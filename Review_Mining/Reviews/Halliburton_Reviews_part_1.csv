rating,review
bad,This company promises alot of thibgs and delivers on none.  I was hoping more from this company and thought most of the reviews were just mad employees. Turns out they were correct. Complete joke of a company and eould not recommend working for them at all .
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked in my life. Pay is horrible. Management has no experience to lead people. The company is always looking to take money away from you when possible, such as holiday pay. Do yourself a favor and just walk away"
bad,"Worked there for 8 months and was miserable the entire time, the manager has his favorites, everyone else is out of the mangers little circle.  At least that’s how it was at the location i was at"
bad,Halliburton is a joke.  They expect their employees to work nonstop for minimal compensation.  The out of state travel is constant and is not family friendly.
bad,Management will lie about everything. Company opinion is that it will run fine with or without you. Constantly micromanaged by untrusting management.  Horrible training program. They enjoy firing people.
bad,"Do not work for Halliburton. It is by far the worst company. The benefits are ok, but the pay is very weak. They promise over time and promotions. The promotion never happen and the overtime is hit or miss. There is absolutely no job security in this company. Halliburton makes it feel like your are just an employee number that is easily replaced, no matter how dedicated you are."
bad,Halliburton is notorious for underpaying and overworking. The entire time I worked there they would let corporate run each yard rather than letting each yard run itself individually. It was ran like a dictatorship and the morale was extremely low at both yards I worked at.
bad,"Over work, unpaid for all the employees. They alone look out for friends and family on the jobs. They alone promoted friends and family  members with better beneifts."
bad,"I'd rather work in H3ll. H3ll would be a much better work environment. Alas, If you enjoy working with a bunch of idiots who still think they're in high school, by all means, sign up."
bad,"Do not waste your time at this company, unless you know someone high up your chance of promotion is none and perhaps on the chopping block everytime when layoffs come around. There’s always a bad apple on all departments that wants to set you up or get you fired. Jealousy is very popular and if you are smart, good, responsible and fast you are a treat and treated like it. There are some really good people too that will have your back and will help you, just not sure how to identify them."
bad,"Very low pay"
bad,Sacan la gente sin decir por que o que el trabajo no es muy buen remunerado y casi no dejan trabajar horas extras
bad,"poor management "
bad,"They do discrimination for layoff and promote you.  !!!!"
bad,Halliburton is a really good company to work for if you plan on having a long term career. Management is good and the people are fair. I enjoyed my experience
bad,"I had a great time working there with guys on different crews we had fun and worked hard at the same time. management is just so bad and cruel. I worked hard really hard through harsh weather, crazy winter and summer to make things happen but management was just bad very bad..."
bad,"First. Let us start with NEO (new employee orientation), NEVER in my life have I heard so many ways to get fired by so many people, just plain unbelievable ( should have left then ) but decided to stay."
bad,"They said safety is first priority, that's a lie. There are no raises, you work long hours and no team work. Manages and supervises are not involved. There is no communication and the warehouse is unproductive, no teamwork and the turnover is outrageous."
bad,USA Halliburton discriminated the employees I have horrible experience treating people like sleeves working long hours no get pay when I was working from home call outs working for free 24/7 on call working  crazy schedule i no recommend this place to work
bad,"A toxic culture filled with company men who care not for your life or well being, but only for output. It is a very unstable company where they will bring in new people as fast as they can whilst pushing experienced employees away with no advancement options (unless you spend time underneath the boss’s desk). Halliburton operates a poor business model and you always wonder which project or department they will shut down next due to quarterly profits not being what they expected. Halliburton is the joke of the oil field. Our customers have come to expect incompetence and we succeed in giving it to them with faulty equipment and uneducated employees. Do not apply here if you value your family or your time."
bad,"Overall terrible place to work. My position was Material Handler. Favouritism, lack of leadership and strategy, useless meetings, terrible pay, terrible hours, terrible culture and i even heard of racial slurs being thrown around with no punishment. They treat you like a number. The turnover is ridiculous."
bad,"not happy with them, treat you like a number not a person"
bad,"If you have nothing better to do it would probbably be great, but if you value sleep, regularity and quality time with family, I would strongly discourage seeking employment with Halliburton."
bad,Management hopless certain TP’s pick who they want as they have favorites rate of pay utter rubbish have mongs running jobs offshore and bullshitters back stabbing poor training list goes on
bad,"Halliburton is very competitive when it comes to benefits. That is the positive part of the company. Unfortunately, the manager of my department has never had to work a day in his life, privileged, handed the position, and it shows when it came to leading the PSL. They promised the moon and the stars and what we received was 40 hour a week paychecks. Also a manager who was trying way too hard to look good that, despite doing VERY hot work, would hunt us down to not allow 5 minute breaks in between production jobs. Unfortunately, most everyone in my department was laid off. No heads up, none of HIGHER management would even bat an eye when asked if we could be transferred, we BEGGED to work. While everyone in the oil industry is booming, Halliburton is not. Please take that into consideration when applying. They are not hiring right now, but in the future."
bad,treats employees horrible doesn't respect confidentiality at all  and dose things very wrong in a very unprofessional way and doesn't follow there own rules
bad,Had to fight with them to get any overtime I worked. I would get my check and 2 to 7 hours of overtime was missing. I have quit and still attempting to get the money owed to me. They treat you like dirt if you are injured or you confront them about pay you did not receive.
bad,"I was a contractor for them.  Which is another word for expendable.  I was working with an Halliburton employee so when something bad happened, I got the blame and the axe while the employee got transferred.  Welcome to Halliburton. They don't pay anything either."
bad,if  you don't know someone you're not moving up. one of the lowest paying companies in the industry. it is tough to advance wit⚽️h in if you're not connected
bad,una muy buena empresa para explotar todas tus habilidades y competencias personales adquiridas durante tu desarrollo educativo y profesional
bad,This Place is Horrible I would not recommend that anyone work here under any circumstances explore every option possible before applying to this place.
bad,Pays well but life is hard when you are away from family. its hard not to go crazy when you are working with people who all think that they are badasses simply because they hold a big wrench and get dirty.
bad,"Very little work "
bad,"Has no work/life balance. Management is not open to employees and not willing to communicate. It is the worst company I know. Pay was not good. Not willing to provide training. Not ethnical, culture was not good."
bad,I worked here for 4 yrs and when I started I was told you would get a raise once a year and I did not receive a pay raise in the four years I work the was told you could advance and that was a lie as well work to many hours for to little pay this job is on good for getting the training and experience you need then good to someone with better pay and better culture all around
bad,"Low pay, Promises never kept. Hours are very sporadic.Very unorganized. Leadership does not seem to care about employees."
bad,This was a bad place to work for i did not have a day off in over 5-1/2 months and they didnt care they paid very poor and did not help with any advancements.
bad,"The crew I was with was excellent, we had each other's back when it came to management. It seemed like that management never backed their employees. Always played favorites."
bad,"Employees are nothing but tools. I've seen people sent offer letters for a position, accept the position and then Haliburton tells them never mind. Everyone is afraid to speak their mind."
bad,"Was a good place to work till. Muslims took it over."
bad,"Добавить зарплату в Halliburtine рабочему персоналу,но не логистом кладовщики менеджерам !!"
bad,"Never worked at a place so bad. Working hours are absurd, 100+ hours, which as a salary employee gets closer and closer to minimum wage. Work environment is dangerous, because of the job at hand. Extreme lack of training especially with health dangers of silica dust caused by the loading and unload of sand for fracing. Unless ex-convict looking for quick money stay away at all possible."
bad,I would never recommend working here to anyone. The experience i had at Halliburton was terrible. They are very unorganized. When I first started they messed up my check and didn't correct it until my third month there. They have terrible rules and regulations that aren't in handbook and treat employees like slaves.
bad,Very stressful work life - when times were good with Oil and Gas Industry work life balance was good. During times that were slow it was very cut throat.
bad,They work you without pay and take advantage of the hard work you put into your job.  Trying to follow policy is overlooked and you will be reprimanded for trying to do this.
bad,"The pay sucks, even worse management, never home. Good benifits, but ridiculously under paid. No home time, 100+ hours a week on the regular. The only way to make descent money is to work ridiculous hours."
bad,"Terrible training, management don't know what they are doing, little job security and work/life balance is awful. "
bad,"13 hour work day minimum, usually around 15 hours.  24 / 48 / 72 hour shifts not uncommon.  You are a number, working in unfit conditions with ever changing pay for management that spends ever moment trying to stab you in the back. No business ethics. No room for advancement. No consistent work schedule. Either your worked into the ground or left to rot at home.  Field hands not invited to company events. Terrible HR. Bloated management structure. Company self insured health insurance does not cover autism regardless of state laws."
bad,"This job has been posted for quite a bit of time. And considering the depressed employment market for oil, you would think this job would have been filled easily. "
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. They don't care even slightly about their people. The turn over rate is insane, but they don't care, they'll just hire another wave of oblivious morons."
bad,I worked there from 1980-1983 as an offshore cementer. Halliburton had the worse management I've ever seen. I was caught up in the lay offs in 1983 after they lied to us and said there would be no lay offs.
bad,"Not a great place to work. Employees have to supply there own office supplies. Job Security highly suspect/questionable, and they do not always fulfill employee contracts."
bad,"I was the only female frac hand in the field. they were unfair with the promotions and what a woman could and could not do. I was passed up on promotions not because of my performance but because of my gender. "
bad,Do not work for this company. The management is very poor and throw people who have not been trained properly under the bus for their mess ups. I hope they go bankrupt soon!
bad,Long school to attend. Work extremely long hours throughout the entire job.  The company has great benefits.  CO workers are also a plus
bad,"Halliburton is  well organized company, & they take care of each employee very effectively."
bad,"Halliburton Company is an American multinational corporation, and one of the world's largest oil field services companies with operations in more than 80 countries. It owns hundreds of subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, brands, and divisions worldwide and employs approximately 100,000 people."
bad,"great place to make money, but will take up 3/4 of your life, if your in the field your on call, if your in the plant your on shift work"
bad,everyone should try this place for work once buss. pick up.the magt team is great to be around. everyone treats you equal. all the employess came to work on time to get there job done quick.
bad,"Lousy, Lousy, Lousy...horrible people. The Rockies management in the Directional Services is a joke. All the coordinators are people who couldn't make it in the field so they went into the office not knowing anything."
bad,"Considero que la empresa tiene un buen departamento de Recursos Humanos, existe comunicacion entre las diversas areas del departamento y el apoyo es mutuo."
bad,"en esta empresa ahi futuro, pero para los tecnicos es a largo plazo, y yo con familia no puedo esperar pues los hijos piden y sinceramente no me alcanza.es por eso mi evaluacion."
bad,Tell you one thing and do another and tell you on short notice. Cut overtime. Way behind on Technology which is not good in the modern day oilfield
bad,"Generally Halliburton will use it's employees up and throw them away when they feel they are no longer useful. The employees there on the average are afraid to report any injuries for fear of getting fired. Will doing a post trip inspection on a truck I had just droven into the yard, another yard hand accidentally closed the hood of the semi o my head which rang my bell but due to the general fear of reporting injuries I kept my mouth shut. Well the injury has created a degenerative disk arthritic condition in my upper back which will probably eventually disable me but because I was so afraid to report the injury now I have a condition that will effect me the rest of my life."
bad,"Audit, Benefits administration, international acctg. Great company.  Respects their employees."
bad,"They cut our 40 hours for our week off, they took away catering services for the workers in the field, and then they kicked us out of our hotels and told us we needed to find our own place to live. With 13 dollars an hour you cant afford to pay rent in an oil town like hobbs nm, especially when you don't live there!"
bad,"Long hours, no time after work, people are good, management can improve, pay is ok."
bad,"dirty"
bad,"A very un-american company. No bid contracts, cheated our US soldiers out of good food, healthy water and armor all for the allmight dollar. I personally know of someone they let go after they needed one more week to vest. They claimed there was too many barrels of oil lost.Dont know what they told to the insurance company. Anyway Let go after 2 years of 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off living in a metal shipping container.Only I week to vest and was fired and didnt even get the other two years prorated money set aside that was earned by two years as an employee that should of been vested..well if it had been any other oil company. All you young men. Dont waste your time with Haliburton if they will screw an American soilder for the almight dollar dont think it will happen to you. Just look around these smaller companies they are much better and care more. Haliburton has gotten too big to care about any little guy. Start with a smaller company and build it from the ground up. You have better chance at being heard , your input will matter. Just not at Haliburton. Dont believe me just check out the several documentaries on this company. Its bad"
bad,Halliburton is just too darn rich they know that you are a number and they throw their good employees away like trash. They are also too lazy to conduct an investigation.
bad,Management spends more time using workers as scape goats for their mistakes and figuring out how not to pay employees
bad,It's not a bad place to work. I worked there for quite a while.  The oil and gas business is very cyclical so there will be periodic layoffs when activity declines.
bad,"The work environment at the campus is very crowded.  There's no seating for the 100+ new employees they hire and its very uncomfortable the way management treats the employees at this company.  Roaches, small and large, have taken over all the buildings."
bad,Management is poor and November to March they are looking for any reason to get rid of you. If you put hr complaint in be prepared you will have one against you in a week and will be fired. Not worth it. Management in some areas good but on mechanic side it's horrible managers only care about themselves and an dont want to help anyone out.
bad,There was no opportunity for advancement and training to grow or advance. There was constant requests for international travel which was not in job description to hostile areas without any form of compensation.
bad,"Place down right sucks,"
bad,"Old boys crowd. Ladies - Beware! "
bad,"Horrible work/life balance, culture is employees are disposable whereas the employees are pushed to rate positively the work culture at Halliburton. Reality differs from perception."
bad,Management has no clear path forward. Houston politics gets in the way of being productive in order to better compete in the market. Job satisfaction is low with no chance for advancement.
bad,If you are an engineer stay away from oil service companies as they will destroy your career as an engineer. The money is not worth your time. Please take this advise as you will regret working for these type of companies. You can eventually  make the same or more money working for an actual engineering company.
bad,"From the very beginning management did little to help you excel at your position. It was expected that this job became your life and you were required to work many of your days off. They treated you as a number and threatened they you were always replaceable. The compensation when times were good was mediocre, and when cuts had to be made it was always the field employees that took the most drastic of a hit. The salary is a joke and you only really make your money in overtime when they don't try to stack the scheduling against you."
bad,"typical day at work: maintain equipment, check inventory, communicate with customers, and communicate with land base."
bad,"After being interviewed for a position for a set amount of pay, the pay was way less than agreed upon once work actually began.  Agreed to 75k a year and they put my salary at 2900 a month.  Was promised 14 on and 14 off schedule.  But received an 11 on 3 off schedule.  Which was later moved to 14 on 7 off. "
bad,long hours no pay and away from home ..... treated poorly not a company to work for
bad,"As an Operator Assistant I Equipment Services, prepare for the ride of your life you basically have to choose career or your family, working on an average of 100+ hrs per week doesn't leave you much time for family, perfect if your single though.  Management is Horrible its a matter of who you know not what you know if your thinking of moving up in the company and coworkers will throw you under the bus the first chance they get if it means they secure a higher position, they pay is not worth the burden it puts on you and your family"
bad,"Founded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world’s largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. With more than 70,000 employees in approximately 80 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir – from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field."
bad,I have a long list of complaints. I would never recommend anyone to apply with Halliburton. They will tell you anything to hire you; even flat out lie.
bad,Was there 15 years and just like that the entire camp was shut down after all employees did everything they could to help the company Succeed. It wasn’t good enough. Most people there had over 10 years some with over 40 years.
bad,"run, dont take the job. there's literally no job security. you dont have any work life balance. work 12 hour shifts no vertime 15/6 schedule. they don't care about you  i promise"
bad,"Worst job ever, and don’t recommend. This place won’t treat their employees fair. The pay is junk, and don’t waste your time. You will do better working somewhere else."
bad,Management is corrupt and nothing truly gets handled as it should problems between coworkers the company lacks unprejudiced professionlism. And the raises and bonuses the promise you you never recieve.
bad,As I stated before this is a bad company to work for.  They pretty much expect you to work all of the time.  You might go along with this for awhile and think that your hard work will get noticed and you'll get a raise but that's not true.  They'll increase what they charge the customer and give you a pay cut.
bad,"A toxic culture filled with company men who promote employees for personal reasons. Very unstable company where they will bring in new people as fast as they can whilst pushing experienced employees away with no advancement options. Very political culture. Antiquated, yet thety preach innovation. Halliburton operates a poor business model and you always wonder which project or department will be shut down next due to quarterly profits not being what they expected."
bad,"the location I worked at had very poor leadership, they didn't care about much there besides getting to work. the hours are very long an they do not care about home life. 80 hrs in one week is crazy."
bad,These so called supervisors do anything but their job. Never bring parts on time and constantly not answering their phones.  Just all around poor communication . Also just cut down on everyone’s overtime hours by changing the day we come into work. It’s a significant pay cut and the company is just reaping the benefits into the new year. Highly recommend somewhere else for your employment
bad,"this place shows too much favoritism and corruption.  There is absolutely nothing good I have to say about this company.  While I "
bad,"How is it legal for some employees to be paid for more hours than others, yet they are on the same bus, going to the same place and coming home on the same bus?  It is apparently common knowledge and supervisors dictate how many ""extra"" hours can be claimed by some. Then, just when you think you have found a job that you can stay with for years, your position is eliminated and you get laid off.  Perhaps it would be easier to take if Halliburton assisted the affected employees locate other employment within the company but H/R is no help."
bad,Work locations are always changing. Work around a 100 hrs a week. Management is not always around to help employees. advancement is low. To work there for a long period of time you be able to work away from home. Great place to start at in the oilfield. Enough knowledge to keep anyone busy.
bad,horrible company they make you work long hours and do not care how much sleep you get the night before. Management hires college friends and they are corrupt
bad,"Would not recommend working for Halliburton. The management team does not coordinate with employees, do not care about employees family responsibilities."
bad,I was overseeing solids control division between the solids control companys Halliburton and MI-Swaco and the neighboring drilling rig company Nabors with great sucess
bad,not so good we all have families and the just gave us our walking papers with a cold face.They should have at least told us this could be coming.
bad,Uma empresa que investe em treinamento que é um diferencial.
bad,"good benefits, pay, health, stock purchase, 401k contribution"
bad,Just another oil and gas company that makes millions by underpaying its employees.
bad,dont really like the pay this particular job is hard to advance in .
bad,"It was a daily battle for communication between PLS's. Rules, regulations, and procedures were changed on a weekly basis. The pay was at least five dollars an hour lower than their competiton. Halliburton was by far the worst employer I have ever worked for."
bad,Tried applying for many of their entry level positions for the past two years. Many of these positions asking for mechanical experience. 20 years in the military 14 of them as a heavy equipment mechanic. Not sure how much more experience a person needs? Not sure what their qualifing as entry level within their company?
bad,Days off policy is a shambles ... ie it doesnt exist !  They're willing to look you in the eye and blatantly lie to you.  All Halliburton management are brainwashed and lied to by the liars above them on the ladder... you could call it bullying / scaremongering
bad,Company lacks the vision to keep steady hours and competitive pay to retain qualified employees. Huge rollover of employees and stressful work environment with no pay increases earned for hard work.
bad,"Not a good place to work "
bad,Management is purposefully murky about rules and regulations to remove or keep who they want. They assume intentions and your competency instead of communicating. Raises and promotions are based on manager preferences which are never stated. You find out months in that days off are optional at no notice and all that matters is managers bonuses for fulfilling contracts.
bad,Haliburton has so much potential but it wasted by poor management which in return is the root cause of all its major problem. You work a good amount of hours and it can be excessive at times (60-80 hour work weeks ) to sometime almost  making your 40. A other issues that is apparent in each department is the lack of accountability their always an issue that will never get solved and will continue to happen .
bad,I got on with them thinking that since its a giant company the management was excellent.  Nope they ask you to come in at whatever time and they told us we were working 50 plus hours ive only work next 3 months ive been with them its 40 . Not to mention when we have a safety meeting they literally say if you dont  like 40 hours then look for something else  i feel they dont care about anybody they lie to whatever you want hear to hire you then thell laid it to you not to mention on you lunch our manager like to have a safety moment
bad,"It started out real well, roughly the first 2 years.  They put the wrong people in management.  There are no career opportunities for me (statement from management) so here I am."
bad,"Bons beneficios mas a politicagem e o ego infelizmente imperam."
bad,"Stressful job with pure management, upper managers detached from work, lower managers not skillful and not helpful, they follow policy SYA, not to improve or make job more productive"
bad,**Beware** if you ever get injured your employment may be terminated under false pretences. Vacation days chosen for you by management. Work under constant reminder that your employment is a privilege and it may be terminated at any moment.
bad,Poor company no management or training as promised. They just use you to perform all the grunt work. I would recommend it. I did not learn a thing because they do not teach a thing.
bad,"Horrible working conditions."
bad,"Halliburton is the best Oil Field College in the industry.  Get your degree and get out."
bad,"Having worked with Halliburton on several continents, I have finally concluded that the benefits it offers do not cover the psychological damages its workplace inflicts."
bad,"If you don't mind being a little cog in a big machine then this might be the place for you. Make sure you have everything in writing, it's your only chance of them following through but even then it's no guarantee."
bad,Dont work here unless it is short term. Managers are stupid dont know anything. The buddy system is in use in every department .
bad,Very difficult to move around or advance in career. Managers constantly block their own employees from transferring within the company to other departments.
bad,"Management pretty well does what they want. HR only applies to the  bottom part of the organization, the upper management (District Manager on up) can make up the rules as they go. If you can wear a skirt you pretty much have it made. Management seems to care more about their personal goals than the Team."
bad,night Supervisor in charge of the maintenance department have driven their vehicles to work with no oil burning up their engine. Also there is a huge drug problem at Halliburton. One night supervisor was caught with illegal Paraphernalia in his drawer and claimed someone put it there in his own drawer to get him fired and management believed it even there is a zero tolerance policy regarding drugs in the work place. There were drugs found on an employee and the employee not in a management position was terminated. There's no senior leadership in the shop for mechanics over ten years at Halliburton. The rules absolutely do not apply to everyone only certain people. Their shop workforce also in not very diverse neither is the office.
bad,"The job did not suit my prior qualifications whatsoever."
bad,Halliburton is a good company to work for but I'm not looking for a job I'm looking for a career. I truly love the guys I work with. if it weren't for them I don't think I would have made it this far. I've learned a lot as far as the oil field goes. The hardest part of the job is a lack of communication. The best part is making it back home to my family safely.
bad,Stuffy work environment.  Management had absolutely no ethics  or integrity.
bad,Halliburton is great if all you're concerned with is money. They have no regard for their employees as people and the district manager continually reminds you of that fact during the entire term of your employment. Halliburton is not a good company if you want a life and family.
bad,"You will make a good bit of money, but you may see your family for 5 days a month."
bad,Finding employment right out of college is very difficult for a lot of people especially if you have no experience in the discipline for which you have your degree. Halliburton is very good at hiring people out of college and generally an excellent place to get that initial experience. I would look at different areas of Halliburton for that experience.
bad,"If you currently work for McDonalds and your looking to work for Halliburton, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, stay clear. This is the most unorganized company I've worked for. There's a high turnover rate so that means you have to do alot of babysitting. I'd look into the competition before looking into Halliburton. Just a heads up."
bad,Used to be a great company but not anymore. Too many upper level managers walking around enforcing unnecessary issues while bigger problems go unchecked. HR lady is less than useless. All they care about is the shareholders so layoffs seem to be a weekly occurrence.
bad,"Management is a joke and there is no leadership, advancement is done on favoritism and who you Know. Pay raises come to the YES men , can not be honest or have your own opinion. Would be a wonderful company if they could fix management."
bad,"Compliance and Ethics are not followed by some managers and supervisors, and even when made aware of the situation, the unfairness and unethical culture seems to take precedence over honesty and hard work. Upper management ignores the complaints and as results, people who voice out are let go."
bad,"If you want to work in an environment where Directors are only middlemen (managers not leaders) who throw you under the bus every chance they get, then this is the place for you! "
bad,"Working for Halliburton Frac Division has its Pros and Cons. "
bad,"Pay is good, work very disorganised"
bad,Very Bias culture at that particular Duncan office. Favorite personal privilages was quite obvious. it was a total nightmare. No people skills among the authority figures. Went Pioneer Natural Resources totally different culture.not a service company. don't feel like your on egg shells at work real laid back enviroment.
bad,The culture is not good. It is very political and rewards are not based on ability. it is an atmosphere of blame and not good to take chances or try something new.
bad,"Heavy truck driver manager was the most unqualified person for the job, not only no people skills, he was ex prison guard and treated drivers like inmates. It is a good company just heavy driving(sand hauler) division was awful!!!"
bad,"A empresa e de nome um  jigante nas empresas prestadoras de servico no campo petrolifero"
bad,This used to be a decent company to work for. After poor market conditions and poor management this is no longer the case. After 32 years of dedicated service I was recently laid off due to poor market condtions.
bad,A typical day at Halliburton includes a lot of different kind of sample testing. We test samples of cement as we well as water analysis. I've learned a lot about working in a lab. Management is horrible. They don't do their jobs right and talk to their employees in a way that is inappropriate. I enjoy working with the engineers as well as other employees.
bad,Spend some time down there and you will understand what I mean. At least 20 years behind the US and Canada.They will cut costs even if it means safety
bad,"Miss managed they are not active in the work you do then try to evaluate your work performance. its a joke!"
bad,"If you're looking for a long term, stable career, don't work here.  The Management team needs to be replaced.  Favoritism, ageism and Politics abound."
bad,"Great paying job but you work really long hours and don't get much sleep and you pretty much don't have a social life any more and if you have a family  plan on missing out on a lot of things and it might destroy your relationship , I know of many people that I have met that were either going through a divorce or was already divorced because of the job.I would say it's kinda like being in the military."
bad,"Aprendi muito a trabalhar em equipe, conhecer muito bem a área de contas à pagar e contas à receber."
bad,"NO appreciation for life outside of Halliburton. I worked in the tool shop in Alvarado, TX. This shop is environmentally open to the elements and the management has no regard for safety within the shop. The are LARGE deposits of pigeon waste within the shop and the workers are forced to inhale this matter while working. Repeated attempts to get the matter resolved were rebuffed. LOW pay and forced overtime EVERY day is detrimental to mental health. Shop management consisted a very young shop foreman who had no experience in employee relations. You are just a robot for production....nothing more."
bad,"Love the people i work with, including immediate manager team. Hate the corporate structure. I just got demoted two pay grades. I'm now back to the same position i was at in 2009 despite being one of two leads for the new rss and constantly supporting other districts with the new rss. I could write more, but its simple. Halliburton only cares about their stock price and not about their employees or the sacrifices they make."
bad,You show up work hard just to be put aside when you get a minor injury they say they'll take care of you if hurt in the job but they actually treat you with the most disrespect any place I've ever worked
bad,"sucks wouldn't recommend it Technician (Former Employee) –  "
bad,work was busy and consistent. Most had no team work abilities and out of 2 managers only one knew what he was doing. So everything always went wrong. And unless your bff with someone who had been there a while your pretty much stuck or they make you leave. They purposely make you feel like an outsider unless your from that area.
bad,"I took this job right out of college because it was going to pay me more than anything else that I applied for and I had a lot of student debt. The last 3 years have been the most stressful of my entire life. Part of that has to do with the downturn of the oil industry, but a lot of it has to do with how Halliburton cares more about the bottom line that the quality of life for their employees. I am salaried, and work an average of 70 hours per week, we get a small day bonus, but we don't get overtime pay. I move around from crew to crew so I don't have a very good opportunity to build relationships with my coworkers, so I am almost always alone. Overall, great way to pay off student loans quickly if you are smart about your money, but it is a life suck."
bad,"Hope I never have to work for them again. They promised us a certain pay rate, when we showed up for orientation, we founf the pay rate was $4 less than we were told."
bad,DAY STARTS WITH A SAFETY MEETING THAT TURNS INTO A GAB SESSION.DRESS OUT and get to work unloading trains mixing mud loading trucks unloading trucks keeping up with inventory keeping all row s strait loading empty drums in trailer broken used pallets on truck.
bad,"Rewards are plenty if you are willing to just tell management what they want to hear.......they hate the truth so just keep quite on that. If your wrongly singled out then God help you.........The PC police are ever present so just hope and try to not hurt someone’s precious feelings.....(or be careful if you are easily hurt yourself).....And don’t ever let them paint the target on you because there isn’t anything that you can do to get it removed..(aside from leaving or being asked to leave). Another thing to keep in mind is that most all jobs in the oilfield are good for 10 years at best. When you get to that milestone you will be targeted for replacement as that’s about the point of diminishing returns for them. You will then be making more than your worth and beings how there is zero allegiance to anything but the numbers, your time is up."
bad,"Good benefits, other than that the management makes working as a sand driver awful. I can’t express enough how bad management is at Triadelphia. Everything I was told in my interview was a lie. Home life is awful, not a job for a family man. If you have any other options I’d strongly suggest passing on Halliburton. I’m a current employee and am looking for a job because of poor management. Seriously, monkeys could manage the sand haulers better."
bad,"You will go far if you know someone.  benefits are above average, opportunities are there if you know who and how to ask.  Pay is above average.  long hours and mandatory overtime but that is typical of oilfield"
bad,"If you love working 100 plus hours a week. Never getting time to enjoy life, friends and family. Then this is the job for you. Advancement is few and far between unless you ""know"" someone. The management is ridiculously incompentent they have no clue how to manage employees or even have a clue about the products and services there field hands preform."
bad,early starts and long days not a whole of family time. alot of rules and paperwork. starting wages not worth it a lot of people unhappy.
bad,"Started working for Halliburton in 2005.   Only planned on working there for a year or so but found that I really loved the work and the people.   Job was interesting from day 1 and it was real easy to stay.   After 13 years, I was asked to become a lead technician and that is where it went down hill for me.   I was not allowed to go back to being a field technician so was stuck as a lead.   I was able to move my entire family to Australia to live and work for Halliburton AU.  Lovely time there but they had promised me they would pay for my permanent residency which is available after 2 years on the visa.  When the time came to renew they reneged causing me to either have to spend the $10K to do the PR or go back to the states.   My wife and myself decided to go back instead of paying the money.   That was a common thing with this company, making promises and then not following through with them.   The oilfield is very feast or famine so every few years you will be wondering about having a job or not."

bad,"the culture between field hands is amazing more like a brotherhood "
bad,Company lay offs were omnipresent and made the work environment very stressful.  Worked in a department where the cliques were reminiscent of high school.  Would prefer a more healthy and uplifting work environment.
bad,mostly I had financial issue so I feel relax because I get control at my existing issues after joining and getting a good package by this company.....
bad,"Worked on pumps for about 8 yrs. Every year my annual salary went down as management kept taking from the employees. If considering becoming a Pump Tech for Grand Junction Halliburton, think again. The shop foreman spends almost all his time stabbing you in the back and purposely setting you up for failure because this is his way to reflect well on management. Your ideas and hard work will be ignored and will have little time to defend yourself because you'll be too busy doing most of the work while your boss is making excuses for not helping. No joke... This is how it goes!"
bad,bad place to work. the people i worked were very difficult.it has been the most difficult place to work. the company don't have human management and it is very difficult
bad,The managers are very shady and afraid to man up.  It’s hard working in a department the the company didn’t want.  I felt un appreciated and never praised
bad,"The actual job was okay, but the top heavy, self-serving 'Service Co-coordinators, and supervisor's make the job a nightmare.  Management always need reports, safety observations and safety step-backs, so they can meet KPI's. So even were no Safety issue is present, operators are required to submit Observations reports constantly to hit survey numbers, and prior to any meeting, all in attendance must make up a 5x5 step back'' reports.    Safety is a joke and antiquated, with ""Perfect Days"" drummed into every operator, even though, the Safety Officers never leave the office."
bad,It’s a ok place to work you’ll learn a lot. There’s way to many chiefs that wanna run the show. They think employees are robots that never get tired.stay away
bad,This Position no longer exists and company was closed during the down turn in 2015. Good luck for anyone that chooses this field and life style. Only reviewed to apply for other jobs.
bad,"I have a very nice day at work because everyday have been learning a lot of good things that i did not know before i has been a very good experience indeed. The management has been evaluating my job monthly sending me an report on how i have been performing my duites, and i have a good working relationship with others co-workers. "
bad,This company does not care about it's employees one bit and will throw anyone under the bus at a moments notice. Do not work for this company
bad,"they will take everything they can legally take from their employees and then take more, absolutely no loyalty to their employees, if you are jaded enough to believe you are anything more then a number and a means to their end while under their employment you are sorely mistaken"
bad,It was hard after a crew member have been on a crew for awhile to get replace with someone else. Working at Halliburton was very challenging.
bad,Possibly the worse job ever.  The company does not care about there employees at all.  The only good thing was the benefits.  They pay there employees terrible wages for the individual jobs they perform.
bad,I was hired to join a new team at Halliburton. I made a tough choice to leave a  company of 13 yrs to join Halliburton and this promising career just so 2 months later to be laid off!!!!!!!!!!! These big companies play around with peoples' lives to make a  buck. I get that its all about making money. But 2 months?!
bad,"Customer satisfaction,"
bad,Do not work for Halliburton nothing good over worked and they don't care about u just make the money that's all they care about
bad,I learned everyday how manage your team work and to plane your Job with Co-workers and Job side. And the most enjoyable part of the Job is Hoc Card every day to maintain our Job Safe.
bad,compañia bien fortalizida aprendes mucho en esta compañya te fortaleses mucho y es bonito aprender la parte dificil de trabajar en esta empresa es que trabajas bajo precion
bad,"I have been working as a sr accountant since last 10years in oman,uae,saudi arabia,Egypt and i have a wast experience of accounting. I would like to utilize my skill with  esteem organization to grow the company also to improve my self"
bad,Productive.  They allowed me to learn and take any education I wanted to better myself.  Also allowed me to work independently or with other engineers.
bad,A larger company with a great work culture. Was always kept busy and learned something new every day. The work was physically demanding at times but overall very rewarding.
bad,"Halliburton is a terrible place to work. The worst management I've ever worked for and I've been through 3 managers working on the 4th. They are only involved with their employees long enough to point fingers and sit back in their office. "
bad,"Low quality of life, very seldom would you find a manager that was family oriented.  There were great training classes that I was given while I was there."
bad,"Management sucks, often they exploit workers, force you to cheat on  DOT logs, many other things, just get in learn and go to other companies that will pay more and work you less and will balance home time."
bad,"Halliburton's only concern is profit for the company and close friends.  If you are not very close friends with a high level manager, then you are screwed.  Breaking the law to accomplish this is common practice."
bad,Compensate employees to create drive for improvement. Management needs to support hard working employees and acknowledge all operations going on per custemer.
bad,"Your just a number at Halliburton,  very poor on the job training, trainer and employee's did not want to properly train you for fear of their OT to be cut"
bad,"At TSS you will feel undervalued and in a poorly motivated division of Halliburton. If you live local to the yard expect to lose out on days offshore as it is cheaper to to take you back from a trip or not to send you at all so they don’t have to fork out on hotels for the lads who live further away. So not only do you lose out on days but you lose money due to the fact they don’t cover travel into the yard unlike other divisions. There is no training other than the mandatory ilearns. So don’t expect any courses or progression within the division. This is all due to poor management and cut backs. "
bad,"Worked under Sperry Drilling Technology team as an Mechanical ATP (associate engineer). The department was promising at first, but managers got caught in climbing the career ladder which resulted in the suffering of the people doing the work."
bad,"Poor management.  Benefits are consistently poor and raises are non existent.  People are nice, upper management needs to be overhauled.  Very out for themselves management and don't care about the employees."
bad,Job was pretty easy just a lot of time away from my family.  A lot of travel time and never home for the holidays.  Pay rate was one of the lowest in the area but you made a good living due to the fact that the average work week was about 85 hours or more
bad,Erratic work schedule. Never knew when i was leaving or coming back. The actual job was easy just not knowing when i was leaving made it very hard
bad,i worked with them on the Oooguruk island and the management was the worst.  they dont care to train their people up because everyone thinks you are trying to take their job
bad,Long hours and the pay does not match the responsibility or the hours you work. The training is amazing for the company however and hopefully once the industry picks up again the company will compensate the engineers correctly
bad,"I try to work and teach all my fellow enployees,evrything i new,we did alot off yard work,more than any other, yards around.maybe cu.i am latino"
bad,"It is really sad and unfortunate that I was laid-off because I did enjoy my time there and my travels abroad, but it is time to move on to bigger and better things!"
bad,"This is a Saudi Aramco sub contractor company. The experience in Contracting and Trading Division was very effective, which gives confidence to work in any place and handle any job."
bad,"Bad management is leading this company to a hard fall. Wrong corrective actions in place, mostly with pay reduction of the most experienced people. Will not last long in such a competitive market."
bad,"It a was an okay job for someone who just graduated and is in need of money. However, if you are not part of a specific group within the people who are already working there it can be difficult to blend in as an outsider."
bad,"If  you want low pay and terrible management - choose big red. The Odessa yard is a mess, management is terrible through my experience. They have no idea what’s going on or where things are"
bad,"Again, Halliburton trains the oilfield literally. It is a great place to start one's career, but hardly where you want to end it. Racism is prevalent."
bad,"Don’t believe the hype. Going to school, being good at your job, and earning advancement opportunities just isn’t a reality. This is all about the “ good ole boys system “. I just got a phone call, in which I had to schedule a time for a phone interview in another city. The call was actually them telling me they were hiring someone else for the position. That could have been done without a phone call. Why even schedule interviews with candidates that you don’t intend to speak with? It’s because the culture in this company is a farce. They pretend to care about you. They pretend to encourage “ taking control of your career “. The reality is, whatever job you take, management with do everything in their power to stop/slow your progress. Better make buddies with your leadership or else you won’t progress. Hard work, skills, and advanced training have nothing to do with anything. It just shows how lonely these people are. They just want to force you to be their friend, so they don’t feel lonely away from their families. The entire company is just a day care for confused adults."
bad,"field engineers aren't very respected, don't get raises in line with performance, and have to essentially wait in line for promotions, which lead to high turnover"
bad,"I have nothing good to say about the management, they only to care of the people that are there friends. Drug testing is only taken by the people that can pass"
bad,Management needs to include all employees in employment training and career advancement not just a select few they want in positions. They need to treat all employees equal.
bad,The old Halliburton no longer exist. They dont care about the workers in the field or shop. They will place unqualified people in management if you brown nose the right people
bad,"There is no organization in their management, they make seat of the pants decisions without considering consequences or the affect of peoples home life or finances."
bad,It pays the bills but dont count on any support from management when it comes to advancement and normal advice on equipment or even parts support to fix said equipment .
bad,most of the employees were not willing to share there knowledge to help you succeed. The management was non existent you nver sw them unless something went wrong. ad when you did do a good job it went unnoticed.
bad,The company has a poor attitude toward there employees and the can never keep to a work schedule we stat at 7 am and get out around 3or 4 am the next day
bad,"The work I did was challenging, using deep physics and latest software engineering technologies. But the first line manager was very arrogant. I suggested a 360-degree review process for all employees will be helpful."
bad,I've worked for Halliburton for about six years as a job they aren't to bad your gone quite a bit but to be awnest  they don't pay very good and they say you can advance good luck with that i wouldn't recommend any one to this company.
bad,"Not a family oriented business for all. Some HR personnel make incompetent decision. Ok place to work, but there it's not a secure job to build a future from or maintain your living standards."
bad,"Not too much fun at work with the typical work pressure and more  work hours. Working hours flexibility is also less."
bad,You cannot expect a good family life. You are always on call and even when your on vacation their calling you to complete something.
bad,When you are a supervisor it becomes a real high stakes game.the hardest part about this job is being to hot or to cold. This job isn't for any one> you have to be thick skinned to work in a environment like frac or probably an oil field job
bad,"I would not like to work in an place like this again."
bad,"Halliburton is a terrible company to work for, management has no idea what they are doing. The company as a whole will treat you like garbage, and spit you back out. If you are going to work in the oilfield do not work for them. Worst career choice of my life."
bad,"one of the most cut throat companies I have ever worked for, the management team has no idea how to manage their employees. and they don't believe in promoting from with in the company, they prefer to hire people who have no idea what they doing. But, the benefits are great."
bad,"Very little training, often training opportunities denied. Good ole' boy corporate America. Often felt like I was working in the 80's."
bad,"Good company, but not for a person with family.  This is a company for a young person with no family."
bad,Would not recommend working for this company. Managers unskilled and untrained in management. 100 plus work hours per week. Always on call. Poorly trained employees.
bad,Not a company to work for. They only care about their bottom line not the employees.
bad,"Working at least 12 hours per day."
bad,benefits where good pay raise was not
bad,I learned that it was never about worh ethic. It was about your connections at halliburton. I laid off so they could keep the plant manager's step-daughter.Politics!!

bad,"i cant able to tell much it but you will come to know once you start working and coming through the scenarios in a day to day life."
bad,"The other geologists either quit or got laid-off. There were no senior geologists, so there was a lack of training. I received less paid and bonus even though I was interpreting more log data than those in Houston without help. There were problems in getting a promotion for those who were not in Houston. It was very stressful work hours. I was given only 7 days of vacation. If you want more vacation, you paid for it and had get it approved. If your tool was not reading correctly or had issues, then the sale guys had no issues throwing you under the bus rather admitting there was an issues with the tool."
bad,"Poor culture would not recommend unless a US citizen, tended to hire and fire according to the oil price regardless of actual performance in the role, Management changed frequently (US expats only)"
bad,"Do not apply if you are a woman working in the field, Office work is probably a better option.  I personally had a horrible experience with a certain crew, they constantly would write me up for just about anything, would even make up things that i had never done or said. It was very obvious they didn't want me around, I ended up getting fired very quickly; within 30 days after working with this certain crew."
bad,Was ok for what it was Management was a joke didn't keep anyone in the loop total bs isn't warn anyone of the cutbacks just showed up and send everyone packing
bad,one of the lowest paying service companies in the world. Training is good if you get a chance to get send. Management care very little about those below them. Very hard to move up even if you work your tail off for them. A since of favoritism is always shown.
bad,"the boss wasn't willing to teach, repeatedly called me dumb in different ways, I did not enjoy the work or atmosphere. other then the safety certifications and training it was not worth my time"
bad,"Halliburton is a major player in oilfield services. They offer a lot of benefits and can take longer of layoff in downturns, but it's still the oilfield. You are committing your life to the job. You will go to location before the sun comes up and leave after it goes down every day. Halliburton is big, so management makes decisions in Houston. A lot of dumb things happen because communication is so poor, and managers don't know whom they're managing. For such a large company, things are done so inefficiently."
bad,my schedule was 2 weeks on and 1 week off.  on you 2 weeks on you could work anywhere in the usa and usually didn't know where till last minute.  also worked over 100 hours a week on average
bad,"Stressful most times, whether it was the hours, lack of sleep, management, or what you were going to be doing that day; it seemed as though you were always stressed about something. Things would change at a moments notice with no reason at all. Bad management didn't stop at your supervisor."
bad,managers are untrained and lack any kind of interpersonal communication. the environment created by such managers creates a hostility amongst fellow coworkers.
bad,"Very poor management. Revolving door of green hats!"
bad,"If you are a single individual who enjoys not having a social/family life then this is a great place for you to work. When the oil and gas industry was booming my typical work week would be anywhere from 75-95 hours per week. I worked 12 days straight and had 2 days off. Now, every department has a different work schedule so I can only speak to my experiences in the completion tools department. I am a relatively mechanical person so I really enjoyed that aspect of the job. Another perk to working with Halliburton is the outstanding benefits package and 401k plans that they offer their employees. Some downsides include: confusion between management ( the right hand often doesn't know what the left hand is doing), overly complicated system in place for promoting employees, positions are based on the oil market (when it's good its really good- when it's bad people get laid-off), and an overall harsh environment if you are not used to working around roughnecks."
bad,It was stressful. Some people worked more than others and were never compensated for the extra work and did not get promoted whereas some folks had an easy ride and got promotions.
bad,"Like getting 50-90% less pay then comparable Field Engineers in your same field?"
bad,"This review is for Halliburton Mexico, Baroid division."
bad,"This job required way to much for the rate of pay that was given. We worked around very harmful chemicals that put our health and the environment at risk. As well as horrible management, we never had anything run smoothly."
bad,"Halliburton was a great start to a new career in the energy sector."
bad,não ha plano de carreira para os técnicos do setor de IEM. Funcionários com mais de 7 anos sem promoção.
bad,"poor work/ personal life balance, lack of job security, and little opportunity to advance fosters negative work culture.  Only employer I have ever worked for that demoted multiple employees without consideration of there performance of job duties, was solely based on companies monetary intrests"
bad,"Company has absolutely incredible potential to become even more successful than they already are, yet they'll never figure out how with the majority of their management being ineffectual with staff. There are so few leaders in this company. Most managers are so consumed with only wanting to report numbers and make sure employees follow processes, that they are blind to see if anyone is happy working for them. It's a fault with some companies today. They can't realize that a company with happy employees, ones that are appreciated and come in with fulfillment are the most productive type of employee. That's why I say they have more potential. There can also be an issue with retaining talent and experience when so many similar companies pay more. Money talks."
bad,"There's a reason why Halliburton has the reputation it has.  Most of the employees that work there didn't really seem to enjoy it.  You tend to feel more like a number, than an employee."
bad,"I did 12 hrs on per day. I have learned new INSITE program."
bad,"Worked in Artesia, NM, management plays favorites , not judged on ability but who you suck up to. long hours but well paid. be careful , many people have been hired and fired after a few months for some made up reason. Management is very young and is less qualified than the mechanics, nothing they write about in the careers section applies.  glad I left !"
bad,"Employed by Halliburton 1+ years, and have not been impressed.  What I have seen is a company made up of young employees who are worked to death.  I have yet to meet a fellow employee who genuinely likes working for Halliburton."
bad,"If you don't have a family and you are single and want to make good money, it is a good place to work.  You just need to make sure you are out in the field and you will get lots of hours.  If you are in the office, You don't have much time with family and friends."
bad,managment not trained manager took gun to work was fired this is what its like to work at the baroid end of things.you will be the only one that works try halliburton but stay away from bariod in co
bad,hardest part of job is long hours and no balanced life style.
bad,"sometimes the work here was worth it, at least thats how I felt, but most of the time it was not. There are very long shifts and no acknowledgement for accomplishments. If you just need a job to hold you over its not bad, but if you are trying to make it a career... good luck"
bad,"Don’t talk to anyone.  Keep your mouth shut and just do your work.  Remember no one is your friend.  Some of the fakest people I have ever met in my life.  Just imagine going back to high school and handle it that way and you should be fine unless you’re laid off. Also, keep in mind you are a nobody.  You are a warm body filling a position and you need to do it well otherwise they will be starting a “file” on you so they can find something to let you go  Don’t work here  it’s not worth it.  Save yourself the stress and drama"
bad,Poor management lack of communition skills. Manage out of fear. Training is based off of fail then you are showed. I trained as a manager for success. Managers sit in trucks.
bad,"The old man that once trained me told me Halliburton is a great place to get experience or retire. Take your pick. He was totally accurate."
bad,"If you could imagine a huge 100 year old steel ship that has been running non stop since new. That would be the best description of Halliburton. Though the boat still floats it is riddled with rust holes and corrosion and is slowly sinking. Instead of sending it into the dry docks for repair the captains continue to hire a very lean amount of smart under paid mechanics technicians to run around with their hair on fire to fix the areas that are leaking and keep the paint new. If the crew cannot fix the leaking ship they will lay them off and find a new crew and make sure to fill them with empty promises and false hope so that they will take on the job of lighting there hair on fire to fix and paint the ship."
bad,"Working for Halliburton meant constantly having the rub pulled out from under our feet by managers who did not understand the industry.  The managers came from silicon valley and had no understanding of the oil industry and were prone to listening to the wrong people and making reckless, whimsical decisions"
bad,Corporate responsibilities for multiple departments.  Several layers of management.  Customer service focus is driven in all departments for continued business.
bad,"Productive but over exhausting. The contract says 5 weeks - 5 weeks on-off pattern, but I have to work around 8 weeks and goes on days off for 2 weeks only."
bad,"Until a few years ago, Finance in Duncan was a great place to work. When upper management in Houston determined it was time to make some big changes, many benefits were removed such as holiday parties, promotions, advancement, MVP awards, etc. "
bad,at first management was amazing after 3 years they changed management and everything changed also had to train a lot of employees on MPD system. What i learned at halliburton i had to learn on my own when nMPD started not/very little people new about it. Got to travel
bad,Halliburton was very good about empowering employees in a safety conscious environment. It seemed there were no repercussions for ensuring that tasks were always performed safely even if stop work was involved On the down side the pressure to produce was always  oppressive. Nothing ever seemed to be enough.
bad,It's either fest or famine financially.  I had to barrow money from my 401k three times during the eight years I worked there. Great OSHA training. Very stringent company.
bad,"Halliburton is a company with good procedures and standards, but it seems to be lost in its own self promotion. "
bad,"Es un trabajo que requiere dedicacion full time, es buen lugar parar aprender muchas cosas pero, el trato por parte de RRHH es pesimo muy malo,pagan lo que quieren y cuando quieren ,en general el trato con los colegas es bueno dependiendo de cado uno, lo que mas me gusto fue lo que aprendi ya que ahi aprendi mucho mas que en otros lados pero no gracias a los cursos ni capacitacion ya que eso tampoco es bueno en general el trato hacia las personas es muy frio e impersonal , es un trabajo para hacerlo una epoca ,no recomendable para pretender jubilarse ."
bad,"I've worked here for the last 8 years.  4 of those with no raise, no promotion or title change, and no bad review.  When raises were given just your typical 2-3% for a record setting year of profit.  It's close to home and the hours are good.  We used to get lots of OT but that has been removed.  I love what I do and I'm very good at it."
bad,"As an electronics technician you better figure out what's wrong with the equipment and you better do it quick.    People talk behind your back, and are very rude when your trying to fix a problem, bugging every five minutes, lots of stress. Supervision is micro managed. Pay sucks, make money because you work long hours. Just remember you have to pay taxes on all that money! On paper it looks good, what you take home isn't worth you being away from your family. Let's not forget the weather conditions you'll have to deal with, extreme hot to extreme cold, wind and rain. Rotating shifts. Minimum 12 hours on location, plus your drive which can be up to four hours one way. Dangerous two lane roads with lots of traffic, mostly semi's."
bad,"Great systems to use, equipment although horribly maintained is still above industry averages. Excellent place to begin and learn PSL, makes no sense to stay past the glass ceiling of high school politics. Lazy workers/supervisors thrive under the radar and middle/upper management too incompetent to make needed changes. Compensation vs other companies is extremely below average."
bad,"To much stress put on the field employees, management always pushes blame downhill. I did enjoy my time with the people in the field but found the management changed often and when that happened everything about the job would change."
bad,"badly organised, poorly run, old boys call the shots. no humour allowed. experienced men ignored in favour of yes men, then when it all goes wrong its youre problem. guilt trips galore youve got to help us out the frequent call of our incompetent boss but when you need a favour amnessia evident, worst company i have worked for just holding on for the redundancy pay out."
bad,"Halliburton is built up to provide adversarial work environment where people are elevated by tearing each other down.  This behavior is mostly on the management layer by management who has never delivered product."
bad,"When things are booming you can move up fast. No work life balance. Ability to move up when things are good, but pay is decreased and hours are increased when things are down. Be ready to work 130 hrs over 2 weeks on salary."
bad,"At Halliburton, we have a ""Culture of advancement."" People who work here truly believe that anything is possible in remarkably short time if they work hard enough."
bad,"Es una buena empresa para aprender, sin embargo no tienen un real aprecio por sus trabajadores así como lo publican, pues realizo un despido masivo importándoles mas las fiestas de fin de año que preservar y echar a mas de 150 empleados en un solo día."
bad,I understand that working for a company like halliburton is going to require a great deal of devotion but they could at least pay their employees for their time and effort.
bad,Company is not people-centric and there is more politics over substance. Overall not a culture that is inductive to get the best out of employees.
bad,"They will use engineers as glorified babysitters just so they can squeeze out every penny from our salary. You will probably end up sleeping in a truck 70% of your time on if you're an engineer and start out in the wrong PSL."
bad,The culture has become everyone for themselves. Blue Collar workers are considered second class citizens.  The future of every worker is uncertain with the merger.
bad,Like I said great benefits but you are expendable. Low pay. Too many hours. You have no home life.  Every thing they do is to save the company money. Even as far as screwing you out of pay. Almost impossible to get a promotion or move up. They lie to suck you in. Then they make you stay a year if they pay for your cdl. Not worth it. There are better companies out there.
bad,Company is to money driven which gets in the way of taking care of it's employees.  Spends to much time hiring and training new employees instead of taking interest in currently employees and managing the internal issues that would retain them and make the company even more profitable. .
bad,"I joined with high hopes, however the role, organization and opportunities changed completely within the first 3 months, and have me questioning what I joined."
bad,"I spend most of my time in the field supporting one of the frac crews.  The hours are extremely long, and the base pay is relatively low.  I am unhappy with both the work, which is focused more on electronic troubleshooting than with instrumentation, and with the company culture.  I find it extremely frustrating to watch the company waste millions of dollars, and then cut back on the employees' hours to save money."
bad,"Typical hours 100 + per week, on call 24 /7. 70 to 80% turn over, average wireline engineer works position for less than 3 years. "
bad,"Good ol'boy system at its finest, and telling the truth and owning up to something will get you into trouble here...not what I was looking for in a company.  Oh, and 7 whole days off during a 5 month period, while being 100% on call and being sick to my stomach when my phone rings... management was pretty cool, but just lots of stress..."
bad,"Typical day was clock in, check restocking area, move bulk product from rail cars to inventory, load trucks, unload trucks, count incoming products. Mix drilling fluids and check drilling fluid weights. Learned basic plant maintenance and how to count and restock inventory."
bad,Long hours away from home some times work is slow and layoffs work on equipment in all weather conditions swing shift physical labor must be able to lift 50 pounds
bad,manage has no knowledge  of jobs they oversee. do not attempt to work with other key job area that will affect your job. In my case as a machinist we depend on programming for our machines. it says in job requirements that we are not expected to do endless edits to program. Yet we do programming will not fix most of these and our management will not find a way to help us.  but will write you up if you miss a edit that causes part to be out of tolerance
bad,"Good benefits however there is no work / life balance. Company expects you to be their primary focus, day, night, weekend, holiday and vacation. The commute to the North Belt office is terrible."
bad,Worked at Halliburton for a number of years now. To get anywhere you need to sacrifice your whole life. Management are full of empty promises and only care about profit and their ego.
bad,"Mudloggers are the bottom of the oilfield,  that’s a known fact. However, Halliburton used to treat us very well compared to other companies. Not so anymore, at least not in the Gulf of Mexico. Management makes promises they can’t deliver to lure new hires and makes no effort to keep experienced hands so turnover is high. Those who stay are demoralized by years of stagnant pay or even pay cuts, and lack of advancement opportunities"
bad,3 yrs of employment.  No backing from management.  Treated employees with long term employment terrible when they scaled back their work force.  I don’t feel Halliburton thinks highly of their employees.
bad,"Flip flopping leaders, micromanagement and culture of fear for some."
bad,"A very busy from 8 to 5 daily activities that keep me going and productive throughout the day. My previous supervisor was great, he did not micromanage my daily projects. A very friendly place to work. The hardest part of working here was the drive. The fun part of the jobs was friendly coworkers and great amenities in the campus."
bad,"I had almost 45 years with Halliburton when I was laid off.  After that long there I ended up with no going away party, no retirement party  or anniversary party.  I know that sounds petty but  I spent a lot of my life there.  I was one of the oldest of the 4 laid off."
bad,"I originally was based out of Colorado. They closed our operations there, so I was forced to relocate to williston, ND, with multiple additional benefits promised as an incentive. They promised played travel time for employees who live outside the area. They took that away. They promised a housing allowance. They are in the process of taking that away. They pay per diem, but make it impractical to qualify. They give 4 days paid sick leave, but make it impossible to qualify for. They have created a very negative work environment with low employee moral."
bad,"I enjoyed the company when I first started, but the lack of promotion and career development in the department I work in has really discouraged me. I notice other departments are treated better, and they get the opportunity for advancement more often."
bad,"la ressource humaine est la première chose à protéger dans une entreprise. Sans les Hommes, rien ne peut être fait.Alors les discriminations ne sont pas bienvenues et il faudrait beaucoup de reconnaissance de la part du management.Savoir que le temporaire comme le contractuel sont égaux."
bad,"The benefits were great, and was the primary reason I stayed with the company. "
bad,"Good place to start, fast money, heavy work load. Wouldnt recommend for someone with a family/significant other because you will not have time for ANYTHING! Job was just too stressful"
bad,The hardest part about working for Halliburton was the constant management shell game.  Management changes every two years like clockwork which makes motivating project teams nearly impossible.  My experience was most team members would rather wait out a manager they didn’t get along with to see if the next manager would be anymore agreeable to the projects the teams were working on instead of focusing on the current projects.
bad,"Moved over to this company wjile in Iraq working. They were also going through change. Oil & Gas in Iraq was also  starting up, Government issues & Local Government involvement also contributed to a poor work environment,"
bad,At times it seemed the focus was on solely the numbers and my supervisor was not located locally.  This at times was difficult in dealing with day to day situations that arose.
bad,This company has very good benefits and has a lot of over time but not enough home time to spend with family. They teach you about safety procedures but when you're on the field is very different. Managers care more about finishing the job then the employees' safety.
bad,"Typical day includes updating the 3-5 managers you answer to about current operations."
bad,This company is good to start at and get your job experince and tranning. There is alot of hours availble out in the field if you want them . And they stay busy all year round .
bad,"Applied online and went to a job fair. They lied about everything and threw me into a completely different department, and location. I am forced to drive 140 miles commute to work bc they won't give me a company truck or hotel room. Been promoted with no pay raise"
bad,Does not pay to move up at Halliburton. Was once a great place to work but upper management has no loyalty to the employees nor do they have a clue what the employees actually do.
bad,Since I've was recently laid off due to the economics of the Oil & Gas industry I am not in a position to give a fair and unbiased review.
bad,"Good Co-workers and management. Typical day would be: "
bad,"I enjoyed my position but the male coworkers were very dominant and didn't like women working with them, did learn a lot about different chemicals and cement mixes that are used in frac jobs"
bad,good company to work for while being in the field. Promotions seem to be a bit on the downside. The company has great benefits also
bad,Not much home time and you cant plan things with family because your on call 24/7. Management is not great they promise you things but never deliver. The best thing about working at Halliburton are the co workers and benefits.
bad,"long hours, with little to occupy your time doing very basic work the pay is decent until you move up within the company and little job security."
bad,"I worked very loyally for this company and was actively involved in learning about the business, our customers and my job as an engineer. I was involved in a number of unique projects and gained very valuable insight into how I could improve processes and increase my productively and value to the company. I also worked with very good people who I got along with wonderfully and who I believe enjoyed working with me. Unfortunately, on a global scale, this company does not care about any of these things. They could careless who you are or what value you can, or think you can add to the business. I was laid off due to a ""reduction in force"" just days after the department added two new engineers and days before I was scheduled for a promotion. Don't work here if you have a family and think this could be a good career path. This job is only good for a couple of years of training and solid industry experience while you prepare for the job you really want."
bad,It will give you the tools and background you will need for more experienced hands on jobs that deal with operations on machinery as well as how to maintain the equipment.
bad,"This company is not interesting in applying new supply chain practices, too focused on old way of doing things.  Too many people promoted up through the ranks that do not understand or embrace forward thinking or new supply chain concepts.  if you do not have an engineering degree do not apply!"
bad,Typical work day was 8-10 hours. You will learn how to drive a 18 wheeler or straight truck depending on your job. They just acquired Baker-Hughes and then laid off 9000 people. Way to go.
bad,"Some days good, but always away from home, management is good and good leaders and all employees work hard for me. Sometimes alot of driving equipment is required which can get tiresome"
bad,"Once a new release or projects are completed prepare to be laid off before you become vested. They state that work hours are adjustable between starting 6 am to 9 am and leave 3pm to 6 pm but managers schedule weekly meetings at 4:30 because ""it's just the way it is.."""
bad,The amount of hours worked does not reflect in the pay. It would if the health and safety rules around hours worked were followed. For example after 12 hours of work you are to stop working. This does not happen which leaves lots of room for life threatening mistakes.
bad,"Worked in various locations including Rock Springs, WY, Farmington, NM, and Williston, ND.  There are good opportunities for advancement.  This is a very difficult opportunity for those with families.   We traveled  to several different places, most of which were out of state.  Often we worked 16 to 18 hours per day for two weeks straight.  Management has little regard for their employees.  Supervisors are expected to work during their time off and be available constantly."
bad,"- very hectic work"
bad,Long days working outdoors.  Usually start at 7;00am on site and work till job is completed. sometimes until 10:00 pm. Averaged around 80 hours per week.
bad,Poor Quality long hours tolerable pay but over all many lazy workers where others have to cover for them
bad,"Productive and encouraging, learnt my job well, weak & untrained immediate(mid-level) management which does not listen to both ends of the story(no skip level), excellent team and team work, enjoyed working with my team. Politics and inability to skip a level and reach out to a higher management team member is the biggest disadvantage I had.It's said that it's easy to move across departments but it's easier said than done. If you want to learn here, access to information and assistance is readily available."
bad,If you don’t mind not having any job security then this is a job for you. If you depend on your job to feed your family stay away from the oil services.
bad,Lack of organizational planning and communication.   Culture was hard to deal with. The hardest part of the job is try to figure out where you stood within the organization.  Very poor leadership in the IT department.
bad,I expected more. A lot more. There is no set schedule. The training is not how they said it would be. They keep you at the lower level for a very long time without much training. You cannot move up easily or at all to different levels with different pay. Benefits are good. Communication can be approved.
bad,You're required to sacrifice and do to much for what you get paid. The work life schedule is also absurd. Management is oblivious to any request. Overall experience is terrible. Benefits are good though.
bad,Halliburton's publicly stated mission says it all. It wasn't this way when I first hired on. Over the past 14 years their focus moved from their customers to their shareholders.
bad,The years I spent working here was in a shop. We would tear apart and rebuild mud motors for the oil field. They worked us many many hours and we were on call every other week. We would work 12 days on and 2 days off. It was horrible and they didn't treat the employee's well. I would NOT recommend working here
bad,"Halliburton is very top-heavy, almost seems like 10 salaried employees for every laborer at an operations base. And there's a somewhat decent chance you will end up answering to a power-tripping supervisor that will make sure you don't transfer or advance, especially to a position considered to be equal to or above them. The benefits are really good here. But if you're hourly, don't expect great compensation. The checks will be decent due to the sheer amount of hours worked, but expect 14-18 hours a day for two weeks straight. The shop hours are better (50-60 hours per week), but don't expect anything close to the paychecks the field guys bring in: And be ready to have a supervisor or foreman with eyes on you at all times because every job can only have so many hours against it. I only say that I recommend this job because it has a great safety program and a good training program. And unless you know somebody at another company to refer you, it's likely the only place that will hire you without experience and take the time to train you."
bad,"I worked there for three years. As soon as my hiring manager left; my whole time over there was a wast. I should have left too. Pushed to the side and kept out of circle. Hated coming to work every morning almost doing nothing and waiting for work assignments. I was creating new tasks for myself every day and doing a lot of data entry instead of working on full capacity like my peers.  "
bad,"Not much of a surprise here, I have 4 years with the company. Only thing that matters is stock price, only people they care about is upper management. Really bad bonus structure when competitors are paying out large commission checks. Nobody even knows how they’re structured or the status leading up to the end of the quarter. I’m sure the Frac product line gets a lot of support but smaller service lines are basically ignored. Good work/life balance but that’s probably just because they don’t care what you do because your immediate boss is too busy doing reports for upper management."
bad,"Spent 10+ years listening to Management tell everyone how great of a company it was but when it came down to it, they talked the talk but didn't walk the walk."
bad,I was a supervisor at Halliburton who managed about a 15 person crew. An average day involved building and repairing natural gas pumping units  and clean up. Managements main focus was profit but did focus on safety as they could lose contracts over injury. The culture was very roughneck and the hardest part of the job was the long hours. The most enjoyable for me was the hard work.
bad,"The culture at Halliburton is dull, the office is far and the people are not very bright. Finding a good mentor will be difficult, work is rather repetitive, and no one has a sense of humor. The rigs are the most fun part of the job, but generally, it's not the most exciting place to be."
bad,"The working conditions in the office are basic. Standard cubicle, no windows, complete silence where everyone can hear everything, no gym or lunch area where the facility had over 300 employees. I want to run out of the door when work is over. If you're ok with a standard office life, where you're simply ""glad to have a job"" this place may work for you. Take your creativity elsewhere because this is a highly processed company where they hire smart people to tell them what to do,and you may still never be right. If your hiring manager has over 40 years experience, decline that service line. Chances are, they're riding the wave to retirement, don't care about employee advancement and likely never had a clue how to manage properly. They've finally made it a requirement to have a college or military education to become a manager. Thank goodness"
bad,"If you’re good at politics, and willing to play the game, then this might be the right company for you. Your performance is based on management’s perception of you relative to your peers, so sabotage your peers as much as you can. "
bad,"all i can say is if the support services PSL is who you are wanting to work for, Mechanic, etech, welder, etc. the phrase around the department is ""if you dont like it you can leave, theres 100 other people waiting"""
bad,Do not expect to get equal pay or treatment. It is and has always been a boys club. And don't forget the lay offs. Your work record does not mean anything when it comes to choosing between someone who does a good job and keeping the buddy.
bad,"Poor Logistical support and planning for working international. poor management once overseas. "
bad,"I worked for them for 11 years. The company recognizes you as a number, not a person. Management is very cutthroat. You are expected to work many hours, even if it is more than the company allows; with no back talk. I was let go due to my manager saying, ""Due to the future workload, I wasn't needed anymore"".."
bad,"What can I say? When you are working for a big multinational corporation, you are just a number. They laid off so many good, experienced people who had spent their whole lives at that company and kept a bunch of kids! I mean, they laid off all the most knowledgeable people who were getting close to retirement and now they have a bunch of college graduates running the place. It’s a big joke. They charge too much for their services and all the decisions are made in some far-away land."
bad,"The works not that hard but be prepared to miss your loved ones and battle depression on a daily basis!"
bad,"Terrible workplace culture, left you feeling like a number.  Very difficult to gain recognition for raises and promotions.  Extremely long hours with some of the lowest hourly wages paid in the ONG industry.  Did have excellent health care benefits.  Safety culture left a lot to be desired as it took a backseat to completing the job no matter what.  Training programs were good."
bad,"If you want good money and are prepared to put up with being treated like a piece of meat who's only there to do what you're told without question then you'll probably like Haliburton.  However if you want to be treated with respect and decency then this isn't the company for you. "
bad,"2 weeks on, 1 week off... switch from days to nights every rotation, 18 hr days away from home in hotels, forget about work/ personal life balance. avg employment length is 18 months, worse divorce record that the military."
bad,I learned to be a team leader. While the boss was away I was able to put my supervisor skills to work. I learned to do inspections and how to work with a pyc for barite samples. Hardest part of my job was when we would loose a coworker. The most enjoyable part is working with the team accomplishing the same goals. Even when management was away we managed to shine thru with no MSHA citations during my time with the company.
bad,When I first joined the team I was excited and thought I would be here a long time. Now with the slow down and layoffs people are showing their true colors. Every man for himself seems to be the feeling.
bad,This was a short term contract during the transfer of operatorship from Conoco to CNOC of the Bohai Bay drilling program.
bad,"low pay, no job security,no advancement options,constantly changing something about your pay or hours, great co workers, strong favoritism"
bad,"- Not a good field of occupation if you have a family and value family/work life balance."
bad,"Halliburton provides a great way to work and learn the oilfield while doing so.  Full health and retirement benefits. Other than that they don't offer much as an employer.  The demands placed on their employees are out of perspective with the pay range and they often lay off older experienced workers to use cheaper new hires, sacrificing service quality."
bad,"a typical work day started with a safety meeting, then work was distributed and worked accordingly. I mostly worked on the mobil rigs  programming and pre-maintance. my co-workers were knowledgeable and friendly. the hardest part of the job was the issolation I found i was working a lot by myself and tho I was able to complete the tasks at hand there seemed to be a staffing issue which lead to overworked individuals and frustration in the workplace. the best part of the job was the people that worked there the long time employees are knowledgeable and know their job well"
bad,"good place to gain experience. management is horrible and clueless."
bad,"Very poor work/life balance.  Constantly working.  Laid off based on seniority and not based on value to company which I was near the top."
bad,"Get exposed to the environment, demanding client, abnormal and long working hours. Great field team, but poor managers."
bad,"I worked in the Maintenance Dept. for six years. I was constantly verbally abused by my supervisor about my physical appearance. Upper Management and HR would do absolutely nothing about it. After I had enough abuse, I finally just quit, and am considering filing a harassment suit against the company."
bad,"Best training in industry"
bad,"Ok, company to work for. Good benefits and perks. Would like more flexible vacation and work schedule."
bad,The leadership of this company leaves a lot to be desired.  Even though they are financially stable they could double their revenue with positive ideas from management.  It is a job that takes all of your personal time away from family and in the end you are just a number.
bad,"Empresa interessante para dar inicio no mundo do Petróleo, te oferece grande aprendizado. O Salário é muito ruim e os benifícios pouco beneficiam."
bad,el trabajo es interezante pero los cordinadores no tienen consideracion sobre tu humanidad
bad,"100-120 work hours per week--Learned alot about the oilfield industry--Co-workers were good to work with, most worked as a team--hardest part of job was the many hours, very little sleep--enjoyed working with co-workers, made some new friends, very helpful--management keeps dangling extras such as bonuses, living quarters, flights to work and then the way to get them is sign a slip saying you will pay back if don't stay a year, so if and when you quit you owe them money from the last year of extras paid to you."
bad,the managers would say going out for a one day job and it would end up being 3 days. you wouldnt be able to go home and you wouldnt have enough food or supplies to last more then a day. They would say theyed take care of are food and nessasatys and they only bought food three times so they feed us once a day.
bad,"my typical day at work is like any manufacturing line. you do the same thing over and over again. Thanks to this company i have learned a lot of helpful tools to further me in life, both personally and business wise. But not without forcing things to get it accomplished. Management is extremely flaky, distracted, and undecided in everything they do. The hardest part about working here for me is knowing that i bust my tale everyday i come and barely get compensated for it. But on the other side everyone i work with looks to me for advice because of the knowledge i have gained."
bad,Long hrs. Hard work poor pay good benefits. Immature/ young supervisors.
bad,Halliburton is a place you go to make lots and lots of money in exchange for any trace of life outside work.  It is an excellent business to work for to pay off debts and build a nest egg but if you wish to enjoy that money you will have to find something else with better work-life balance.
bad,"This used to be a good company to work for, but as of late, employee loyalty is all but gone, constant breakdown of communication between staff and management. Any incentives that once enticed employees are now gone, hours cut too often, and rampant racism and homophobia present despite it being against corporate policy. Overall a toxic workplace environment not for everyone."
bad,"I worked in Lagos Nigeria Halliburton. Halliburton is a good place to work and learn, however, the Human Resource  Management needs to improve and have their Staff's interest at heart."
bad,Don't expect to advance unless you're a woman. Constant rule changes and fighting to get what you're owed. Though the people are good and easy to get along with
bad,"In particular, Landmark PSL suffered from lack of leadership, clear direction and employee development.  The culture resulted in high attrition and consequently loss of valuable knowledge necessary to perform business objectives."
bad,"Management is okay but sometimes they need to communicate directives to the workforce."
bad,"Typical shifts ranged from 12-16 hour days.  In the cement bulk plant their were usually 4 supervisors, 1 clerk, and 1-3 workers in warehouse / dump room.  "
bad,"I would not recommend working for Halliburton. The hours are long, the weeks stack up without you having any say, and they will force you to work rather than spend time with your family. If you like money - this if for you, if you have anyone who loves you and likes to see your face - steer clear."
bad,Its a service company.  Every thing is judged by the service end of the business.  Technology is a read head step child.  Just realize this going into it.
bad,I left Halliburton due to the fact that I moved to Florida. We worked swing shifts and it was a lot on my family life. There was also not much room for advancement.
bad,It wasn't am pleasant place to work at the end. Lots of favoritism. I made good money for a little while with company but found myself always gone. I don't feel like i'll never want to for Halliburton again. I'm out spoken with a energetic personality some  felt I was making the rest look bad. but I had great training and great safety training.
bad,"with my 4 years degree, I have been working for Halliburton for 6 years and 4 months now. I cannot really see the reel change regarding my career with Halliburton by comparing with mates I left a schlumberger (for instance). we all started there from grade 7 and they are now to grade 10, some 11 while I'm still in grade 7 despite all training I had been doing, despite all the effort i have been doing to avoid NPT (Non Productive Time) and providing a good service quality, despite new system that we have to learn and implement in the company..."
bad,"Dirty job in oil field, very technical and sometimes intensive physically-rigging up or down the equipment.  Had to be aware while working around other company employees for safety etc..."
bad,"The company has great benefits, in terms of insurance and perks. When it comes down to the work, training and actual incentive to stay and progress, it just is not there, the only way to make a good living with them is to work long hours and have no social life."
bad,"Company will not stand behind its employees, lots of back stabbing between supervisors, pay really doesn't equal the work being done, gone 2 weeks and off 6 days."
bad,100+ hour work weeks. Outdoors. The hardest part of the job was staying awake for so long. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and interesting people.
bad,"Worked for Halliburton for 3 years. The best thing I got out of it was free Mud School, the rest of my experience was not good. The pay was below other companies, management only cared about the profit and were ""safety"" hypocrites, and they treat you like a number. I am not a fan of working for such a large company."
bad,Absolutely no leadership during my first four months.  I felt completely lost with no mentor to guide me. Over all i found it to be a good working environment with a combination of field and office work.  Salaries are below average regarding all the hours you are expected to work.
bad,"High skill level on shop floor ."
bad,"Poor management that aren't helpful and care only about their paycheck."
bad,Halliburton has a pretty bad habit of working their employees a lot and not paying them comparable to other service companies.
bad,"not the best job i have ever had now the money on the other hand was great"
bad,This job is filled with so much undercutting from coworkers people willing to throw you under the bus to advance it is nothing but high school drama out here.
bad,This company is absolutely chaotic.  Work/life balance is a joke.  The management team is terrible.  (See pros & cons.)  Upper management lacks ethics.  I do not recommend working for this company.
bad,"I loved Halliburton. It was hard work and long days but I was laid off after a purchase of a large company. The benefits were wonderful, management was good. I would have stayed with the company for a long time if it was my choice."
bad,"Training is basically non-existing. "
bad,"I handle all plants of several European countries in procurement."
bad,"Work/Life balance is better than most oilfield companies.  For field engineers the 4 on 10 off isn't bad.  There is no direct management over what you actually do, only in the paperwork you turn in.  90% of the job is unsupervised and is primarily handling day to day routines with crews that are staffed with a wide variety of characters, some great some awful, and across the board there is no knowledge of how to manage others or projects.  The engineer typically is left to clean up all the messes and ethical dilemmas left behind by the operations side without causing the account reps, customers, or business development to look into possible problems.  If one or more departments puts the other under the microscope anticipate vulgar emails and phone calls from all parties, followed closely by everyone doing their ritual of stabbing at least two people in the back.  This relationship of communicating between all the customers and departments causes alot of tension and being able to communicate effectively is critical.  Working at Halliburton as a Field Engineer is all about navigating a minefield to make your job comfortable, your actual success has nothing to do with the quality of your efforts in this area or any of your efforts.  You will succeed as an engineer if you are liked and apart of the inner circle, or ""Good old boys club"".  Lots of hardworkers have quit due to this, they get into the inner circle and realize that no matter how hard they work and succeed or fail nothing impacts their actual standing as a good worker.  Most of them eventually just give up and stop coming"
bad,Stay away very low pay compared to other companies alike. I believed they moved guys up to fast before knowing exactly how to operate very dangerous equipment. While working you more and more with no sleep.
bad,"long hours, have to fight with mother nature"
bad,"Maintain electronic instrumentation to provide reliable well maintained equipment to insure service quality.  Promote safety awareness and environmental consciousness, and comply with all applicable safety and equipment to ensure service quality.  Perform routine and preventive maintenance of electronic and electro mechanical equipment.   Interpret electronic and mechanical drawings"
bad,"If you enjoy having a life and family, Halliburton may not be for you. I can only speak from my experiences and from others i have worked with. The pay is the lowest in the oil field and they will work and exploit you all they can. But if you are single individual who wants to make some cash and does not mind long hours of ""hurry up and and wait"" this may be the place for you. Advancement is a complete joke. so don't plan on advancement unless you want to spend your days after work doing mindless computer work. If your not in the ""Good ol' Boys Club"" forget it, you will be at the bottom of the food chain. Make sure you get your salary and pay and everything else the promise you in writing before you sign anything!!!!!! THINK TWICE that's all i can say."
bad,"Empresa possui muitos procedimentos. "
bad,"The higher level personnel in the company are were solely worried about themselves, clueless to the actual goings on on location. Oblivious to the skill of many of their personnel."
bad,Always laying people off. Dead need road under pay. All you are is a number to the company. Good benefits tho. To many people trying to move up on the company
bad,Poor management that struggles to identify good talent within the organization.   Focused on technical sales with really creative engineering clients that made the work experience much more valuable.
bad,"Listen, it's the oilfield. If you have spent any time in the industry it's what you'd expect. Long hours and a lot of time away from home. There are certain things that occur due to the company being as large as it is. Benefits are great. The pay is good when it comes to labor jobs in general but as far as oilfield pay it's on the lower end. The size and success of Halliburton does lead to higher job security though. I spent 2 years with the company in the field and working in the yard and management is all relatively the same. I was fortunate enough to have a great supervisor in the field that really took care of his guys. Typically above supervisory management they become brainwashed by the negative and mindlessness of the company and are simply there as mindless drones that do their job but don't care about the individual. If you can put up with the BS it's a decent job. They provide all of the workwear and PPE you need and are good about replacing things when you need it. The hours are routine unless things slow down and they make cuts but even that is only temporary and the work will return. Don't plan on a career, upward mobility is possible but difficult to achieve without playing your cards exactly within the low standard of Halliburton culture. If you want a decent steady job with good benefits with an average amount of company BS and can handle the schedule, go for it. For me personally it just didn't line up with my core values and goals in life."
bad,"A lot of traveling, heavy work load due to lack of personell, hard to advance in this company, lowest paid employees. Its hard to get the parts i need to make the equipment work,"
bad,Was able to utilize my technical skill sets and enjoyed the product lines that I was in charge of.  People were vert talented but there was very little career path options available for senior management.
bad,when I first started with the company it was a good and fun company to work for but over the 10 years very bad management has driven it to the ground I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless your new to the oilfield and need training that's all they are good for they will stab you in the back and will fire people that get paid too much and offer job back at lower rate to save money
bad,"Halliburton is the kind of place where managers and supervisors pick their favorites and those are the ones that get the special treatment and best job assignments. If for any reason they don't like you, you get singled out on a daily basis. The workers there are top notch and great people, including the third party mechanics, but management runs these shop like its their own personal playground. They act like Halliburton global rules and regulations don't apply to them unless a ""big wig"" is around and its strictly by the book. Not all management is like this but for the most part, sadly it is."
bad,"Very large company, good benefits, no reguards to employees, your are just another number. If you don't kiss-up to manager of department there is no advancement."
bad,In charge of cleaning and maintenance of pump truck that I operated. Keep all equipment clean and organized on truck. Load truck of any items need for that weeks particular jobs. Work away from home 7-10 day at a time.
bad,"Halliburton brought my family and I money and even more so the benefits we desperately needed.  They blow up safety and training as a core obligation but when you get out to the job all of that is still preached only and not practiced.  When someone brings this to the management's attention it is turned around on you.  I have unfortunately experienced this. So if you can handle the outdoors, the long hours and the fact that you are simply in harms way then look no further!"
bad,"Pay is good, when its busy cause of all the overtime. Starting pay is horrible so you need the overtime to make a decent living. Once the overtime is gone and your living on your 40hrs/week you realize how much this place sucks. They don't really care about there employees. They'll work you until your dead tired and ask you to keep going. You work in all types of weather conditions, you will not have any holidays off. They always let the senior guys have xmas and new years off, so every years they cancel days off during December, so plan on working every holiday."
bad,"At the time I went into the oilfield, prices of oil were going down. Jobs were being laid off every day so I was walking in egg shells each  day hoping not to be the one being laid off next. Managers were pretty cool and I made a lot of lifetime friends out there since we stayed on the road with each other. It was a good job for someone who doesn't have much to lose but not for somebody who has a full life and family"
bad,When working at this company i felt like a number no care for who you are or your family. Even in the safety meetings you didn't put your name down you just put your number.
bad,"While at Halliburton, I had the opportunity to work with some of the best people. The team at our facility became much like an extended family. This has very much to do with the fact that the atmosphere was already such prior to our company being bought by Halliburton."
bad,"long hours"
bad,"A manager called me on the telephone for an interview.I went to the interview and found out that all the parking spaces were taken in front of the building.I drove around and waited for about 10 minutes for someone to pull out.I got inside with about 10 minutes before the interview.I was called in by a floor supervisor.It was a two part question interview.He asked me the general questions for the first part.The second part he said there was no right or wrong answer.I found out for this not to be the case.It was heavy detailed questions about diesel engines,brakes,hydraulics and a Lot of electrical.I was struggling during the whole time and the supervisor did not even try to help me.Not the place I would want to work.The whole interview took two and a half hours!Not an easy verbal test for me.I was looking forward to cross training into this field but it seems like they already want you to know everything and just go to work on the first day without any training.Not what I want.If you have a Lot of diesel and a Lot of electrical experience I would say go to the interview.If not, do not go.It was just a big disappointment for me."
bad,"Management needs to take some classes. Favoritism is evident, supervisors talk negatively behind their employees backs, etc.  Very unprofessional."
bad,work realy hard never have a day work hard all tha time do hard work every day all ways tired whe you get off
bad,Technology is state of the art but very limited in advancing based on my knowledge and abilities. Internal systems is based off the buddy system and not what you know or have to offer for the company.
bad,Great money but you had to work a lot of hours to get it. Gone away from home for long periods of time
bad,"Sucks constantly up and down type of work, its the oilfield if you know what i mean, hopefully it gets better, most people say stay thru it all but its hard"
bad,"First of all was a very nice experience if was not the economy situation I guess that never give up that."
bad,"Management gets their buddies/ ""yes"" guys in lead positions.  Double standards for those who aren't part of their group/clique. Employees who bust their butts but make a mistake and aren't part of the group get the boot. Those who are in with them can make several mistakes and just get a slap on the hand or they turn a blind eye."
bad,"have management that tries to make you do unsafe things, treats you differently as a disabled vet. purposely tries to get you fired so they don't have to deal with you. I don't know if its the company or the higher ups that worked near me but regardless management should not act they way they did. work 13-16 hrs. a day and they try to tell us that we cant eat or drink out in 103 degrees. supervisors will mess something up and blame people lower than them so they don't get into trouble.  have gone to HR but they never seem to handle anything. this company doesn't care about you or your family all they care about is their name as a company."
bad,Halliburton is a great company if you are starting out in the oil field and have zero bills.  Their payscale is bottom of the barrel and far from competitive.  You are paying for the buildings full of people doing less or close to nothing.
bad,Lots of hard work be prepared. Lots of  Long hours and hard work or be prepared to work holidays and not have very much family time it's a great company if you are young and strong and don't have any children
bad,Give you a set schedule then due to mismanagement call you 36 hours before and tell you to drop everything and to go offshore despite having a schedule on  land job.
bad,A great place to work as long as the oil field is good. An employee can learn how to read blue prints and learn to build a lot of oilfield equipment.
bad,"The division I worked for was sold. It was great to work for Halliburton in the division I was in. As long as you did a good job, you were left alone."
bad,"This company offers a lot of room to move, but the bust in the oil industry left a lot of good people high and dry. The work it very hard but the pay is well worth it."
bad,"This is the one a lot of people like to work for but if you find yourself hired here, you'll quickly realize there isn't any recognition for a job well done. if you happen to make a mistake, you will hear about it from at least three different sources. "
bad,"You're gone all the time, the pay is bad but you make your money on the hours. you won't have a life becuase you are always working. the benefits are great though."
bad,"Dont care much for this company they have great benifits but the management is poor and raises dont come often or of a significant amount. my personal working experience of working there is that we are disposable. if they cared at all for the employees they would show some sort of appreciation, but they dont. its fine job if dont care to be appreciated and just wanna make some ok money for oil field"
bad,too many hours did not like working for halliburton. did not like did not like did not like did not like away from hoeme this is not fun   wishni never go
bad,"Was an intern in the doha division. Amazing Co workers."
bad,"I had a very special position that I loved and ultimately lost. The manager, although very understanding, was not strong and avoided conflict at all costs. I was told they tried to find me another position in the company but they didn't try very hard. I was even rewarded and given a raise based on my work and contribution to the team about 2 months before I was released."
bad,Not for everyone. It was a typical oil industry environment. Lack of respect towards employees. Not open to new or innovative methods of workmanship. No chance for career advancement unless on personal basis with the correct people.
bad,"Company value the most the capability to show off, no matter the quality of what is being said - important is to say something that sound getting along with the ""boss""."
bad,Management did not have experience in coil tubing. Sometimes it made the job more difficult when you did not have the support and knowledge of upper management.
bad,ok if you like working for big Oil Industry company. it has decent ben efits because it is such a big company with over 30000 employees you will probably be just another number.
bad,"The current work environment at Halliburton is toxic. Senior managers are using lower level employees as a RIF cushion for their $4B M&A mistake. The Halliburton culture has eroded to the point that no one willing comes to work and the family atmosphere is a by gone era. It is really a sad testament to market greed driving poor business decisions. No pay raise for years, no 401K matching, etc. A non-incentivized job is a minimum effort job."
bad,this company does not have a structure that is equally fair. This company goes off of the buddy system. If they gave out raises to people who deserved them it would be great
bad,"Halliburton was one of the worst companies I have worked for. They spent all this time training me and getting me ready for work. Then after they shipped me to work it didn't last. They are management heavy and don't plan to far ahead. They lied to me and kept telling me I was going back to work for 6 weeks before laying me off. They are the lowest paying company for the same jobs that other companies pay 2 or 3 dollars more an hour with better benefits."
bad,"Halliburton is renowned as a training company. They provide superior training at the beginning and intermediate levels. This company promotes based on performance and has clear development plans for the beginning stages of your career. I would not recommend Halliburton for a life long career, but if you are looking to be trained then they could be considered."
bad,only worked for the company for 2.5 months then got laid off due to a poor economy. just wish that i could have worked there longer to learn more. now i cant support my family because of it and having a hard time finding a new job 30+ days later.
bad,Solo 6 meses de trabajo y poco tiempo para argumentar un feedback.
bad,"Management does not follow through with things, there is little to no communication until the very last minute"
bad,"Was told I would make a certain amount, didn't make close to it.  Then when I moved positions while overseas, it took forever to get paid for it.  I still don't think I was paid properly!"
bad,I worked at Schlumberger before working here and I made way more money. There is no opportunity for advancement in the field I'm in here. Low moral in the team.
bad,"Good company benefits and equipment, great people, very big company, relocated 2 times, can't afford the 3th..had to go to C&J.."
bad,Halliburton overall is a good place to work but with any down turn everyone's jobs are at risk. Constant uncertainty about your job takes a toll on the atmosphere of your work environment.
bad,Halliburton is a poorly managed company with many internal disputes and an enormous disparity between field workers and those in the shop and office.
bad,"Rigged weld which consist of pump operators calculating distance , space , volume to be pumped to determine the most efficient and effective way to connect iron from pump truck to the manifold to the weld head for maximum flow."
bad,"you will make alot of money but, only because you work about 160hr weeks and that you wont get much time home. i dont know what else to say, you make a sacrifice but is it worth it? if you have a family then probably not."
bad,"Contract work in Iraq. Deliver supplies to different bases. Typical day, I would load flatbed truck, meet with Marines around 3am to discuss direction we will travel and hazardous status. Unload supplies then return to home base."
good,"People are great but management sucks, make numerous promises but never keep them. Takes forever to move up unless your best friends with someone. A giant game of favorites"
good,no benefits except paid vacations and medical all rest of things been taken away i.e 40hrs guaranteed now be on call 24/7 and don't get paid for that
good,Interview was short and quick over the phone. Received an off lettter within the next week. At the time Halliburton was hiring a lot of people. The company helped me get my CDL and they kept us busy with contracts. Halliburton has a ton of good benefits to offer it's employees. But the competition pays better. Halliburton schooling is something that I will always appreciate. They try their best to make sure all the employees have a good understanding of what those job consist of.
good,Take equipment to leave location and set up equipment. Do maintenance on equipment. Rig down equipment and move to new location.
good,People are replaceable and not as valued as they should be due to have deep pockets.
good,"They get ride of whomever makes a good salary to show profits, and as many people as it takes to show profits, all about the stock holders once they demote them they limit your hrs to 40 a week to starve you into quitting so they dont have to pay unemployment."
good,"Management is lost, with no direction is sight. everything is ran backwards."
good,"No support from management, no tools to run jobs. Have to go to other rigs to search for parts, even if you haven't slept in a day or so. Management does not care about employees safety."
good,Not a good working environment. People like to gossip and management talks badly about staff members in front of other staff
good,Local Managers dont have the experience with managing people. They take field hands that are tired of the long hours and give them desk jobs without proper training. Waste alot of time and money going back to fix issues that should have been addressed prior to doing the job.
good,"not good upper management was lacking, equipment was horrible, the people in charge had no concept of what they were doing and the other personnel had severe attitudes and made the workplace both hostile and no regard for the other personnel."
good,managers were only conerned with how much their bonuses were so they tried to keep pay to a minimum.
good,I can only speak about the Frac department and it was not a good experience for the oilfield/gas service.  Starting pay is 15.00 per hour and you are doing 3 to 4 different jobs. Pay is too low for the heavy work you are doing.  I highly recommend applying in a different department.
good,"Wasn't a great place to work, but it paid the bills. Long hours, long weeks away from family, no advancement, no understanding of life needs, no communication, no leadership."
good,"Rotational work, even time."
good,I have been working for long time from this company and it was a very good place to be. The management system from Halliburton needs more improvement.
good,"Great training program, especially if you are new to oil and gas industry. Pay is good but requires to work very long hours. Most of the benefits have been reduced due to current market."
good,"They will lay off people to keep their profit up high! The Management is a joke they do not know how to manage big jobs, they higher people with no degrees to work Engineering jobs!"
good,You will have to put in many years of service to obtain any kind of recognition. High turn over rate in all areas.
good,lack in commuacation skill worked with new equipment was not very helpful in helping in training every one for them self
good,"Provide customer service to oilfield workers while maintaining inventory. Learned new computer program SAP. Reset product and provide new labeling system. Provide administrative services while developing a new electronic filing system. Prepare warehouse documents for end-of-year and new year hard-copy filing system. Hardest part of the job is utilizing 1/10th of my knowledge, skills and abilities. Good part is my Supervisor is using my skills and allowing the opportunity to streamline warehouse processes."
good,The hardest part of the job is realizing that coworkers should always be kept on a professional level
good,Management is from a bunch of morons who got there by kissing up to the boss. Not a place you would expect professionalism.
good,This place to start in learn and get to understand most of the industry but if your coworkers get drunk and attack you and you defend yourself and no fault of your own you still lose your career so it's a nice place to start but you don't stay there people leave all the time take what you can as much as possible make them pay for everything they paid for my CDL
good,"The work was either fast pace with long work hours on location or really slow office work. The classes I attended were very helpful and the information learned while working was the best in the industry, but job security is very poor."
good,"Everyone is walking around on thin ice due to job cuts."
good,"Not the best place to work at all. Very stressful, demanding, and tiring. People that work there are very young, immature. It’s like a high school. Only way to advance is brown nose and make the right friends. Hardly a work life balance. Compensation is good and benefits, that’s the only good thing. If you really need a first job, go ahead. Would not recommend to anyone."
good,"Work was performed based upon assignment on a rotational basis."
good,"Halliburton has great benefits but the pay is not competitive. The training is good, so I would recommend Halliburton as a gateway into the oilfield.  However, there are better opportunities once you get a little experience."
good,No two days are ever the same. I really don't think there is a need for me to write about this company. If you have questions for them try contacting HR.
good,"Lowest pay in the industry "
good,"Stressful. poor management. it is not what you know, it is who you know is big. 3 years with one raise only. huge down cluture with no willing to change."
good,"Long work days with excessive amounts of pressure to meet deadlines and unrealistic expectations for the work force in place. Several districts have a poor work culture promoting individualism and creating separation instead of promoting teamwork. Lack of managerial support makes for a negative work environment. Difficult to move up in the company without knowing the right people. "
good,"You work according to their schedule. Family is zero priority to them. You are regularly threatened that you could be fired if you don't work your tail off. You do get paid well. You are treated very poorly. I would never return to Canada district. UK district, different story. I would go back there in a second."
good,"this company is a stepping stone to learn about the industry and grow, they have great training and development but the compensation and growth within the company is super slow paced. most individuals that are in management really never move up so others may also grow"
good,If you never want to advance work there. It pays well but you cant have a work and life balance. I loved the job in the beginning but I'm a single mom.
good,"This is a great company that has lost it's work force due to management. The company hires people and ask them to move to the Odessa area BIG PROBLEM, no housing."
good,"Great benefits and insurance, below standard salaries.  Halliburton used to excel in salaries and profit sharing,  not so much anymore.  Maybe if the economy turns around it will change....maybe"
good,Great pay with long hours. They have a good training program. The management is in need of help in how to plan for future. Over all it is a good company to work for.
good,"work hard, don't complain, sleep when you can and never say ""No."". you are given that ability from places near and far in state and out of state. the people you meet are hard workers and mostly family orientated. not for the weak of will kind of person."
good,"La actual organizacion no muestra objetivos claros de trabajo, lo cual no permite priorizar el uso de lso recursos, esto genera una continua situacion de estress, agregado a la politica de gestion por miedo a la perdida del empleo."
good,"traveled to Wyoming 3 weeks out of the month and received very little training, as electronic equipment did not fail very often. the remainder of the month was spent in the office with not much instruction.honestly spent some time on the computer researching upcoming updates on a mmorpg game I was playing on my own time. was fired for being late three times in six months. the last words my boss told is ""we don't play games here"". He held the high score on a pinball game they all played while at the office."
good,"Overall experience with this company was eventful, with a lot of changes going on globally which affected the staff internally in every region.  The experience gained along the way was very valuable.  Working in different departments of a company gives you more of a perspective as to how the bigger picture comes together once executed."
good,This used to be a decent company to work for. Poor market conditions and poor management decisions has made this company undesirable.I was recently laid off after 32 years of dedicated service due to poor market conditons.
good,"un organized, good pay structure, good hours, cliques a plenty."
good,while oil price is high good place to work but if they take a dip they lay off large percentages of employees. Company will transfer employees during lay offs as long as you have a relative high up in the company. Its a who you know kind of company rather than what you know and how you can benefit them.
good,Not a bad place to work if you are in the oilfield or if you are looking for a company to start your oilfield career.  There are a lot of better places to work once you get the experience.
good,There were a lot of chiefs and few indians. Working conditions changed always and little consideration was thought of concerning driving issues.
good,I was working on the global sourcing center where I was responsible for project and product management. It was great experience there working with my colleagues from different countries of the world.
good,"Halliburton is a training company.  They will hire and train a new employee before attempting to retain another one.  You are strictly a number they use to generate revenue and management does not care about you or your goals.  Like the majority of the oilfield Halliburton uses the good ol' boy system so play the game and tell people what they want to hear and you might go places."
good,"management doest care about family issues, no chance for advancement and steady work schedule, work wasn't stable and dependable"
good,"Satisfaction at Halliburton depends on immediate management. The hardest part of  job was dealing with upper management and justifying decisions. Too many management rotations - every 18 months on average. These changes caused stress and undo spending, due to  changing everything the previous manager had set in place. Do not expect Halliburton to take care of you when the rubber meets the road. Co-workers were great, wellness benefits were very good. Benefits are OK - could be  much better due to size of the company."
good,This company was a decent company for entry level work into the Oil and Gas industry.
good,"Good company to get door in door with but when it comes own to it, they only go so far till advancement stops."
good,Wasn't the suitable enviroment or job for me. Getting trained as a new employee was very poorly rated. 
good,"You'll definitely learn a lot and develop some important skills. The Pay is alright for first starting out from college. Hardest part to get used to is by far the hours, easily working 14-16 hour days for two straight weeks then get a week off. Management sucks, they hardly ever keep you involved in anything unless you are very actively trying. There are hidden motives and or objectives that they don't tell everybody. They are very hands off unless you do something wrong, but that can be taken either as a benefit or a detriment depending on how you look at it."
good,There are some pros to a huge company and definitely some cons. A pro is the size allows for the company to weather some of the ups and downs of the industry. A low is that they are so big that they are slow to initiate changes for a very dynamic industry.
good,"Favoritism and high school drama contributed to me leaving the company. Not to mention, zero personal life and the feeling of being JUST an employee #"
good,"The nature of a service company in oil and gas is going to drive its market, based on the market conditions that it operates out of.  Given that the oil and gas is unstable, it makes it hard to feel safe with employment and not worry about frequent layoffs."
good,Above average training but below average compensation for the oil and gas industry. About as stable as an oil and gas position can be.................
good,The typical day you check your gear and do load-outs. Management was really professional until raises came up. The hardest part of the job is balancing work and home life.
good,The management ran my department into the ground. While we all knew it was happening and trying to stop it. The training is scattered. They depend too much on films as training. After two years of work I was laid off. My pay slowly decreased because of lack of hrs and no raise.
good,Did not like the way that the company lay us off. It was so wrong even though the company was laying us all because of gas and oil at the time it was so wrong to lay us off like that and we had family
good,Good place to work for as long as the work is there. Becoming more difficult to work for under current management. Mistakes in the field are very unforgiving and accountability is inconsistent at best.
good,"A typical day is getting to the yard early in the morning like 2am off of 4 hours of sleep. Drive to location and start up all equipment and monitor equipment all day. The workplace culture is very racist. Favoritism is the only was to be promoted. The pay is dependent on politics. The best part of this job was being off for a week at a time, but this was after 2 weeks of work."
good,"Employer does not reward long term employees who advance their skills and education.  They cant see them in any role other than the one they were hired for.  Many people had to leave the employer and then come back in order to get promotions or pay increases for the same roles."
good,"Did not work there long enough for honest review, got terminated before even two years of employment.  The company offered variety opportunities for personal development."
good,"I worked on a cement crew in the mountains of Colorado. The work was 24/7 on call for 2 weeks and 1 week off. When we were called out on a cement job we would typically be out for 24 to 48 hours. We had to drive Semi's on narrow dirt mountain roads to the rig and then rig up piping in terrible working conditions, mud snow ice etc. This is extremely hard work and only for young people who are in shape. Our camp had a terrible attitude toward the crew member's and we were treated like criminals."
good,"Best training around.  When market dips, jobs slip. Very good place to start your career; Halliburton offers many schools for different areas of the field. However, when prices dip even the slightest, Halliburton just views numbers and not names.  Layoffs very common even with the slightest of market hiccups."
good,"Halliburton has a problem of not promoting personnel that actually do the work.  The only folks that get promoted are the suck ups and bs-ers!  If you like doing the same job over and over for years, then it's the perfect spot."
good,".Good entry level oil field job, management needs an overhaul. They will constantly threaten your job. Job security is non existent. Good to start off as entry level."
good,Empresa em que trabalhei e tive muito a agregar na minha vida pessoal.
good,"When the downturn hits, it is very cut throat. It becomes very hard to advance your career after a certain point. I am interested in not traveling abroad as much"
good,good job for singles. a lot of traveling evolved. the management is not very good. they care more about themselves than any of their employees. it pays well and there are a lot of good people working there. the pay is ok but still low for the industry. a good entry level job for someone looking in the oil field.
good,"I shouldn't have to tell everyone in the oil and gas field that jobs can come by the truckloads with plenty of work and money to pass around for everyone one day. Then thousands of people seeking unemployment the next. I don't like their micromanaging system of coordinators and the, ""Oil Ego"" of people bragging about who's got a rougher neck than the other."
good,"Descent place to retire."
good,"My experience comes from 11 years working for this company. The work is rewarding and you can learn a lot on the job, when working with the right personnel. The computer training is horrific, for a company to advertise and university concept. advancement is slow and very difficult. the best part of the job is the overtime you get to make a decent paycheck and the benefits. There are too many rules, that do not balance out with the pay. I would rather be back in the military"
good,Great Benefits but the management played favorites with certain people. They could come and go as they pleased. Used massive amounts of sick leave and were never counseled. Left everyday before end of shift and took numerous smoke breaks. Layoffs came and those are the people that are still employed while individuals that showed up early and stayed late and never called in sick are in the unemployment line trying to survive.
good,"I was one of the most experienced employees but was let go due to market conditions. I worked, I was not 'friends"" with my manager outside of work and honestly I feel like it cost me my job."
good,"As a long term employee (22 years), I witnessed severe changes within the company. In my early career, employees were treated fairly and advancement was available. After the down turn in the mid-80s, an operations CEO was replaced by an accounting CEO. Employees became a number and the pay package was changed drastically (profit sharing plan manipulated)."
good,Hired from a third party vendor as general helper but registered in Halliburton as Material Handler. Often confused with job scope as two different title is involve.
good,Made a lot of really good friends there.  The crew was awesome.  Management looked for things that were wrong all the time.  Never an attaboy.  Long long hours and family life is non existant.
good,Was given a maximum of 1 hour before being required to be on location 2+ hours away for upwards of 24 hours at a time. Management would do nothing to facilitate assistance in simple things such as sending relief after being awake on location for over 24 hours.
good,Work was always up and down. You never knew when you were getting out of work. Co-Workers made the job enjoyable. Management was not good at all. Too many inexperienced management in charge of job titles they had no knowledge about.
good,Fun work place with good co workers. But the management is bad. No information is given until last minute we just know what happen.
good,"Awesome benefits, but Montgomery Area is poorly managed in PM&L/ Warehouse.  Poor Communication, Untruthful management. "
good,Good place to get a foot in the door in the oil & gas industry.   Career advancement is limited to a select few.  Best bet is to get in stay a few years and get out.
good,"Halliburton é uma grande escola a nível de se trabalhar com prazos das urgências, confesso que quem trabalha lá terá a capacidade de trabalhar em qualquer empresa de nível off-shore. A mesma possui excelentes benefícios comparados as grandes empresas de mercado, no entanto, deixa a desejar em ambiente de trabalho, equipe individualista, rotatividade, falta qualidade de vida e gestão de pessoas."
good,Usually get called in anytime during a six days on rotation.  When you get called in you respond to teh yard and pre trip your vehicle and then meet with the supervisor your going to be with for a safety briefing.  Once briefing is complete and a determination of who is doing which job on th elocation we are responding to.  Then we drive to location and once the rig is ready we drive on and set up our trucks to pump cement into the well.  We rig up with 2 inch iron pipe and 4 inch water lines to from the pump truck to the rig well.  Then when ready we operate the cement bulk trucks and send powder form cement mixture to pump truck.  Once job is completed we rig down by removing iron pipe and water lines. Then we drive back and post trip our vehciles and clean them.
good,They have no regard for the loyalty and hard work of their employees
good,"poor compensation for work duties, better opportunitys in oilfield."
good,very fast pace environment and a lot of lifting and ordering parts for the oil fields.
good,Got promised the world. And no where lived up to what was said.
good,"Regular workplace."
good,"they have a lot to offer but they have a lot of layoffs that really keep people that they need from appiling, the company really does teach safty on every aspect of the company like lock out tag out tow moter training , with me being a contracter they would not put me on with the company"
good,"It's a place to work. Most people have the same view of the company. There was nothing enjoyable about my job, and the turn over of management was unreal."
good,"Working in the field, you typically spend a majority of your time away from your family."
good,"I find it hard as a young college grad to find a place to fit in this company.  It has an old mentality of intitlement, where a college education isn't viewed as important.  It is difficult to advance within the company.  The pay is very low."
good,overall Fair employment. Needs better employee relations and management could use HR skills.
good,"I've been in the oil field for over 3yrs now and all I can say is "" The pay is ok"". Before I had this job I was making dam near to what I'm making now. Hours are long, pay is ok, benefits are ok, if your single this is the job for you. If you have a family prepare yourself for a divorce! Management don't listen to there employees and we work on their equipment all day! They never hire enough people to cover any rigs. You never see your supervisors, the people you work with always talk behind your back like your in high school and they don't pay you enough. Instead of losing jobs or laying off people they cut your hours just so there department looks good. They give you 2 weeks of vacation time then when they start cutting cost they take away your vacation and your pay. You don't progress in the company unless you are friends with someone in the office."
good,Good place to work for a single man in my opinion.
good,Halliburton is a good place to get your energy service career started and gain skills but career progression can be slow. Management is typically lacking and has poor organization.
good,"The overall direction of this great company is lost when it reaches the small managed, field camp locations. Much management does not lead by example and workloads are unfairly distibuted. Career progression is limited and promotions are handled in the ""buddy system"" or who-knows-who method. Prejudices are notable although not many of the employee base will state this due to being afraid of retaliation. ( also forbidden at the company but difficult to prove) Corporate needs to peek in on their managment outside the corporate structure. It seems the inmates are running the asylum."
good,Its very difficult for most people finding employment right out of college especially in the discipline for which you obtain your degree. Halliburton is very good at hiring people right out of college and a great place to get that initial experience.
good,"Its an ok job, and the money is great but there is no supervision there. Everyone does what they want making it hard. I work while others slack all day and thats unexceptable in my book. It is not secure either. I could be let go at any time."
good,Management isn't great and is constantly changing. Yes. It's a business so it's all about numbers regardless of the actual work available or put in. Not a lot of opportunity to move up unless you know someone.
good,"Difficult to move up. Upper management makes it difficult to complete the requirements to advance. Too much red tape. The company is just way, way too big. You're just a number. They don't care much about the individual. They will get rid of you as fast as blinking an eye and then hire a hundred more people just like you."
good,"No matter how superior your work, an entry level will never surpass a previous employee who is returning at the same time. The will always have seniority, always get bigger % raises and $ raises, and can float through without effort. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but after a few years of this, and they're making $3 an hour more and think they're your boss because they have a higher code......"
good,"Very hard work.  In the field away from home for months at a time.  Not for everyone. All Weather.  Great co workers, management could use a kick in the butt"
good,The best part of working at Halliburton are the friendships you make. The good ol boys system is a real thing out there and you can make life long buddies at work.
good,"Halliburton will definitely take just about anyone, so if your looking to get started and have some education for the oil field it is a good place to start.  That's pretty much it."
good,Extremly poor management style with military attitude. Intimidation and bulling are common in Halliburton working place. Employees work under extreme pressure and constantly worrying about being fired without notice.
good,"When the economy got bad, I got a job with Halliburton. They were very eager to put me right to work at over a hundred hours per week. I kept my nose to the grind and worked hard and was very loyal. Then one day they showed up and shut the whole place down without notice."
good,management sucks and they have favorites if you mess up its automatic fire of employee management does not have the back of the employee they take care of the employees that live in that town
good,"It is a difficult lifestyle and would be for anyone who had a family.  I am in the field for weeks at a time and then home for weeks at a time, but still on call"
good,The company is great truly.So many good trainings and benefits but the districts are largely allowed to run as they please leading to some very unprofessional work practices and downright suffocating atmosphere. They concentrate so much on cost cutting versus doing more with what is available. This puts so much pressure on managers and causes them to act like jerks quite frankly. Everyone is so afraid of loosing their jobs they do any that is asked.
good,"Halliburton is a great place if starting off your oilfield career. They are proactive with safety, train their employees and have great benefits. The downfall is that you wont get premium pay, the hours are not consistent and you probably will never see your raises based on their so called ""competency system""."
good,very competitive work environment. good people to work with in high skilled trades . management task care of them selves and there friends benefit because of it. more contracted based to cut there costs on employees and make it easier when they have to lay people off . customers are fun to work with and help make the jobs easier
good,"Mancamp room is shared by 3 employees. They paid 25$ per diem that isn't enough in west Texas. Managers didn't care about employees advanced up. No training after 1 year with them. In general, I'm really disappointed with it."
good,"A typical day is waking up, driving tractors to work locations 150-250 miles. We rig up and down on cement sites.  We reset and then start the day over on a new site unless the workload is limited.  Sometimes as a cement pump operator, we work as a collaborative team to ensure that all operations are performed with safety and accuracy.  We do work in all weather conditions from extreme heats to extreme cold."
good,Long hours. Fast paced. Lots of money to be made if you're willing to put in the hours. Company pays for your CDL. High turnover so opportunity to move up.
good,"Halliburton (HAL) has a firm culture of customer service and profit. "
good,"I was the one responsible for training, fixing equipment, holding meetings about up coming scheduling. People they hired were friends of the management. They could not do the work right. I had to retrain and retrain. Correct the problems employees made. We never knew when we were finished for the day. I was doing all the technical work of High pressure testing over 15,000 psi. Also done all the magnet partical testing looking for cracks. also done all lltrasonic testing measuring parts thickness. Employees wouldn't show up for work that put the strain on the ones that showed up every da. I really liked this career but no room for advancement."
good,"A lot of work for no money . The people are nice and some work harder then others. If they paid just a fraction of what the other companies pay, they wouldn’t lose employees at all."
good,You give up all your time to the company.  Everything you do will be micromanaged.  The good is most of your coworkers bond like a family and make it fun.
good,"If you're looking to slave yourself away for a couple months this job is perfect for you. Work 12+ hours a day for 2 week hitches and can stay to work over if desired. Good place to learn about frac and oilfield in general. Top safety practices working with certain customers. Environment is very old school, full of ignorant uneducated workers. Its not what you know, its who you know if you wanna get moved up."
good,"Hard long hours lots of overtime. Poor management and not much room for advancement. The benefits are good with a lot of paid time off. Must work nights, days, weekends and holidays."
good,Good training program. Lots of field work to be exposed to the field and equipment. Have a mentor when hired on who helps show/answer and questions you may have.
good,"Very poor Strategic Sourcing Management was the major reason I left this company in 2011."
good,Empresa não apresenta um bom ambiente de trabalho.
good,"No real career advancement unless you are really close to upper management, they will change your contract on the spot as they see fit to save money on your time."
good,the job is a good one just bad decisions by management and supervisor needed more tanning i would return though if i had the opportunity  the work hrs is long
good,Days are long but the pay is phenomenal. If you are interested in the oilfield prepare yourself for hard work. It is definitely not for everyone. Benefits are also good as well.
good,Good company with great benifeits. But they leave one thing out. They never tell u your gonna take about twenty test in one week and if u fail a retest your out. So it's bottom line is they go to places were jobs are low and promise you the world then they say all u need is a cdl permit. Lol not true they get you there on your first day and say well if you fail a minimum of three test your out even if you pass the retest. Ok so here is the problem. You don't got a job so you gotta bum money thinking I'm gonna go have a great life in the oil filed. True only if your  good enough to pass all those test they tell you about after you get there. They leave that little detail out. And it can be a big problem if you quit your old job or go bumming money you don't got. Be carful cause those test mean studying four chapters in five hours then taking two fifty question test on it. So if book skills is your thing this is the job for you. If not don't go blowing you day job or barowing money you don't got
good,Halliburton offers a good wage and the opportunity to increase as you desire. The overtime available is equivalent to or more than 40 hours a week. The benefits begin day one and are some of the best offered anywhere.
good,"Training was great and lots of exciting professional work until HR gets involved with job.  HR has its 'good old boy"" mentality with their own agenda.  If you don't fit their profile, then they make your job difficult.  There is a basic failure to treat professionals correctly.  HR doesn't understand the concept of professionalism."
good,"Muy profesional el equipo conformado. Se trato de generar nuevas propuestas de pozos que permitiera generar incrementos del POES. Sin embargo, las conclusiones del proyecto para el campo Madrefil fue que solo se podría adelantar producción mas no incrementar las reservas."
good,"Buena oportunidad para desarrollar conocimientos en un ambiente petrolero, ofrece oportunidades a un costo de calidad de vida condicionado a tiempo demandado."
good,"Company was lack of employees with education/skills to complete there duties in work shop. Got tired of babysitting and showing other how to do their jobs, especially when they were my superior."
good,Employees are just a number unless you know someone or are a suck up. Compared to other similar companies their pay is lower but their schedule is a little better and the equipment is better which makes it safer. The employees that are good at their jobs tend to get stuck there and other get moved. Management likes to focus on the things that are easy to fix but don't really matter and ignore the big issues. Don't expect raises and if you get them hopefully they will offset the consistent region wide pay cuts.
good,"I finished up my college with a nice degree in Mechanical Engineering and immediately got a job offer for MWD Field Engineer in Oklahoma.  "
good,"Lots of training, but not much effort taken to retain employees.  Top heavy management makes making changes difficult."
good,"This is a service oriented company.  The engineers design and develop the new product and the sales team tries to sell it.  There is a lack of trust for employees are constantly competing against one another, so you will want to spend a lot of time researching and finding the facts before acting on any assignment. Leadership will ask the employee to present results, be prepared to tell a ""story"" putting everything in a positive light even if it is a lie. There is very little truth in what is presented to sr leadership."
good,"Excelente empresa para se entrar no mercado de trabalho e adquirir experiência, possui excelente pacote de benefícios, porém exige disponibilidade total sem levar em consideração vida pessoal."
good,OK- a lot of work not a lot of upward mobility is available for those that work hard and give it their all. More options to experience other areas should be more freely given.
good,Typically the day starts with a call from a coordinator with minimal information and facts. You are in a constant rush to do things with never adequate time to plan. Management it rarely helpful and demand you to complete tasks that are in fact their own responsibility. Halliburton used to be a great place to work and then the down turn happened and they became ruthless and cowardly. Managers would rather throw field personnel under the bus instead of taking the responsibility on their own.
good,"The pay at Halliburton was ok. I would work 6 days on and 3 days off 12 to 14 hour shifts. Considering the amount of work i would put in i would expect to be making more then i was making. I only got one 10 cent raise in two years with the company. Job security is non existent. I have seen countless amount of people come and go. And as in my case when the oil prices fell so did my position. There are a few good people that work with the company that actually care about their employees. But for the most part management is a joke. HR is a joke also, if you would ever go speak with them about an issue the whole yard would know within hours. I'm not by any means bashing Halliburton, it is a good company to work for. Although there are a few things that they can work on to make the company better for everyone that works there. Especially the ones who put in all the hours."
good,"Working in wireline each camp is different and managment is different, working out of the odessa,tx camp was a complete work should be your life cultural experience. The turnover rate while the oilfield was busy was so crazy you have so many new people coming and going. In 2 years of service i was a senior guy that was responsible for many things that technitions at other camps had never done."
good,"worked long hours, but never knew what was happening on a day to day.  Gave up a lot for the company but didn't get anything for it."
good,"The management team was poor and unprofessional at times. A few are great and solid but the rest are poor. "
good,"I have been working with cooperative and helpful people part of bad manager."
good,Halliburton/Baroid was a OK place to work for. There was too much time off between jobs and they were very deceptive. and the pay wasn't the best.
good,bulk plant cement sort and dump 50lb sacks of chemicals . loved the work 12 hr shifts 14 days on 7 off. managment had no clue what really went on in plant
good,"Job was easy, work conditions were horrible, management could use more training and job culture was horrible. Was interviewed and hired for one job, than at orientation put in another area."
good,"Always on location, gone for 2 to 3 months at a time with a week or 2 off until I left again.  I was a lead mwd engineer, never turned down an assignment for 4 years, was promised to be promoted to Directional Driller, but my coordinator did not want me to leave and tried to keep me as an engineer."
good,"A reactive rather than pro-active company. "
good,"This company from the outside looks like it can offer you a bright future. However when they do the interview process and the new hire process they roll out the red carpet and treat you like a king. However in a short while later you realize it was all fluff. There is no team moral boosting, if you want a raise or to try a different task you have to fight for it for a full year before they even consider it. Too many managers contradicting other managers. However this place has great benefits and pensions. If you can work for a sub-par wage, and great benefits, fighting for your small raises and work in a place that recognizes you faults before ever acknowledging your successes, then go work here. Oh and they say that safety is number one but they try to prevent employees from seeking medical attention so the managers get their safety bonus at the end of the year."
good,"I learned how to do accounts payable and receivable, as well as how to balance leger journals. I felt that they were there to teach you and help you grow."
good,"o trabalho em si é um pouco massante, chegava a cair na rotina em alguns periodos, porem existiam situações em que era necessario pensar bastante para chegar a uma solução rapidamente, por se tratar de prestação serviço na área de petroleo, cada segundo conta. aprendi a utilizar programas que nao conhecia. a parte de direção dos setores, bem como a direção geral nao se importava muito com as realizações e empenho dos profissionais, apenas com numeros. a equipe da qual eu fazia parte é uma das melhores da empresa, profissionais dedicados no serviço e sempre dispostos a ajudar o colega com duvidas. a parte mais dificil era a falta de reconhecimento, uma vez que eu, especificamente, estava em desvio de função, nao podendo ganhar promoção (que normalmente ocorre de 6 em 6 meses). fiquei por 3 anos na empresa e nao tive nem aumento de salario. Os momentos de lazer, na hora de almoço, onde nos reuniamos com funcionarios de outros setores para conversar, distrair a mente. ocorria tamem jogos de futebol 1 vez por semana era a parte agradavel do trabalho."
good,"My time at Halliburton helped shape my work ethic that I have today. My job role as a Field Materials Coordinator was extremely demanding. I worked in the Supply Chain group.  Inside of this group,  we handled all of the purchasing, logistics and storage for all materials needed for the various services Halliburton offered. All materials were stored in multiple holding facilities, ran within our group.  Not only did we have to establish vendors, under a strict budget, we had to forecast the materials while also reducing slow moving as well as excess & obsolete materials, at the same time.  My specific role was to ensure that all materials purchased were delivered to our facilities not only in a timely manner, but to oversee that we stored all materials within company and OSHA regulations.  I also conducted various site visits to preform cycle counts to validate inventory and to increase efficiency."
good,"lots of work, but little time outside of work. you dont make as much as you think."
good,A great place to start but you definitely don't want to finish here! Employee retention sucks its like nobody cares because they never do anything about it .The hours you get is why  people stay around not because of the hourly rate.
good,At Halliburton it is difficult to move forward with the company. The benefits are great. You will be working hard for you salary. I have learned a lot of managerial skills.
good,"Repair and maintenance all Halliburton Equipment"
good,"Shipped and received material, deburr material, used part washer,"
good,"any day other than cement job, we always perform equipment maintenance in stages, the least preferred is when I can not finish a job properly. The most enjoyable thing is to have a good team and good communication with the team."
good,"Good company"
good,"Always chasing after the emergencies"
good,"for the amount of hours you put in you can have a good paycheck how ever they pay terrible , unlike the competition starting out more around $20/hr"
good,"Good place to start oilfield career, very grateful that they hired me with no oilfield experience and sort of trained me."
good,Typical day at halliburton would start at midnight for me. Yes i worked nights at the beggining I loved it towards the end it started to take a toll on me. I did nights for a year the remanding of the time I was there worked relief meaning I covered everyones day's off. I learned alot about the oilfields while I worked for them. I can say that my most enjoyable part of the job was because it was an oilfield company. I was raised with my whole family working in the oilfield industury.
good,Great opportunities if you are in the right places and know the right people.
good,"You are paid less than the industry average for your position.  If you come to Halliburton with experience, you still start at the bottom.  No schedule flexibility and days off are not guaranteed.  Management will make you work extra days with little notice.  They do not respect your days off or personal time away from work."
good,"The field experience was valuable but at a cost of flexibility of hours, low pay, unclear expectations, and no clear development beyond the scheduled classes.  Mangers treated employees like a number, the entire time.  Very poor culture with no sense of belonging and constantly having to look over your shoulder in fear of being let go. Mangers kept increasing the requirements to breakout and get promoted from the previous people that had hired on, even those only hired 6 months before me. The 12 hour work days were daunting, but the field experience was very valuable to those who used it as a learning exercise everyday."
good,"Great company to work for and Hallibuton has some of the best world class trainings. "
good,"Great to work there. But management culture are laid off the most experience and valuable people to lower cost. Also, contracting oversees is not making our economy better."
good,You may learn alot w/Halliburton but when it comes time to be promoted they find ways around it so they dont have to give raises or freeze  your raise.
good,My experience my differ from yours. I worked at Halliburton during the oil and gas market downturn. 2015 and 2016 were especially rough on morale and career outlook. All those recruitment benefits such as 401K matches etc. disappeared. So things have stabilized now and your experience may differ from mine greatly.
good,Good job for the most part. There was days that stood out from others. I got to travel and see different parts of the state. If you are a family person this is a hard job because you are away more than you are home.
good,Was a good job but oilfield is a up and down industry. Looking for a more stable industry to work in and spend more time with kids. Prefer not to gl through temp agency
good,"Average pay, excellent benefits. Allot of good old boys mentality in management. Go fishing or golfing with the boss and get promoted! Some management was very good to work for some managers were all about helping themselves at there subordinate s experience."
good,"Working in the field as an MWD Field Engineer takes you away from everything that matters to you, but will make you a stronger person. If you stay working there too long you may lose yourself, your family, and your friends. There is no rotation despite what the managers promise. Work is typically 13+ hours a day in shifts for 3-8 weeks at a time with your time off being 1-2 weeks at a time. It is hard to plan when your time off will be til the last minute and how long your time off will be. While on time off you are given 12 hours to make it to location. Locations are typically between 30 minutes to 2 hours to the nearest town for groceries."
good,don't go into it expecting to retire from Halliburton. During slow down periods HR will go house cleaning looking for any reason to terminate employment.
good,Working in the elements a lot of manual labor heavy lifting the hardest part is rig up every thing then rigging it back down an doing it again and long hours
good,I had wanted an engineering job out of college and I thought I had found it. They constantly are restructuring and the expectations change so frequently that it is hard to maintain a good work standing.
good,"Empresa oferece treinamentos para os funcionários dedicados e benefícios atraentes, porém é muito pouco humana, zela pelos interesses da corporação apenas."
good,Good money just don’t ever get hurt or they will let you go. Also have to be weary of company acquisitions and hope your dept won’t be terminated. Management and company don’t care about employees they are too big for that.
good,Work is very redundant. Shop has a assembly line atmosphere with weekly and monthly goals to hit. Same thing every day and pay is not equal to output.
good,"Halliburton gives you all the training you need to start an oilfield career. If you have the patience to accept abrupt policy changes, and the ability to keep going in the worst environment imaginable, when all you want is to sleep....."
good,Halliburton has a phenomenal benefits package. They have to have this in place because its the only rewarding part of the job. This is an enormous company and you end up being just another number unless you are connected with someone higher up the ladder.
good,I work 136 hours a week. It's great if your single but I wouldn't recommend it if you are married with kids. Culture was fun but towards the end got ridiculous. It was a lot of labor and had to think on the fly. It was fun to work hard but not for the pay. I frac'd and it's dangerous but great if you respect the dangers.
good,They under pay all their employees. The work you put out doesn’t show when it comes to payday. They give you a hard time to climb up the ladder and get a promotion because they don’t want to pay you.
good,let Halliburton be the last place you go to for employment in the oil and gas industry because other companies similar to halliburton start out pay is way more than halliburton especially if you already have the experience
good,"The options for training in your field are plentiful. Be prepared to work many many days straight without a break if you are a field employee. Halliburton will underpay you, not provide the proper personnel required for jobs, and expect you to do the work of 2-3 people and pay you below average wages. The compensation and work/life balance are very unfair. Management expects you to not only do your scope of work, but they expect you to work well beyond the scope of your job description. You had better hope you don't have family emergencies or anything personal going on in your life because they will just remove you from the equation."
good,Worked there for 12.5 years and just about every other year we were wondering who would get laid off.  The job had great benefits but the work load to pay wasn't very good.
good,Pexima gestão atual ! Pessoas que só se preocupam com números e não com pessoas !
good,"good company with good incentives, poor management in some areas, more political to move up than work based. overall a good company, just would like better home life balance"
good,other workers are great to work with. management is not the best. you will have to travel the whole time working. you  work 2 weeks on then one week off. the pay is not enough for the amount of travel you have to do and job responsibility.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with Halliburton. I enjoyed my job,  when we had a good crew. Management seems to change a lot. Started with great management,  but it was a joke by the time I said goodbye!  The worst part was trying to get everything done with equipment on jobs two States apart. Also at Halliburton you are a number and that's it.  I called it quits when I was forced to lie on my logs. They harp on safety until it doesn't fit their best interest and get caught you're fired!"
good,I came to Halliburton for Health Benefits for my family. In that aspect there is none better. I don't have any time for a home life though. I can't remember the last time my work day was less than 12 hours long. There is a lot of money that can be made but sacrifices will have to be made.
good,Working for Halliburton you are just a number to them.  They are willing to fire the most experienced worker. I worked for over a year there with no manager.  They finally hired a manager and fire him a year later.
good,"a lot of stressful situations with other employees. good work environment but the pay is not worth it due to how much work is needed to be done plus stress of the job. Lastly, the job life/home life is not worth it either."
good,"Halliburton has good benefits, but is not an equal pay employer. I enjoyed working with others in my department, but there is still a lot of prejudice against women in the work place."
good,"Very stressful at times, but when the work load slows down, it becomes slow and boring. This job doesn't quite center around the employees, it's more centered around itself."
good,"You are easily replaceable to them as has been stated to me multiple times by management.  Not to say this company is completely awful.  If you can find yourself in the right place at the right time you can do ok, but don't expect hard work to get you places.  It's very much a ""who you know"" environment. They are so much about cost reduction that you typically end up burned out in what you do because you do the equivalent of three persons job without the appreciation or pay.  Internal turnover is high because the only way to get a promotion is to apply for different positions....  The benefits used to be the best part, but with recent insurance changes, the cost for the employees is continuing to rise... If Halliburton doesn't learn to appreciate it's employees a bit more, the benefits won't be enough to keep people...."
good,They work you to the bone with no regard for the balance from out of work.  you are nothing but an employee number to them and once you are there you feel that way
good,"From my experience at Halliburton, I have been exposed to a wide range of responsibilities that ranged from administrative to operations and even business development. My normal routine included operational tasks such as issuing and maintaining software licenses to clients (in UAE, Pakistan,Oman & Iraq). I was also involved in reviewing client contracts and ensuring the required support function approvals were in place. My job role also included administrative tasks such as arranging flight and hotel bookings for employees, placing requisitions for office supplies etc."
good,Halliburton provides tools to do well.  They do have processes in place to ensure a positive outcome.  It is a great place for someone just out of college.
good,"I loved working with the guys on the crews and most of the management.  There have been many changes some good some bad since the down turn in the economy!"
good,Darle la oportunidad a la gente para promoción de puesto y aumento de salario y no poner solo pretextos
good,"The job is challenging and there is a lot to offer. but there is no room for family they are your family, so if one is married like i am it strains ones marriage and  alone kids time. but the money is good. so one must learn to balance work with family.  hard to do!"
good,"The hardest part of my job is not the task per se, rather how to motivate my players to give their best while staying safe. It is not always easy, but when you achieve that, you enjoy a well done job."
good,"Halliburton is a company that when things are good, they are great. However, when things are bad, they are not as forthcoming as one would expect. The experience I had was a positive one and I really can say that I enjoyed my time there. However, one of the biggest flaws of oilfield work is that you go where the work is. That means you miss a lot of family functions and if you have a family emergency, you are not able to be there all the time. The company tries to take the ""good ole boy"" system of promotion out by using competencies as a means to promote fairly, but there are still ways that system is manipulated. Overall, it is a good company to work for but I would not work for them again because I value my family time too much. The pay is very low compared to other companies in the industry but is offset by the amount of hours worked and charged, so there is plenty of money to be made."
good,100+ hours per week.  Always on the road.  Never close to home.  Never see the family.  Easy job and good money.  You are just a number and reminded daily that you are replaceable.
good,"Halliburton is one of the largest oilfield service companies in the world.  it gave me the opportunity to work with many different cultures, nationalities, and personalities.  All were different and yet successful in their own right.  "
good,"Worked in the oilfield a long time. Like other oilfield jobs they are up then they are down. Halliburton pays well, works you hard and lays you off when things bottom out."
good,"lots of manual labor, long hours, travel out of state, rigging up/down location, operating frac equipment, safety standards, proper personal protective equipment."
good,Able to progress from entry level position to different job types. Good benefits package and salary. Strong teamwork exhibited by all I had opportunity to work with.
good,"This company is too big to review. I can only tell you about my experience and review my Experience. "
good,"Work long hours a day, hands on training and work well as a team. It is a fast paced environment that requires full attention to detail."
good,"Es una segunda compania de servicios petroleros en el mundo, con una dinámica dependiente de resultados de USA, país de origen"
good,"I can only speak for the production enhancement side of Halliburton. Frac specifically. If you live to work then this is a great place to be. But you will sacrifice every relationship you have and ever will have for very little pay for the hours you put in."
good,"empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, lhe proporcionava um vasto aprendizado onde aprendi mutas coisas que aplico ate hoje na vida pessoal, onde aprendi muito a conviver em grupo, com muitos benefícios, e sempre foi muito pontual no pagamento de seus funcionários  mas sem expectativa de crescimento."
good,Great Pay because of lots of overtime and great benefits.  But average work week is 70 hours with field hands doing even more.  Scheduled 2 weeks on and 1 week off but can be called in on week off.  Minimal Advancement opportunity.  Management knee jerks to any problem with fixes that generally cause more problems and more knee jerks.
good,Read the news it tells you a lot. you can only imagine. Pair that with my review summary title.Need I say more? Do not waist your time unless you just don't care about money or just want good health insurance.
good,"Its a company who believes in paying good and destructing people career as the management totally runs on buttering and politics. If you can keep your manager happy all means, you will rock here. Manager does not respect the work and they respect personal relationships to survive. Top management is spending a lots of money but middle management make them fool with buttering and politics and top management enjoy it too."
good,"My position was always travel based and on call. A typical day on site consisted of 12 hrs monitoring a computer inside a steel boxed in container, to make sure your down-hole data was populating right."
good,The work load is immense. There is a severe lack of people management. The chemists are made to manage engineers. These managers have no understanding of what engineers. This place is a heaven for chemists and bad for engineers.
good,"The pay is okay, the experience is great, but you may have a job today and not tomorrow.  It could be the nature of the industry itself, but its for that reason I'd never advise anyone to go work for that company."
good,Challenging  if you want it to be. management within the arbroath plant needs to be looked into. the ways of its always been done like this is still strong in this plant.
good,"You must learn on your own, lack of training, poor support from management.  Excellent benefits 401k, Health care.  Pay life insurance and 14/7 work days."
good,"The pay was great the work location was in North Dakota and in the end getting to work became an issue as they no longer offered the company flight that we paid for, which was the inital cause to look fo new employment."
good,"The work schedule is 10 days on, 5 days off with 12 hour shifts. Working night shifts and weekends are a requirement. In the first year a lot is expected during the training so work can be very stressful."
good,"Poor job security, when the price of oil is not good Halliburton cuts jobs like crazy, but to some extent that is part of the way the industry is. Work life balance is ok, you work long hard hours about 2/3 of the year, but then then other part of the time is completely free for traveling or whatever."
good,"Great Learning opportunity via HEI program where employee gain both technical and practical knowledge of the equipment such as the hydration units, the down hole blender, the pumps and the expendables. "
good,Management is constantly worried about how upper management perceives of them by pushing the techs and workers in operations to their limitations with unacceptable time frames for projects and builds. In turn very little reward or appreciation is shown to anyone below upper management which makes it a difficult place to personally grow and enjoy going to work.
good,"Put in a lot of hours, which would be good if you weren't on salary.  The compensation at the company isn't very good.  Put in a lot to train people up then for them to leave for a higher paying job with a competitor."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"No loyalty, they will use and throw you away. They are cheap when it comes to providing you with the proper tools to do your job."
good,Halliburton allows a broad range of roles for employees to learn and advance within the company when market conditions are doing well.  Management is supportive of learning new roles and promoting within where appropriate.  I enjoyed the opportunity and room for growth within the company.
good,"Very poor management on base no accountability and constant labor strikes by employees."
good,"Good advancement oppurtunitys, work/life balance."
good,"overall good, but pay is not good and they pay out small when or if you get laid off. do not go international with this company"
good,The management decisions to shut down a yard that was out loading a super plant was not the smartest move so this is what drew me to take the lay off as management was not going in the right direction.  The employees I was over were the best as they worked their butts off to get the job done and keep the plant looking great.
good,"Working at Halliburton energy services can be great or it can be one of the most stressful times of your life. This is because of the price the market for oil is very unpredictable. In this job you can work extremely long hours and be hundreds of miles away from your family for weeks on end and earn a substantial amount of money, or you can sit, wait, and pray that an oil company hires Halliburton to come work to extract oil out of the ground. Basically what it comes down to is, if you are working things are great except being away from home. If you are not working life is very stressful."
good,"a typical day was about addressing time sheet charging issues, project monthly forecasting accuracy issues, budget and cost issues, meeting expectations of upper management that didn't have a clue about what went on in the trenches. as the Lead I did not have co-workers the workers that were under my direction took most of their direction from my boss so there were Role issues as well. "
good,"It is a 14/7 schedule with rotating shift. "
good,You will receive great opportunities and experience but the pay is less than good and no personal time. Plan on using this place as a stepping stone for your career but be weary when making sure you will be compensated well.
good,"pay and benefits a plus. "
good,"Empresa com padrão americano, foco em resultado a qualquer custo, pessoas exaustas, alta rotatividade."
good,Job was not well paid compared to other Oil companies. Started with good hours and hours got cut. Job was not consistent.
good,".Safety"
good,They hire H1 B employees. Salary is lower compared to the markets. Men have better career path than women. In general no well defined career path for technical employees wanting to switch into management. Most coworkers don't care much about advancing in their career.
good,"Where I was located, morale suffered and there was an obvious ""invisible line"" drawn between employees."
good,Good job with excellent benefits. Downfall is being away from home and family a lot. Excellent benefits and compensation package.
good,I learned how to operate and engineer problems independently.
good,"As it is a integration process, each and every day was busy and so many things to do and to make it HAL standard."
good,"Although the job was very interesting, being isolated out in the middle of nowhere with no access to technology that allows you to stay in touch with loved ones takes its toll."
good,A typical day at work entailed quite a bit of work.  Management team was dedicated and competent.
good,Busca constante de crescimento perante as concorrentes e carga elevada de trabalho.
good,"Maintain electronic instrumentation to provide reliable well maintained equipment to insure service quality.  Promote safety awareness and environmental consciousness, and comply with all applicable safety and equipment to ensure service quality.  Perform routine and preventive maintenance of electronic and electro mechanical equipment.   Interpret electronic and mechanical drawings"
good,"es un buen ambiente de trabajo capacitacion constante te mandan en avion a cursos a villa hermosa reynosa te hospedan en buenos hoteles, la gente que labora aqui te ensena y ay un buen companerismo"
good,"People and training are good"
good,"A typical day what I want at work are quite situation but without problems in work we won't learn about how to solve the problem around, with problems we will learn how to handle problem without getting the problem again."
good,Great Benefit plans.  Good company for someone who is single looking to pay off student loans and start building toward a house and vehicle before starting a family.
good,"manutenções e testes em ferramentas de perfilagem,tive uma boa aprendizagem sobre segurança e a trabalhar corretamente com ferramentas,a empresa é muito boa porem a gerência deixa a desejar e acaba deixando o ambiente de trabalho um pouco pesado,os colaboradores muito competentes e companheiros,a parte mais difícil era quando tinhamos que ir cobrar para receber alguma coisa que trabalhamos e não veio no salario,a parte mais agradável era quando concluíamos os serviços e recebíamos boas avaliações do cliente."
good,"Every morning, as usual, we begin the day with a morning meeting where we develop a sécurité.Après about the meeting, everyone has a task to do or a group of people has a spot. In each work, the organization is an essential part of a job and it is not ambiguous made ​​by people with a sense of responsibility and self-control. When a job is well done, it rejoices all staff or the workforce."
good,"Working with Halliburton gave me the opportunity to aquire a CDL licsense and driving experience. When I first hired on, the recruiter said that I would advance rapidly due to my college degree. After working two years with Halliburton this never happened. I think overall they are a good company but misplace people with education in a more manuel labor type of position."
good,"gained international experience, communication with the co-wokers from very different culture, SPE technical paper work and presentation, not completed research type of work "
good,"Boa empresa, porém , poderia ser mais organizada, em macaé, eu acho que devido a todos os PSL's dividirem a mesma base, prejudica a todos. Deveriam fazer algo a respeito, melhorando também a logística de equipamentos, materiais e pessoal."
good,"Somedays, there's no telling where the work comes from. Other days, work is stretched to make the day go by. i have a better understanding of oil & gas by working here. Management, in my opinion, are horrible at their job."
good,"Challenging job with a great deal of variation, where no day is the same."
good,Good company but pay is at the bottom of all other companies on north slope.
good,It's a great company to get your start. They try to get the high potentials trained as time and budget allows. The big problem with that is that they are usually pushing you to the limit on time. Once a manager likes what you do and has any sort of clout with senior management then you will get locked into a position. It's all about what's best for the individual manager rather than the company.
good,"Good company, positive work environment. Training is very good, close obervers of cost and management. Compensation is very low for most positions, need to upgrade the payscale."
good,I have been at Halliburton for 5yrs and only gotten 2 raises
good,"Most of management decisions are made by people with very little technical knowledge. There are some very good and hardworking people there, but they are not the ones who make the important business decisions."
good,"Last Manager before shutting down Manufacturing is a joke. If you kiss his bu$&# you were part of his team, the guy was knowledgeable but likes gossiping, other managers at the location more worried about “relationships “ with employees that work. And she was a “good” manger."
good,"It a good place to work where you have lot of competition around you, which automatically make you smart enough to give your best and prove your existence."
good,"Halliburton is willing to offer many benefits such as housing allowance and top quality insurance, as well job specific training and licenses, but have a culture of strict unforgiving enforcement of policy on most employees and lenient indifference in others. I can't be sure what the overarching reason for this is, but I suspect racism and sexism are both involved.  I was paid well during my time at Halliburton, but still have the feeling that I was targeted nearly as soon as I was put on my first frac crew."
good,was laid off one day before my 20th year it was a good company but due to lose of work in the basin they closed the shop down halliburton is not in farmington  nm
good,I worked here for a year and a half. In that time I completed all of the necessary steps to receive a raise/promotion. Every time I asked about it I was told that there is a promotion freeze going on so that sucked. Awesome guys for the most part.
good,"Typical day at work: Machine, fixture and gauge design."
good,"The oilfield is not the same anymore and Halliburton are still going with the pitch of highly motivated workforce but do not think that this is the case. Same management talk and it is about profit, shareholders value propositions. Not a,lot about people and attrition is still high. If you worked there previously you are coming back for less money. If you thought you had perks then less so now. Same across the board. They are trying but not a vibrant place to work. It is only a job and don't expect career prospect unless you are prepared to live in somewhere"
good,You are required to travel a lot. You are typically away from home for 3 weeks out of the month. Women are not overly welcome throughout the various crews.
good,"huge established company"
good,"The atmosphere was great the company is not very appendable though. We had jobs then we didnt have jobs, our hours would get cut then go back up. Our callouts would change every week. Not a job I want to have anymore. I'm very flexible AMD can be but 10 years of doing that gets tiresome."
good,Employees need to watch there back when times get tough.  They will release the best and employees with the best knowledge of the business to save money if times get hard.
good,Very stressful place to work because everything had to be approved by several people up the chain of command in a staircase that hardly any good solutions would be approved because someone in the chain of command would nix everything. Very dependent on the price of oil.  If Oil goes bust they'll lay off instead of fixing the budgets.
good,Halliburton is a great company apart from the few not very good service managers  the workplace is  very good. I am glad to be part of Halliburton Family in the past 13 years.
good,"Depending on your manager, this job can be a lot of fun, or a real grind.  I have had both types of managers, one was awesome, one left a lot to be desired.  This job is oilfield, so if you aren't prepared to work 90+ hours/week, don't badmouth the job about that, because they didn't oversell that part.  A typical day at work can be picking up tools in -30 degree weather with a 40 mph breeze on the rig floor, it can also be 107 outside with 90% humidity and no breeze.  These aren't bad things, but you need to be prepared to utilize both your intellect and your back if you will.  I learned a great deal about directional drilling, the tools involved, and how a lateral well is drilled, as well as different mud properties, how different operators look at a problem and well control.  Halliburton's workplace culture can very strongly remind you that you're a pulse headed to a job location (again manager dependent), however, they do put a lot of confidence in you, which can be nice.  What I felt was the hardest part of the job, other than (cold) weather, was the constant ""up in the air"" schedule.  When you work rotational schedule, you are ""on"" for weeks at a time, and ""off"" for weeks at a time, which is truly awesome.  What's less awesome, is when you have no idea when these are happening.  I also thought the onboarding class should have more relevant information to the job I'm doing, as opposed to the most common jobs there."
good,"They say the reason Halliburton pays so much less is because the benefits are the best. I really could care less, the pay plus how much time you spend away from your family on top of the physicality of the job is not worth the 15 dollars an hour. Hardly ever get any raises and when you do its .70c. The Halliburton name used to mean more in the oilfield. Now they cant keep good hands because of the pay issues on top of hiring anyone off the street."
good,"I learned a lot and got a lot of us patents When my applications manager was forced to retire after 38 years I was fed to wolves. Some extreme racism and sexism. I always like the work and support folks some the best in the oil field, the office was another story. I was happy but always have stayed away from the wolf pack of youngsters. Support only young people in leadership positions."
good,"Typical days at Halliburton are usually always different. Sometimes the day is fast-paced, others it may be slow and sometimes the days are very stressful. I learned to work well with others and that no matter what job you are doing you will always have to adapt and learn to work with those who are around. Learning to work with differences in opinions, beliefs, and motivational effort is a difficult task but staying calm is the best approach. The workplace culture is usually a bullying system. Halliburton hires a lot of people who don't understand the professionalism that should take place in the workplace and those individuals are often bullied for their lack of company codes of business conduct. The hardest part of the job is being away from my wife and daughter for 14 days in a row. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a good working day where everyone is working together to complete a task."
good,"Exceptional training at Halliburton, but not so great pay. One of the largest companies but salary does not commensurate with industry with many of its (Halliburton) peers"
good,"Overall it was a good experience. I learned a lot about the industry, and the crazy schedules and pace of the oil field. There was not a lot of personal time, be ready to work a lot of hours."
good,"I was a Facility Engineer where I did structural and civil designs at the manufacturing plant and also worked on contractors which did the projects a the plant.  When the Engineering Manager changed, the company was letting go a lot of engineers based on engineering works was contracted where they assume it was a cost savings.  I left the company based on I would have probably been laid off my end of 1994."
good,"If you're looking for the ""gateway"" to the Oilfield, Halliburton is that.  They're a good company to work for overall.  The benefits are inexpensive and excellent."
good,"Ok to work for , great coworkers , get to travel to other states for work , can get stressful at times , a lot of overtime, schedule changes , too many paperwork to follow just to work ,"
good,"High Load of Work "
good,"Corruption at it's finest.  Worst organization I've ever been a part of.  I was a top employee who never refused any job, Always had myself squared away and competent.  I was rewarded with 3 layoffs!  Thanks for nothing."
good,"13 hours per day, 7 days per week for weeks at a time, living on location potentially hours away from home.  Work is either extremely slow (i.e. 5 mins of work every few hours) or very fast and stressful (i.e. rigging up and down or when something needs troubleshooting).  You work by yourself in a trailer on location with very little interaction so a lot of the time you are free to do whatever you want.  Very good benefits and compensation to make up for the non existent work/life balance.  You either lead the job during the day or work as crew at night, otherwise there is no possibility of career advancement at the field engineer level.  There is a very clear culture of time is money everything you do affects the bottom line.  Hardest part of the job is the monotony of the work, doing the same thing every day for weeks at a time.  Best part of the job is when you have worked with the same crew and co man for a while and you know what to expect and people respect you."
good,"A good company to get your feet wet, however working in the service side of the industry presents its own challenges.  Having to deal with managers demanding you fix things out of your control make it a difficult environment to work in."
good,"Halliburton has been a good company. The environment at first is relaxed and not rushed during training. But when you get into the shop as a mechanic, you are pushed every single day to be as productive as you possibly can be. You get told how much y’all suck in the safety meetings and makes you drag the rest of the day. The pay is good for the work. But, putting up with the politics isn’t worth it in my opinion."
good,"Generally well organized and typical of employers in this industry. Wages standard for industry, no benefits for contract workers. They do have some good professional journeymen working for them."
good,"Great company to work for, but looking for more time with the family. My present job I only work on oilfield equipment, and I want the opportunity to expand"
good,Working with Halliburton was the best experience I've had. Met lots of people from different areas. Worked hard and moved up quickly. I made good money and never had a problem working days off and working on holidays.
good,"Halliburton does offer proper training, fair wages, and good benefits.  However, this position is probably not the top choice for a recent grad looking for a desk engineer type of position.  Because out in the field, you will be expected to get your hands dirty; literally.  Basically, this type of work is not for everyone."
good,Difficult to have a personal life with the hours being worked. The pay is good with several hours of overtime and there is a lot of room to learn new things and move up quickly.
good,Benefits are good.  Working hours a little excessive but not too much to significantly interrupt your family life.  Limited career advancement once you hit supervisor.
good,Salary is not comparable to other companies. Work culture is really good at Halliburton. I worked there for years and advanced in job title but not much in pay salary.
good,Predominantly men so the females were ridiculously competitive. A lot of the men acted as if they've never seen a woman in their entire life. Felt like junior high all over again.
good,"I was contracted to work at Halliburton, with the implication that the contract was to EoY 2017, and likely to be extended through EoY 2018. "
good,experience was average. good company good benefits poor management. its all about money and thats why i left. quality of life is more important to me than money
good,"lack of focus on what the customers want/need. "
good,"decent pay, more hours than most other jobs, you will have an entirely separate family/work life and you will have to learn how to manage time when you are at home"
good,no advancement and very low pay. every project is late. but that is all part of field support.  little or no training made available to employees.  Reorganized 5 time the 4 years I was there.
good,"Halliburton, it's all about profits.  Upper management:  ""Safety is important, but needs to be balanced with corporate objectives"". Could say more...."
good,"I worked in completions as an engineer. I started after a short stint with an oil company, and moved here to pursue a career with more field work."
good,"A typical day at work is a day when when you load guns in GLF with all seriousness without any mistake, because there is no second chance in mistake on explosives."
good,we typically would work overnight. Had a great mentor that helped a lot. you would finish a long shift and go home and they would call and tell you lets go again.
good,"Good company to learn fundamentals and job security for people who performed well above average. Top level management is good, but mainly concentrated only in U.S. market."
good,"Oil field money!!!! If you like living out of a hotel and traveling and making money great career for sure, especially if youre single. Will pay for training"
good,All career & remuneration oriented benefits including work environment is below par than even average industry standards excluding the cut throat competition & politics which is above par than any other organization.
good,"""Broke out"" here in my oilfield career.  Obtained my CDL through the company and learned a lot while i worked there.  Work slowed down due to the nature of the industry, so I looked for other work options."
good,"typical life in the oilfield. slave away, usually with friends that become like brothers. family time is nonexistent. money is good. management is questionable."
good,SINGIII is relatively new and system is not well establish. Management trainee taking up new leadership but not in the interest of developing better process for plant but more towards putting additional surface work to appear good to Global. Relatively tiring job and hiring is very time consuming to 6 months for replacement therefore manpower is stretch when your team is already very lean. Location is far and medical benefit been cut since downtown. PAY FREEZE for Y15 and Y16. No news of increment for Y17 as of April 17. Variable Bonus Payout for Y14 - 2.5 ; Y15 - 2.5; Y16 - 0.8. Hope this sharing help interested candidate to make a choice of your own. Annual leave start at 14 days which is very basic.
good,Supervisors are lazy and unorganized. Lowest pay in the oilfield and supervisors don't back their employees. Way too may people in the office that should be in the field!
good,Undeniably the benefits are great maybe some of the best but while working there you rarely see your family or even go home. Overall it is a good company to work for.
good,"In my current job you are exposed to the many different elements involved in a drilling an oil & gas well."
good,"The company I worked for was actually purchased by Halliburton, and thus began the slide from ""excellent"" to just so-so. About two years ago, which is about ten years after I left Halliburton, the Calgary development office was substantially scaled back (effectively closed) and development shifted to Houston."
good,"“On Monday I begin by going over the list from the previous week, setting priorities. I review the progress of existing projects, then check the calendar to refresh my memory on the upcoming week. I like to meet with my staff early, mid and late week to discuss priorities, check progress, and then prepare for the following week. I want to make sure, as much as possible, that we can all dedicate to tasks that move projects forward, so I make habits out of organizational tasks for speed.”"
good,A good MNC to work for . Can do better on work life balance and management support. Good learning experience with strong company performances
good,This kind of work is not for everyone it is working out in all types of weather. It is also continues and nonstop work with very little rest and long work hours.
good,"Working here is okay but the organisation needs to understand that to improve one's services, the employees need to be trained and the foundation of the company needs to be strengthened. That overview is lacking and needs to be rectified."
good,"To succeed in Halliburton is to marry Halliburton. You must think about the job from the time you wake up to when you go to sleep. On vacation you will be checking your phone, answering challenges, trying to stay ahead of customer demands. There are not rotations, there is no time off.  It pays well..."
good,"I enjoyed my position with Halliburton (Mid-Continent Division) and worked countless hours to ensure all my job responsibilities and any and all deadlines were met.  The environment was  a fast-paced,  and high stress.  Numerous training courses were required yearly in regards to safety protocol among other training related to the oil & gas industry.  I was the Mid-Con Lead for training new employees and kept current employee's trained in the roll-out of Halliburton's new software program. Responsible for troubleshooting all issue's employee's had with the software.  Good company to work for, good pay with good benefits.  Enjoyed working co-workers. The hardest part were the countless hours required to do my job that took time away from my family only to be layed off."
good,this is not a place for family person its only good for a single person and your work goes and come. keeps you away from home days off will change at any moment
good,good place to work and nice people but no career advancement opportunities and layoffs like crazy right now.. the work is not too difficult once you get all the tools down. also a place i could see someone sitting at the same desk doing the same thing for 20 years.
good,"I would have remained with the company, however, they closed the facility and I didn't want to relocate.  I enjoyed learning about how the drilling process occurred, and was the first FEO to have 2"" iron installed on his truck"
good,"Great job when the oil and gas market is good. You can make lost of money when the market is good, by working 120+ hrs a week. Hourly pay is lower than industry standard, so when the market and the hrs go down so does the ability to make good money. While working these hrs there is no time for family. The actual job is hard work but lots of fun."
good,Hard enough to find and sell customers but the biggest challenge in this role was selling internally to win work.  The system and processes often proved too slow to respond accordingly and meet goals.
good,"Get used to worrying about having your job week to week. Great people to work with though."
good,Guardare indietro dopo 35 anni passati nel oil & gas è come sperare di poter rinascere ......mi ritengo fortunato di aver lavorato in questo settore per tutto quello che mi ha offerto .;.purtroppo  ora è tempo di continuare a guardare avanti
good,Management referred to shop employees as meat in a grinder. Worked there several years with no raise. I stayed for the benefits. It was the best insurance ive ever had.
good,"работа на должности инженера по буровым растворам, к сожалению предполагает ненормированный рабочий день, жаль что не работе два инженера на буровой. За год работы компания дала огромный опыт работы, но разнообразия быстро закончилось, лично для меня! Замечательный состав руководства, поддержат, не бросят никогда."
good,Decent pay with a bad view on the future of the business. Management is very short sighted and doesn't invest in employees.
good,"Good Company to grow with. Good core values and ethics."
good,"Employed as a mechanic but the position was not as it was first promised. the days should have been working on the various mechanical equipment in the company, 75% was working shift day and night carrying out welding work."
good,"Provide work orders for maintenance shop, answer telephone calls, assist vendors as well as mechanics, corporate american express purchasing card holder, payroll support, fuel man"
good,Empresa que oferece bons benefícios e mantém a visão e missão sempre impostas.
good,"The managers were given enough freedom to control culture, but had limited power to make necessary changes.  A good example is I had two kids at Halliburton.  The first one I got two days of paid leave, my second I didn't get a single day off in fact I had to show up to fill out paper work while on vacation."
good,Great company when times are good.  When the oil business fell it turned in to a very unsettling atmosphere.  So bottom line is it is too up and down and they lack consistency.
good,Great company get get started in oilfield industry.  Very poor balance of work and life.  Very travel intensive and long hours are the normal.
good,"The job is higher risk, but benefits are great. Very long hours, often 100+ per week. Management at the local level had high expectations of how often one should work scheduled days off, and any training was to be done on days off. 2 weeks on, 1 week off schedule. Company closed product line in region with little notice"
good,"Used to be a ""getting things done"" culture, but now it has changed to the opposite. Too much office politics thanks to the new management with ""GE style""."
good,"Halliburton starts its employees at a low wage regardless of experience, upper management are fear managers and have no real people skills, and they like to present false information to its employees, definitely needs work."
good,"Halliburton is a decent place to work temporarily if you want to make decent money, and don't have a family.  The management at Halliburton (Kilgore) is full of hypocrites, they preach safety and ""any has the right to shut the job down"" until its a high profile job or the supervisors want to ensure they get the job bonus.  My recommendation for any ""green"" hands is to focus solely on doing your job and getting home safe, keep documents of everything that happens, because management will close ranks when they are found to be in the wrong."
good,"Management did what they could to keep our comfort at best by meeting our needs if possible."
good,Great guys at the field level. A few good managers but for the most part a severe amount of unprofessionalism. Not a tremendous amount of room for advancement unless your in good with upper management.
good,I work for this company for a short time . I didn't like work place and I find out hard to advance . I  don't have much to say about this company because I work there a short time
good,Halliburton will expect long hours and hard work from their engineers during your work week.  This cultivates a mentality of work hard and play hard.  Once you are done with your schedule and on days off we completely disconnect and go enjoy our free time.
good,"Typical days can include: maintenance, housekeeping, preparing equipment, or picking up and heading out at any time for a job. On site the job is expected to be efficiently and safely completed, at minimal cost to the customer. MY knowledge of diesel equipment and general mechanical operation increased vastly. As far as management goes, the entire northeast division was shut down due to poor decisions mixed with product price dropping. In the industry, I encountered people from all over the world, and different walks of life, which allowed me to learn more about other cultures and behaviors. The most difficult aspect of the job would be needing to be available and ready to leave town at any given moment, however, I was able to see more of the country and do things I otherwise probably would not have been able to."
good,"I figured after being laid off I would be one of the first to get rehired. But in this case I was told by the HR guy in duncan that ""I don't have enough experience"""
good,I suppose it was a average place to work. I went from working in a small company with an office to being stuffed in a little cubicle in a leaky building. The money was good but management could have been better.
good,A typical work day in the field involves waking up at 3 in the morning and heading out to a job location that is usually 1 to 2 hours away. I would record data and monitor the job for about 12 hours before heading home. I learned the importance of engineering as it relates to Production Enhancement services. I have experience with crosslinked gel fracturing fluids and nitrogen fluid systems. I had great co-workers and managers that were always happy to help me with projects or something I did not understand. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling accomplished after a hard days work.
good,"Halliburton has many excellent employees, but the management is lacking in many areas, especially HR departments. Good place to learn how to navigate company politics and get oilfield experience."
good,I Learned to be a directional driller and got good training even through  the current hard times in the oilfield. A good starting point in the area of MWD and DD. Management has been tricky as it seemedevery month we had a new manager/coordinator
good,"One won't feel safe, top management seems to hide things.  Didn't have much freedom of thought and no transparency."
good,good company to work for but their one of the lowest paying company in the oil industry in wireline product line.
good,good company to work for but little chance to move around and learn more
good,Halliburton is very good company. I am Working as a Mud Motor Tech.All supervisor and co-workers are co-operative.
good,"It is a good company to work for, but it is very hard on the family, and very hard to attend school."
good,"Compared to the other divisions of Halliburton, you get treated like garbage. High turnover rate. Most people are just looking for the next best thing. "
good,They are a leader in the oilfield with the tools they use for directional work and MWD tools.
good,"To start off a regular work day is from 3 AM get to yard gear up for the job and equipment needed. Drive out to location once the task of Journey Management has been done.  Access the location of work and fill out all the proper paperwork for the processes that will be done like safety and work methods. Rig up the job using the proper tools. Pump the job and rig down in a safe manner that no one will get hurt. "
good,"I am responsible for creating the training plan, communicating and coordinating with other involved functional areas and implementing the plan.  I ensure that the physical schedule stays on track, results of enrolment are reported timely and efficiently and any problems along the way are resolved.  Once in receipt of all results of enrolment, I reconcile all enrolment records and prepare the  certificates for signature by Instructor."
good,Job is dirty and dangerous. The job involves hard labor  and long hours.This is a job for a young man that wants to make lots of money and spend little time at home.
good,"Some good experience to work with customer"
good,"if you are a worker in operations or maintenance, you are going to work your butt off. with the 2+1 schedule you will work 2 weeks on 1 week off minimum 12 hours a day. if you are out in the field, it can be an average of 13 to15 hours. in maintenance department, good luck moving up unless you kiss up or cut throats. management preaches safety safety safety, but when it comes down to it, its money money money. spectacular benefits package cant be beat."
good,"Compañía que ofrece posibilidades para adquirir experiencia en campo, con poco equilibrio entre la vida privada y laboral."
good,"I started out with no experience in the warehouse, unpacking boxes and handing parts to the people who required them. Gradually increasing my own knowledge of parts and assembly for each product service line. Daily SAP usage. Inventory control through monthly cycle counting. Eventually specializing in Completion tools, issuing materials as needed for sales. Recently learning to be back up materials for Bulk Cements Materials control. Learning chemical issuing and conversions for sales as well."
good,To utilize my potential in the right place and enviroment.The project is closed to an end.I Joined to make further performance progress.Worked hard and could fill full my duties and responsibilties.The frequent changes in management and and non technical decisions disturb the operations and create critizism.The hardest part of job when deal with disqualified key people.This would not prevent to make solutions and corrective action plan.
good,"This job has great benefits. Management is not the greatest. This job takes over your life. I was told by many that if you work here, expect to go through at least 3 wives so if you decide to work for this company then you can't have any problems at home, bar none, and your family has to have a strong bond."
good,Company to big your just a number great entry level way to get in the oil field
good,"They have good benefits medical, dental,vision, poor pay scale and management. Halliburton isn't what it used to be. Lowest paid frac department but hardest working men."
good,Worked 11 days on---3 days off.
good,"A typical day at work was entering new items into the system, ordering for customers, and helping with sales. Management was always there to help with any questions and my co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of my job was when we got a new system and had to learn it pretty much on our own. But I enjoyed always staying busy and learning new things."
good,"It's a good company to work for. Good training and compensation. They match the 401K. They have medical, dental, and vision."
good,"Former Cement SSII at the Brownfield, Tx Camp. Halliburton has a great group of Employees that work hard but are unappreciated most of the time. The market for these persons is slim. Other companys are offering great pay packages, to hands with experience just like the employees in This Camp. Halliburton will lose its Reputation for being the Best if they do nothing..."
good,Working 2 weeks on 1 week off is good money with the overtime. The budgets allowed for maintenance can run out and seems to be a lot of hour cuts at the end of quarters. Great coworkers.  Slow advancement in pay. Gone away from home more than I care for.
good,"Was a good job when it was just Landmark. Not so good when it became Halliburton as they took all our benefits away"
good,Not a bad gig.. was on the frac side. equipment was old compared to some of the other service companies we had around here at the time. Its the oil field so be prepared to hurry up and wait. its the nature of the beast in this industry. Had opportunities to travel to some cool places in Canada and USA working with some really great and really douchie people. I havent worked for big red for like 10 years now and still have some close friends that I still have in my life today.
good,"Competition in the Energy industry is going through major changes not seen in my 25 year career.  "
good,"Benefits are great. Some management, Leads, and Supervisors will not train or support employee growth."
good,"Under staffed in indivisual divisions. Long hours required, little time off with exception of vacation/sick leave. Benefits are great and the 401k plan and stock purchase plan are good, just very little work/home lofr balance, not good for people with family ."
good,Falta humanidade junto a gerencia e muita competição de chefe
good,"Oil is a volatile industry. There is a good chance you will be laid off at some point. They had to close a facility due to not getting customers. It will probably come back at some point, but the money likely won't be as good."
good,"As a Service Operator I (SO1) for 5 years before getting laid off."
good,"Depending on what line of work you’re in, there are a lot of hours. Job is consistent when the market is good, but when the market goes down there is always the fear of layoffs."
good,"Payed for cdl training, once you got licensed with tank and hazmat endoursment, they started you out at 13.50hr which really low compared to other companies. Work schedule was horrible n hardly got time off"
good,Good company to work for but new upper management is taking the company in a different direction. Very safety oriented and trains their employees well.
good,"A mix between lab work and the office, Halliburton offers a varied work life. With interesting projects coming in each day, each one different and specialised, you are always kept on your toes. With a fantastic, supportive team behind you, you are able to quickly learn new skills and perfect every day qualities such as productive time management and accuracy under pressure."
good,"This is a lonely job, not for married or family man type unless you need to. it takes a certain group of people to work for this company. there is no short of hours and they will work you"
good,"~Work from 6am to 6pm vice versa"
good,Too much time in the field -110hr work week with 30-60 days on and not enough compensation for slave labor. NO balance of life - your life is work and cry because they just cut your wages and benefits again.
good,"Big corporate atmosphere where you're another number."
good,"Management does not tell employees anything. Everything is decided last minute, nothing is planed out. No job security, managers are cut very easily. Had 3 different managers in about a year."
good,But in all was good to work for them. If you have a family understand that certain parts of the job requires you to be gone alot or work very long hours.
good,"I had a good work environment at my last location, but poor opportunities for advancement. There is a big change in company leadership, so nothing historical posted on indeed, prior to 2019 will be of any use."
good,"It could be a fun job without the child-like things that go on out in the field. Typical work day was making call out, go to Walmart, drive to location, frac, go back to your hotel room for 6-8 hours, rinse and repeat."
good,"work 7 days on 7 off, no advancement opportunity, pay is decent,but fluctuates with the market and you worry about your job security every 2 years or so."
good,"The pay and benefits are good. The management is really bad though. Most of the management team sits in the office and ignores their surroundings, having no clue what's going on or how to do any of the tasks. The only way advancement is available is if you are well liked. Hard work means nothing to them."
good,"We work on the field. the work pace is great, and Halliburton provide us with all the equipment and tools we need as well all the PPE require for the Job. The down side of the job is management. some supervisor just care about the job being done, and not so much about the one doing the work, unless they belong to the same ethnicity which is unfortunate. The service supervisors do not even attempt to interact with other employees, they only talk to the team leads. The culture is one where most employees really only worry about looking good especially if it means throwing a colleague under the bus. In conclusion, The company does provide us with all we need to do the job well, but the culture could get better."
good,"I worked with Halliburton for 3 years, during my time i worked for two PSL's both of which fantastic teams. I started right before the 2014 down turn and was moved to a new PSL from the first to keep my job secure - which was great for me since my time there wasn't going to be up yet. "
good,"Management people skills extremely poor employees morel very low it makes for a very unhealthy work enviroment."
good,"Very busy, lifting heavy parts everyday some management can't hire people with advanced Degree. The pay is very low, they have a say we train and other company pay good but not Halliburton"
good,Long hours outdoors. Spent more time with my colleagues than family. Overall a descent place to work with good benefits. It is a hard grind oilfield job.
good,"What to know:"
good,"Huge company, lots of benefits, pay is ok but is compensated with lots of overtime. this is a great place if you are not tied down and want lots of money, but you will have to give up out of work life because there is no time with 12+ hours daily. and if you take FRAC or Cement this could turn into shifts lasting days (yes you are paid for it)."
good,"If you have a good life with a family this is the wrong place to come. so much work away from home, they will work you to death but the pay is good. There is alot of politics here too."
good,"Would never work here again unless needed. "
good,"Working for them is the same general work. The job isn't difficult and is what I would understand to be the same for any other production company. But in any area I have traveled or worked, every manager seems to make empty promises. "
good,"Altos estándares de seguridad en las operaciones."
good,Me desenvolvi bastante através do trabalho que tinha e das pessoas com as quais trabalhei em equipe.
good,"Halliburton was a good place to work on an all around basis, overall work environment was good, job culture was friendly and compensation was good. Flexible work hours"
good,"Good Starter company to get your foot in the door, but does not pay well the turn over rate is crazy with the amount of people who quit on the regiar."
good,"constant management changes, no set raises or time, environment is ok, people you work with are great, it was good when I first started, very frustrating place, if you don't let it bother you I guess it will ok"
good,My job is one of many at potential risk to be eliminated and performed by someone in India - so I really have nothing more that needs to be said at this time.
good,"as stated above, typical oil field work, long hours."
good,Good place to start a career in the industry. Lots of different areas are covered. Training is good and thorough. Great place for someone who is just starting out in the industry
good,"A good place to train for future jobs in the oilfield, management is cutthroat and family worklife balance is near non existence for regular employees. Career advancement is limited to a select group no matter how hard one works or how valuable ones work. Someone else can always do your job in this culture."
good,"If its field work that you are looking for, than this is the best you can get as far as hands on training as well as academic training. "
good,Halliburtons internal frac software is bar none. The technology put into the frac equiptment is the best in industry. Halliburton claims to be worldwide but that doesn;t mean you go world wide at any point in your carreer. Locals are usually hired for cheap.
good,"At one time in 1967, Halliburton was located on East Texas St. and Benton Road, behind a Restraurant at that time named Kickapoo Restraurant and was an all male environment. "
good,"Great benefits, consistent work hours, employee stock options.  Management is aloof with little room for advancement, must be willing to relocate, many complacent employees."
good,"Nothing but praises from me working in Halliburton. There were ups and down but overall it was a good nature workplace to work for."
good,"No personal life... No balance between Life/Work... Salary, payments, and stability depends of OIl Market... No Schedule, no consider real overtime, Oil business keep cutting benefits"
good,"Working there you realize how mean and cut throat business can be. Competitors will gladly shank you and if not them, other departments at Halliburton will do it if it makes them look a tiny bit better. The sales team is like any other sales team, they will lie, cheat, and steal to get their commission, however here the payouts are much bigger and so bad behavior is much more common and nastier."
good,Halliburton is okay to work for. Its a huge company so there's a lot of competition for career advancement. Great benefits and okay compensation. Opportunity to relocate almost anywhere in the world.
good,"To start a career in Halliburton is good but after 3 years you have to move on, There’s not much career growth and compensation hike "
good,"I would not recommend this job unless you want to sacrifice your free time and go long periods without sleep. Great benefits, but management is the same as any other job."
good,This is not the place to be in right now due to the rollercoaster in the market.  You don't know if you are going to have a job from month to month.  warned
good,"pretty decent place to work .and nice co workers to work with ., hard place to advance , but steady work is a steady pay check , Managers , some .... are good some are a little bit more hard to work with."
good,"96 hour work weeks, great benefits, OK pay, no home life. The company has issues maintaining workers due to the lower than industry standard pay. training is good as well as benefits but home life is near impossible to balance with a 6/3 schedule."
good,"Very fast paced supply chain environment requiring quick action and very dependent on the price of crude oil . No two days alike . Experience is the key to making correct decisions as it relates to matching supply to demand. Work directly with field operations daily so you are always at the tip of the sword, which I like . The hard part was working with people  who don't have a sense of urgency that is required in this industry . I miss the action more thank I can say"
good,Ambiente laboral pesado. Solo despidos casi no había contrataciones. Difícil escalar.
good,"Long hours and competitive work environment"
good,Could be a cool/fun place to work. Facility seems to lack sense of direction. No direct career path for advancement. Favoritism is heavily present within this facility.
good,"A typical day at work: being in the lake "
good,es una buena compañia pero falta valorar al personal
good,"Halliburton was a pretty good place to work overall, but they did not pay well, often requiring you to take on responsibilities above your job title without proper compensation. getting a raise of any kind was an uphill battle. my main issue with the company was the supervisors/shop management. they are rude, and i saw quite a few examples of sexism, racism, and favoritism from them over the years."
good,"Good place to establish yourself in the Well Servicing market, great training dependent on you taking the initiative to learn and grow with the company."
good,Enjoy working in a safe environment and very friendly environment. Enjoy working. Family man. Like working with livestock. Like a safe truck to be driving. And I keep my trucks very clean.
good,"financially driven oil & gas service company, striving to secure its status at the top of the tree, weathered the storm through a strong and demoralising down turn, rebuilding the business for the future. hardest part of my job is being focal point for members of my team and trying to please everyone. Most enjoyable part of my job is helping our customers to achieve their goals in a safe/cost effective and professional manner, and knowing i helped in providing that service."
good,"Not a family orientated company, 100 plus hr workweek  was the norm for years, however it supported my family well for over 20 years"
good,"As a very large global company, Big Red did not offer a very good benefit package.  Management of the Landmark BU was in flux during my tenure with numerous Haliburton executive moving to guide the Landmark BU but managers lacked an understanding of software management and direction to steer software BU that aligned with objectives of Haliburton corp."
good,"The job itself is not extremely difficult, but the lifestyle that comes with it is hard on the body. Typically, you work 14 days then get 7 days off. During those 14 days, you work anywhere from 12 to 18 hours mostly sitting in front of several computers and driving. However, the benefits, overtime, job bonus, stock options, and average pay, is top of the line."
good,"The job itself is not hard. Just don't like being gone from home this long, they are making us go to 2 week on 1 week off schedule staring in October. I liked the 6 days on and 3 days off schedule better."
good,"Being a Mechanical Engineer, I am open to work for all core sectors. In Halliburton which is basically an oil sector i get to experience a lot of new challenges and responsibilities. "
good,"Huge global company potentially offers many opportunities for employees, but many layers of beurocracy and a ruthless corporate culture can make employment here frustrating. "
good,"No challenge. Typical day: Do your job and go back home. There is a culture of  this is how we do it this is how we have always done it. Laid back culture. Due to low  salary, no job security and no advancement plan people are not motivated to go above and beyond."
good,Baroid Drilling Fluids provides innovative drilling fluids solutions.  Dedicated professionals provide quality services.
good,"Overall position was good, limited to what u can do. Advancement kinda slow. People working with cannot be trusted. Benefits are good."
good,"Worked all over the global, meet good people from different cultures and made new friends."
good,"Typical day-"
good,"I have learned in my supervisor role how to effectively communicate with customers and how to perform in extreme conditions. I feel the most enjoyable part of my job would be the people that they have hired on, I spend a lot of time with them due to it being a twenty-four hour operation and they have all become family."
good,schedule is crazy but when oilfield is good you can make good money.Co workers are good to work with. safety is big here.benefits here are the best I have had.
good,The company is in a reaction mode verses a proactive mode. The oilfield is in a downward slope but prior precautions should have been taken.
good,Um ambiente bom de trabalho. Muitas oportunidades de aprendizado.
good,"Its hard to find information, everyone is hush hush they don't trust their employees, which makes the employees not trust management"
good,"Typical day varies. Could be on location for multiple days straight, then in the yard for 10 hour days. Management disconnected from their peoples skill levels and knowledge. Managements knowledge lacking in the operations of the typical day to day tasks."
good,"In normal times it is a great company to work for, good pay, good benefits and challenging.  The company culture can be challenging at times as the business thrives on competition between organizations, positive tension...  I've enjoyed most the management team and people I've worked with."
good,"A Typical work day consist of driving anywhere from 30 min-3 hrs to location on your first day and .5-1.5 hr drive everyday after that. You wake up anywhere from 1 am - 4:30 am depending on the above travel time and when you are starting your 12 hr shift. Once on location the time varies greatly depending on the people out there. Environment can be fun, entertaining, and insightful or belittling, awkward, and uncomfortable. Very little appreciation."
good,"12 hours work time "
good,Call outs for jobs are anytime of the day and any day of the week.  Could be on an oil rig for days and sometimes the conditions are very challenging.
good,My job was to service accounts/ search for new opportunities in an area where Service Centers has been closed to deliver seamless service from main Service Center(Odessa). I had to be self motivated to make contacts and show Halliburton's commitment to area.
good,"Very little internal development. Above average pay. Great co-workers. Oil & gas market is very difficult right now. Some managers really care, others are pretty self-centered and your career could depend on if you get a good one or not."
good,"A good company overall. just on the inside with the new yard I was at was very unorganized, understanding that it wasn't going to be smooth all the time. The management often didn't know what was going on or was late to relay the messages or jobs down to us. there for making us always running around at the last minute trying to get the right tools ready for the job and causing us to be late sometimes. looking bad as a team overall"
good,"Admittedly, the upstream energy industry drives Halliburton's business. My work was mostly on call, which meant I had little idea when I'd be home and when I'd be away. I couldn't plan much, and was often required to depart for a job half a state away, or in the Gulf of Mexico, with less than 12 hours notice. Also, in my line of work, technical and educated employees were often subservient to those who had little schooling, but had drilling experience. The pay was pretty good, which is why educated people accept these conditions.  Benefits are good, including ESPP. Naturally, if one is working in the office or on a scheduled rotation the uncertainty about scheduling mentioned above is mitigated."
good,"Beginning at 4a.m. I leave to go to a location 3 hours away and work until 7p.m. then get home at 10p.m. This would continue for fourteen days in a row, and then I would have a week off. Extremely tough work schedule"
good,"miss organization every where too much facilities but no body knows how to deal with that and how to use it."
good,"Working for this company I realized one thing, it's that they felt that just because they would supply all the employees with all of their supplies.  Such as uniforms and class A license courses, that they owned you."
good,"While working at Halliburton I was a basic secretary who was instructed in every responsibility. Secretary's at my level had a lot of direction from the attorney's the supported. There was not a lot of variety in responsibilities, though there was more than enough work. "
good,Aprendi a trabajar con chicos y relacionarme con ellos a traves del idioma ingles.
good,La exagerada apuesta por los procesos hace que la agilidad operacional sea muy baja. La capacidad de respuesta es muy lenta ante algunos clientes. Los procesos de promoción no son llevados a cabo de una manera clara. Un gran grupo de profesionales que no tiene un liderazgo claro y fuerte.
good,spend most of your time away when work is available. lots of training. excellent  benefits.  safety safety is a first. little room for advancement.
good,Support end users as need requires. I take walk-ins and phone calls or assigned tickets and complete the task as needed. Work will a great team throughout the region who assist one another on issues if needed.
good,"It was my first full time job with Halliburton. I learned a lot about the related technical field, management and real-time operations. Most co-workers were friendly and supportive. Intense part was working in long and irregular hours with new trainees and trouble-shooting. Getting the project completed was the most enjoyable part."
good,Excellent company to work for with good benefits and as with most larger companies some good employees and some not so good. Work hours were pretty relaxed.
good,"I worked with Halliburton for 5 years, making my way from a Operators assistant to a Supervisor and made a good living doing so. The downside to all of this is that there is no time for having friends or family unless you count the guys you work with 120 hours a week."
good,"Workplace is ok and benefits are average."
good,"Having worked as a mudlogger on both land and offshore jobs I’ve had the opportunity to gain a deeper insight into different rig and drilling operations. I was fortunate enough to work with a variety of major operators and learn from their operations and safety programs. I lay a great emphasis on adherence to safety protocols and have an injury free track record in the oil field as a result. As a third party contractor on the job, I value customer satisfaction and execute my duties keeping in mind the impact my work has on repeat business and the image of my employer. As a petroleum engineer, I enjoy keeping up with the latest industry trends and technology. I am an avid soccer fan and try catching up on European league matches in my free time. I also enjoy reading books and watching movies"
good,"-plenty of hrs -good training and safety courses, learning experience"
good,"good place to learn and advance, but my department does not offer a lot of work life balance opportunities."
good,Great training. Great coworkers. Hours are hard to track and there is not a good work/ life balance. Good attention to safety.
good,"I could not have asked for a better crew or better immediate supervisors but the actual people in charge that make the changes the actual workers have to endure are not people who have done the job and know what its like, rather they are people with a degree and only know the job on paper."
good,"Halliburton will pay you very very well with little education. Depending on the job you take, they will give you a CDL for free and you wont have to wait to get your medical benefits."
good,"Multinacional Americana de grande porte – Segmento de Óleo e Gás – com grande excelência na prestação de serviços, com gerência Financeira altamente qualificada, possuindo ambiente de constante pressão em busca de resultados financeiros, impactando diretamente nas relações entre os colaboradores da organização. Saber trabalhar sobre pressão, ser dinâmico e pro-ativo são ativos que a organização agrega ao trabalhador."
good,This is overall a great place to work for anyone in security.
good,"Start early and end late.  Send callout to crew, be at callout early and then handle call ins and document.  Send employees to equipment I assinged them.  Fix problems with unit before leaving yard.  I learned that being in charge is non stop and every employee is at a different point in their life.  Situations are unique in circumstance and should be treated individually if possible.  Co-workers are the best part of the job.  Sometime you see them more than your family and that essentially makes them family.  Take care of them and they will take care of you.  The time away from home."
good,"Good to get a start in the industry. Low paying, not much of a future."
good,"A Halliburton é uma empresa multinacional muito dinâmica, com ótimos profissionais e onde fiz um network muito rico e importante para minha carreira."
good,"On a daily basis I braze repair drill bits. My schedule is currently 4am-4:30pm. Various tasks surrounding braze are: visual inspection, tip grind, braze prep, final grind, quality control, bit paint and various others. Co-workers are great but management has no desire to improve employee's pay or knowledge. Brazing is probably the most technical part of my job, but with experience it becomes second nature. Best part of the day is perfecting my technique in brazing."
good,"Handled customers problems by engineering solutions."
good,Working for Halliburton is a fun experience that can produce great compensation and advancement opportunities!  One ideology that Halliburton teaches are to make yourself relevant.  I have learn a great deal about personal promotions and communicative abilities.  great company for seasoned and entry-level job seekers.
good,Seeking othe work because work here consumes your life. Pays very well though.
good,"attend morning meeting"
good,work schedule was random. one pay period nights next days onsite schedule was hit n miss.
good,"This is a company that demands all of your time. There is no life work balance. Though they say that the pay is in the 95%, that is for frac hands not educated trade. They pay next to nothing in comparison to the industry standard but you can work 120 hours a week to make up for it. The benefits are better than most companies I have seen, which is a plus."
good,"At Halliburton I was on a 4 week on and 2 week of schedule which was different at first but I came to enjoy it. I learned a lot about the oil field and high pressure pumping during my time there. I did not find the job was as physically challenging as some had said it would be. I always enjoyed the time I spent working along side my co-workers, I have always been a very social person so that was probably one of the best aspects of the job.  Probably the most difficult part of the job as I was a member of a group that traveled from crew to crew as a special service division was dealing with second set of supervisors, first being our supervisors in Duncan OK and the supervisors where we have been sent at the time which the two groups never seemed to see eye to eye and we were always caught up in the middle."
good,"It was a good place to work. I worked with good people, and got along well with everyone. They are safety oriented."
good,Ok place to work.  Hours wasn't like i was agreed upon in job offer.
good,"Tear down, cleaned, rebuilt and test Down Hole Tools. Monitored all parts, requested parts for inventory. Would upkeep, inspect all equipment used and kept maintenance and inspection records on all individual Service Tools and any equipment that requires yearly certification/qualifying. Local management was more than willing to help in times of need, but were hampered by a District Management that preferred to add job duties to overloaded employees, rather than rehire for positions or promote other employees. Work was rewarding since you directly impacted customers and return business with quality work. Being the only full time person in the shop, and covering two to three locations can be overwhelming. Local management not having final say in ordering replacement parts effected work output. Work required to be on call 24/7."
good,"Worked for Halliburton in Houston for almost two years and slowly watched the work load drop due to outsourcing design work to India. Even with the errors and rework issues, the outsourcing continued. Very sad to see work sent to another country to save money and ended up having to be corrected in the U.S. Several of us lost our jobs this year because of this."
good,Sometimes its a comfortable working environment and sometimes its not.
good,"MWD Work, In Field Tool Preperation and Maintenance. Great Pay long hours and inconsistent work schedule."
good,"mantenimiento y lavado de unidades, chequeo pre-salida a pozos."
good,long days or nights fast past learn to multitask. learn to handle customers. make sure we had materials at all times not to run out
good,Not a very good place to work. One of the lowest paying petroleum services jobs out there. Management treats you as a number rather than a person.
good,A empresa nos ajuda no crescimento do funcionário com cursos e aprendizado na manutenção das ferramentas.
good,"O funcionário deve se dedicar exclusivamente para a empresa, visto que passa a maior parte do tempo na mesma."
good,Worked under extreme weather condition with little or no days off
good,Managment runs things very lean. Staff turnover is an issue.
good,Working as E-Tech for this not bad for a person that doesn't mind being away from home and it's family for at least 2/3's of the day.
good,The work life balance was not good I was working 2/3 months at a time with no break
good,"La recomiendo es una buena empresa como todas hay falencias, que debes saber manejar, para evitar que se te convierta en una mala experiencia"
good,"Excelente empresa no periodo que trabalhei na mesma,no momento eu não teria como avaliar,pois estou afastado da empresa a muitos anos e ocorrerão várias mudanças."
good,"The job I started with at Halliburton was a hands-on, rewarding job that I enjoyed. The more time I spent with Halliburton had me moving up the ranks of the company and running into management of the company that is not involved in the daily operations of the business. This did cause issues that could be worked around for a while. Ultimately, the company started loosing business in the area in which I operated and I was given a choice to move or quit. I decided to move departments, but was unable because of the down-sizing of the comany in the area."
good,"Halliburton offers a range of positions, but mine was Frac operator. It's hard work, long hours, and the field supervisors don't have any regard for DOT regulations. I was asked to fudge my logs regularly. Other than that it is a great job for a single guy."
good,"Good bennies, management needs help, I haved learned how to work on high pressure pumps, rebuild valves. most of my co workers are good guys. the long hours, 80 to 100 per week, When your job is done and you know you did it right."
good,you never know what to expect for a day of work
good,"My time spent with Halliburton was interesting to say the least; I did learn a lot of skills to take with me to my next career, but there is a lot demanded out of you with little to no recognition or advancement."
good,I started back in 2006 as a shop hand and later worked my way up to management. I made good money without a degree. I just had to work hard and follow all company policies and procedures.
good,Worked from field to international field to management.   some great people there...others not so...You must find a good trustworthy group to be happy there
good,"I would set up employees a job task first thing when the shift started"
good,"Halliburton field positions are generally in the middle of the compensation range for the industry. But, as with almost all position in oil and gas, work/life balance is poor. Expect to be away from home two weeks at a time, and home for only a week. One advantage Halliburton has over competitors is the training."
good,Good place to start to get your foot in the door with a solid oil and gas company.  I refuse to speak negatively about anything that could have an adverse effect on my current career search.
good,It was a great internship experience. My mentors were awesome and helped optimize my learning experience and gain knowledge generating earth models. This experience opened up many different opportunities for me.
good,"I had fun actually working here, but beware this isnt a stable job and dont let them lie to you that you can turn this into a career, youre just a number here, BUT you do become close with your crew, you work hard but you can make plenty of money if they let you get over time, I would def go back but something for easier than frac, the man camps and food where actually decent oh and Some of the supervsior are disrespectful!"
good,"Was a great company to work for benefits are some of the best out there. Was really disappointed to be let go due to relocation especially when I live fifteen minutes from the new location,  but they did offer a decent severance."
good,Job scope is limited and do not get to interact with many parties. However work always ends on time and there is a shuttle bus to and from work. Good work life balance.
good,"Due to a volatile industry, Halliburton is continually forced to make difficult choices and these choices dictate management, not the other way around."
good,Great job to work for just some of the worst people they have running it good money also but the hours are terrible if you don’t all that then give it a shot
good,There are many great things about Halliburton but you are a number and need to kiss the right butts for advancement.  Starting pay is really important because no one gets a pay raise so people finally quit.  Great benefits and you can learn a lot before moving on with your career.
good,You will be the best asset to the company when the work is flowing when work slows down you won't matter. You will work 12+ hours a day for 14 days straight.
good,Based in Aberdeen but worked in Kuwait also. Rotational work when overseas but normal 8 till 5 working hours when in Aberdeen onshore. Position fell through due ton the Oil and Gas crash inn 2014/2015.
good,I enjoyed the job at Halliburton very much. The job continued to challenge me and was willing to meet all challenges. I moved up very quickly however due to the market I was laid off.
good,"Ups an downs, when good its good when slow/bad layoffs tend to happen.Shifts vary travel is required. Often away from home. Many changes over the past 15 years"
good,Not a steady work place..went through 3 layoffs in the time I was there...stayed till the last major layoff...not good pay for experience .left with a two week notice
good,"Again,  there has been so many people come and go, from this place. why would you ask for a review,i believe it can speak for itself, and doesnt need any help"
good,I just recommend that you just do your job and get alone with your coworkers mind your business don’t be lazy listen to your supervisor or whoever in charge
good,This is a starter company. Get all the frac experience you need. Once you have a year or two under your belt go to a place that pays better an treats you better
good,"great co-workers mechanic's"
good,"Poor culture overall. Very disappointed with career progression other than following a sales route."
good,"Stressful Environment"
good,"The company has become more internally focused by less personal attention to clients and driven by processes and software."
good,"workplace is business casual, working as a team, working with great co-workers, learned about the oil and gas industry, interesting, stay busy at work"
good,should be more focused on frontline employees.  Too many meetings sometimes management is more focused on their own path forward.  Politics gets in the way of decision making that is relevant to the revenue generators.
good,"A work day, start with good job plan and safety attitude. everyday we learn something new, safety and job quality deliver is one of the key for company success. the management needs to provide the necessary support to the employees by giving them training and equipment for the designated job. the workplace culture needs to be best possible where the employees helps each other. I do not think that exist any hard part of any job if you have the required training and support, because if you have any doubt you should ask somebody else and not assume that what you know is the right thing to do. the most enjoyable part of the job is delivering a safe and good quality job to the client, the filling of ``job done´´"
good,Fast paced and high stress job. Its production so everything is based of how much money you make the company as a whole. Hard to get raises. High turnover rate
good,"Good benefits, below average pay. On the job for 10 days then home for 5 days. Poor communication company wide. Paid baby bonding leave up to 8 weeks."
good,"too many people complaining about pay, visited several crews and nearly everyone regardless of experience is concerned about pay.  Even some of the most experienced and some that wee doing ""treater"" job had never gotten an increase"
good,"Good place to work, but not much training. It will depend mostly on your manager your experience, big company, not much work life balance. A lot of travelling might be involved"
good,"Company has a reputation of hiring many people and then laying them off. I was laid off due to a down turn in the market. The company has a good training program for the engineers, but the job security is not good."
good,"Halliburton provides a good working environment with training and personnel development. It complies to health, safety and environment policy. It has a better benefit for its employees and provide opportunities to work around the globe. Recreational activities in Halliburton is poor and there is no room for table tennis, swimming pool, football field."
good,Payment to short for the amount of work that you do. When another companies pay more. It’s a good job to start but not to remain like forever. Try to get the most that you can from this job but it’s better if you can get another later.
good,Sometimes difficult place to work.  Objectives and goals were not always clear.  Pay did not match work responsibilities.  Old guard versus New mentality very prevalent.
good,Its a good company to get your start with. The salary is ok and the work environment is good. They do a good job of training employees for growth. The vacations could be better and pay raises would be inline more often.
good,Great sense of family/team within our crews. I joined right before the downturn of 2015 so my stint here was short as our entire yard was shut down shortly after I started.
good,"I was on call most of the time, whenever there was no job call out it was a normal work day.  The hours where good the pay was good, but you would work for that pay check."
good,Great company to work for.  Lots of traveling involved and plenty of overtime.  Work 14 days then off for 7.  If you don't like being away from home then you won't enjoy this type of work
good,The job is really rough if you arent experienced or prepared for it. Can work upwards of 100 hours per week. The pay doesnt really seem likeit is enough when you are starting out. Also you can spend multiple nights sleeping in a truck without showers or resupply of food.
good,Good spot to work at was in there warehouse and got trained slowly but surely to do all that was required. Let my self motivation move me to my office position and my hard work did the rest. I was moved from one thing to the next all based of me showing I was more than capable of doing the job that was being asked of me to do.
good,"inconsistent schedule and rotations, daily duties and tasks are within a reasonable amount, communication with management is fair, short on staff at the moment"
good,Very good place to work if your young and without family the job is fairly easy to keep if u can stay off your phone and show up on time and be able to go anywhere in the United States with a few hours notice
good,"Revisión de contratos"
good,"Typical day of work was spent mostly in meetings, replying to emails, training new employees, performance any technical activities needed in case of equipment failure/malfunction."
good,"Too many meeting for daily production, more worried about daily output numbers / profits than quality work and appearance of safety than actual safety"
good,There was not enough work at the time and i had no where to better myself. They are doing good now and Im sure it is a great place to work. The benefits are great and stock options is a must.
good,A day in Hydraulic Fracturing was typical of well stimulation for the production of oil and natural gas. Maintaining control of Oilfield monitors in a time challenged environment and unexpected delays.
good,good work condition great co-worker got alone good with every one only draw back i was not used to my fullest protension  not willing to try any thig new
good,"like the title says, it's Halliburton. They train the oilfield, you'll be a number amongst thousands. really not much different than the other large service companies. If your looking for a job, chances are good you can get on with them."
good,Company pays well but doesn't put much value on family life. Will lay off as needed.You are definitely a number and not a person. A typical oilfield type employer.
good,"Halliburton has provided various type of HR Tools"
good,Halliburton bought the company that I worked for and the company that was bought had bought the previous company that was very small in size.  Therefor the ability to make independent decisions and see the fruition of those decisions did not exist.  It was a very structured environment and control was completely maintained at the top.
good,"Seasoned cementing Field Specialist and certified drilling fluid Engineer, with more than a decade of practical field experience spanning Land, Swamp, shallow offshore and Deep offshore Oil and Gas drilling operations. "
good,"Overall, Halliburton is a cool place to work. Working in IT allowed me to learned a great deal and the projects I was involved in were varying in size, scope and technology; provided exposure to the various Product Service Lines (PSLs).  I always remained at full capacity. I wouldn't mind working there in the future."
good,Great company and they work with you and they give you training. The crew you work for is outstanding and very good communication. I will totally go back to Halliburton once they rehire.
good,in all the place was great i probably would still be there other then the fact i had some personal issues that the job didnt help with great benefits tool allounce
good,"Halliburton provides a good working environment with training and personnel development. It complies to health, safety and environment policy. It has a better benefit for its employees and provide opportunities to work around the globe. Recreational activities in Halliburton is poor and there is no room for table tennis, swimming pool, football field, etc."
good,"inspect tractor for any defects, check all fluids and re-fuel if necessary. inspect sand trailer, check all tires for proper inflation and under carriage. Load sand trailer with proper mix and  deliver to location."
good,"Used to be like family, but corporate in Houston has all but destroyed that dynamic. Watch out for yourself and you'll be fine. Don't believe a lot of the hype started by the corporate propaganda machine."
good,compañerismo y equipo de trabajo. profesionalismo y dinamismo
good,"Awesome group of colleges, you are able to travel the world but just like any other large company everyone is replaceable when the price of oil is more of a supply than a demand."
good,"Personnel are promoted based on them wanting to leave the company. ""You want to leave? Here, take a promotion."" Ridiculous!"
good,"Halliburton has safety culture more than enough. Not compromising with any code of business conduct."
good,"Good Training. A little relaxed on safety. Especially overseas. Once your training, leave and utilize it at another company which pays better. Stock purchase plan is good."
good,"Overall the job is interesting and challenging. There are some smart and creative guys you can learn from, and also many chances you can contribute to the company."
good,I would recommend this kind of work to a young single individual. Work the long hours and gain the experience when you are young. It is very hard if you have a family.
good,"Start work at 7 AM.  Wait on transports to come in to be loaded, and/or wait on a vendor to come in to be offloaded.  About noon or 1 go out to the yard and take straps on all new transports.  Come back to office and email report.  Note any damage or leaks."
good,Worked there for over 35 years and lived my job. It was stressful at times and sometimes management did not make it easier but I learned a lot about business and customer relations while I was there.
good,You work a lot of hours. They do not give raises in 3 years. Your Job depends on the oil economy. The Benefits are amazing. Management depends on their moods.
good,"offshore environment away from family, pat is decent if you are single. depends what department you are working with and if there is consistency with schedule."
good,"Halliburton is a huge company and it is concerned more with the bottom line than its' employees.  Of course, that is par for the course in business.  I wouldn't work there again."
good,"Good Company"
good,"Busy days interacting with multiple departments. Management in my department was excellent, but not all department are the same. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, They took pride in their jobs."
good,"nice place to enjoy life and people but not seeing career advance"
good,Typical day involved reviewing well schematics and dealing with the business development reps while trying to decipher what their need was. Workplace culture was sub par.
good,"Money is to be made. No question there. You will be away from your loved ones. You will miss holidays and depending where you live; you will be exposed to gnarly weather."
good,Dangerous job have to be on your toes at all time. Work in all weather and environment. Have to be able to drive an 18 wheeler and be on call 24/7  good benefits
good,"When I first started with Hall. as Field Professional II, I had a plan to surge up to Field Operations Coordinator (Drilling Fluids) but the drop in Oil price shattered my dreams."
good,"- Learned a lot about circuit layout"
good,Everyday is different working for Halliburton. Some days are very busy and some days you do nothing. Days always start off with a safety meeting and then depending on many factors your day can go a lot of directions from there.
good,typical day starts early in the am. I learned a lot about geology and what different formations can produce. management seemed to forget what its like working in the field vs. the yard
good,"Fast paced environment with flexible time schedules.  Field offices need an opportunity for advancement and training."
good,Many layoffs but it was a secure place to work. Good benefits and insurance policy. There was a collaborative staff which worked worked well together.
good,Business was moving fast and I was just hired on. Things were going great. But then it all slowed down. Soon people were getting laid off or fired. Then I was called in to be let go
good,Never knew what you were going to do next. Nothing seemed to be organized. Had good foreman but bad upper management. Fast paced and long hours. Good co-workers though.
good,Have very good people working there in the field always ready to help each other out willing to do just about anything to help but the management is another story
good,"Halliburton heeft veel mogelijkheden voor werknemers om zich te te ontwikkelen mits medewerker zich daarvoor inzet. Er wordt grote inzet verwacht. Medewerkers hebben over het algemeen veel zelfstandigheid. Regels, procedures en processen dienen wel gevolgd te worden en zijn arbeidsintensief."
good,Halliburton is a pretty good place to work Ready for a change in job status  just not satisfied with current position want to move up and share my knowledge with competitors
good,"Lots of good people and learning opportunities, but a very political culture and unstable industry.  Does not have a performance based evaluation and not much in the way of a career path."
good,"Worked for them for nearly 10 years, and was laid off due to market conditions. I would consider going back solely for the great benefits package. Compensation was good, although low for the rest of the industry. Biggest complaint was upper management was run by too many engineers and beaurecrats, and not enough of guys who actually had field experience that understood what the field guys needed."
good,"This was my first oil field related job and for the most part I enjoyed it. There came a time when it went from a ""we are family/team"" to very impersonal. I would return to the company if an opportunity presented itself but in a different location."
good,"good company pay was great, i was never home and my relationship suffered. When things went wrong they just fired whoever caused a problem. Would have wanted to leave within a couple years."
good,I wasn't there for very long so I don't have much to say. they got me the training I needed to get to enter into the oilfield including my class 1 and after that I moved on to more competitive companys
good,Relaxed but professional environment. Very good safety culture. Halliburton has good benefits and work ethics and a great team/working environment good work life balance.
good,"Good perks, very team orientated. great potential to progress and to move abroad if desired. supportive with internal movements to develop personal goals."
good,good company and good people. I have good experience for eorking in this company. the people here have good teamwork. they are always help each others.
good,"You are working for 2 weeks strait with about 10-18hr days, sometimes more especially in the winter time where you could be stuck on location in the middle of nowhere because the roads are to snowed over to get in and out."
good,"Worked in the Gulf of Mexico as a slickline supervisor for twelve  years, I also worked in the Gulf as a completions service operator for four years.."
good,"A typical day at work: O&G drilling is a challenging work as a mechanical engineer"
good,"Great Benefits and competitive pay, overall not a bad place to work.  I wouldnt have a problem recommending this as workplace for someone to apply to."
good,"Halliburton is an ok place to work. They want you to work and the office is ok, but they don't go the extra mile for their employees in Williston. No time for any parties nothing for Christmas, no bonuses. Things like that, other companies here do treat their employees better."
good,"As the health of the oil and gas industry fluctuates, the service companies are obviously affected by increases and decreases in demand.  As such, job security can be volatile.  Earning potential is high, especially if you work tons of hours (which is not uncommon when business is good), and the benefits are a plus, but it is hard to maintain a consistent lifestyle in this field."
good,"Unrealistic deadlines"
good,Halliburton is a great company. They provide excellent training. They are one of the most advanced companies when it comes to cutting edge technology and techniques.
good,Working in the field doesn't allow for much time at the house but pay is decent and benefits are some of the best. Not a lot of room for growth in my current district.
good,"Good place to work for people interested in working in the oil and gas industry. Productive work environment with focus on self learning. The company has achieved great success in Exploration & Production, Geophysical & Geological Software."
good,"More Income - More Stress, very friendly work environment, career paths are up to you, oil industry is very volatile, not too stable as I wish. Good relocation packages when moving globally. Good pay as long as you work hard, nothing complicated."
good,"Worked on cutting edge and state of the art measurement tools."
good,really enjoyed this place the other worker are polite and very relaxed place to work and would like to go back and work for them in the future. quite the place to be at work everyone helped everyone
good,Halliburton is a good company however it is very hierarchical and bureaucratic That makes it very difficult to progress professionally. Career advancement is not based on merits or business results but on who you know
good,The company is an oilfield related company . The hours are long and it is a stressful fast-paced environment. the hours are irregular . lots of night travel and work. the good part is you share the work with a crew. the last few months I worked here I was in the bulk plant and I liked that better
good,"Great company to work for. Good benefits, the pay is decent. Would recommend Halliburton as a good place to learn and start your career in the oilfield."
good,"Good relationship with upper management..."
good,"I have been with the company for more than 13 years and I enjoyed working here. People are nice and good office environment. Good management. "
good,Company has been doing poorly with the downturn in the market and had a layoff a large amount of workforce. Should return to business as usual once market stabilizes.
good,"manual labor, long hours, out of town for many days at a time. Gets caught up in layoffs when oil field businesses are having trouble. Has good benefits and money is good when overtime is happening."
good,"Very fast pace with extremely high standards. Looking to weed out people and maintain the best of the best. "
good,"The regional management teams in this company are very under qualified to be performing expected tasks.  There is very little control over employees, the relationships between employees is great because you spend so much time together and away from your own families :("
good,If you want to make good money but dont care to every see your family this is the company for you.. Live out of hotels and travel your life away then when the field dies your laid off gone..
good,"Really enjoyable place to work, co-workers really feel like family and are always welling to help. Is a great place to get a good understanding of how the oil field works"
good,They spend a lot of time and money on training and safety. They take care of their employees by means of good benefits but poor management and low pay.
good,Overall great place! To begin a new Career and start a new chapter in your life. I would recommend this job to anyone that eager to start new beginning.
good,"Plano de carreira pouco definido."
good,"has it good days and bad ones. people are nice, the job was at times stressful. no social time with the family. hours were long and sleep was minimum when its busy. had a hurry up and wait culture."
good,"Recent company changes have made it difficult to develop product.There are many unnecessary meetings and there is a risk aversion culture among management. As an engineer or designer there is little freedom to innovate and improvements that are different ideas seem to be frowned upon more and more. "
good,"- Completed Halliburton ‘Fast-track Program’  "
good,Working for Halliburton provide well for my family for many years. I appreciate the knowledge and skills I have learned working in that industry.
good,"Job started at 4;00AM Monday thru Thursday ten hour shifts."
good,"A good job when the oil industry is good,  but if things get bad they aren't afraid to cut a good portion of their staff, which can really hurt employee morale. The work is enjoyable, the training program is great if you are new to the oil field, and high turn around allows you to change postions often if you like. The company has high turnaround for a reason though; long hours/expectation to work days off and for weeks straight, low pay (for O&G), and lack of job security."
good,Уволился по причине снижения зарплаты. Постоянные переработки до 45 дней на вахте без выплат.
good,"Was a Good company to work for, met a lot of great people through the years. There were good and bad managers, as well as favorites, but pretty sure that is everywhere. The best parts of the job were that the people were like family and having the opportunities to work just about anywhere in the world."
good,"Looking new Challenge (Vacant)"
good,learned a lot about oilfield procedures and values. grew as a person and learned a lot about myself and how far I could push myself.
good,for a starter in the business you would learn a great experience but as tech guy you will get stuck in one level after sometime
good,"Work/Life balance is solely Halliburton and family comes second.  Work schedule is on call 6 days/24-7 typically working into your first of 3 off days ; 365 days a year.  Hourly pay is low, but constant overtime makes up for it if you beat out all the others for it and supervisor is not afraid to sleep on the clock."
good,Great to learn the business from but management decisions on the national level did not give me confidence of companies future.  Always regarded as the best of the business.
good,"Halliburton is a good company to work for. The multiple service lines make the company large, solid in diversification and inclusion and multicultural ethnicity. However, due to the lack of proper management selection the top management gets disconnected from the lower management (field site) making difficult to establish a solid and high-quality service on all the multidisciplinary departments. "
good,"Fishing out of well 1.75"" coil tubing using snubbing unit inside rig derrick. We recovered all coil tubing except coil inside casing below packer. Well is dead so the rig will continue fishing once packer is pulled from wellbore."
good,"Very great job that require engineering experiences in Marine and high level of customer service skills."
good,"Company pays good and great benefits"
good,its a nice place to work brand new facility ac state of the art equipment and tools nice benefits if you like hours thats the place to be
good,"There is nothing unique or special about this company.  The only thing that keeps me coming are the employees whom I work with.  Management is percieved as disruptive, unsupportive, and a burden."
good,Work is extremely busy.  Extreme deadlines so you day is never boring.  I learned a lot while I was there.  How to efficiently conduct a project on time on budget.  The environment with co-workers was very exciting and somewhat family oriented.
good,The job was interesting in some ways. With some thinking involved and some physical labor. Most of the time working either by yourself of with one other with some stress from constant rule changes.
good,Lots of good people lots of opportunities for advancement overall a good workplace with lot of education opportunities and advancement.
good,Started working here almost 5 years now and there are a lot of things I like about this place. The place is laid back and the people are nice. There is a full gym upstairs I take advantage of and it feels like a great place to retire from. Good safety culture.
good,"I enjoyed my team that I worked with and the work that we did. The company overall tried to have a good culture about them, but still felt like we were pushed to the back with the overall scheme of things. It is a company for most, but was not as ideal as I had hoped for. Spent more time there than I was able to with my family."
good,technical developer and researcher do not get equivalent attention. Team members are super nice but the management is not good.
good,"Work Hard, and you will move up quickly. A day at work would be fast pace, challenging, and rewarding. Management can be helpful and educational."
good,"I would like to be sincere about Halliburton. "
good,"sometimes the working environment can be quite dangerous, especially overseas but the pay is amazing and the coworkers are great to work with"
good,Continuous work load that changes with daily operations. Never a dull moment and always provides a challenging work enviornment
good,Empresa de grande potencial no ramo de óleo e gás e com um ritmo de trabalho intenso.
good,"The job culture was pleasant. Management in my opinion was a bit corrupt. If someone did not like you, you were let go. To me it was too political. Other wise it was ok."
good,We would have meetings on a daily basis.  The management team was ok.  The best part about the job was just learning new things daily.
good,Company has a good base of employee benefits if you choose to take advantage of them. Management could have been better.
good,"Typical day consisted of unloaded tubs from pallets, scanning in cloths to system followed by security tagging, size cubing and hanging all items of clothing before filing into store room or shop floor."
good,"I had an excellent experiences on my previous works. You always learn something from everyone that you work with. You never know enough and you don't know everything. That is the fun part of the job, you have investigate and research to try to find solutions to problems or obstacles during any project. Your team become your family in office. Your co-worker are your friends because you spend the other half of the time of the day in the office. One thing that I learnt from my experiences is: communicate with your supervisor, so you are align with his/her objectives; and therefore the company's goal."
good,"Some of the nicest people I've had the fortune to work with. "
good,"Good place to work when times are good. When times are not so good they tend to cut employees rather quickly. They are also heading to an ""outsource"" methodology, even to the point of laying off employees and then bringing in less qualified workers from India."
good,Halliburton is very good company to start your career in. They provide one of the best industry related training both in class and hands on.
good,I worked at Landmark: High level technical work. Good and smart people. Good work life balance. In the negative side you are on your own to succeed.
good,Work life balance wasn't that good but the pay was. Learned quiet a bit during the time I was there and meet a lot of interesting people
good,Working in overseas locations overseeing pre production test..  Enjoyed the work but the travel was very extensive.  Found employment in the USA.
good,"I had a great time working for Halliburton. The training they gave me was two months long in Houston and I learned almost everything about the job. I was able to make very good connections with my colleagues with that as well. The job itself was fast paced and challenging as a field engineer. The only thing was the management in West Texas was not highly organized. Halliburton is huge so it really depends on your department, place and the type of management."
good,A large oil service company with locations internationally. Process-driven with focus on HSE and service quality. The job was logical but the internal processes could be a minefield for the uninitiated.
good,"Halliburton es una empresa reconocida en el rubro del petroleo a nivel internacional, lider de Mercado."
good,A company that is all about furthering the advancement of itself. Overall the insurance and benefits are top notch and makes up for what the company lacks in other areas
good,Worked on valves and pumps not only in a shop environment but offshore as well working a 21 and 7 schedule until I was laid off from this company due to a down swing in the market.
good,"Good experience.  The long hours away from home started to wear on me, but overall I learned a lot working for Halliburton."
good,I enjoyed my time at Halliburton.  The long hours away from home started to wear on me but it was a great learning experience.
good,"Its all about working in Offshore Day to day challenge, fun about work is 35days ON-Duty & 35days OFF-Duty(Holidays)"
good,"My day starts out putting out fires from the evening before. I then move on to training my replacements."
good,"Halliburton is your typically big corporation.   You as an employee are a number, it is very political, there are processes to be followed, and little wiggle room in how things are done.   With that said, I was surprised at how ethical accounting / finance procedures were handled and any concern (no matter how large or small) was handled properly and promptly.    They certainly aren't a ""warm fuzzy"" company but truly how can you be with so many employees.   "
good,Great environment. Worked in all kinds of weather. being gone from home is the hardest part about the job. The easiest thing is bonding with the other guys
good,ok to work for if you like a lot of bosses up your butt and like to run around in circles like a chicken with its head cut off get in a click fast or you go nowhere
good,long days. great co workers. employees make the best of of bad times to help keep moral of shop looking upwards. management could use some help. its not what you know it who you know when it comes to open positions
good,"Halliburton is a great company to work for when the going is good, but cut heads fast when things start to go down hill.  There is a lot of  potential for advancement."
good,cleanbuiding facility  cleanbathrooms went to five building  each day   and  clean  allbath  all hallway and offices all over town ofcasper
good,Driving in convoys from base to base delivering products to the military. And suppling ice to all bases in Iraq. It was a twenty four seven job.
good,"professional working place. great teaching program for new hires. long working hours in harsh environment. good pay, good management. good starting point for those who is looking to make a career in the oil field."
good,A very good learning experience working with an array of specialised tools and equipments used by Halliburton. A very good head start for recent graduates. Co-workers very assistive. Work hours stretches up for a bit long which sometimes affects the work-life balance. A good working atmosphere.
good,"Coordination of jobs where successful and promising,  Our daily duties where stable and communication was key in daily operations. Learned snubbing and experienced cross training.  Management was supportive in all areas. Supportive in training employees to the fullest.  Took Well Control Courses, CPR and First Aide as well as safety classes and meetings."
good,"É a empresa que me deu um grande conhecimento profissional em todas as áreas, uma empresa que cobra muito da qualidade do serviços pretado pelo funcionárioos aos clientes e tambem dos treinamento dos funcionários mais assim adiquirimos grandes conhecimentos e qualidade no trabalho."
good,good place to work. great benefits. good environment. good management staff. very good overall place to work good great place
good,Company too large for me. Thought there were a lot of people with the cutthroat mentality. Didn't appreciate their workers the way other companies do.
good,"Great exposure in the oil and gas industries working in different customers location,great trainings withing and outside the country"
good,Halliburton is a great company to learn many things from and work with great people. Benefits are awesome. It's just the long hours that you have to put in and weird times of working that are rough. Job security is completely based on the price of global oil. You also need to not mind getting dirty on the job.
good,"lots of time on the road from home in all kinds of different weather but good experience in all oil field related areas ,you can also meet some very interesting people there to open other doors at different companies"
good,"Empresa visa principalmente a satisfação dos clientes, buscando em toda preparação de trabalho um resultado perfeito. Também propicia aos colaboradores vivências em locais distintos e inusitados melhorando assim o senso de trabalho em equipe e adaptação em seus colaboradores."
good,Working on a frac crew - A lot of time away from home and challenging work environment is a compromise you have to make for the money and benies.  Most of the work is not difficult and there is a lot of down time.  Make lots of friends.  Price of oil make this job rare these days.  Laid off 9/30/2015.
good,"I loved my job! The coworkers were great and the work atomosphere was good, too. Wished I could have stayed there until retirement age."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,"I enjoy the crew I work with, and have learned a lot through on the job training while working here.  I also enjoy we have a company gym on campus."
good,"Enjoyed working here. Learned a vast amount. Once oil dropped, layoffs hit like crazy. Would go back if things were more stable."
good,Halliburton is a good company we had company party every once in a while when we happened to be in the yard.They have very good insurance
good,There is truth to what they say Halliburton they have great training without the great pay. I would work here a couple years get all the training they provide then go to the places that have great pay
good,Halliburton is a great place to work. This job teaches a person importance of safely daily without accidents. Management can be tough at times with multiple changes that can happen daily. Employees are treated fairly on the job site.
good,"There are a lot of retention issues with service industry companies, the type of work being performed being the main reason. The schedule will wear you down and even when you do get time off, you are often asked to work your days off. Compensation could be better, they pride themselves on paying the exact average for the various positions."
good,"Overall good company to work for, yet life/work balance is difficult to achieve."
good,"Halliburton is a great company. They are not the best paying, because they have the best training and the best benefits from what I understand. And I also understand that once you have them on your resume, you are golden to work just about anywhere else since they have put in all the time and effort in you, then all the other service companies want you."
good,"They treat you very well when times are good, once the market goes the other direction watch out because you aren't even considered a person at the point just a # on a spreadsheet"
good,"typical 12 hour shifts, learned a lot of jobs and life skills, enjoyed working with people from across the country and all walks of life, hardest part of the job was working away for long periods of time, enjoyed perks such as bonuses and free meals, gym and sauna, etc"
good,I had the best co-workers who I supported. They made going to work very enjoyable. I had different tasks that needed to be done throughout the month that kept me busy. My manager was very laid back and made sure we were always a team that worked together.
good,"During the first hour at work I prioritise which tasks have to be done. During the day this can change at a moments notice so I have to be adaptable to changing work practices. I have learned to drive forklifts up to 12 ton, narrow isle and side loader. I have worked with sap for over 6 years. I worked in a small team and worked well within it."
good,worked with some very knowledgeable supervisors.the most enjoyable part of the day was taking product to the drilling rigs.and meeting new people.
good,"No Life balance. Very demanding work. "
good,"Great company to work for except for the constant worry of whether or not there would be lay offs. The position was interesting and honestly fun, but once production slows down everything inside this company basically slows down. Overall, a good company to work for if you can dodge the lay offs! Great benefits, nice co workers and also a great work schedule, within administration with this having been said."
good,"work work and then work some more"
good,"The technical side of the job varies depending on the product line and on the managers. There are a lot of employees with years worth in experience but the experience is not taught to new engineers, you have to teach yourself and find the information for yourself. Employees are being micromanaged and they need to report which project they are working in intervals of 30min. The hardest part of the job is accepting upper management decisions knowing that they are not front line employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around other value oriented employees and going home safe every day after work."
good,"Halliburton is a good service company. Unfortunately when the demand for service declines, so does employment within the company."
good,"Most of the employee happy with the day at the work base which is flexibility time and no tension on the job preparation."
good,"Not a bad job, but never had a day that pushed me past my limits though. Learned alot about the drill bit portion of the oilfield. Management was pretty good and I am impressed with the way they handle productivity issues and how well they handled personnel. As far as co-worker they were mostly good people though they tended to be group based as far as who would work with whom. The toughest part of the job was probably our last production day of the week as we would have to crank out 2x's as many bits on those days. The part of the job I enjoyed the most was probably the type of humor that one can only see in the oilfield, military, or mining."
good,This was my first job out of college. I worked in an accounting group that taught me so much in 2.5 years. I could not have asked for a better first job.
good,"I have been with Halliburton for about 5 years after they bought Boots and Coots, which I had spent 2 years working for.  Halliburton has excellent benefits and they have treated me well by keeping me on though the Boots and Coots acquisition and a facility shut down over my last 7 years there.  Due to the downturn in the oil and gas industry I have felt that there is a significant lack in job security.  This is the main reason I am looking for another career.  I am not looking forward to starting over again, but I feel that it is what I need to do to make sure that I am able to provide for my family."
good,This company provides  a different take and strategy on the management of a large O&G company compared to others.  The management style is often hard to read.
good,They are a professional company with an eye on the bottom line.  They have been in the oil service industry for a long time.
good,"Enjoyed working with diverse cultures.  Working with co-workers was very enjoyable.  Learned how to coordinate travel for students, lunches, issued letters of invitation into the U.S."
good,"- The management system is not efficient."
good,"Awesome place to work if your in the right department, great benefits and time in the field. The only bad thing is when the oil prices go down equal layoffs."
good,got to see lots of areas in Colorado I never heard of before I also got to learn new equipment and be part of the biggest oil company in the world
good,"Safety minded, forward looking global possibility.Most enjoyable part was the team work."
good,"Typical work day was busy and enjoyable, management was some of the best I've seen in my work experience, most of the co-workers were very agreeable and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was not having the resources needed to preform the daily job duties, the most enjoyable part was daily interacting with co-workers, management and employees."
good,"Field Engineer, M/LWD Halliburton Worldwide Ltd, Abu Dhabi, UAE                        Job roles and Responsibilities: Perform rig-site Measurement / Logging-While-Drilling (M/LWD) tasks safely, Assist in managing (M/LWD)  rig-site assets and ensure highest level of safety standards are followed at all times."
good,"Typically the day started with reviewing evening activities and ensuring that the customer was satisfied with our services. One of the time consuming task was generating bids for new work. The hard part was to separate yourself from the competitor by creating value and winning the work while remaining profitable. However, I enjoyed my freedom, golf games and my co-workers. Strong management in place to assist you with any challenges that you may encounter."
good,"I am not going to go into details about my experiences at Halliburton."
good,"Fast paced and growing downstream oil company, where I managed the Marketing of the entire organization, including their motorsport sponsorships."
good,"Great working hours, great manager, poor team morale, no consideration for employees company as a whole."
good,Excellent company to work for with a great attitude toward safety.
good,"Reuniões de segurança."
good,The re-organization lately put unqualified people to management position and this drives out experienced and dedicated people.
good,"Atuei no departamento de propostas e contratos, mas não me identifiquei com a função. Era muito mecânico e rotineiro."
good,"Project Manager Real Estate Services: "
good,"My co workers taught me a lot. Loved my job, always learned something new. Management is great benefits and pay was better, they just need to sometimes appreciate the time people put in."
good,"Work with Field Engineers around the clock"
good,"setting up/ rigging up the equipment needed to Frac a site.  Very tedious hard labor type of work.  ran equipment and regulate pressure also amount of dirt, chemical, and water needed to pump into oil well.   After job was complete we rigged down the equipment and drove to the next site."
good,"The company is one of the biggest in the world with the HES policy very well defined, but the system to manager the employ's free time is really complex because the company has a deficient number of workers comparing the number of open jobs in a field and onshore inside the client's office.   "
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendi el principio del funcionaniento de las herramientas de registros, tuve buenas cuadrillas de trabajo, lo mas dificil del trabajo fue el lasrgo tiempo de trabajo lejos de casa, lo que mas me gusto fue conocer toda el area."
good,"Muy buena empresa en general. Capacitan con muchos cursos en linea y presenciales, se preocupa por la seguridad de todos sus empleados."
good,"Working with Halliburton has been an eye opening experience. I have learned a lot about myself and how I have dealt with different circumstances. The people I have worked with all care about their job and the everyone they work around. The day is a long one, it can run from a 12hr day to 18hr day. I am working a scheduled that has you work 2 weeks then a week off. The scheduled can run real long on the 2nd week of work. I love working with everyone, its like a family."
good,Good workflow ensured little down time and kept workers busy
good,Halliburton is an Oil and Gas company.  There are several PSLs that are geared toward a specific vertical space within the Oil and Gas Industry.
good,you work long hours but the pay is good it you can put up with the hassle of working for a large company
good,"The work itself isn't bad, but the pay doesn't match up with the competitors."
good,"aqui el trabajo era de 12 por turno como este fue mi primer trabajo aqui aprendi el funcionamiento de los equipos de control de solidos y sobre la perforacion en pozos petroleros,con mis jefes tuve una buena relacion laboral sabian de mi trabajo abordo trataba de no cometer errores, me lleve bien con mis compañeros de guardia, lo mas dificil fue acostumbrarme al area de plataformas, lo que me mas me gusto fue la experiencia que obtuve."
good,Much of your time is spent away from home so not great for someone with a family but perfect for a single engineer who wants to travel.
good,"Enjoyed the pay, the people are great and the job was interesting"
good,Basic warehousing and equipment operations. I learned the Halliburton Inventory System. The management was goal oriented. The hardest part of the job was constantly lifting heavy oil field equipment. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my teammates!
good,"productive, relaxed, great co-workers, flexible work environment"
good,"Fast pace life style, good experience, great money."
good,"A typical day in this job was to answer the telephone, greet clients, distribute mail, collect payments, daily deposits, filing, and office supply management."
good,Documentation and design of down hole oil field equipment.
good,For new hands they have the best training program in the oilfield. It is also a plus that they put you through driver training and make sure you are qualified to be on the highway in an 18 wheeler.
good,Most of my time with this company has been served out of town. We were compensated for going out of town until we got a new manager. I am almost the only one left of the crews I have been working with all these years due to the reversal of compensation. The current manager is bringing in workers from his previous location to fill openings for advancement and this makes it difficult to move up in your career. The company is still a good company to work for.
good,"•	Manage corporate, industry and customer events and trade shows"
good,Halliburton is your foot into oil an leave it at that lowest pay nation wide expect 13 an hr coming in but get your 1 yr of knowledge and operations learn everything and move to another company who will give you 18 to 20 an hr
good,"The office politics was the worst part of working there."
good,"Lots of good but there are lots of bad. I started working for them when I was having a low point in my life they helped me get back on to my feet. As your responsibilities go up, your pay scale does not. If one person screws up then every one gets punished. Safety record is more important than the care of the employee they will try to fix a missing finger with duct tape and staples rather than have you go to the hospital just to prevent a recordable. They can beat revenue mid year yet cut the hours of support staff in order to make their profits look better to their higher ups. They have no loyalty to their employees its all about the $$$$$$$$$. I have visited other camps and they do not have the same issues as this camp."
good,Working outside dealing with the elements and the pressure from the wells where very challenging.
good,A typical day work is long hrs constant working in all types of weather. Everyday is a learning experience the co workers r the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and the being away from home
good,Great opportunities to travel. Great people and management
good,"Day to day shift on remote location"
good,"good company bennifits, lots of travel. great pepole. Tired of working overseas when the same amount of money can be made here."
good,"bad on pay for type of work done, managers didnt know how to run product out on time, always wanting to pull other worker away from their job when very busy, very dirty shop,"
good,"frac for oil and natural gas."
good,"I have always enjoyed working at Halliburton.  Management is good, but too many retraints are put on people, because of budgetary concerns."
good,"Short assignment and due to Hurricane Ike, we were not given the opportunity to finish our required job. Due to a pending case, I was to review documents and go through 10,000 boxes of documents that needed to be documented and organzied for the legal department. I did work with a team of 6 other contractors in order to document, organize, and box up company data that needed to be ready for pending case."
good,Started in the heat then went to the Field hospitals and performed general maintenance on ECU units and cooling systems then as I performed my task I learned the conditions of extreme heat and what I takes to accommodated these temps I managed other employees from the Philippines and  a service rout on a base that housed over 5000 soldiers the hardest part of my job was the distance from my family and the most enjoyable was being my brothers in the  army.
good,"During day to day work basis was very productive, worked with customers on the shop floor, received parts, pulled parts, helped motivate team to be more productive as well as completing each day with a safety value. Since start date of 06 I've acquired much knowledge in many departments such as receiving, deliveries logistics, inventory, shipping department, production, miss-shipments local/overseas, material requests, customer service transactions. In each department I acquired SAP skills, also power point 1&2 classes. Some workdays would get pretty stressful but thanks to superb team-workers they would help lighting the day up!!  My co-workers would always give assistance at anytime of the day when needed, if there was a safety issue that needed to be address they would adapt well in any situation. Management was good when I started, always listen to any idea I had which helped improve the process in shipping in 2008, the workflow was magnificent! Also if any class I needed to take threw I-learn instructor to better the company he would always approve. Since 2013 new management has entered, an what I can say is...a lot has changed..? The most difficult part of my job was driving home after a exhausting day, which consist of eleven to twelve hour productive days. I have to say Halliburton has given me a lot til 2013, as far as awesome co-workers    ,benefits, acquired much SAP skills, team leader ship.         "
good,"•	Utilize the Summit and SAP module"
good,Good place to work. Excellent people to work with. Great learning experience.
good,Work very long hours and on call sometimes work 40 hours straight and go home only get get called 2 hours later to come back to work. Its paid slavery.
good,lots of hours
good,Participation in the initial phrase of New Facility Setup.
good,The title says it all. Long hours for a pay level below the industry average.
good,i learned how to build down hol drills and xl motors as well as sperry drill motors and other oil and gas industry tools.
good,start early early
good,Started my career with Global aspects. Learned Accounting Structure of Global Company and new Accounting Procedures.
good,The work experience was good but after doing it dont want to work in this enviroment
good,"Always something different day in and day out,,,never the same"
good,"great work environment, but job security is very poor. Halliburton has a bad habit of having lay-offs."
good,Working everyday with a great group of men who keep safety with them at all times.
good,i learned a lot of things as a machinist.
good,"Decent place to work. Good people, good pay. Long hours and lots of work on weekends, but work was not super challenging."
good,I feel it was one of the best companys I ever worked for.I loved my job and the equipment was great second to none. The only thing I didn't like was the politics there some of the worst I have seen in that company. But all in all I would work there again
good,Needing to make more money to support my family! Pay is not enough!
good,A good place to work with helpful co-workers. A manageable schedule with good pay.
good,"To summarize working at Halliburton Energy, I would say that it is a great company to work for to broaden your understanding of the oil field. However, the long hours, multiple days in a row, with sometimes only 4 days off a month- can be undesirable. Accordingly, there is very few opportunities for advancement within."
good,"Finding employment right out of college is very difficult for a lot of people especially if you have no experience in the discipline for which you have your degree. Halliburton is very good at hiring people out of college and an excellent place to get that initial experience. If you can handle the stress associated with working for a company in an oil industry, the type of work you will do actually enjoyable."
good,"It was a good job and I lasted about 7 years.  Halliburton provides great benefits in exchange for below average pay.  They're a world-wide company and provides lots of opportunity to grow and advance.  Very few entry-level jobs give any personal life flexibility and the employment is always subject to supply and demand.  When production is booming you'll live for Halliburton, when production is declining you start looking over your shoulder and when the market tanks, lay-offs happen.  That's the nature of the business. I learned a lot about the world and business and will always be grateful for that education.  The branch I worked for always kept things on the level. I've a great appreciation for my time with Halliburton."
good,This job is not for everyone. Must be dedicated and willing to learn. Be prepared for layoff season and create a 401k and invest in stocks. That's how you make your money here.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Halliburton, but unfortunately people are being laid off or quitting. The pay is below if comparing with the competition. Some roles are more flexible than other and overall, there is work/ life balances as most people are able to control their schedule."
good,"A Cia tem muita frentes de trabalho  em  distintas linhas de serviço, com isso temos  oportunidade de desenvolvermos diversas competências para cada atividade."
good,"Halliburton is a great place to get started working in the oil field. Once you get hired on, you can apply for other jobs for Halliburton internally. I held three different positions within the company and worked for two districts."
good,"14/7 job. West Texas is NOT a place to live if you have loved ones miles away. Nice pay, benefits. Fun to meet new people. LONG work week hours. Def recommend starting here but try to get out after a year or so."
good,"Good compensation and benefits, but lacking in work/life balance. Unfortunately, in this line of work there are demanding hours and a 24/7 workload. Weekends and holidays are no exception so it is very hard to have a family life."
good,"No job security, dependent on oil prices. Benefits are top notch, may require travel if just now starting. Safety is very big with them. Most personnel are easy to get along with. Can’t miss too many days without doctors excuse,"
good,I learned a lot and many training opportunities. I was sent to many training classes to not only teach me how to run equipment but the reasons why we do things on the equipment.
good,The company is a great starting point. Your gona learn alot and het alot of skills. Just isnt gona pay nearly what the competition is paying. And benefits was great. And management is pretty good. U have to work your way up through halliburton. So the management will know what they is talking about
good,A typical day at work we get to our stations and do maintenance pump until told otherwise. The hardest part of the job is time away from my home. Everything about the job was self explanatory and simple but very hard work.
good,Corporate culture strongly focused on service execution. Service personnel well-trained.  Management style is authoritarian. Normal day includes multiple meetings.  Communications are predominantly verbal; needs to improve documentation.
good,To many rules feels like they try to make it so safe that all you think about is if your doing something wrong instead of focusing on the task at hand
good,Great working place.  This place is very diverse and everyone is friendly to work with.  There are cafeteria with good food and that is my favorite.  The management is alright and not that great.  The pay is decent.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to solve engineering problem.  I have learned a lot at Halliburton since they have classes frequently.
good,"Working at Halliburton is a great financial decision, no doubt about it. However, it comes with sacrifices. I knew about my 14 days on, 7 days off schedule, my monthly compensation, and what promotions I was working toward, but I did not know what exactly my job duties were at the time of hire. After seeing the oil field for the first time, I knew it would be a challenge to learn everything. I worked diligently toward my promotion, but I was unable to reach it. At first management put the blame on the person training me. After switching to a new mentor, we started using older procedures that took longer. This really hurt my confidence in learning. Not only was everyone pushing me to learn faster, but they forced me to use slower methods to get the job done. It was too much, so I quit. I had contemplated finding a new job for a month before finally deciding enough was enough. I did try to transfer to a different position within Halliburton, but the market was down. People were treating me worse and worse. I'm very happy I left."
good,good company to start a career in the oilfield very good on the job training for field and driving.  Long hours without a lot of compensation to counter.
good,Halliburton é  uma empresa multinacional e é  sempre muito bom trabalhar  numa empresa de tão grande porte e dar o contributo para o crescimento  desta e do país
good,these guys knew what they wanted and also knew how to teach it to you the tec there was nice and up to date you got to go on a lot of different rigs and got to use a lot of different tools to drill a well
good,I so much loved my job at Halliburton unfortunately I just happened to hit it at the wrong time during a down turn in the economy and unfortunately lost my job however they pay well treat you well and as far as the work environment it's like family.
good,"Working at halliburton Nigeria gave a lot of exposure in my area of specialization. These includes but not limited to hydraulics, pneumatics, safety, documentation, preventive and unscheduled repair on engines from different manufacturers. Employees development comes once in a while but worth a lot if it  does come. Safety is part of the business without safety no work. Most enjoyable part of the job is employees cooperation. There is this zeal to assist fellow employee when the need arise. Hardest part of the job is coping with low income."
good,"They give you as much overtime as you could want.  They have good benefits and decent pay.  I was looking for more training and advancement, as i had completed all training at my current level."
good,"Benefits were very good."
good,The company had to adjust to the market letting many of us go at the end. The company was good to work for. The pace varied on the conditions. Fast to get set up and then relaxed as long as nothing went wrong.
good,"Mediocre work environment"
good,"Everyone works in a team work culture. Good communication with each and everyone. "
good,"Over all it is a good company to work for, very good benefits. My typical day starts about 3 to 8pm. average 150 hours per two weeks, very fast pace. Enforcing the DOT rules are very strict but fair to industry. Management is to political. Being able to finish the job safely and going home to enjoy your family. Also, worked as a pump operator, coil operator and nitrogen operator."
good,Enjoyed the experience of working with the Field personnel and assisting with HR and Payroll questions and concerns.  Good experience with processing new hires.
good,"When the job was going it was a face paced environment.  While waiting on location for the  job to start could be a long wait.  As a person who likes to be busy this wait time could seem like forever.  Had to work in all weather conditions, they supplied the clothes and accessories to accommodate the weather."
good,"The only thing that they could really change was the way they scheduled."
good,Opportunity to develop on core competencies. Very excellent manager. The job requires traveling to offshore locations and missing one's family for weeks.
good,"Work life is a mixed of fun and stressful. However, it is career-rewarding place to advance and grow. Challenges are intermittently encountered and management support are sometimes not guaranteed."
good,me desempeñaba como conductor em la empresa halli burton gracias a un transporte llamado galbam donde mi jefe inmediato es de nombre miguel gomes
good,"Long hours, good, money, good benefits.  Hard work and plenty of it.  If it's hot, you're boiling and if it's cold, your thankful. However, I couldn't expect momma to raise the kids by herself."
good,"boa gestão, boa experiencia profissional, um pouco exaustivo."
good,"The workplace culture was challenging for engineers with competitive compensation. Engineered learned to design, manufactured, assembly and test prototype products to meet customer requirements."
good,"As with any job I aquire I did learn quite a bit with Halliburton."
good,"Multicultural environment with challenging projects but rewarding experiences at the same time (career progression, training when needed and overall client satisfaction with our services)."
good,There has not been much room for improvement.  I am assuming that is mainly because the industry.  My group itself is managed quite well from the over-arching boss.  But my direct manager is not very good at managing people.  The pay is on the low end compared to most across the industry.
good,Cool people but this is a place of business  and when dealing with a place of business you will find yourself dealing with things you might not like ..
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed my time with them and have no negative comments on them."
good,"Se trabajaba mucho en función de los proyectos, algunos de los cuales se llevaban a cabo pero otros en donde se invertian muchos recursos no. Requería en aquel entonces estandarizar los procesos de trabajo en Oriente y Occidente del país. Un ambiente multicultural y se estaba trabajando en la integración del personal. Para mi fue una gran oportunidad para conocer el ambiente petrolero y sindical."
good,My current place of work is a good place for learning and training future industry leaders. It is a place where team work is key and healthy professional competition is encourage based on organisations set goals and objectives
good,The people are great and work/life balance is good. Job security is very poor. Houston management is very removed from what the company actually does.
good,Pretty laid back at the shop but on jobs the stress level is extremely high. Management in the office does not have much dictation over work getting done in the back shops.
good,"it has alot of different areas of work a huge company, overall a great company to work for just depends on where you work at and which department you work for"
good,"Was a field Engineer for coiled tubing operations."
good,"Halliburton rolls with the oilfield. When oil prices are good, Halliburton is good, but when prices are low it can be pretty rough."
good,"yeah a ton of us got dropped by the the big H but i liked the work, i worked in the cementing dept. work was hard but nothing the average worker could handle, met a bunch good people while working there and the safety mentality worked great in the shop but not so much out in the field."
good,"If management took a 10% pay cut globally, the small guy could have a fighting chance to keep his job.  Great company when times are good but starting pay is low for the oilfield work.  "
good,"Great place to work good pay when the oil fields where busy, "
good,Great Place to work with wonderful coworkers. Long hours and short staff. No backing from management. There is a lot to learn from this company. Uses a lot of different programs.
good,"Always a new challenging issue to solve."
good,una empresa muy estable loboralmente y con buenas prestaciones de salud
good,"you can get hired without experience and advancement is readily accessible as long as the market is good. compared to competitors the pay is garbage. some weeks I work 100+ hours, some I am capped at 40 hours. continuous cuts in pay and weak bonus structure."
good,Average conditions in an average company. Nothing is too good or too bad. Quite a flexible work schedule. The way the company works is changing with each new top manager. In last couple of years they invested too much in Houston Northbelt infrastructure that is almost empty now.
good,"Halliburton has many product lines, offices around the world, and a lot of differing job types within the company. With so many positions available motivated employees can move up in the company every 2-5 years. "
good,I look forward to the different challenges I need to solve everyday to improve our database system. I learned a lot about the oil/gas business as well as many other aspects of management system. My co-workers are friendly. The hardest and also most enjoyable part of the job is the continuous changing and evolving of our business and technology.
good,Nothing bad to say about this company. Best job I ever had. Having freedom to do the job you were hired for. Learning new skills ever day.
good,"was ok, regular oil and gas services company.. cowboy culture, always trying to compete with SLB and BHI, but are nowhere near, hence decided to buy BHI"
good,"Focuses on employees but do expect long hours on the job."
good,"I loved my time at Halliburton. I worked on Blue Crew out of the Vernal Camp. Until the price of Oil crashed it was a great job. But Halliburton is in business to make money. So they started cutting benefits and advancement opportunities. Since I was away from my family for two weeks at a time, I felt like I was already making a big enough sacrifice for the company. So when they cut our per diem and started treating us like war captives, I quit."
good,"Interesting place to work. There is not much room for advancement in certain departments. One of the most safety focused companies that I have worked for. With it being a world wide company, there is room to transfer and work different parts of the world."
good,"good pay and benifits"
good,"- Challenging work environment due to dynamic changes in the product"
good,"Busy work day, keeping focused on job duties was very easy, but not much room for advancement for women."
good,Una empresa fuerte y grande aunque con una cultura corporativa muy asfixiante en términos de procesos lo que hace lenta la reacción operacional
good,Great place to work however not always best home time.Good benefits and family coverage. Good training and safety procedures.
good,"Working for Halliburton has taught me a lot about how the overall workflow, culture/environment can change from great to not so great. But in my years of working there I've learned a lot about the oil and gas industry that I originally thought I knew but really didn't know. Management rotates in and out every year so you basically can never get used to having one manager and sometimes its hard to prove and be acknowledged as a hard worker when you have to be learned by a new manager every 6mos to a year therefore making it hard to get a good rating when it comes time for performance reviews.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with poor management. The part I love most about the job was that they were very family oriented."
good,Highly unpredictable schedule 24/7 when on call. Hourly wage is quite low (what I would consider the oil field minimum wage). Benefits are good and management is pretty good too. They will pay for you to get your Class A CDL but you have to stay for 1 year after obtaining it or you will have to pay back the cost of the class and CDL fees.
good,"Duties: Plan, lead, supervise and execute all aspects of drilling fluids engineering. Continuously monitor equipment and downhole properties such as pump output and casing pressure using calculations and/or 	computer programs. While providing advice and technical 	support to respective project team by reporting daily drilling fluid properties, suggesting treatments and estimating cost impact."
good,Typical day consisted of 2-3 rig/mud checks. The hardest aspect of the job is driving and being away from family. Co-workers were great overall. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was independence.
good,"good job although with the downfall of natural gas and oil prices mechanics jobs are in danger now, and I am looking now for a new job because I have a family to support, and don't want to walk in here one day , and the shut the doors down, and that's what its looking like a lot of our work is going to other camps now."
good,fun place to work at time long hours great pay and benefits aren't to bad to many lay offs  gone from home a lot grat guys at time
good,"A safe place to work until a oil sector market went down."
good,Good pay with benefits. Good work/life balance. Job security not as secure as I once thought it was.  If your the low man on the pole you may be asked to resign during droughts.
good,"The money is great until the market tanks and you get laid off.  There are 1000 safety rules, one violation of which can/will get you fired."
good,"This is a really good place to work for a single guy who doesn't like to be organized in any way, shape, or form.  The unpredictable nature of the oil field makes for an interesting lifestyle, to say the least.  They pay just enough to make you keep working in the inhumane conditions that develop. They even pretend to care about you!  You won't want to quit because nothing else pays this good.  You won't want to stay because of all the micromanaging nitpicking that goes on.  If management would concentrate more on getting us work, and less on snitch on your neighbor programs, the overall morale would be greatly improved. Just when you can't take it anymore and are ready to jump off a cliff, your paid days off will begin and you will realize that life isn't that bad after all............repeat. "
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was, learning how to build tools to change the drilling era. they had great benefits, the compensation was very well. we had a lot of fun working with this company"
good,"Calculations calculations calculations!!!"
good,Busy and professional but badly under-resourced. Sourcing candidates for Sperry Drilling and Baroid Drilling Fluids (also involved in some supporting roles and recruitment events). Busy with Sub Saharan Africa and emerging countries on East Africa.
good,Great place to gain experience not a great place for job security.
good,"Halliburton is nice place to work at, the salary is always in the average band no matter which country, but the benefits and health care are fine"
good,Typically I will complete any testing that needs to be done first thing and then work on results and anything else the customer requires. I have learned the processes of how a well is cemented and how much work actually goes into it.
good,"Well organized, team atmosphere and culture. Supportive management"
good,on call 6 on 3 off driving equiptment to location rigging up and rigging down hoses and iron. pumping cement down rig hole
good,"I learned quite a bit a Halliburton.  One of the jokes that we used to say is that 1 year at Halliburton is equal to 2 years at any other company.  This company basically 'throws you in the fire' when you first start and you never look back.  Halliburton is perpetually busy and you feel like you are never ahead and always struggling to keep your head above water.  Many of the departments are understaffed and everyone does what they can to get by.  I worked in the corporate offices in Houston, TX and traveled a lot to the field and worked in the field camp in Brighton, CO permanently.  The culture of Halliburton is definitely work above all else including family and personal life.  It makes you feel important and that your job is worthwhile, however, I personally do not believe you should live to work.  I think one should work to live.  Everybody at Halliburton honestly does get along for the most part and is nice.  It seems like a massive family and you can ask questions with impunity, b/c that's a great way to learn.  Halliburton was very enjoyable when I traveled with the company and got to meet many people and taught people.  The toughest part of working for Halliburton was that working in one of the busiest field camps in the nation, if not the busiest in Brighton, CO.  Having been to many other field camps, Brighton was always struggling to stay afloat in all departments.  Halliburton tries to corner the market and take on more work than it can maybe handle.  This is a very good problem to have, however, it takes a huge toll on the employees trying to ensure the business"
good,On a scale of 1 to 10 this company overall rates 7 in most areas.
good,"Typical day could be in the field or in the office. I have learned a lot through Halliburton, including technical information, but also how the business works. Management is very nit picky, they will micro manage you... Hardest part of the job is making sure management is happy and CYA!"
good,i enjoyed working here it was a great place to start my career in the oilfield.
good,"Dressing service tool all day, 9 to 11 hours a day. Tools come off a job, break the tool apart and clean it. Then make any repairs and put it back together. Then pressure test the tool. How to read blue prints on service tool, pressure testing tools, repairing tools.Pretty good group guys that run the service tool department. Every body works good together in the tool shop. Very physical and dirty job. Got to be home every night."
good,"I was hired into a program that was established in order to place college graduates into supervisory positions.  Everything was going well until I found out I had herniated three discs in my neck.  I was warned by a co-worker that they would find a reason to terminate me, and they did.  They reasoned that I had not informed them of an injury (that I didn't have, this happened over an extended period of time) in an acceptable period of time.  Although I notified my supervisor (after visits with my Chiropractor, Physician, and MRI) on my return from days off."
good,"Pues un dia tipido de trabajo, es entrar a las 6 30am, entramos todos los dias a las reuniones de seguridad y despues comenzamos labores, lo que mas he aprendido en la parte electronica de la herramienta de lwd y la parte mas complicada fue aprender a trabajar con los manuales y chek list"
good,I enjoyed all the learning I received from Halliburton. Mgrs. were understanding. Teamwork. working nights the last 4.5 years was hard. I enjoyed accomplishing a task at hand that was difficult.  
good,Un entorno de trabajo dificil donde la excelente paga es reflejo del esfuerzo en los roles de trabajo hasta de 20dias por 3 de descanso y un alto indice de accidentes que varian desde el tipo vial hasta intoxicaciones.
good,A typical day here is busy. Constant meetings trying to figure out the best way to sell our product to our old and new customers. I think the hardest part is designing new technology on how to manufacture the bits quicker. Co-workers are always a joy to work with.
good,The hours are LONG! The work is HOT! The pay is not bad. The benefits are STELLAR!
good,"Whereas compensation and hours are excellent, there are a number of flaws with the way the company goes about business. Not all departments were as backwards as mine was though."
good,adquirí conocimiento sobre las operaciones que se realizan en dicha empresa y en algunos de sus puntos de trabajo se respira un ambiente laboral la relación es estricta debido a las operaciones que se despeñan por su complejidad y en otros uno equilibrado y agradable dependiendo de las actividades a desempeñar
good,"I have almost been with Halliburton for 2 years. The room to grow with the organization is endless, but the problem is if you don't play the ""game"" or aren't ""buddy buddy"" with someone, its difficult to move up. There is really no training and development, all competencies are completed online. The benefits provided by this organization the far the best I have ever seen."
good,"Working from 8:00 Am to 7:00 PM six days/week, three weeks/month"
good,Working from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM with one lunche hour between 12:00 PM to 01:00 PM
good,"Muy bueno, Halliburton es una de las mejores empresas de servicios petroleros, por lo cual siempre hay muchas oportunidades de aprender."
good,one of the best training in the industry however the pay is not the best compared to other companies in the same field - was in the field of fracking..
good,"Good means of earning a living, benefits and pay are very competitive.  Oil and gas industry is at the end of its usefulness and Halliburton is ill-prepared to adjust to future energy requirements."
good,I have learned a lot more about hydraulic systems and mechanical functions. advancement can be difficult at times when management is focused on budgets.
good,I liked my job good comradery the benefits are top notch. Salary was ok but it slows down a lot and you go to the yard and that that burts your paycheck and this happens frequently.
good,"Too much middle management, no recognition for employees, to much emphasis on process and not enough on products.  Outsource too many jobs overseas,  not a very good corporate citizen.  Main facilities have access to more employee benefits than the smaller facilities, pay is competitive, job advancement not great."
good,"This is a great job for a single person or a short term, make money quick, family person.  I love my coworkers and love working hard. The hardest thing was not seeing my family."
good,It is a good place for yourself to be independent and work under stress because it will teach yourself a lesson how to manage your own work will lots of load. I been go through this working life and it is a very good experience to help myself build my own career path.
good,"just the typical oilfield job. you work non stop or you don t work at all. there was plenty of advancement, just no life at home. good if you are younger and want to sock some money away"
good,"All processes were extremely lean and streamlined, which made for an easy work environment..  Culture is strong on safety and work life balance. Work hours are precise and easy to follow."
good,"You will learn a lot & gain a lot working with Halliburton but the pay is not all that great. "
good,Depending on your job role but my experience has been that it is a highly competitive environment that requires quick thinking and actions. You are well paid and great benefits for your work.
good,"Good place for starters in the oil field industry."
good,"Good pay & benefits. Good place to learn & gain knowledge. Management views you as just a number. Many hours per 7 days are a drawback, you look forward to time off."
good,"Halliburton is a good intro company with good benefits, decent pay, and good training programs. However due to market conditions the past couple years the turn around has been high, so they are always understaffed making a lot harder to use any training programs. Halliburton is a huge company trying to stay afloat in a bad oil economy. So when it comes time to cut cost it's the employees that end up paying for it."
good,"I believe everyone has a unique opinion about the place to work. I consider myself a hard worker and responsible about the work I do represent. try to make it the best as I can and do help out the other people at work because I believe a team work. My main reason for finding another place to work, mostly because of being disrespected as a second language speaker or not having straight work schedule."
good,"Great pay, great benefits, but no family life. Once you have an awesome crew it's fun. Balancing home life with work is almost impossible. This is not a job for everybody."
good,"Good job yet can be fast paced at times. I have learned alot about how the mantenance dept. works. Management is good but could always be better, great co-workers. Hardest part of job is getting the help I need when I ask. most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships I have built over the years."
good,"Field Engineer- Halliburton-Sperry Drilling Services"
good,The job itself was good u get to work on new and old cars that came through the shop. The pay was not very good but I was a newcomer as well. I had to leave due to the 1hr drive I had to make but good company.
good,It's like any other job you go there to work and that's that expectations are set high but the pay does not make up for it let alone the hours they keep taking things away and wanting more they stopped providing transportation to people from out of town and cutting back on hours on tools to work on equipment and even parts I used to be very happy here but the management here don't want to waste any money overall it's an okay company any where else but the San Antonio district
good,"The thing I do is to go to my 'do list' and check out outstanding items that were not attended to the previous day. New tasks are also included. This is done to put me on track for the day's job."
good,"I loved my job at Interscope Manufacturing, but when oil prices went down the cell shut down resulting in layoffs. I was one of the ones they kept. I am a very rounded person when it comes to production and the daily duties of a machine shop. I gave Interscope 6 months more of my time to see if my original job would come back, oil stayed down and so did the cell. So now I am looking for something along the lines of what my resume states. I am a jack of all trades. I believe I would be an asset to any company."
good,"Every day was enjoyable to work here."
good,"Not a bad place to be!  There are a lot of bright, talented individuals within the company.  It has weathered the downturn as well as could be expected."
good,Travel was the aspect I enjoyed most and the opportunity to interact with people from other countries and cultures are what I truly enjoyed about working on this job.
good,Felt like I was never part of the team the last time I was there. Some co-workers were ok to work with. A lot of individualism there. Upper management had no trust or faith in employees capability.
good,I loved working for Halliburton.  I found my job both enjoyable and challenging.   It allowed me to continue to learn and travel.   My co-workers are now life-long friends.
good,"Good life-work balance however does not let you work remotely. The location is getting too far away."
good,An excellent company to work for that shows the proper way to accomplish the job in the least amount of time and how to do safely.
good,"The usually day consisted of either waking very early and heading out to locations to run fracking jobs around the Hannesville play, or working in the office learning all about the equipment we used."
good,"- 8-10 hour shifts"
good,"I'm not gonna say it's a bad job but it's not my cup of tea. You always hear ""you make a lot of money working at Halliburton "" I thought it was cause you got paid like 20+ a hour with full time. But no you make a lot of money from working overtime. And with overtime I didn't like it. I wanted to work overtime if I want to but it's basically if the boss tells you to stay you stay. The off days aren't my cup of tea. They say 6 days on 3 off but that's not to true."
good,"Fun to work at, co-workers are typically very helpful and willing to teach. Management is very approachable and willing to listen. Great benefits package. There tended to be a few obstacles to getting parts to complete a job, but they are getting increasingly streamlined. Daily duties varied by the day keeping it interesting every day."
good,"I liked working for Halliburton. They had great pay and great benefits. I was really never bothered from my bosses, I took care of my work and did a good job. I knew the oilfield would drop off oneday. I thought I was safe after four years with Halliburton. That is why I stayed loyal to them after a lot of senior hands jumped ship to go consulting. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While a LOT of senior hands that stayed, including myself, were laid off, they kept mostly new hands that had been there a year or less. I know I would have taken a cut in pay."
good,"Halliburton is one of the largest providers of products and services to energy industry. The company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field. Presently working with Halliburton`s Oil and Gas division handling Early Production Systems (EPS)."
good,"decent money, fun people. 2 weeks on with 1 week off is nice. a lot of travel though. good benefits. strong company to work for and with good reliability."
good,"•	Responsible for management, leadership, accountability and competency of various personnel and crews."
good,"For this role I went to Amarillo College and acquired a CDL in order to work on a drilling crew. It was hard work but overall I made life long friends while learning a new skill. I was on the hydraulic fracturing crew working 14 days on and 7 days off, 12 hour days. I learned a new level of what it means to work as a team at a level that safety and production is completely dependent."
good,"Sperry had good values before joining the Halliburton.  Tools were much better and efficient that SLB and Baker, but Top management of Halliburton did not continue developing the technology to improve MWD/LWD tools compare to the competitors.  They fall behind and loose the market."
good,"The pay and benefits were great but, Mel Gabel was over my office and he single handedly ran it in to the ground causing us to lose 90% of our offices work which in turn caused lay-off's of more than 75% of the halliburton directional drillers. However, he has been transfered to the global office now and the new boss seems to have his act together and has actually started gaining jobs instead of losing them."
good,Received chance to crossover and learn the management and parts warehouse side of business has taught me a lot. Hours are long need more of a family job
good,I really enjoyed working there. Communication needs more work. Most of my co-works were great and I made some possible life long connections there.
good,"Not a  bad workplace, people are friendly, you can learn a lot, you get to travel if you want to. The co workers were nice. The job was easy."
good,"Working for Halliburton was a great experience. I learned so much in the 8 years of working there. A typical day at work consisted of something different every day, although the shifts were long, the work made up for it as the time seemed to go by so fast and never seemed to drag out. I met people from all over the place and made some great friends. The hardest part of the job was probably the traveling away from family quite a bit. The most enjoyable was probably the pay and benefits that came with it. There was always a way to move up and further your career."
good,"I mean the title in most senses of the word:"
good,"The environment at work is very nice. All the co- workers , lead and manager even are helping and funny."
good,"In Halliburton safety is more priority than anything. They provide all the safety equipment and provide training and seminar as well. I learned to be more focus in quality because they only allowed you to have a 3 non-conformance for the whole year and challenge also to be a ""quality champion for those who doesn't have non-conformance. The management also present every month company status by it's profit or status. The management also want us to focus on be productive and efficient every job we do. Most of my co-worker is Malay, some are Indians that also a foreigner like me. They all kind and helpful in work is talking about. The hardest part of my job is when you face some chattering issue for thread and ovality for part's material. Doing rework is the most enjoyable part in my job because it's a good challenge and i learned a lot from it. So every time my leader ask me to rework the part, I'm happy to do it."
good,Very good people to work with good company and benifits pay is not as expected for working offshore but you do learn alot and often chances to transfer to different divisions through out the company
good,"EXcelente empresa tecnicamente hablando para aprender y conocer el sector petrolero, "
good,"Not the best company that one can ever be empolyed by, but it is still good."
good,"Halliburton was a reliable job. A strong company that took care of its employees with medical, dental coverage. Alot of very long hrs 12 to 17 hrs a day. If your the traveling sort alot of travel,home very little,living in man camps, motels,hotels."
good,"Ive been with Halliburton 2 1/2 years and It has not been as enjoyable as I first thought It was going to be. Long hours, Poor hourly pay rate, HORRIBLE management and almost no life. I recommend for anyone looking to join the Halliburton team to get your 1 year experience and leave as soon as possible."
good,"Halliburton was a fun place to work. Everyone was super easy to get along with and my Supervisors were great. They were very flexible with schedule, although I worked full time, I could always get off for appointments and emergencies. The hardest part of the job was the intense problem solving, but overall, even that wasn't too bad. The one problem I did have was they aren't very good in the payroll department. Three times I had a hard time getting them to pay me correctly and after separation, I had a hard time getting my last paycheck."
good,"active &observe equipment and operators do satisfy tasks"
good,Nice place to work. Can get a bit stressful but that comes with the terrority. 
good,"The over work experience was great had its good and bad parts. The worst part of the job was people were rude and inconciderate to the cleaning staff and would leave us with some nasty, and I mean nasty chores to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was most of the people there."
good,Professional united group. Good equipment. Interesting work
good,"One minute you may have job next you may not, but benefits are great."
good,"A typicaly day at work involves traveling to a well rig to perform a logging operation of the well. The experience was new to me, as is for many who are unfamiliar with the oil field business. The oilfield is a dynamic environment, with plenty of work and plenty of people willing to work in. The hardest part of the job is being away from family and friends for extended periods of time, with little or no rest from days on. Layoffs are common when the oilfield booms are gone. The most enjoyable part is probably the pay, since thats why so many are attached to the work. The co-workers are some the hardest working around, and most are friendly. Management is keen on safety and reliability, so a sharp mind is required."
good,"It was a good experience for a first job out of school. they like people who are boss pleasers. They are not afraid to cut your pay, if you let them. Don't be afraid to tell the what your worth!"
good,"Oil feild job. "
good,"Mainly revenue drives the company, with loose strategy and strong execution. But profit is mostly awarded, which creates a confusion in the employee mind to understand the company's drive. The top management has difficulty to transform their vision in small changes in the short term."
good,"Worked in a safe environment at most of Rig Sites, performing customer assistance and technical support to obtain great results on every job executed."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Halliburton.  But over my almost 20 years the culture seems to have changed from a top-notch, well managed organization, to a somewhat rudderless company-- at least from where I sat."
good,I left HES to go to work for SWS because SWS offered me a great raise. SWS gave me additional responsibility and opportunity for sales and management. That was another reason why I took the job.
good,"When working in logging the typical day was always controlled by the rig operations, which could vary considerably. There was always such a wide variety of responsibilities to be taken into consideration but with good training provided by the company the challenges could be handled well, also, an awful lot is learned. The management were very talented personnel who were in the positions they were in for a good reason."
good,"Ok pay, great benefits, not very good hours, started out ok then went on a 12 hour shift really hurt my paycheck, management is way to high strung and corporate with their hr is the worst, equipment was very poor at my location operating many of the pieces of equipment from the 80's and some earlier very unsafe and unreliable."
good,bonne ambiance au sein de l’effectif avec une culture assez diversifiée
good,"HSE as No.1 Priority. I've learn about technical and practical stuff, meet up with customers, and prepare tool as per requirement to meet customer satisfaction. Have a very great colleague. The hardest part would be the emergency load out. The best time would be meeting with a great satisfaction from customer."
good,"It was a fast paced and challenging position. There was always something to be done, changed, fixed, or discussed at any given point and time."
good,"Отличная компания для начала карьеры"
good,"The company is a great place to work for if you are trying to make alot of money. Overall the long hours do pay off, the job really is not worth working for a long period of time."
good,"Good experience"
good,"Great company. Tough times for the oil and gas industry, but before the market went south. Work all the time, kept you busy, fast paced environment, more work than you can possibly do. You would never finish which is just the way I like it."
good,"I gained a significant amount of knowledge about the Oil & Gas industry while employed with Halliburton."
good,This was a fun place to work focused on company wide safety had a lot of red tape and politics for a company is size the most enjoyable part of the job was the team I worked with along with help other teams in other departments. Would have probably retired from there is not for the downward turn of the oil industry.
good,"Enjoyed my work and the people I worked with, I found it rewarding and challenging to be able to learn new areas of the business."
good,A typical day of work in the yard/base office would be preparing a logging truck with equipment that is required for the field job. The hardest part of the job was miscommunication and unpredictable hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of new things you got to learn.
good,"building and testing tools for the oil rigs, great that they payed for your education, management at tewkesbury facility are fantastic, had a great reliable experienced work force, salary isnt great and regional management made it difficult for employees to get a pay rise."
good,prep work area perform maintenance and clean equipment learned to be a valve mechanic and tester fun coworkers clean work area for next day
good,"receiving call outs through out a 24 hour period for 6 days then having to drive semis all over the dj  basin , i learned how to be a better person show new hires the ropes to help there new job less stressful , the crew that i worked with where all amazing and fun to work with they where my family away from my family the hardest part of the job was dealing with not being home sometimes on the holidays the most enjoyable part of my job was the comrodary that we had for each other"
good,"Enjoyed the 4years I had here, built a strong cohesive team, and managed people well. Generated a lot of new interests and cultivated new relationships realizing additional business."
good,Working a 24-hour on call schedule is a bit tough but you manage to plan for it. You will get a lot of knowledge about the industry at this company. Almost always a chance to move up and change positions because of the quick turnovers. Hardest part of the job may be dealing with the weather but you learn to anticipate that.
good,Halliburton is a company that provides a  great service to each client and making sure that all expectations met.
good,Great pay but your never home to see your family. The work is not too hard. Hours can be long
good,"my time while ive been at halliburton iv'e learned alot "
good,"A typical work day is to be in early, get the necessary head up, and has a quick morning chat with the team, then upon that resuming previously open projects or starting new ones is to be decided."
good,Por ser empresa americana tiene normas rigurosas y bien establecidas. El ambiente es enriquecedor y los colegas con experiencia muy dispuestos a transmitir sus conocimientos en petróleo. Por ser un puesto donde 98% son hombres resulta ser un desafío tratar con ellos.
good,Great company there benifits is awsome. 401k is offerend and they will match you very well. my first day Halliburton gave me 91 hours of paid vacation time.
good,Job is demanding with a lot of hours. A way from home a lot. benefits were good. Advancements was low hard to get any were higher. Management was ok a little demanding . Job culture was not so good. People were not working as a team and a lot of conflicts.
good,"Nesses 5 anos e meio de empresa adquiri muitos conhecimentos e habilidades tanto no escritório quanto no ""campo"" (Offshore ou Onshore). Fiz alguns colegas de trabalho e muitos amigos de trabalho."
good,"For me regular work day is field job somewhere on remote location"
good,"work far from home, lots of hours poor hourly pay but overtime double time makes up."
good,"aprendisaje en hidrocarburos respeto veracidad, ejecusion de mis labores agradable a mis superores"
good,"Preplanned jobs verification of calculations and information with customer"
good,"Great training , but dangerous work. Workers live by the book and regulations. I will one day return for a yard job and not go out in loction. Dedicated workers that get the job done"
good,awesome company and great benefits. fast paced environment with potential to grow with the company. lack of communication sometimes but for the most part a thriving company.
good,Good place to work specially if you are looking for good work life balance. Decent working hrs. Helpful people and rewarding. Recent downturn has impacted the company where a lot of talent has left the company for greener pastures.
good,"Oil & Gas industry giant a great work place great co-workers. Great company safety programs in place for personal. Training resources are great when available to the employee, due to excessive work demand which is great."
good,"empresa con buen sostenimiento laboral, diferentes culturas laborales se aorende mucho se adquiere buena experiencia."
good,"Good experience. Motivative enviornment, saftey is the main motive of every company and halliburton is one of them.every one have individual responsibility towards their job..senior operators and supervisor are very helpfull in all activities mostly during rigup and rig down.overall it was a gtood experience."
good,"Excellent pay, would like to have been home more. Excellent resources provided to do job. Great benefits."
good,"The typical workday evolves checking emails, prioritizing projects, meeting with engineers and designing new parts."
good,"control rig up and rig down duties control aperture and departure of equipment to and from locations, hold safety meetings before and after shifts, treat the jobs and control the sand operations"
good,"The job required a lot of physical labor. Often you would be lifting heavy pieces of iron, and hammering it together with sledgehammers all day. There were a lot of good aspects such as the pay and the benefits. I would say the pay and benefits were top notch. We worked a god awful amount of hours, but it would be over the course of two weeks. After the two weeks we had a full week off and it was like that the whole time. The best part was on your week off you still got paid for 40 hours. Overall I'd say it's a good job for anyone willing to put up with a very demanding hard labor job. You have the opportunity to make 6 figures after your first year starting from the bottom."
good,"Refer attached resume"
good,"This is a great and rewarding company with good management. The salary and benefits are great and the training is very good. Most people you will wok with are engineers and a great source of information for training. Most of your training will be in the field working."
good,"12hrs a day monday through friday. learned diffrent departments from machine operator to heat stress operator, material conditionor. night manager is really good and has great communtcation skills to get things done. my coworkwers are great. job is not hard at all "
good,"The pad is always wet during any weather. Other employees were always willing to help with any task. Not a lot of driving a commercial vehicle, most of the time was spent on the pad."
good,Pay and advancement are very good every body works together like family only draw back away from family for days at a time and only home a short time.
good,"A global company with good environment but during current oil & gas industry, all position is unstable & we do not receive any salary increament since 4years ago"
good,"I was a summer intern, but the economy collapsed a bit in 2012, so they weren't able to offer my job upon graduation. However, they are hiring like crazy now. I had good managers, it was just a bit too structured for me, a bit too much like the Army. Great benefits if you're willing to work your tail off. Not the ideal job for a family man."
good,Divers bedrijf met vele mogelijkheden die betrekking hebben op de olie en gas wereld
good,muy buen ambiente de trabajo comprometido con la seguridad y el medio ambiente
good,"I  was Laid Off, other that the experience was great. Long drives and Long Hours, Not really into that! That's all for now."
good,Great place to work with great benefits.  Unfortunately with the gas prices so low I was part of a mass layoff.  Excellent severence package.
good,Great Career built with this company. Met a lot of good people. Im glad I have had the opportunity to learn and build my career here.
good,the last 2 and 1/2 years have been great up until recently. Currently we do not have a shop foreman and they do not care about hiring new employees to replace the currently understaffed mechanic's shop.
good,The hardest part of the job was working the night shift. I enjoyed the co-workers and the actual work wasn't to taxing. Policy seemed to be changing constantly. Worst part of the job was title changes and pay decrease.
good,I learn alot at my job how to use different kinds of equiment and how to fix them on the go and most days are easy some other days it might be nothing but alot of work and my co workers become more that the become family you are with eachother more than youre family sometimes and the hardest part is if you have a family you are away from home six days out of the week.But the most enjoyable of my job is the experience i get from all of it!
good,"es un trabajo que exige de ti mismo, en el que te puedes desarrollar y aprender muy bien si asi tu lo deseas."
good,"I work as a lab tech testing and designing cement slurries, frac fluids, and acid designs. I had no previous experience before this job, but Halliburton fully trained me. I have made many new friends working here. It can be a bit stressful at times with the workload, but realistically it makes the day go by pretty fast. The pay could be better for the importance of our job. I have learned many valuable skills I can utilize in future professions in the oil and energy industry."
good,halliburton was a good company to work for if u wanted to get into the oil field for the first time.
good,Very good work environment and work ethics management are very nice and experienced but like I said before salary is not that great and I’d rather work a 14-14 hitch
good,"cultura laboral. bien hecho, lo que se hace.manejo de criterios.satisfaciones  calificacion del cliente"
good,good employer i was senior dispatcher booking equipment back from offshore it could be busy on a day to day basis next day it could be quiet for periods of time
good,I go in every morning and start my day at 8AM. Some days 7AM. Send out our morning emails for bits to be selected to be repaired. Make work orders and paper work throughout the day for us to be able to keep record of how much a repair will be. Also what has been or needing to be repaired. At the end of the day I am billing which is probably the most consuming part of my day.
good,"productive workplace, great staff, not enough hours or pay, great working environment great learning experience only problem is the amount of hours and the pay was not of enough for the amount of work that needed to be accoplished"
good,"I enjoyed working for Halliburton. Retirement plan, stock purchase plan, great people. good learning opportunity. well earned money while out in the field working."
good,Trabalho offshore. Principal cliente Petrobras. Operações de grande responsabilidade. Cuidado com o meio-ambiente.
good,In house fights on location being under minded by other employees workers not following company code of conduct HR department does not keep complaints confidential employees may let if they complain about problems at work there numerous times workers broke company policy
good,In overall  my 10 yrs was great I had fun learning and meeting new people  I hated managers that were pulled and replaced all the time you could not have a stable relationship or work place with the rules being changed every year or department  changes it was said they get rid of the experience people and keep the new sad real sad
good,"This was a temporary job, it was meant to serve as a placement until the position being held for me opened.  Although I enjoyed the new experience, the day to day operations and living conditions were not for me.  I decided to end my position."
good,"Hours are bad, single mans game, there is no time to anything but work. Corrupt system on how to advance, Great pay though and bonuses make up for many things after you start working for a year."
good,Managers not to inclined to help associates move up. lots of manual labor and driving required class a cdl liscense with tanker hazmant and doubles abd tripples endorsements

good,buena empresa a nivel mundial lider en drilling fluids
good,"Great Leadership and compensation. You get what you put into this job. Work life balance is not that great, but tolerable for young engineers looking to pursue and enhance their engineering skills. Would recommend friends to work here."
good,"Working with Halliburton is not bad, but they call for job without intimating 2-3days before. Attitude of few personnel working is not supportive.  They are expecting more but pay scale is very low."
good,"If you're not one of the ball suckers then you don't get the jobs with the good bonus attached to it. Low base salary that's barely minimum wage, the money is in the job bonuses. Really great benefit package. Most of the guys are ok, but there are several ""typical"" oilfield workers who think that they're ""god's gift"" and who party all night and try to be ""safe"" all day."
good,"Extremely conservative and politically driven culture."
good,"I've learned a lot about safety and I caught on quick with the work. On a typical day I may be either doing pump maintenance, measuring acid, or sand maintenance. The culture is only certain people get advanced very quick even with no experience. The hardest part about the job is only being able to be home a week with my family, 2 weeks would be great. I feel the company makes more money than crews are actually paid. Great job though it has some room to grow and be even better than what they already are."
good,"I spent many years as a desktop systems analyst at Halliburton.  Over the years the company shifted the responsibilities of the position many times.  At the outset people in my position maintained PCs, printing and assisted in network troubleshooting and software installations.    I was able to save the company money by recommending and implementing network infrastructure changes that improved performance while reducing costs."
good,Halliburton its a good place to work you will learn the intense part of the job. its a good place to incur a career. you will learn how to operate different equipment.
good,"good hours when oil is up"
good,"was a good start to the oilfield industry. only problem is you discover that pay is better from many other companies. upper management gets paid well, the hands however, get started a lower wages than other companies."
good,"they feel everyone is replaceable You are just a body for them. they don't care what you do for them, as long as the make a profit."
good,"Halliburton is a great place to start your career in the oilfield. They have better training than most. They have excellent benefits, but the pay is the lowest in the industry. There is definitely room for advancement, but they are leaning more towards people with a college degree these days. It's not the same oilfield it was 20 years ago."
good,"Depends on the department you are in and who you work for in this industry they do. I believe in hard work, not overworked! It's really a ""young man's"" job and not for anyone that wants to excel very quickly up the ladder. "
good,"this is a ok job if your single,because you will be away from your family two to three weeks at a time.it extremly demanding job working and very harsh conditions,they talk about safety and have you go through all the training and classes to cover their best interest,but once your in the field all that safety training goes out the window and is a joke,unless a big wig comes on to the job site.the money is good when your making the tons of over time,but when it slows down your struggling,so save for all the rainy days."
good,"I worked in the maintenance shop of the Muncy PA location.  "
good,"1. Okay so a typical day at work for me consists of waking up to a phone call, having one hour to get to work, getting in my truck doing a proper pre-trip inspection, driving in convoy to a wellsite location, usually wait for the rig to finish casing ( this can take up to days to complete), rig up our iron, pump our cement into the well, rig down our iron, drive to our yard, go home."
good,Good company with great training and safety programs. Opportunity for growth. There can be a language barrier at times. Poor pay rate compared to other companies and job stability is an issue.
good,Most of my time was scheduling and managing EE's. Tried to learn something everyday. Mostly a fun place to work and was given the ability to design and come up with new ideas.
good,"Halliburton has lost a lot of what made it a great place to work. If management would care more about the employees who are the real heros of the work place, it might be worth sticking it out with them until retirement. As of late, they seem to take away benefits, cut hours, and work you harder because of less people overall from layoffs, and still expect people to stay."
good,"It was a great place to learn. Lots of projects from train speedometers to down hole logging tools.  Towards the end of my career there, I was technician running my own projects with engineers working in support of me!. Too bad Halliburton no longer does research in the USA.."
good,"Halliburton is a good company, but it does have many flaws.  A lot of the upper management are good though.  I don't agree with some of the business strategies lately which has resulted in poor service quality.  For a company that prides their selves one service quality, they do not show it.  Halliburton is a company to build a career with, but only if you know how to maintain business/family ratio.  Halliburton will take up all your time if you let it."

good,"Es una empresa que da buenas remurenaciones economicas,así como prestaciones."
good,great place to start and gain some knowledge and experience in the industry. scheduling is a little tough getting used to but money is decent
good,"Division I was in had zero ethics, the only thing important was that something was shipped out the door.  Input from experienced individuals was over-shadowed by the ""how soon can we get it out the door"" attitude, even when a product or component was known to be ineffective or would fail when used."
good,"Ежедневная подготовка оборудования для использования его на последующей работе.Изучение вновь поступившего оборудования, что является для меня достаточно интересным моментом в моей работе. Непосредственный руководитель не может обеспечить грамотным персоналом для проведения работ , которые являются достаточно специфичными, работу приходится выполнять фактически самому."
good,"My day started early in the morning with a long van ride to location. Followed by a long day outside in the elements. After the day was done it was back to the hotel for roughly 4-7 hours of sleep and then back to work. This was repeated for 14 straight days and then we were given off for 7 days. "
good,"Empresa onde estou desenvolvendo no ramo offshore ,com manutenções a bordo."

good,Halliburton has trained me in the field of explosives. I work 12-15 hours day in a bunker type building. I'm on a 11 & 3 schedule which means 11 days on and three days off

good,"Spend more time at work than home, decent pay, little job security, average 16 hours a day, but creates a great work environment with fellow coworkers."
good,"Well testing division is closed.  They did not have any standardized placement or position assessment in place when I was there so it was cliche-ish.  The department head left and then everything went to s.h.i.t.  It was the blind leading the blind.  Several issues were pushed aside or simply ignored.  The main being the scope and quality of the equipment we had to perform the jobs with the amount of gas, water and oilwe were making on the wells.  We were doomed to failure on that alone.   It seemed like we w"
good,"You will learn about the oilfield extensively. Training opportunities are abundant. Competency system here ensures the customers have competent crew on location, but it stalls entry level employee advancement. Be prepared to learn patience."
good,if you can get past the coddling of the gen x and the lack of trust from the management you'll last a year or so...……………………………………………………………………………………………
good,La Cia te daba las herramientas necesarias para desarrollar el potencial humano.
good,Great place to learn about the oil field and different types of services needed to drill and produce oil.  Opportunity to work in different groups that are part of different stages in oil well life.
good,"Company was ok to work for. However, they did not respect scheduled days off. Many rotations of working 5-7 weeks straight in order to fill in for other employees."
good,"When interviewing I had no idea what type of work I was being hired for. I just knew it would be in the mechanical realm as my resume is loaded with that type of experience. After being here a while I can't understand where they looked at my resume and placed me in the position that I am in. My background tells whoever that looks at it that I troubleshoot problems, diagnose problems, and handle the situation accordingly. My current position does none of that. I'm confused as to what they thought they saw when they went over my resume."
good,Pay is great but you spend a lot of time in the field. The management has very lose rules and follows them only when it fits there purpose. The people are great to work with.
good,"safety oriented, great training program, great benefits, supply housing or man camps, none competitive wages, no communication, typical oilfield buddy system,"
good,"you will be hated when you can do your job well enough and can prove a lead wrong,  then you will have a target on your back after that,  everyone leaves this company for that reason"
good,Loads of great people with the best intentions. Overlapping layers of management is a problem. Loved working for the company though. Pros outweighed the cons....
good,You can make a lot of money fast. They also offer training and certification which is nice. Really long hours and day with no work life balance.  Great job for someone who is single with no family.
good,"I'm sure Halliburton is a great company but I happened to be placed in a department that was in the middle of being sold off, so we had a wage freeze and I couldn't transfer out or apply to different positions in the company. The future of the department was in limbo with no end in sight, so I left. My boss tried to tell me the sale would go through within the month but I knew better. After I left the deal collapsed."
good,"O setor no qual eu trabalho, Setor de Pipeline, muito pesado e pouco serviço técnico!!"
good,I enjoyed working for Halliburton. The pay was low but the training was great. In my time here I moved up fast but once I was moved to different location the supervisor did not allow you to take classes to move up within the company to reach goals that you set for yourself. The pay was very low but worked a lot of hours to get good pay. I don't mind working a lot of hours I just wish the hourly pay was better.
good,"- Friendly working environment"
good,"As a Console Supervisor I overlook the building and gate officers on duty, I also monitor the Fire Panels and all incoming building alarms for several sites. I am usually managing the Console alone, however when I am speaking with the other officers on shift it is always a pleasure. I would say the hardest part of my job is watching upper management abuse their authority and the lack of respect they have for the employees. The most rewarding part of  my job is listening my officers express to me how they wouldn't want to be on any other shift but mine due to fairness."
good,Mentored drilling fluid engineers. Looked over reports to ensure proper procedures were followed. Acted as a liaison between Drilling Consultants and drilling fluid engineers.
good,Enjoyed my supervisors and co-workers. This job was a pleasure to go to everyday. I was able to use my computer skills daily in order to perform my job successfully.
good,Halliburton is a great company and tries to take care of its employees.  As for a normal work day depends on the job you hold with them.  You could be waiting for a phone to ring at anytime for a job and sometimes you could be going into the office everyday.  For the most part you have pretty good co workers.  Sometimes when markets are demanding people at high volumes the quality of people are not as great.  The hardest parts of the job is work life balance and scheduling time away from work.  The work life balance comes from getting calls not only during business hours but across weekends and being on call 24/7.
good,"A typical day at work, would start of with a morning meeting discussing JSA, toolbox talk, Safety, and the task that needs to be done.  What I noticed is I learned something new everyday.  As for management their are simply selfish.  My coworkers are like family now,especially been that we've put some many days and hours together working.  The hardest part of the job was being on call at night.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having a job that you loved."
good,"The main thing learned other than your normal knowledge about the tools and equipment being used is how to deal with the customer and how best to meet their expectations while at the same time maintaining company policies. "
good,This was a year contract position to implement new SAP solutions globally. It was a great project and a great team to work with.
good,"good company to work for. Hard to get job advancement due to high overturn in management. Underpaid for years of experience. Buddy system in lower management. Company used to do a lot more for employees like gift cards, luncheons, but due to volitility of industry had to cut back."
good,"I've worked for Halliburton on and off for 19 years. The starting pay is always l, but if you show some initiative you can move up quickly."
good,"Lacking follow up from procedures passed down from management to field supervisors. Example, upper management says do one thing then field employees say okay, and do another or just what they were doing before.  Pretty easy to move up in the company if one is willing to put in time and show initiative. Working with crew members they begin to feel like a family as you spend 100 hours a week with them."
good,"leave man camp drive to location and frac sometimes rig down move equipement and rig back up at new location . supervisors are great ,the team effort is great too and the team concept is awesome"
good,"While not managed in a way that favored all employees, safety was a dominating factor in the daily work environment. Pay was at the upper end that I have received at various jobs. The variety of jobs and conditions kept you from getting bored for certain."
good,"Oil industry is an amazing place to learn from about our energy resources. How its made, where is comes from, how its processed, etc. You will work very hard when you do work and in all the elements. It taxes the personal life and trying to get sleep. Not a great place to work if you are concerned for your health. Many unhealthy things that the oil industry brings."
good,"A place where and employee can move up his career with all the apt training in due course of time. "
good,"Used to be a fun pleace to work, when everyone would work hard to grow thier carrer"
good,"Management styles/effectiveness for each department varies by location. I had bad management at one location and much better management at another location."
good,Great pay and benefits but job work/life balance isn't the best for the kind of job I chose. Not the company's fault but that's just the job. Job security depends on the demand of work by oil companies which is increased or drastically reduced depending on the crude oil price. Management is not the best but isn't bad either.
good,"Expenses and vehicle got cut, wages got cut down, work slowed down unless if you was in the click bunch or yes man. Plus having people that was never on rig telling you what you need to do."
good,"me gusto que es una compañia primer mundista y las herramientas que te brinda para superarte profecionalmente son buenas, los equipos son de una buena forma operacional y lo mas avanzado en tecnologia."
good,"A empresa em si é muito boa, fornece vários cursos de capacitação ao profissional, porém a gestão de alguns setores deixa um pouco a desejar."
good,"Great job, not a lot of home time. Management is good,and the crews are a great bunch of people."
good,Made good money here in the short period of time I was employed here but I did feel we were under paid hourly for some days the work could be a lot.
good,Enjoyed working with management on the on-board computer project.
good,"Hard to advance. Training and advancement system is not very advanced and has alot of problems. Good bunch of guys, good safety program."
good,"Demanding work, great benefits. Great place to start for entry level into oilfield."
good,Halliburton was a great company to start with. The Management group was very helpful and encouraging when I was starting out in wireline. As I gained experience they helped me progress in my career.
good,"Halliburton provides good benefits, 401K matching, health insurance, etc. maybe average pay.. Not a lot of job security when theres a downturn in drilling, oil & gas production.."
good,"Always learning something. That's important in IT. Generally people are friendly.  People usually appreciative of the help given. "
good,Halliburton was a good company to work for when the price of crude oil was high and the company was extremely profitable.  I did experience gender discrimination in the early days when few women worked for oil field services companies.
good,"Halliburton is a good company and they take care of their employees but you have zero time for a life outside of Halliburton. If you have a family the schedule is pretty rough for field personnel. Two weeks on one week off, 14/7 schedule."
good,"On average I was offshore working on drilling rigs 250 days per year. I did make ~$200,000.00 one year, but did not have much time with my family. At the time of my departure from Halliburton, I was still working 250 days, but due to cutbacks, I only made ~$140,000.00 my last year."
good,"Great place to learn and make some contacts, but not the best place if you want career growth that matches your aspirations.  You constantly have to keep pushing your managers to move you to different areas for continued growth.  Also, the work life balance is horrible as you are away from your family 2/3 of the year.  Some people can tolerate that."
good,"A great job for a single guy-very tough hours and on call status makes it hard for a family man - although the pay is great, it is hard to be away from the family as much as is required"
good,"Had good training and teamwork.  Upper management was not overly concerned with everyday employees.  When oil prices fell, there were massive layoffs,"
good,"Spent several years with the company and learned a lot. Got to work in a team environment and for the most part everyone helps out. You will get opportunities to assume plenty of responsibility however getting paid for the position you will be assuming takes some time. What I can offer you is go work in the places that no one wants to go work. There, you will be able to move up and get promoted. Also the more places you go work that no one is willing to, you will feel like more than just a number and actually feel that you are valued. Management does care about keeping you around because again finding a competent worker in areas people do not want to work in doesn't just come around everyday. Obviously this isn't the highest paid company to work for, but usually more stable than what the others offer."
good,"Management rotates every 18-24 months"
good,certain people have ruined what halliburton stands for. there are people who cannot be happy for others and would do whatever it took to ruin there career.
good,"My time with Halliburton was from 1978 -2000 so this review is dated. Please consider this old information. "
good,long hr but a good place to work and make money. Some of Management are good at there job but my manager was not a good one. he never help you when you ask but if you where a girl he was there help you if need.
good,Big brother. Stressful away from family very dangerous quicknpacrd lifestylr. Too much racism and closed minded empkoyees. Alcohol use is encouragef and joked about.
good,"At the time a typical day was hectic due to the setting up of our work space and the contract. Pemba logistically was not easy."
good,"I learned a lot at this company, there were incredibly long hours. There was a strong training program and mentor ship. Most of the employees are stressed and lacking family life."
good,"I had never been in that type of environment before. it makes to adjust fast. so it was sink or swim type training. but being a part of the ""oilfield family"" we all understood we had to make sure to trust the guy next to you so you could both get home to the family."
good,"Enjoyed it, but lack of growth for young engineers. The new company structure  made advancement nearly impossible. Variety or projects decreased as you were pigeon holed into one product type."
good,"Boa empresa, contudo deixa a desejar na questão de falta de meritocracia, pois pelo menos no segmento em que trabalhei ainda impera a questão política forte e onipresente. Não existe um parâmetro de avaliação de desempenho do funcionário para o desenvolvimento de sua carreira, embora eles estivessem tentando estabelecer essa prática na época que saí."
good,It was a desk job that involved coding a lot. Being an intern position it was clear there was not much expected of us. Our supervisors had their own work to accomplish and we were left to our own devices.
good,Oil field operations and support is for a young man without family. you work long hours with little time off but get paid very well. Expect to travel and be gone often.
good,"Halliburton is a company that compensates is employees very well, ensures employees have the necessary items to complete their task safe and efficient. Halliburton is always looking for ways to improve their process."
good,"Great opportunity where I could function with Corporate oversight but also make local improvements and make the locations I represented better for the employees.  My hat is off to any Oil and Gas field worker...long hours, away from your family in sometimes dangerous conditions."
good,"Poor balance between work and life.  Working all the time"
good,"Halliburton is a great company to start a career with. They provide training and testing to obtain a class A CDL at no cost to the employee. The health benefits were amazing and started the day that you were hired on. I started working as an operator assistant out in the field. From there I transferred into the bulk plant to allow me more time with my family. I moved up very quickly, which was great at first, but quickly made it to a position which did not allow me to move any further."
good,I've enjoyed working at Halliburtion due to the company's insistence on excellence and offering business value. I built a strong work ethic and great communication skills.
good,"Was a great place and opportunity for growth, very large company with many locations. Co-workers become close friends and family because of the two weeks on, one week off."
good,Fill tanker with production water. Properly document weight and volume of production water.  Haul production water to disposal . Allow waste water to be disposed of properly . Repeat this process for entire day .
good,Very good people to work with and spend time with. Was very physical work with long hours and little to no time off. very good benefit package but had little time for family
good,"es una gran empresa  y una gran escuela profesional."
good,"Good people to work with"
good,"Like all businesses in the Oil Industry, Halliburton has highs and lows.  This last one was one for the books, but don;t count this company out.  Like all businesses, Halliburton has it's dysfunctional moments, but if you're young and want to learn.., this company has a lot of room for advancement and the opportunity to work in a worldwide workforce.  It was a learning experience working there, both good and bad.."
good,I leaned much about the oilfield for this type of work. I really enjoyed working at the PSL until the end. My Management could not have been better. They were always willing to help and teach when an issue would arise that I wasn't able to understand at that moment
good,"Overall a great place to work, long hours and traveling a lot makes for a hard family life. Management has a good understanding of this and it is easy to get time off, in most situations."
good,in and out of hotels. good pay good benefits. hard on family to be away for so long.  Great benefits medical dental.  long hours
good,"Crazy work schedule, but was able to pay off student loans faster than anyone else I know.  Was able to move up very quickly due to booming oil economy in 2011-2014.  Once the bust hit in 2015 pay went down along with job security.  Ended up getting laid off."
good,"Halliburton was the best job I could have dreamed of getting when I started in October of 1997.  But through the years they implemented many changes, not all bad but not all good either, that I feel were not conducive for an oilfield service company.  They seemed to stop caring about their employees and only about the bonuses for the people at the top.  There definitely became a separation through time that was not there when I started.  I do miss the Halliburton I started for but I realize now that I missed my family more."
good,Halliburton as a hole is a great company. Local management could be improved depending on which PSL you are assigned to.
good,"Halliburton has great benefits for an Oil and Gas company but the compensation is very minimal. They will start off most entry positions at $13/hr and raises are very hard to get. Raises are usually at a ""freeze"" point. Working long hours (12+) and barely having the money to get by is rather ridiculous. I have busted my butt for this company only to be demoted from Supervisor to a Lead Technician because they favored another employee, who has less experience, poor spelling and not as great a physical laborer worker as myself, only because they have relatives in the company."
good,Extremely long working hours during a day of work. Mostly 17 to 20 hour days with typically long commutes to job location. Away from home and family for 2 weeks with a week off in between. In the winter temperatures can get down to way below freezing. Worst part is with the economy and current oil prices falling the company has to make numerous cutbacks and it greatly affects the employees income and the moral.
good,"Un ambiente familiar por el numero limitado de personal, todos somos mil oficios lo cual nos ayudo aprender a desempeñarnos en muchas áreas de forma eficiente. Personal profesional muy capacitado por los diversos entrenamientos fuera del país con un muy buen Lider en la gerencia General. Las limitaciones podrían ser la falta de personal y situación coyuntural de país."
good,"This is a great job for one that doesn't mind working long hours. Or doesn't mind being away from home for 2/3 of a month at a time. Benefits are almost 2nd to none working in the field for Halliburton. But when you work for a large company, it feels almost as if you're just a number that can be replaced. Promotions are outlined with steps to take to get promoted, but upper management tends to drag their feet when it comes to giving you a promotion."
good,"Revisaba las publicaciones en el portal de internet se hacia la lista de licitaciones y se esperaba la aprobación de la línea de negocios, una vez aceptada se procedía al plan para hacer la licitación en tiempo y forma."
good,"This is a typical oil field company and aligns it's self as such.  There are pro's and con's to every decision made.  They will take you far if you want, but be careful to balance life and work."
good,"Dinamismo e trabalho sobre pressão, excelente para aprendizadp, na Halliburton vivenciei situações que deveriam ser consideradas como ""impossíveis"" se tornarem possíveis. Na minha opinião quem trabalha na Halliburton está preparado para trabalhar em qualquer empresa no mercado."
good,The Coiled Tubing division provided lots of opportunities to learn and gain knowledge while working with other persons. The Subsea division is a good place to work as far as money goes. The opportunity to advance is decent if you are cool with the right people. Shop suffers because of mismanagement and favoritism of certain persons
good,"a lot of late nights and long days when in field ...."
good,"A typical day at work will start around 3am and end around 8pm. The main topic of everyday is safety, it is something that all must participate in to maintain the safest environment possible. Work is almost always out of doors so the weather can be your best friend and worst enemy."
good,"Interacting with people all day long, and learning from different stages at the operation. As the one taking care of the drilling / completion fluids had the chance to manage situations with the client and distribute time and organize the steps for many operations."
good,"Main duties include the preparation of samples, analysis and logging of cuttings • Recording  monitoring  and analysis of real time drilling data while making this data available for the client in the required formats • Monitoring of hydraulics and gas levels • Gas system technical maintenance • Unit Management and work practices"
good,"Great place to work at. Time flies day by day, people really help as you start and work your way to your position. Would have loved more family oriented environment but its policy does not include much of this."
good,"I worked a lot of long hours and missed out on things, but that's just the way it is working in the oilfield. The work was hard at times when you were tired and wet, but for the most part it was good. Always enjoyed working with others especially the guys on my crew that I trained. I have learned in the 14 years of working at Halliburton that you will meet many good people in this world and some that are not very good. You just have to take the bad with the good and keep your head up and do the best job you can under any circumstance. I have butted heads with many people, but after my job was done everyone was happy because I didn't let it bother my performance in doing my job."
good,"If we got a good management, then it will be the worlds best company. salary and the benefits are awesome in this company."
good,"Safety was a high priority, and the shop was nice and clean."
good,it has a lot of great things going on for work overall it was a great place to work with then everything moved to San Antonio. Other than that I would work there again if I was the manager.
good,Get exposure to work for some very good and advanced technologies and good pay
good,"Too much turnover,one day I came into work the whole mudplant quit!!! I got volunteered to work out there,bout 90-100 hrs in 6 days.Management never came out of the a/c unless someone got hurt!:(.Being a former paratrooper I sucked it up for 6 mos,empty promises in Monahans Tx."
good,five years of experience has me all over location from down hole blender to front yard opening and closeing well
good,"HALLIBURTON EMPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES ADDENDUM  (FIELD ENGINEER)"
good,it was ok high turn over rate. nice work atmosphere. high security so it was very safe good people beautiful buildings. learned different values
good,"Foi minha primeira experiência de trabalho, gostei muito da função em que trabalhei , criei muitos amigos , trabalhei pessado e mesmo com algumas dificultades valeu a pena."
good,"Typical day at work was to wake up after working 2 hours before and having to get ready for the next job."
good,"A typical day can vary between the slow and extremely busy with no time to eat. The day starts at 7am and ending at 5pm. (Give or take) Creating work orders from after hours the previous day and give to the mechanics (if any), issue parts, run new inventory report so that replenishment orders can be made. Help schedule equipment for timely service, check on any outstanding orders or pending service. The PM list on all equipment is updated on a daily basis as needed, printing out the check sheets, scanning completed CS into the work order then filing. Co-workers come in/out of the office all day needing different items, maintenance, window repaired/replaced, needing new registration papers or other paperwork that should be with the unit they are driving. Phone calls are always answered and returned if missed immediately. Inventory counts are run on a monthly basis, bringing inventory into stock is a day to day operation depending on the delivery of the orders. I manually count each box making sure the delivery matches the invoice and checking the order in the computer to verify the purchase order, vendor, amount per each, quantity, and the material before stamping, coding and bringing into stock. Having a PCard is a challenging job having to make sure that what you are purchasing is correct to avoid credits, making sure that you get the appropriate authorization signatures on the requisistions and reconciling daily with all of the supporting paperwork. Keeping busy is the enjoyable part. I keep a good working relationship with all co-workers, customers, inside/outside vendors."
good,There is something always needed to be completed . Working at halliburton gives you the chance to see the work and with the option to transfer anywhere.
good,It was great pay and benefits. It is not the same as its stateside counterpart. Stateside would be my preference.
good,Very good place to work. Great and friendly environment with a balanced work load for the week. Halliburton completion tools in Texas. A twenty minutes drive from the main campus.
good,Halliburton is an excellent employer for job experience. The company has been around for a very long time. Be aware that the oilfield industry is very cyclical and layoffs are common.
good,"Good company to work for.  great place to start my career in the oil and gas industry.  Worked a lot of hours, but was worth it with the knowledge learning"
good,Good place to work and learn. Good Customer and co-worker but no possible to grow-up because I am not a citizen  in the country. Management almost prefer local people to attend the training.
good,"This job is not very good when you have a family if you are not careful it can break your family apart but over all it is a very good company you can make a lot of money and get tons of training and experience in many different thing like running equipment, learn how to rig up frac jobs learn how to set up jobs ,how to drive,"
good,Halliburton is a great company to work for times are slow right now do the downturn in the oil field. When things are good at Halliburton. things are very good when they’re bad they’re very bad.
good,"Halliburton is a great place to work, but like many of the oil and gas companies experiences a lot of downturns in the market.  Unfortunately, many downturns in the market leads to cyclical layoffs.  When layoffs occur the already overloaded resources become even more back logged.  It can be stressful and challenging to manage all the requirements.  When the company is operating at it's full capacity, resources are plentiful and work is manageable."
good,I am able to explore new technologies here and am given the freedom to try out new products. There sometimes is ambiguity when trying to figure out how to grow at this company.
good,I enjoyed working here and loved the team of people I worked with. They really supported you having all the tools and abilities needed to be successful.
good,"Working for Halliburton has its ups and downs, just like at any other company.  The office environment is very nice, and most co-workers are pleasant."
good,Halliburton provides excellent benefits and pay rates. Each employee is treated with respect and has opportunities to advance. Very competitive in each work field and employees also are encouraged to further their  education in different areas of the oilfield.
good,"Muy bien los entrenamientos y capacitacion."
good,Computer work had to try retry and try to get my  Job application on sight once in got a call back having  hazmat  Helped with job ask questions some one got the answer you need.
good,"The interview was not a bad experience. Thorough, but not intense.  Attire at haliburton is casual...jeans, nice shirt. One of the better experiences I've had."
good,"Wonderful company to work for.  There is really no work/life balance.  If you enjoy working 13 hour days with an 1+ hr commute to the hotel/man camp (ie 15+ hr day while in the field) then go for it. I know it is rough, but I personally enjoyed the challenge. "
good,"Been a good experience, nothing of what people say to many bad operational MG. but Halliburton it's a place to retire."
good,"Good management, good team, good crews. we all work like families. no time for play. long hours of work. they sometimes send staffs to school to certifications and licenses."
good,Great Place to work great benefits and great work atmosphere the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I get to work with Ive gotten the opportunity to work with some really great people.
good,"Good training/career improvement opportunity, but not very stable, lots of event, management is ok, friendly working environment, flexible working schedule."
good,"Trabalhei como treinee com carga horária de 5 horas de segunda-feira a sexta-feira mas o coordenador solicitava o horário de 10 horas diárias e alguns finais de semana, por mim sem problemas em trabalhar, porém um único dia eu precisei cumprir meu horário formal e o coordenador de TI disse que ou eu trabalhava 10 horas ou seria demitido então infelizmente tive que cumprir meu horário formal, o que ocasionou em minha saída. Não culpo a empresa, na verdade eu adorei cada experiência grandiosa que tive nesta empresa mas o coordenador de TI não me deixou uma imagem positiva com esta atitude injusta."
good,"First we would have a tailgate meeting discussing about safety, then of to work and lunch at 11am return and back to work until 4:30 pm, I do enjoying working with others in the shop and taking equipment apart then re-assembling them"
good,"overall positive, good environment, great people, focus on health and wellness.  I really don't want to put too much info here, I'm only typing because this is required"
good,"Within Halliburton i got very strong knowledge about the safety and service quality and how make the customer happy "
good,"Good learning experience. For having no experience in the industry before landing this job, the people and the job itself afforded me many learning opportunities about the job which I was to perform."
good,"Work to home life had no balance, the money is amazing but not being around loved ones is very hard. Long 18 hour days were constant along with working every holiday. Management was decent but could've been more receptive to all employees."
good,"Good place to work if you live in Williston.  There is typically a lot of turnover at the bottom rung for the Etech shop, bit those that stick it out can have a really well paying career."
good,I am working as a consultant for Halliburton and do not have specific information about HES. If I knew more about the inner working of the company I would be happy to elaborate.
good,"Good company to work for, however, not all job functions have equal career progression opportunities. The work culture is normal as in any oil and gas company."
good,"On a typical day making sure the drilling parameters for drilling are set up correctly to obtain formation data to interpret for modeling."
good,"Aprimorei minha capacidade de liderança, apliquei treinamentos internos e pratiquei inglês."
good,nice location it was close to my house. I was there for a few years but they lay off all the time. You need a degree if your working in an office but the field no.
good,"Halliburton Company is an American multinational corporation. One of the world's largest oil field service companies, it has operations in more than 70 countries. Halliburton's major business segment is the Energy Services Group (ESG). It offers a broad array of products and services to upstream oil and gas customers worldwide through fourteen product service lines. The exposure I received at Halliburton is great. The work culture was extremely healthy and flexible except for India location. The curiosity was always appreciated and taken positively by my managers."
good,"A typical day at work is fast and your on the go all the time.  I learned a lot computer software as well as oil & gas info. Management was not very good in department where I worked at, but if you can find a good manager then the job should be good to go."
good,"Rewarding, challenging, team work was a plus. Management informed the team of the task that was needed and then let the team complete the task. Work environment was relaxed."
good,"As an intern, I had to stay at one of the field sites for a month away from hometown in the middle of nowhere. They do try to compensate for that but you end up working a lot of hours and away from your family and friends. So it is really hard to balance you work and social life."
good,I have worked there for two and a half year and it was a very fun experience. I enjoyed working there and was a very good working environment. I have learned a lot.
good,"Empresa buena, sin embargo no contratan directamente si no que por outsourcing lo cual hace que el salario sea menor, aún asi esta muy por encima de la media, la organizacion dentro de la empresa tiene muchos puntos a mejorar, pero depende de la linea en la que se trabaja, mucha presion y horarios no fijos"
good,"Pros  productive environment "
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, siempre y cuando te desempeñaras laboralmente bajo las estrictas normas y reglas de la empresa, y como en toda empresa cuando las cabezas empiezan a rotar, pues siempre se van por el mas nuevo, la experiencia y la disponibilidad de uno para hacer su trabajo no se toman muy en cuenta."
good,Great people to work with on location and at the gun shop. Benefits and matching 401k are generous with the ability to purchase and contribute more. Overall a good company.
good,Long hours.  Lots of overtime-working over 100 hrs per week.  Working outside in all types of weather.  4-5 hrs sleep between shifts.  Rotating shifts-2 weeks days then off 1 week then 2 weeks nights.  Tough on families especially if spouse works also.  Alot of self-taught classes thru Halliburton online modules-required.  Culture is about Safety.  Fast paced most of the time-requiring good problem solving abilities.
good,"Like any good company, you get out what you put in. I was able to grow within the company relatively quickly. I enjoyed my time with them. It can be hard on families if you don't know how to deal with being gone a lot."
good,"Productive and good working environment. Good team to work with ."
good,I would be called out for  a job at all hours and would prepare my vehicle.  i would get my work orders and make sure i had food and fuel.  Then i would make my trip to the job and wait for orders.
good,The biggest con in the industry itself which is very volatile. Competition is strong and turnover can be high. Very fast paced environment when industry is strong. Cost cutting when it is not.
good,lots of good people to work with. management is not that great. almost all work is out of town but they do pay for hotel. its a good entry-level company for young single guys.
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar na Halliburton. Na epoca que trabalhei na area de Mudlogger foi uma das melhores épocas de trabalho para mim.Trabalhava com uma equipe maravilhosa e colegas de profissão."
good,"With any job you'll find the pros and cons with corporate politics and difficult-to-work-with coworkers, but overall my experience has been great and I've enjoyed working with my team here."
good,Was not there long enough to get the full benefit of Halliburton Benefits.  History of Increase hiring and as well as mass layoffs so job security is not stable unless you a have rare specialty.
good,"Worked of drilling rig and drilled the well bore, We would work 12-16 hours and would stay with this rig from Spud to TD. I would work 21-28 days before having 48 hours off while they move the rig. "
good,"Overall, Halliburton is a good place to work. It discourage employees from working home so there's less flexibility in case you have doctor appointments and such. They provide good salary but modest benefits."
good,"Over the years Halliburton has been a great company to work for. Recently it seems to be focusing on a younger diverse generations and skipping over the tenured, experienced people. Taking them for granted it seems."
good,"This is by far one of my memorable experience, so much was learned on the field and off. Great staff , great co workers and just an overall great experience. I would recommend employment there to anyone who is interested in a great opportunity."
good,Many great things have come from my career at Halliburton. I wouldn't be as highly qualified as I am today if it weren't for this companies quality training programs.
good,Work life balance is appropriate. Management is hands off as long as you are being productive and meeting deadlines. Opportunity for advancement is limited.
good,"i have learnt a lot while i was in this company especially on the system (SAP).  this is a very useful system.  besides, i also dealt with different levels and groups of people which helped to improve my communication skills."
good,"Halliburton is an amazing place to work.  If you enjoy being challenged, as well as making decisions that actually have an impact on day to day operations, it is the company for you."
good,"Good pay and benefits. Long hours, which impact work life balance. Opportunities of advancement, but the ""good ol' boy"" network is alive and well. Every day brings a new project, so it was never boring."
good,"worked at Halliburton full-time"
good,"Uma empresa dinâmica, de muito aprendizado e com um bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,"Typical oilfield job"
good,"Beginning in Congo Africa putting a workshop together from nearly nothing in a fairly dirty environment."
good,"fue mi primer empleo después de salir de la universidad y la compañía me dio la oportunidad de aprender y de ampliar mis horizontes, es por eso que estoy agradecido."
good,The benefits provided by Halliburton were outstanding and affordable. You were expected to work for long periods of time but compensated pretty fairly.
good,Good Benefits For This Company. The Work Place Was Easy To Get Along With Other Employees. Halliburton  Upper Management In My Opinion Did Not Really Care very Much About  Job Security For Their Employees. They Were Quick To Let Loyal And Faithful Employees Go. They Would Not Stand By Employees That Had A Medical Issue. I Devoted My Self To My Job Taking Time Away From My Home And Family And It Was For Nothing. When You Get Older And Halliburton Replaces You With Someone Younger Even If They Have To Bring Then In From Another State. In The Beginning Of My Time With Halliburton I Loved Working For Them And Would Work 12 to 16 Hours A Day.When I Got Ill I Was Layed Off.
good,Halliburton is a great company that fosters career growth and challenges their employees to continue to develop and enhance their career.
good,"Halliburton es una gran escuela de aprendizaje ya que continuamente capacitan a su personal, su plan de carrera es muy optimo."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, constante capacitación y complementos salariales."
good,Halliburton Energy Services is an amazing opportunity. Leadership and roles are clearly defined but work schedules are often determined by global markets. Other employees come from all different backgrounds which leads to great opportunities for additional learning. The hours can be long and schedules are often multiple weeks at a time leaving family as a second priority. Work conditions are not for the weak at heart and it takes determination to work in the extreme weather. Halliburton does support its employees and offers work life balances as best it can during tough economic times.
good,overall a great place to work. Great benefits and awesome employees.  Hardest part of the job are the long hours. 90% of the time you are working you will be out on a well site. In my position i manage the job and the employees on location and make sure that everything we need is either on location before we arrive or bring with us when the work calls in.  I am also in constant contact with customers while on the job site keeping them informed of the way the job is going.  It is hard to say anything about management  being there have been many changes in the last few months.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you and your team have successfully completed a job and everyone is leaving the job site unharmed.  Safety is and always will be the number one factor on any job/jobsite.
good,"Working at Halliburton was fun and challenging.  Meeting expectations and being willing to work OT when needed is key.  The people (co-workers and managers) are great, and the work is challenging.  There is never a dull moment working in this industry."
good,"Good company, fair to employees, good project work.  Works with many cultures around the world.  Exposure to many different elements and settings within the field of oil and gas."
good,平常時と繁忙時の差がありすぎ、この変化が楽しいと思えないと長くは続けられないと思う。また管理が厳しくないため出来ない人でも何とかやっていけ、ある意味公平ともいえるが、出来る人との差は開くばかりになりがち。
good,"My  job has shown me how to work with diverse employees. From helping out in the shop to going to location and completing jobs. While on location I would give advice about the specifics of our tools as well as some data collection for future reference. While in the office I have completed reports and have completed some job coordinating which includes making job tickets, assigning employees for jobs and making sure we had the correct inventory to complete the job."
good,Its was good working on the road. I learned a lot and a chance to travel to different cities and areas to experience different cultures.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy bueno en los sectores que estuve, siempre hay que seguir las reglas que ya están estipuladas en la empresa."
good,"A good company to work for. Although the hours can be long there are good benefits. You get to work with a great, positive team who are achieving goals. You know at the end of the day that you helped keep the world in motion."
good,"Good experience working as Cementing Service Supervisor."
good,"Halliburton Drill Bits and Services is a industry leader that's focused on customizing their customer needs. They offer Fixed Cutter, Roller Cone and Service Repair for drill bits. The work environment is friendly and management is very supportive of employee development."
good,I have worked as Senior Project Manager in Halliburton. Company spans across the globe and provides great opportunities to travel and relocate. Helpful employees and managers.
good,Learned a lot while working here but internal workings of Halliburton leave a lot to be desired. A lot of in-fighting between departments because revenue is tracked by department and not as a company.
good,"The people that Halliburton hires are knowledgeable and always willing to assist. The culture is somewhat laid back and relaxed, but the quality of work done is high."
good,"Great place and opportunity for growth, very large company with many locations to showcase your abilities and knowledge.  Co-workers become close friends and family over the years.  Due to the nature of the company and being second only to Schlumberger in Oil Service Providers, you suffer through many ups and downs but if your strong enough to survive, the rewards are there for the taking."
good,My immediate co-workers were what kept me sane at the job and why I stayed for longer than I should have.  There is a lot of politics involved in the company and there is a big disconnect between upper level and executive management and the people who actually do the work.
good,Great place to work if you look for a fast pace environment with a lot of thinking on the fly in order to repair the equipment.
good,The company drops people like flies. The economy has to be blame too. Oil market is down the dump and Halliburton is no exception.
good,"good people that are their to help you when needed."
good,Halliburton bought out Europump and was in the process of merging the two companies. Major downturn in the energy industry stopped all plans in their tracks.
good,"Typical day at work: Depending with the current economy, when there's a high activity means have to work thru the night/weekend. It is challenging but satisfying job."
good,"Worked here for over five years and loved working there but for the fact that they hire and fire without consideration for time invested in training. when the oilfield started going slow, instead of laying off the newer hires using the first in last out approach, they look for flimsy excuse to fire older employees with higher pay range so that they do not have to lay off and by so doing do not have to pay any severance package."
good,My manager allowed me to work as long as I wanted on the slope.  I could spend 2 weeks or 4 months at work if I wanted too.  I would go back if I had the opportunity to.
good,"Infelizmente a parte de estabilidade e promoção deixa a desejar, onde pra conseguir aumento tive que mudar de empresa assim como outros profissionais da área."
good,"Halliburton was a good company to work for, they have a good training program, their cement schools are top notch, but pay was below oilfield standards at the time."
good,"long hours lots of travel, its great if your single but hard on a family, but the benefits do make up for a lot of that because your able to provide very well for you family and have a great retirement plan."
good,"Great team setting. Very safety orientated. Great experience and learned a lot. Truck driving, heavy equipment, and technical work experience."
good,Learned how to manage the work when you receive a job. from the first step of preparing and identifying customer needs then to prepare our equipment and making a full plan to the job until the end of the job and review our performance.
good,Halliburton is a dynamic and exciting place to work. The company offers a number of careers options and encourages individuals to develop and fulfil their full potentials.
good,good company great benefits. its hard on family to be away for so long. in and out of hotels better to be single because you will have no life as a hand
good,"Innovation was not encouraged."
good,Halliburton is a fast paced work environment requiring you to pay strong attention to detail and have the enthusiasm to finish job correctly from start to finish no matter the time it takes.
good,Long periods away from family. New experiences. Interacting with people. Mostly nice people to work with. Working with new customers.
good,"Enjoyed my job, got to interact with majority of the departments,"
good,a typical day woud be going into work at 8:00 in the morning and working until at least 6:00 in the evening! rain or shine we worked! my co workers were hard working individuals and I enjoyed working with them
good,Long days and hours but some days of slow.  Can be very stressful at times depending on the area of work.  Work more with the rig crews than your own company employees.
good,Very good company to work for. My day to day activities keep me busy and tend to teach me something new every day. Management is good and keeps us informed on what is needed to know. I have strong ties to co-workers and tend to be more of a family due to the time frame we have worked together.
good,I enjoyed working in the fast paced environment. I learned how to mult-task and manage many different aspects of logistics and operations
good,I enjoyed the first four months working there but after that things went down hill. Management breathed down our necks to get units out when we were months ahead and then when lay off were happening they didn't know how many would be laid off or when.
good,"For the amount of time I have been there, I feel that they have given me the chance for advancement. Overall, good place to work at."
good,"large, underpaying, get in and get out, oil field too volatile. Under educated folks everywhere.  free flights to rigs, free food on rigs"
good,I was part of building various units based around the horse power focus of oilfield equipment.  Some units required proper documentation of traceable items for quality purposes.  Some units required small amounts of testing which was performed in the stall to set the initial tolerance for that piece of equipment.  Management was readily available to answer questions and at time even assist with problems we may deal with in the stall.  I was able to make many good friends over the years while working in multiple areas and enjoyed being around my fellow co-workers.  We sat down at lunch and breaks and spoke often of things going on in our own lives with each other.  The best part about working there over the years was a lot of the people I met and the friends that I made.  I was very fortunate to work with several individuals that passed on a lot of knowledge and experience to me as I worked side by side with them.  Hardest part for me would watching friends/fellow co-workers being walked out during the layoffs.
good,"Great company to work for! Went offshore a lot through out my time working there, good people to work with. i learned a lot about the oilfield at this job, as it was my first job in this field."
good,Great Pay and good safety standards. Good work environment. Very clean. All around teamwork.Very disciplined and long hours
good,Halliburton is an excellent company for being globally sized. The size is where the problem lays. Bottom management has no one overseeing their actions and do whatever they want. Most of them have no experience in supervising or management and were promoted due to being in their field for decades.
good,Halliburton is great company with good benefits. There is room for advancement when the oil industry is good. The most enjoyable part of working there were the other employees I worked with while employed there.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Halliburton is the sense of accomplishment after finishing a job. The worst part is the strain it puts on relationships at home, because you are gone so much. Even after days off you never feel like you are rested."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Emphasis on safety both in theory and practice. My typical day was dealing with various contractors on site or scheduling the right contractor to perform a needed service, managing the day to day needs of the facility to ensure smooth operation and compliance both internally and externally."
good,"-What I learned? Troubleshooting; Lots of it!!!"
good,"Working Frac crew is awesome, swing the sledge and moving the iron is great!!. Hours ""when"" busy are 120 hr a week. 2wk on 1wk off. plenty of time to plan vacation without having to miss work hours. Not a job for family. NO NO NO!. If you don't care about being around family members then this id the job for you."
good,"Halliburton was an ok company to work for, management favored those employees more who would go out of their way to make them feel good and go out of their way to ""help"" the management."
good,"Long days and nights, but very safety oriented company. All men/women were told the specifics of the job and everyone went home safe at the end of the day."
good,"typical days were only over if all the work was finished."
good,A job where the only way to learn it is to live it. The terminology is like no other workplace. My co-workers became family. The most enjoyable part of the job was that every day was different and every field ticket to be reconciled depended on the customer and their individual pricing agreement. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day to keep it interesting and challenging.
good,"Started off as a great company to work for, put you through all the training necessary. Give you the freedom to complete jobs on your own and explore the different aspects of the industry. "
good,"Halliburton has great benefits and when the oil business is good, it is a good place to work.  I have been through two layoffs and when things get tough, there is no loyalty or consideration to years of experience.  In fact higher paid professionals are bigger targets when things get tough."
good,It was a good first job but unfortunately I was laid off due to extensive cuts in the company because of the market. Therefore I am looking to continue my career with another company doing what I am passionate for.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Halliburton and would stay if the oilfield was stable,got to work on a lot of special projects travel a lot and got paid for it"
good,"Halliburton gives you the tools and knowledge to head straight to the field, from orientation to driving school to earn your CDL they cover all the basics to keep you safe while working to return home to your family."
good,"Halliburton laid off drafters and replaced them with drafting firm in India. Upper management does not have that Halliburton culture. Middle management types think they know everything, but are often cannot make up their minds so there's a lot of mind changes or ""flipping like a fish"" at times. Big problem are those who have their empire to defend, and often request unrealistic projects that cannot be built on time or will not work like they think(?) it will."
good,"Friendly, supportive people.  Offers classes for improvement and growth in personal and business environment.  The benefits were very good.  With Halliburton being a world wide company, the job opportunities were awesome."

good,"I worked out of the Sperry office in OKC for almost 8 years. For the most part, my time was enjoyable. The pay was excellent, but the management seemed unorganized and chaotic at times."
good,Very stable company when oil prices are up. This company has very little lay off and pays well. Be prepared to work long hours
good,"With a 2 week class in session I arrive 1 hour before class starts. I like to welcome the incoming students as they arrive. The class room is already setup for a new class so we start with a facility safety introduction. Next we do personal introductions as a bit of an ice breaker then move on into the course introduction. For meals we have an in house restaurant with students staying on campus. Usually the class finishes for the day at 5 pm, students have there homework and a place to work on it as a group. Each class is a continuous learning experience, learning how each group interacts with fellow students. I think the hardest part is keeping connected with the slower versus the faster students. I love to see the light come on in a students eyes when they understand a process or calculation."
good,The company as a whole is good. The pay is outstanding but the balance of home life and work life just doesnt work for someone who has a family and wants to be home to spend time with them.
good,My typical twelve hour day was full of excitement and new things to learn. most of my coworkers were amazing people to work with and made the job enjoyable. learning new programs regularly kept the job challenging and intriguing.

good,"Good training, good crews, great culture...very low pay. For being such a big company, starting pay is low and upper management has a hard time with completing competencies for low level employees to move up."
good,"This employer pays well, but the hours are often exceedingly long. There are opportunities for advancement when the industry is on the upswing for those willing to move and put in the long hours."
good,"Operator Assistant: Cement Services.  As an Operator Assistant I performed basic safety and repair procedures using processes designed for the job. I  performed pre and post job inspections, performed and completed preventative maintenance procedures, and maintained support equipment. "

good,"Goog time, where lot of lessons learned. In Mexico the company is influence by Pemex"
good,"Halliburton gave me a start in the oil and gas business. Plenty of hours, almost to much but they gave me a quick education in the workings of the oil and gas business that allowed me to advance into other areas."
good,Halliburton is a good company but I felt that my skills were not being utilized.
good,"A typical day for me went like this. I would get to the office around 06:30 and would take calls and build jobs and coordinate all of the crews and support personnel to make sure everything was where is needed to be when it was suppose to be there. It was intense and never ending. i enjoyed the rush of it and the sense of accomplishment it gave me. to succeed and make the impossible come to life, with no safety issues and following Halliburtons best practices. This job was rewarding and very hard to. the phones never stopped and you worked a 24/7 schedule. As we all know the oil field never sleeps! I enjoyed helping employees that worked for me succeed and grow and get promoted. What made my decision to leave the company was broken promises and lack of managements support. This was and is to this day the hardest decision of my life to leave my post at Halliburton. "
good,Hardest part of being a wireline field engineer is being expected to work/ stay awake for days (3+) on some jobs. The pay is relatively competitive depending on your location.

good,Halliburton a company that expects great things from all their employees. The environment is active and influenced by the hardworking employees that inhabit it. Halliburton pushes for hardwork and group success. I learned that in order to be an effective leader in any devour you must instil a passion to win in every single member of the team. The hardest part of this job is to keep everybody motivated. The most enjoyable part is to work with the endless amount of talent that Halliburton effectively locates.

Its thorough training programs is one of the greatest benefits you can get while working there. Pay is low for the industry so if money is the most important thing to you, you will be disappointed."

good,I enjoyed the work enviornment. Friendly coworkers and plenty of room for advancement. I was promoted several times durring my employment.
good,"Good company to work for if you don’t mind being away from home. My supervisor is super nice and very helpful. Some coworkers can be very toxic and negative, so be careful who you surround yourself with."
good,Oil field has its ups and downs. I did my job to the best of my ability with rigging in and data van IFS operator. Enjoyed having money and insurance!
good,Long hours away from home. Great pay technically challenging work. Lots of training and transfer opportunities. Work is outside 24 hours of operation with night shifts
good,it is a rewarding job though it can be isolating at times from family. compensation is good though a sense of job security can lack from time to time. location is very important. jobs in texas will be the most secure.
good,If you want to work and get paid good money a great place to do that . If it's a family you want or are your goals not the place to work . Career in oilfield is not the place to be but if you want to get a foot in Halliburton is a good start .
good,"I worked sometimes 100 hours a week while on shore, and when off shore I was billing 141 hours per week.  Not all of that was direct work, but there were some 40+ hour days while running in hole as the only onsite supervisor for my equipment."
good,"I enjoy working here.  Wish there was a bit more communication.  Company policies and procedures are a bit daunting, but acceptable.  Job security as with anything in oil and gas can be a bit unstable no matter the effort or performance you put in daily."
good,"El Reno is having a period of severe retraction, so there is constant threat/actual layoffs. However, Management is young, and day to day is actually quite good and allow for employee independence."
good,I liked working for Halliburton. It definitely was a tough job at times but I was paid well.  I would definitely recommend Halliburton for people wanting to get into the oilfield.  I worked for Halliburton for over 9 years and learned a great deal.
good,The hardest part about this job is living away from home. Which has nothing to do with the company they can’t help it. It’s a great company with great technology
good,"Not the job for those who don't (or) have great time management. Attention to detail is key, the work can be hard,cold,wet and allots for long shifts."
good,They train u well and have good insurance. Low hourly wagers tho. Learn a lot about the job. But hard to advance financially. Require you to manny things to advance in pay.
good,lot of OT.  Poor home life.  Typically work 12-16hours a day.  Low stating hourly pay made up in OT worked.  Company has GREAT benefits including a good matching 401k.
good,Great company to start the in the oil and gas industry. They help you get your CDL. We work 14/7 hitches. They do offer one of the best benefits of any company out there.
good,"Upper management plays favorites "
good,Their pay is lower than the industry average but my crew was able to keep busy even during the downturn for oil. If you are willing to work harder than the others and take on more responsibility you can move.
good,"A typical day varies, we push out alot of baroid bags"
good,"Halliburton is a great company to work for. They take safety very seriously, which is a definite plus when it comes to working in the oil field. The pay is lesser than that of any other oil field company. The benefits are second to none. You control how far you advance however which is a really cool system they have."
good,Place full of productive staff and challenges every day. Very systematic and organised in processes and procedures. Every day is a learning experience where you share and learn from each other. Place where best teams get together from different backgrounds.
good,"This is a field job, you must be ready at any given minute to be available to go out for service call. It is demanding but if you can properly manage time there is a lot of growth opportunities available"
good,"Halliburton was very good to me, schedule and work was demanding but helping the client was fulfilling.  my hours were flexible and with small children that was a bonus"
good,"No differentiation between an land employee and Offshore employee.  Offshore you will run 4 x the number of tools, yet there is no compensation.  Benefits are great, and although there is no difference between land and offshore pay, the pay is still decent."

good,"10 to 12 hour days mostly 7 days a week when required, learned a lots of things over the years, Logistic, programming Personal, Inventory control, working as a team. OHS."
good,The health benefits were the best I ever had. The average work day is about 15 hours with 10 hours off. You will travel alot and work both days and night on call duty.
good,"Haliburton was a learning experience.  It is a good place to work if you're single, need the money, or just generally like being away from your family"
good,Ok to work for. Not paid enough as a mechanic. $19 an hour is not enough for doing major engine overhauls and transmission changes on equipment that large.
good,"Enjoyed my time there."
good,"you receive decent benefits and have opportunity for advancement, but the pay is simply not on par with other companies for performing the same amount of work."
good,"23 years at Halliburton. As with all large companies, had it's +/- aspects. The company allowed for work in multiple countries which was an amazing learning experience both professionally and personally. In general, you're allowed some measure of flexibility to achieve your business goals. "
good,Halliburton is a good job with excellent benefits. This job allowed me to learn some more advanced computer skills and manage a group of people in a department.
good,"I worked here for 18 years, surviving several rounds of layoffs. My straw came up short recently and I'm now on the outside. I'm very disappointed in this company as I felt the work I was doing was relevant, but apparently not. Either that or I was getting too old or made too much money. I never dreamed I would end up being in this situation, but never say never!"
good,"Good company"
good,I was working at Halliburton on a contract. I was able to visit many of the locations here in southeast Texas that was under the Halliburton umbrella at the time.
good,Halliburton is one of the best large companies I have worked at.  The sperry division in particular was small enough to give you the perspective of doing something that really matters.
good,Great place to work. Halliburton is a safe environment. Continuous training. They also have growth within the company. An average work day is pretty even paced. So far I have enjoined my time here.
good,Hot work environment and physically demanding. Advancement in position is all in your hands. If you don't get the job done they will find someone who will. Great manager for my particular shop and area.
good,"Good place to work for."
good,Halliburton is very nice company to work with. I enjoyed my tenure working with them. New challanges and career development is important. I found nice team
good,"A wonderful company in the right hands of working, wise & compassionate managers & employees. Hardest part - not getting paid for extended work hours."
good,"Non-stop madness! Since the downturn in the industry, it's been ""do more with less"" and they want you to do it all with nothing. Poor performers are kept onboard, even though they do not carry and equal share of the workload. In many cases, their salaries are higher than those of the workhorses."
good,"Depending on the crew you work with this job can be really fun or really awful. The work load is demanding but with the right time management skills time can still be found for breaks. The management is mediocre but I've seen way worse in the oilfield. They will work with you as far as requesting days off. The schedule is typically 2 weeks on and 1 week off, so you get plenty if home time. Overall not bad."
good,"GE is a good company to work for.  Unfortunately, I was only there a short time.  Restructuring and reductions in workforce took it's toll on my group."
good,"Contract job with great facilities and supervisors.  Worked a both facilities and wish my contract would have lasted longer.  They offered to pay my move to Fort Worth, but the pay was not worth it."
good,"Good learning environment, competitive business, great benefits and competitive perks. Great management and support team. Very safe work place. Stable job with little to no lay offs."
good,"Loved the company, but Well Dynamics is run by the old buddy system, look after their friends instead of whats right for the business.  During lay off period from oil downturn, instead of keeping the hard and highly valued employees, kept the slackers that had been there 10+ years and couldn't even spell SAP yet along use it."
good,"Halliburton is a great oil service company to work for, great benefits, pay is good. Management can be good or bad. I am salaried and work a 2 week on 1 week off work schedule. It can be challenging at times, but rewarding."
good,"Working at Halliburton was pretty alright at best. The pay is great, the work life balance is solid but the work culture is pretty boring. The industry itself isn't terribly interesting so working there as a young adult was very difficult especially since most there were much older. Honestly, you feel like your job isn't contributing to much development."
good,"Day starts at 7am and ends when the day is done, sometimes 6 or 7 pm.  Great company with excellent services provided and equipment development.  Amazing training and development tools."
good,"Great Place to Work, but sometimes its Iffy,its up and down work, not sure.. good benefits and 401k matching plan, work with some really good people  in the field"
good,"One of the few companies started and successfully run in oilfield services in India against the majors. The work culture is amazing, everyone is like family. Everyone works with all their heart for the good of the organization."
good,The people that I met that became my co-workers were very knowledgeable of the job and took me under their wing and taught me the job at hand. With me being new to the industry with never having worked in the oil field before they were patient.

good,"En ocasiones los jefes toman decisiones erráticas para beneficiar a ciertas personas, sin importar su desempeño dentro de la institución"
good,"Great Job with high income , the only problem  the number of working days and working hours (6 days a week and 10 hours a day)"
good,"A very strong company except for layoffs this last time in 2015.  Salary is not the best for 40 hour work week but overtime was weekly and for 22 hours a day when away from home.  Allowed per diem for meals but not usually for lodging since I drove a tractor with a sleeper.  No bonuses, no turkeys at thanksgiving, no christmas gift cards, but 401k and stock options made up for that.  Field management/supervisor was generally high school with no or some college.  Office management was same for the most part.  Best to be a single person with no family to be able to keep up with the overtime and work day/night demands.  I would give consideration to going back if I was called to return, but only because the over time and benefits were best anywhere I've been."
good,A typical day at work would typically consist of unloading and loading trucks. Paperwork forklift operation. And building and disassembling mud motors.
good,"Halliburton holds there safety standards quite high which makes it an enjoyable work environment, the benefits and salary are great"
good,"Halliburton was a great place to work.  The benefits are great and the money is good too.  Once again, working in the energy sector is feast or famine.  Lots of management levels.  I'd say it's a good company to work for.  They treat their employees well."
good,Halliburton is a good way to start a career in the oilfield.  They helped me get my CDL with Hazmat and payed for it all.  I would recommend Halliburton if you are wanting to go into the oilfield.
good,"It's the only place you'll hear a high school graduate or someone with a GED complain that they only made $70,000 last year."
good,"A lot of hiring activities during high oil prices, extended vendor networks for medicals and Visa processes, helpful co-workers along with managers always ready to extend support"
good,"my working environment is good. Co workers are great. Upper management needs work on how they treat their workers.I've been here for right at 5 years and, no pay increase the last 3."
good,"Halliburton is a great company to work for. It would be nice to have more home time, but they compensate well and have great job security."
good,Great company to work for just not the right industry to grow at the moment. They have trained me above the industry standards and make safety a priority. The product service line I work in as the rest of the company's lateral movement is very static at the moment.
good,"Empresa valoriza muito o funcionário, porém exige muita disponibilidade de tempo."
good,"There is a lot of work to be done in Halliburton / KBR. A lot of projects to keep you busy, but sometimes you need to find you own projects and take the initiative, as many managers will not kick off the projects for you."
good,"es una buena empresa pese a sus salarios bases bajo, cuenta con una buena cultura en seguridad por ser una compañía extranjera,"
good,good job and pay when the price of oil is good. You get to know alot of guys and learn alot on this job. they provide you with all the tools to move up
good,"I like everything about the time I worked there.  You get what you put into the work.  The only complaint, which it happens in the oil field, is that I got transferred from Hobbs, Nm. to Odessa, Tx. and was laid off a month later."
good,I learned very much during my time at Halliburton. People were very nice and they have 2 Gyms and good cafeterias at the HQ that gives plenty of healthy options.
good,"Typical work day was waking up at 3-3:30am. getting breakfast getting ready to head out to location by 6am. get equipment ready to start the job. Management was on top of most things. I learned a lot coming from not knowing anything at the beginning. CO workers were oen of the many reasons I enjoyed going to work, your co workers become more than just your co workers they become family. spending time with them more than you spend time with your own family. Downside was you only got to spend aout 4-6 days at home out of the month."
good,"Worked as log analyst, supervised small group of technicians, location in New Iberia was not a plus.  Mix of field personnel and college educated professionals."
good,I enjoyed working at Halliburton and really enjoyed working away the lads where great to work with and would do anything to help people out.
good,I had fun and made lots of money while it lasted. The oil field isn't for everyone but if you like a fast paced work environment and don't mind working hard for your money great place.
good,"Halliburton provided me with an excellent work environment where I learned much on the production of oil and natural gas.  It is a world leader in energy production, and trains its employees to prosper in the oil and natural gas industry."
good,2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. Worked 24 hour service on a drilling rig. I learned a lot about drilling both oil and gas wells. hardest part was being gone for 2 weeks at a time. enjoyed the continuing education and benefits.
good,"Salary is relatively low compared to peers, bonus is not stable, 401K is good. Used to have one office room for each employee, cubicle right now"
good,when it's busy it's busy when it's slow they are real slow. There's a lot of hours but the money is great plus they have a 401k and match it dollar for dollar.
good,Some key positions are held simply because of someone's long tenure; having little to do with skill or prowess. Typical large corporation politics. Side benefit of always having your call taken or returned when the recipient hears that it's Halliburton calling.
good,Provide Salesmen and Customers with a proposal with cost of the job requested. Halliburton was a place were where you worked independently with not much supervision. So you know what your job was and did what ever it took to get the job done right and in a timely manner.
good,Very good company but unfortunately it's going through some tough times but will rebound like always.  Enjoyed 20 years with Halliburton until downturn in the market.
good,"Typical day, work break work, which is great. No surprises at working there, every day is almost the same. Employees are friendly."
good,"They work you to death, and as soon as they are in trouble they let you go. There is no real management support for the field personnel. Every man / woman for themselves."
good,Overall great career experience working for this company. Good structure and overall Management experience and training.
good,I would pack up for a 2 week stay where ever the job was and leave. Once down there we would drop our stuff off at the hotel and go straight to work and work a 16 hour day. We would pick up where the crew we relieved left off. We would frac a stage and then do a round of pump maintenance on the pumps that didnt run right while fracing. Once the maintenance was done we would fire the pump trucks up and frac another stage or hammer the iron loose and hook up to another well and frac that one and the same steps repeat.
good,Halliburton was a good company to work for. Made lifetime friends and enjoyed most of my career there. My immediate managers were supportive and fostered growth.
good,"Halliburton challenged me to continuously learn and accept change in the workplace."
good,16 hour ++ days or nights depending on shift. Is a great place to start a career you can learn alot about oil field in a short period of time. Hardest part of job is first day back from days off and last day on shift before days off. Most enjoyable is your friends you make along the way.
good,"good place to work with benefits"
good,"Cementing in the oilfield is all about time management.  In order to maintain DOT compliance, employees spend many hours in the sleeper of a truck.  Halliburton compensates for these hours of nothingness accordingly, and a lot of time is spent away from home."
good,"This is a great place to work as far as training, pay and benefits. The constant layoffs are stressful and being a good worker does not mean anything when the market is down. I did work with a great group of people which also is a sad time to see good people walked out. Also, no raises in an unstable market."
good,"Halliburton Service Company teach me how to communicating,how to handle a job make me more confident to start a job. Good teamwork."
good,Easiest hard job anyone could ever have. Travel away from home at least 65% of time. Co-Workers become your family. Long Days. Good Benefits and days off schedule.
good,"long days but you are paid for it, high paced office. Some training, and with higher staff turn over, opportunities for promotion is good"
good,"A good company to work for, allows you to develop and move up."
good,"This is a great job opportunity for young career seekers who are looking to make a generous wage with great health benefits and a good 401k.  "
good,"A typical day at Halliburton was basically 10 hours of driving a mouse around my desk. I would design equipment in Solidworks and send the design to a team of drafters in India. When communicating with foreign drafters I had to be very specific in my communications, if you do not tell them exactly what you want then you will not get what you want. When the detail drawings were returned form the drafters I would review and mark them up and return them for any changes. I would also wright the technical specifications for our equipment including paint, material and testing requirements. On a few occasions I traveled internationally to solidify vendor relations or train international teams on the use of our software."
good,Halliburton is a 14 days on and 7 days off schedule.Day one is spent driving to location and making a shift change at 6am or 6pm.We work a minimum of 12 hours a shift. We get assigned our job roles and responsibilities. We work as a team to get things done properly. The hardest part of the job is being away from the family so much and missing most of my kids growing up and activities. The coworkers are nice and we get along really good. They are like our second family.
good,giving the fact that I was laid off during the time of the boom. I will never take away the things Halliburton did for my career. I learned a lot of tricks to the game and felt safe while doing it day in and day out.
good,"Halliburton is a great company, Production Enhancement is a very intriguing field. Great benefits, great coworkers, but the 16+ hour days really takes a toll on yourself and family life."
good,Working as part of a team and supervising others in a challenging environment. Friendly atmosphere and opportunity to gorw and progress your career
good,"Halliburton has very strong values on safety, customer satisfaction, cost control and job completion."
good,Halliburton as a whole was a great company with brilliant talent.  I learned so much from those that I had the pleasure to build relationships with and highly recommend working on the main campus.
good,"good place to work if your single, but be ready to work hundreds of hours. management is good. benefits are really good.why do I have to write such a long review"
good,good company to work for I owe a lot to this company and thankful for working here it provided my life and financial status stability and would definitely refer someone
good,Good work and life balance. Good training. Big and diverse MNC. Clean workshop environment. Updated with Lean initiative. Autonomous.
good,"Excellent future possibilities. Difficult to adjust to the lifestyle of a job closely tied to the price of a barrel of oil. Price is up, make good money. Price goes down, get laid off of have your pay cut in half."
good,"Would usually wake up at the man camp around three in the morning or afternoon, to gather crew and drive an hour and a half to two hours to the job site. I would then swap out with the other crew on duty with a safety meeting. The crew would then go to there stations and we would then pump the job for our 12 hr shift. This was the normal work day for two weeks and then we would have a week off."
good,"Halliburton is a good company, but it is the oil field and there is the fall side and current layoffs. I need something that will always be around."
good,if you dont mind getting dirty and working on big equipment then this is your place to work. good bunch of guys. good managers.
good,"Angola is probably one of the most challenging and frustrating places to work in the oil and gas Industry. This will be the second time working here for a service company and  It has not changed very much from my previous employ here 2 years ago."
good,"Not the greatest money in the industry, Work long days. Away from family. No schedule, Arrive when the job starts and leave when the job ends. Always on call.  Great benefits"
good,"when hired I wasn't told that I would be going to Homer City, PA for NEO (New Employee Orientation)  I was just to report.  Once there I found out training was 6 hours one way away.  My family and I had to make last minute adjustments and it complicated things with young children, etc.  Once returned home, because this was entirely a new shop, etc.  Many hours were required, OT was something that was not mentioned and it did put a strain on my family, as a mother.  "
good,"open up workshop"
good,Job requires good troubleshooting skills and the knowledge of electronics. You'll learn explosive and radiation safe and how to use them on the job. You'll supervise a crew and equipment to ensure a job is accomplished. This requires long hours and travel to where the work is.
good,Solid organization that has a strong global presence. Company will survive the current energy downturn. Conservative corporate culture that instills ethical values.
good,"I enjoyed going to work each day because there was something to learn everyday. A typical day involved installing a network or calibrating a mag meter, radiation meter. There was always something new to learn. Management was always helpful with any problems. my coworkers were excellent we were a tight knit group that stood up for one another. The hardest part was the extremely long hours we sometimes had to work. The most enjoyable was working with my hands and accomplishing tasks. This created a great feeling."
good,The coworkers were very helpful in answering my questions and helping me understand the Fracking industry and how the whole process works.
good,Training well provided to ensure each and everyone is well equipped and competent. Plenty of career advancement to be experience.
good,Halliburton is probably the only company I've worked for who takes safety really serious. Its not always comfortable wearing all the proper protection gear but it is all required to wear at all times. Every injury reported is taken care of immediately and the company supervisor actually calls you personally to make sure you are getting better everyday.
good,I enjoy working with the fellows I do now and am glad to know them. I learned much during my time with Halliburton and in different circumstances would continue to do so.
good,I worked almost 10 years for Halliburton where I was able to learn and advance my career.  Unfortunately due to market conditions my job position was no longer needed.  Halliburton is still a great company that you can grow your career.
good,Exposed to the different culture of races during working environment.The task were tough and required a good physical condition to perform the job.Learned how to manage the time at given a timeline to complete the task.Forced you to have critical thinking to solve a problem when encountered.
good,Corporate cultural with training provided for job descriptions. Access to co-workers to develop sales and project management with diverse clients.
good,"Standard FIFO camp lifestyle, with a lot of time operating a lil to no sleep. Poor people management an no advancement opertunitys"
good,"un día típico es bastante movido el aprendizaje nunca termina el ambiente laboral es bastante bueno "
good,if you dont like seeing your family or dont like to do anything on the weekends then this will be perfect for you.
good,"Quando estava ON SHORE na base, realizava manutenção de ferramentas utilizadas para aferir pressão e medir temperatura dos gases e fluídos de reservatórios de petróleo, atualizava ferramentas de ponta através de softwares de programação das mesmas e as programava para operação e OFF SHORE realizava operações com as ferramentas no poço. Por se tratar de um empresa de grande porte, seus gestores são capacitados e sabem gerir os setores, a parte mais difícil do trabalho era com relação aos riscos expostos e a parte agradável se dava pela boa convivência entre funcionários."
good,"A good 30 years, challenging work until the last 3 years of my career.  Company outsourced most software work, and over managed projects to point that the good smart driven employees began to leave."
good,"Well I will always bleed red. I chose the lifestyle, while not for everyone, if you want to be engrossed in your work, Halliburton is for you. I worked 240-300 days a year but I was paid for it. Long, detailed work but I was fairly compensted. Great 401k stock options and day rate. Salary sucked but I worked for my day rate which was very fair. I would recommend Gulf Coast to anyone looking to get into oilfield, Broussard, LA. You will be engrossed in your work but you will also know your job and if you pay attention, alot of other peoples job also."
good,"Halliburton Germany GmbH is a very nice place to work at, but the taxes band is high and it requires fluent German Language for your career development."
good,Halliburton is a very powerful player in the Oil & Gas industry.
good,"Oil Field isn't for everyone, in fact I would venture to say that most that get in quickly get out due to family or various other reasons. Halliburton MWD's are much like most other MWD companies in that the work is usually steady with some slow periods and some where you work for three months and don't see home more than 2 days before you are back at another three months. It takes some adjusting to the culture but it's not a bad way to earn a living for those who don't mind. Halliburton generally takes care of their people and have yet to convert to hourly instead of day rates."
good,tons of departments and advancement options. great knowledge learned in many areas of the oil field.
good,Halliburton will do what they can to keep you busy even when things are slow.  High turnover rate. Good entry point into the oil field.  Good training.  Not the highest wages
good,"A Halliburton é uma empresa excelente para trabalhar, porém existem alguns pontos que precisão melhorar, como por exemplo o plano de carreira dos funcionários e o cumprimento dos prazos das promoções e no equilíbrio trabalho x vida pessoal."
good,"I think halliburton is a great company for people that want to get there foot in the door and make a bit of money. "
good,"If you can last during the winter, you'll have a rosy future within the company."
good,"Atypical day at work will start with around 60 emails that have arrived overnight from from the rest of the world, in the shape of orders, requests issues that need to be resolved vendors looking for payments....Will run reports for blocked invoices and ensure any allocated to me are done....RFQ's sent tout to vendor and a wait responses to place, attend vendor meeting, then have lunch and a chat with the team....update two outline agreements, update teams working hours within Sap, attend conference calls on REACH registration...hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone all of the time.....most enjoyable part of the work is when I get an email to say thank you for a job well done"
good,I enjoyed this job for interaction with people from different parts of the world young and old. Typical day started reviewing what last shift did and work they passed over to next shift. Huge corporation just a number. Two weeks away from home at a stretch was hard on family.
good,"While I enjoyed working in the frac fields it was not the career opportunity I was looking for. I enjoyed the hard work as it gave me a sense of accomplishment. "
good,Long day of work hours with plenty of work always something new to learn in a team work enviornment. knowledge of fracing and working on frac pumps and rigging up/down on frac locations
good,"I worked in several different divisions of Halliburton.  The hardest part of the job was the constant hiring and laying off of personnel depending on the management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  Each division I worked in, there were employees that treated me like family."
good,"A empresa oferece bom salário e benefícios que oferece para os seus funcionários treinamento mandatórios relacionados a sua atividade diária."
good,Good place to work. Equipment is a bit out dated and pretty worn out.
good,nice active environment
good,Lot of OJT on job. Learned about the frac equipment. Management tough on employee's.
good,"A typical day at work is not knowing what challenges you may have instore for you but overcoming them. I learn how to work through problems when jobs do not go as plan, but always finding a safe and a good solution for the crew to get the job done. I liked my co worker and they thought highly of me. The hardest part of my job was being away from my family days at at time. The most enjoyable part of my job were the guys i worked around."
good,Long hours which was fine with me. The training program was good but was always hard to get the training needed. I had two excellent managers above me who really cared about production but also cared about there employees and their families. I have enjoyed my time with Halliburton and was able to climb the ladder a little but I feel that I had plateaued out with them and would not go any higher even though my skill set would of allowed me too.
good,This is where I started at in the oilfield. Started at the bottom of the barrel and worked my way up to Supervisor. Great place to learn and the schools that you attend are great.
good,Enjoyed working for this employer till they placed all the eggs into one nest - ignoring Windows platform and favoring Linux.
good,"Halliburton is the place to learn to be adaptable in all situation and environment. It does require more than 12 hours work time, but different challenges can be encounter to make each day busy and accomplishing."
good,Good atmosphere at work
good,I worked in this company for 4 years now. 3 in India and Oman and 1 in UK. It has provided me with a stable job and it requires significant amount of travelling. The work on field is quiet hectic.
good,"I worked offsite testing and deploying new Landmark tools to aide System Administrators, Data Analysts and GeoTechs in better more efficient workflows."
good,"To work here you must be very flexible, willing to relocate when the opportunity comes up. Must have the right attitude. The work never ends and there is something always to learn. High paced enviorment. Pay your dues and get to corporate to expand on design and manufactoring engineering skills for those who wish to grow (mechanical/electrical engineers). Lots of fun. You will work hard and it is very rewarding if you life good balance between life and work. Build strong relationships where you go and make a good lasting impression. Great job for singles due to the fact you dont have someone complaining at home. Invest your money on real estate or seek good sound advise."
good,My time at Halliburton was a great introduction to the oil field. The culture at Halliburton is unique. I doubt I will every work at another company quite like Halliburton. Earning my Red Hat was something I will always take pride in.
good,"boa empresa para trabalhar, ótima no desenvolvimento de profissionais desde que os mesmos se interessem."
good,Halliburton is a great place to work. Great core values and training. They just need to listen to thier employees more on processes and how to do certain things. Management seems to not have an open mind about some things.
good,"dia tipico en la empresa reunion diaria, aprendi a ser tolerante, obtuve muchos conocimientos aunq no me dieron induccion se puede decir q qprendi de todos mis compañeros de la linea."
good,This company had a great benefits packages but lacks in the compensation area. It offers a diverse working environment with a chance to experience the oil and gas industry from a variety of different angles. Overall this company is more about their profits then their people and equipment. If you are looking to get a start in the industry thus is the perfect stepping stone to something bigger and better.
good,"Good company to work for, excellent benefits, good pay, busy business."
good,"Halliburton is a big company with lot of procedures, every thing has to be done following the hms, which sometimes makes things to be slower, is well focused and objectives are clear, communication channels are good and"
good,I started at the bottom as an assistant operator and worked my way up to supervisor with many international postings. Good team work and longer term employees are generally of similar mindset due to the nature of the work.
good,"The job in itself is stressful, but Hallibirton has done it's best to mitigate a lot of it. Most of my days were working o. Pumps and working sand. Management is very dependent on your crew. Each crew has it's own personality, and you either click or you don't. The hardest part is always rig up, but you do get some amazing views of the country. The benefits are awesome too."
good,"As far as benefits, Halliburton is hard to beat. The pay is on the low end but if you are able to stick it out and do what needs to be done a person can advance pretty quick."
good,"Showed up early to plan the day for the shop, created repair orders and gathered parts and assigned jobs to techs. Deal with all customer needs and attended multiple meetings and kept up with all equipment movements. Assisted techs in repairing and testing equipment."
good,Good leadership and a place to advance and make a good living. Long hours but a decent schedule. Must like working outdoors all the time in all weather conditions. Good peers to work with.
good,"Es una empresa muy buena la cual pagaba muy bien y daban capacitación necesaria para el trabajo así como el apoyo en decisiones importantes, nos proveían de equipos necesarios y las prestaciones eran muy buenas."
good,"Good company but hard to get a raise/ higher position from within "
good,Halliburton provided ample opportunities to its employees to progress and learn new skills.  They took really good care of their expats working abroad.
good,Typical day 10-15 hours a day. Decent pay If you stayed with the company for a while. Good benefits with overall good family time if you can handle life in hitches.
good,It is like a roller coaster ride. Always up and down. It was a fairly decent place to work. Hardly any family time. I did have the chance to move to other dept. And learn more about what each dept. Involvement meant to the company.
good,"una empresa con una infrestructura solida,  niveles de calidad  del mas alto nivel,  sueldo competitivos."
good,"Good company.  Benefits are ok.  Since closing down Bellaire campus commute is 1 hour, have to say the understands."
good,"Too much time away from home, I have a family and want to spend more time at home. Sometimes I am gone for a month or so at a time and with that said I am ready for a more stable job"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job at Halliburton is definitely the people that I work with and the growth and experience that I have gained while working there.
good,Upper management in turmoil and constantly giving mixed messages as far as direction. Conflict between market share and profitability. Many meeting with scattered results.
good,Loved working on cross-functional global project teams and found them to be very successful - good collaboration amongst team members.  Offers a magnitude of work locations domestic and international.
good,The workers are great management sucks some thank they are way to initialed .  love the people I work with hate the people I work for.  some could stand to be let go.
good,This was my first job post graduating from University. An unforgettable experience that exposed me to rigs and well logging. This company launched me into the oil and gas industry.
good,Great place to work and make a career. Competitive pay and advancement opportunities if you are at all ambitious. working hours are long in all weather.
good,"Halliburton was a challenging work environment due to the constantly evolving technology requirements.  They valued feedback and a short learning curve, which would sometimes amount to pressure, but would end up making positive personality changes."
good,"It is a diverse and every challenging company to work for. There are no limits to the heights you wish to achieve, and is no different from any other large graphically encompassing company."
good,"Loved the people i worked with and my manager, unfortunately the oil business is very volatile and many of us were laid off. If not for thst and the insane hours i wouldve stayed"
good,"If you don't mine long hours and work, this job is for you. A lot to learn in the production Enhancement in the Oil and Gas industry. The company is safety oriented in a harsh and dangerous job."
good,Great company and great people. Many opportunities available to learn and grow professionally but is up to each employee to take control over his career and make it happen.
good,"Halliburton is a great company to start a career, learn new skills, and make connections. As a service company in the Oil and Gas industry expect layoffs every 4-5 years."
good,"At Halliburton, the job is pretty okay the management is also nice pretty decent and benefits are very nice i will push people to go for the job with them."
good,"If you like the outdoors this is a great job.  You'll spend time building your measuring tool and setting it in the pipe. The shifts are 12 hr and you'll switch out with the other MWD at your designated time.I  don't like heights very much so the hardest part for me was putting up the monitor on the rig.  I learned a lot while working for Halliburton/Sperry.  It can get cold in the winter to work on metal equipment, you'll learn to work with a team to get to your goal."
good,"a great place to work if you like working a lot of hours, you must enjoy fixing things as well as putting in the time to learn new things. team work is a big thing."
good,"Great job for a high school graduate or even college graduate, however if you have a family, you want see them often. I worked two weeks on and one week off."
good,"Halliburton is a great company to work for if you have no experience in the oil field. Great benefits and competitive pay, you advance quickly if you are a go-getter."
good,"The work pressure is too much as it includes physical activity. However, the salary is market competitive. Field work is very tough but there are many facilities on field to keep you busy and kill time."
good,I do not wish to write a review on Halliburton at this point and time due to it being my current job. Maybe at a later date I will give more feedback on Halliburton
good,"Good place to work, I have found a lot of skilled people, multi cultural environment. Hard company values and goals. "
good,"Great company, especially if you like to keep busy.  Difficult to move up without an education, but Halliburton does offer tuition assistance as part of their benefits."
good,"Much like another company I worked for; a typical day at Halliburton looked a lot like 15-17 hour shifts for 14 consecutive days, before having 7 consecutive days off. "
good,We work hard in the pump shop and dont make enough money and never get told god job always lacking necessary tools lifting heavy equipment and parts all day
good,"The oil and gas industry is all the same. I have been in it for ten years and its time for a change. It is what all the people say it is, good money stressful work and a lot of days away from home."
good,"typical day was hot and sweaty at Halliburton, it was what you made it, complaining isn't good in anything but can creep up at this job if you let it.  learned hands on work such as torch. management was cool. culture diverse. hardest part, rigging up and down, most enjoyable part....The crew your on and building a relationship with."
good,There was definitely an endless amount to learn working as a production enhancement engineer for Halliburton. You couldn't get enough experience with all the different fluid systems they use for the different types of reservoirs and disposal wells. 
good,"Daily operations and guidance of offshore teams to perform data acquisition program; be part of team that is responsible for well design and well placement. 24 hours per day 7 days per week. High financial stakes in this kind of operations; about $20,000 per hour of non-productive time. Culture is non political and straight forward which is also the most enjoyable part."
good,"Halliburton has given me the opportunity to train with good people on the skills and knowledge needed to fulfill a career while here at Halliburton. They offer great benefits and compensation, however, your pay is determined by the up and down of the economy and market."
good,"Looked forward to going to work every day, for 20+ years . I learnt that limitations where what I put on myself, but would be suportted if I wanted to push the limits. The most enjoyable part of my job was deal with internal and external people in the industry."
good,"Work with very intelligent people. Good job if you can get hired on fulltime. As a contractor, feel lost sometimes and very little opportunity if any to advance (at least as a contractor). Again, if fulltime, this might be different."
good,You were only as good as your last job.  As long as you were bringing in revenue management was satisfied.  It seemed at times that your employment was a one way street.
good,"I learn a lot at halliburton,it gives me self confidence at work and safety awareness."
good,"Great to start without much experience"
good,Halliburton are a large organization where you can thrive as many opportunities are presented. My time at the company has span 17years and has very productive results. Halliburton has good benefits and work ethics and a great team/working environment.
good,"Great training."
good,"I loved working for Halliburton!   If you can survive the ups and downs of the oilfield its a great place to work.  I was laid off due to the current oilfield conditions.  My manager had already been laid off, so the person that decided on who was cut had no idea of my work ethics.  I worked extra whenever needed because no one else wanted to work over."
good,"better place to improve skill and learn something new. good teamwork during the job and good supervision from superior."
good,Uma empesa correta e com grandes possibilidades. Gestão direta e fácil acesso as pessoas que decidem fazem da Halliburton um bom lugar para se trabalhar.
good,"Benefits were excellent.  Pay was iffy but overtime was almost guaranteed to make it worth it.  Work was mostly on an on call basis which didn't allow for much free time but you did work a 2 week on, 1 week off schedule and were paid for 40 hours on your week off."
good,I loved working for halliburton for 10 years. I had a great boss and liked the people i worked with.  they are a huge company with room to grow with postions all around the world
good,"The hours are long, the pay is great and the experiences are countless. All in all a cool job that doesn't make you too happy at the moment but at the end are glad that you had the guts to take on the experience. Very long hours, like you never thought you would be able to hack, thus the rewarding part."
good,"- Good company and culture"
good,"Halliburton was a great place to work. However, the company is severely impacted by the downturn. There are no growth opportunities and  severe job in security."
good,"Worked in Gulf of Mexico division. Work at the shop was relatively slow paced 40 hour week unless you were preparing for a job and it could range upwards of 70. Same when you were offshore. If you were working it wasn't irregular to work over 24 hours. But there was a lot of downtime in between. The jobs ranged in time from a couple days to a couple months and you were on call all the time so you never know when you will be working. "
good,Productive place to work with minimal compensation. Excellent benefits. Working time varies unless you are on a rotation. Call outs are very minimal. Work atmosphere is very tense.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Job security is at it's best with Halliburton. From my experience, management is always an issue.We stay busy. Which, allows me to provide for my family."
good,"Management does lack, as there are some people who do not like to share responsibilities or work as a team.  Compensation is lacking - no bonuses at all; nor raises in the past several years.  But love the two on campus gyms.  Environment is nice.  Good culture."
good,"I was on a solid work crew. Our yard relocated from Alice, TX to San Antonio, TX. The befits were great. I felt we could have been paid better for the hard work that we did."
good,Azienda che ti permette di crescere professionalmente e ti permette di viaggiare tanto in tutto il mondo
good,"Halliburton ia the best job I have ever had. I have been here for ten years and the benefits and pay are great. In the last two years the company has retired all of the experienced older employees and brought in younger college educated people. I didn't have a problem with that until my new boss informed me that I will need to go to college and obtain a 4 year degree in order to keep managing the chemical building that I have been managing for the past 4 years. Also my job requirements have changed to a lot of computer assignments that I don't have knowledge of how to do. We have lost a lot of good people due to these changes and I am trying hard to keep up and learn all I can. the classes I need do not start up until June and my team is being told nobody has the time to hekp us with these assignments. We have lost both of our supervisors that made sure things ran very smooth and I don't want to leave but I have to keep all options open. I an descent with computers and I learn fast when I have someone to show me what I need to know. My job is 75 percent physical outside so there is a conflict with getting all these new computer assignments completed but I will keep trying. I am a fast learner when I have direction."
good,"Gostei muito e aprendi muito neste tempo que pude trabalhar nesta empresa."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, aprendí el departamento de tesorería, contabilidad de proyectos, documentación para cobro a dependencias gubernamentales (Pemex), los directores dan mucha facilidad para seguir aprendiendo y colaboran con tu carrera profesional, la parte mas difícil son los días de cierre de mes contables ya que se trabajan días de aproximadamente 12 horas y el ultimo día hasta la madrugada, lo que mas me gusto es poder pertenecer a una compañía reconocida a nivel mundial."

good,"It is very difficult to balance life and work when you're working in the field. That's the hardest part."
good,Good company with great benefits. Management is just ok and the pay is not that great. The schedule worked out really well for days working and days off.
good,"As a field engineer, I spent very little time with the family. Was always waiting for the call out from the coordinator, and sometimes it would in the middle of night and you had to hit the road immediately."
good,The job was interesting and demanding.  Paid me well for my service.  Had to travel and be away from home for extended periods of time.
good,"Plenty of room to grow and accept new challenges if you are willing to move around.  The downside is that management is generally changing every 3 years.  If you want to stay somewhere that you enjoy and are doing a good job, you may get viewed as a blocker."
good,"Halliburton as a whole treated me well as an employee, I enjoyed my time there but needed to change my field in order to advance. I would work there again if the opportunity arose."
good,"A Halliburton depende muito dos clientes para evoluir. Sofre pressão  da sede por mais lucratividade sobre seus investimentos e, ao mesmo tempo, um cliente que não tem capacidade de investir e testar novas soluções."
good,"The people I worked with for 17 years were some of the best people I have ever met. The job in its self was very organized, safe minded and easy. 15 out of 17 years we as a team had no recorded safety incidents. Everyone helped each other, many who had 30+years experience. Over all a great place to work."
good,"Freezing, or roasting, mud covered hours staring at automated equipment screens, surrounded by bone jarring vibrations and noxious odors, marginal directives and guessing at estimations. All the OT you can handle in a boom cycle, and lay offs in a bust cycle. It's not for everyone but if you want to make some great money in hurry, take your chances."
good,"Excelente compañía trasnacional, te permite crecer día con día"
good,"A great company to work for, I was never treated unfairly. I would still be there if it was not for the economic down turn. At the end of my ten years working there it was a little rough but that what was expected with the lack of drilling operations."

good,"The company in Canning Vale has now shut down, but whilst working there in 2007 I enjoyed the hours and the people were pleasant."
good,A great place to work when the oil industry is booming. In a downturn every day you fear for your job. Hence why I'm on indeed.
good,"The work is very time consuming, have to have the phone on you at all times. The pay was good, but less than competitors. Good company with excellent benefits."
good,"Offer good career future at the beginning, but the fall of oil price affect the company a lot. Overall, the working environment and the organization is well-arranged."
good,"The company has grown too big to live up to its core values. Senior Management is caught up with its own progress up the corporate world and is far removed from the problems and challenges the everyday employees face. Promotions to senior management are biased, mostly done as patronage appointments."
good,"halliburton para mi fue una gran experiencia aprendi muchas cosas, me capacitaroin en diversos cursos. un ambiente tranquilo con los compañeros."
good,"Big international corporation with a continuos interest in expanding operations while improving the internal processes/administration. They have shown a positive change towards employees' relationship/company. Overall, it is a place worth to be for building a career."
good,Great company.  I have no ill words for the company.  Made great friends and almost everyone there looked out for each other.  Often I would feel isolated form my family at times but there were always lots of encouragement from co-workers.
good,"I work very long hours, but i enjoyed the work and the people i work with. Oil field environment can be hard on some but it also can give you brotherhood that is close to army life."

good,"Provides education opportunities internally and externally.  Has a strong safety environment that encourages employee involvement.   "
good,"Enjoyed the work, great people, all about the numbers, not about the people who make them great. Very good training, top of the line tools and support."
good,"Good company to work for. Plenty of opportunity to move around since it is such a large company. Pay is decent, benefits are great. You work a lot of hours for this company and that is how you make good money since they start you out lower than other companies. The bad is that this is an oil field company so when times are tough, layoffs are common."
good,"Halliburton is a great place for employment, but there were a lot of ups and downs due to the growth of the company across the years. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with colleagues that worked together as a team on all tasks. The hardest part was having to work away from home for long periods of time."
good,Was Nicer Working Out of state.Had a great work experience while our of state. Worked with great supervisors and crew members. was moved around a lot within the PE department in bakersfield. Equipment was very well taken care of
good,"This was a good place to work.  As long as you have a work ethic, advancement is inevitable.  The days do get long, and the work week can be very long, but they take care of you.  Most of the people you work with are hard workers and good people."
good,At Halliburton its a great job you will work on a 14 day schedule with 7 days off. The hardest thing about this job you have to go where the oil is located which is about four places in the United States.
good,"Start of a healthy day at office brings the energy to work efficiently throughout the day, specially when there is a friendly corporate culture , one tends to learn alot of grooming ettiquettes and work in the field of finance,microsoft.Managment was friendly and realluy fun loving,but the hardest part was to complete the projects in the small span given, but than again one can enjoy more with a team and managment full of cooperative people also i am thankful to the people who were harsh on me as they taught me more important lessons in life."
good,"buena empresa, aunque con muchos procesos internos."
good,"A typical day involves supporting a fracking crew in the field completing a well. Work closely with crew and mechanic to ensure all equipment works properly. You'll work long hours (12-16/day), be away from home 7-10 days each pay period, with extensive travel. Day and night shifts switch every 2 weeks."
good,Great company to work for. Great pay and advancement opportunities. As long as business is going good this company is great!

good,There are plenty of opportunities for growth within the company.  There are many division that one can chose from to broaden your skills set.
good,Good team out there. Supportive. quite a lot of overtime. I gained valuable experience on SAGD planning and execution. Overall a pleasant experience working for Sperry...
good,"This job taught me to deal with clients that are outranged with the result of their vehicle being fixed at the shop. This job taught me how to handle these clients and how to resolve complicated situations. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the clients faces when their car would be brought up looking brand new,"
good,OK place to work. Sometimes stressful. Sometimes slow paced. Not too easy to advance. Lots of clicks. But all around OK.
good,"Most of the times, you'll be working 12 hours a day. Depending on company culture, it might be more. You'll have to work during days as well as nights. Your sleep pattern will take serious hits. Moreover, most days, you'll be so exhausted that you'll spend any free time dozing off, leaving negligible time for recreation. You'll be away from home for 14, 21 or 40 days at a stretch, and again. The most enjoyable part is to be found in working out in the open, and not cooped up in a 6X6 cubicle; there's joy to be found in working with your hands, probably explained by science as endorphins; and there's joy to be found in working in perfect harmony with the guys around you, sweating side by side. There is, of course, no joy in being exposed to dangerous working conditions, but it heightens your senses, does arouse a feeling of manliness, of being reduced to basics. There is not much politics on the field, nor mind games, making life slightly simpler that way. Plus, you'll always remain fit."
good,"Observe and monitor all cement equipment"
good,Typically an opinion of a company comes from whether or not you have good management.  I've very much enjoyed my time working at Halliburton but it comes with an understanding of the oil/gas lifestyle.  100% travel is standard.  Promotions are merit and tenure based and subject to availability and your typical work politics.
good,"Halliburton provides great training in order to prepare you for the job you are tasked with, whether its an office or field position. There is a fair amount of pressure to perform to a high standard, especially in field positions. "
good,"Halliburton was a great start to my oilfield career. They are the lowest paid of all service companies, they have the best equipment, and great management. Very safety conscious."
good,"Halliburton is a great place to work if you are willing to travel.  It provides the services for oil and gas companies world wide; therefore, traveling must have.  Beside traveling, there is a lot of opportunities to learn from, especially, the information technologies is in the state of the art."
good,Generally a good place to work with a touch too much bureaucracy at times. Semi-independent job schedule and work duties with infrequent direct supervision in my last job position.
good,"Serving meals to very hungry crowds "
good,"I do a series of jobs within my profession.  Too many to list or write down.  "
good,"Daily duties included sales orders, hr duties, collating staff holidays, sickness, etc, time sheets for workforce, offshore and onshore, assist with reception, ordering supplies for base"
good,Halliburton was an all around good company to work with but if the oil field gets rough at all your job security is on the line. many many people have been laid off to save Halliburton money.
good,A very job specific and need to meet deadlines. The coworkers were very pleasant to work with and the overall group was great and fun.
good,"Buyer for 3 warehouse locations"
good,Wanting more experience in the oil industry I decided to do Frac. After a couple of months again I was in charge. I was set to handle all the paperwork and inventory for all chemicals used for each job. Everyone was impressed of how organized everything turned out
good,"Lot of out side work, depending on your position."
good,"Halliburton is a good company. I like the practice of Agile/Scrum, code review."
good,"I love Halliburton - A few changes could be made with supervisors, but it's all good. Right now, due to low oil prices, my future is not secure here. I don't know if tomorrow is going to be my last day or not."
good,"Working as MWD engineer you get everything- very good rig and drilling expererince, get new skills and be creative, discover new places onshore and offshore, work as one team with different people and cultures."
good,"The worst part of this job is the amount of overtime needed to make a healthy living. The co-workers are more like family here, everyone generally gets along well with one another."
good,"Halliburton understands that change is necessary but like most large established companies, change is slow and measured. Halliburton is in Houston. Houston's economy is largely supported by oil and gas and healthcare. So most employees bounce from one oil company to the next. Because of this movement, the companies tend to feel the same after you've worked for a few of them. A typical day for a change manager will involve facing people who are more concerned with a technology or process improvement and less with the people who make that possible. Leaders at the top will say they support people centered change and you just have to wait and see. The hardest part of the job is being a part of a change initiative that you know was entirely top down and had no employee engagement or input. The best part is when everyone gets it and we can deliver change that people can believe in, support, and adopt because they understand the value to the company and themselves."
good,"Challenging work with great travel opportunities. They have an excellent training program in place which consists of a boot camp and onsite training. "
good,I am being forced to leave because halliburton is getting rid of this facility all together and were all forced to leave.
good,"I didn't have a chance to work there long enough.  I was laid-off after oil prices declined.  I'd say its a great company if your timing is right. But volatile, dependent on oil price."
good,"A typical day of work consists of "
good,It's a very good company to work for. It provides lot of learning opportunities. Need to put in long hours at work at times. I would recommend it to my friends.
good,Love working for Halliburton. Great pay and opportunity to advance. The lifestyle is rough being away from home so much.
good,This is a great job for people who value money more than a family life.  They are bad about finding a fall guy for problems that naturally occur.  They do value the employees they have and compensate them well.
good,"productive, involved in all areas of the warehouse operation, free to speak to management, friendly people, high stress level to insure parts delivered, varied duties"
good,Working in Halliburton gave me the opportunity to work in the oil and gas industry. It was an office hour shift job with plenty of overtime. In Halliburton safety was the most  crucial aspect of work. I was given the opportunity to lead my team in some of the safety events and project they held.  The hard part is when i have to juggle my everyday work responsibilities with the safety project. The enjoyable part is the feeling of satisfaction i got when completing those task.
good,"Learning in L&T was very high."
good,"A good company to learn. The co-workers really help each other. A typical day at work. However, many paperwork to be done."
good,"Bom trabalho em equipe."
good,"I like my daily work routine which is not too predictable and challenging enough.  Learned to work entirely on my own with support from head office in US.  A dynamic management who cares about employees, the environment and supports charity generously. Hardest part of job is working alone which can be quite lonely. Enjoyable part of the job is there is appropriate challenges and stress factors to keep me on my feet and keep me interested and satisfied."
good,"Drive to the well head"
good,"La empresa es muy buena, el unico problema es cierta parte de la administracion"
good,"- Attend morning meeting to discuss rig operations."
good,"Uma rotina pesada de trabalho, onde é seguido muitas normas e procedimentos para o bom funcionamento das tarefas, onde o foco é qualidade e segurança. É exigido muito conhecimento e esforço intelectual de todos da companhia, por isso foi uma das maiores experiências profissionais positivas que tive. A gerência e supervisão acompanham muito de perto aos funcionários e nunca se negam a ajudar ou ensinar qualquer funcionário, independente da sua função. Grande cobrança por produtividade, qualidade, conhecimento  e segurança, mas o clima era agradável mesmo assim."
good,"The learning is the best part of the job. As it is a cementing Laboratory, the samples we handle are sometimes heavy and some tests include heavy machinery. Co-workers are easy in nature and provide friendly environment to work in. Management is in improvement level, however, as a team and as an individual person, we support at our best and make the effort in positive result. "
good,"Working as a 24 hour service, drilling fluids engineer in the DJ Basin, Colorado consists of continually maintaining and managing the fluid while drilling progresses. Ensuring the client is always aware of any issues that come up and resolving them as needed."
good,"10 days on, 4 days off. 24/7 on call for jobs. Good learning experiences, everything from designing frac fluid recipes to operating frac equipment. Management is great, the managers here take good care of their employees. Hardest part of the job is working 12 hour days, potentially 10 days at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom of the job when you are not on call. Culture here is very laid back."
good,"I am a Field worker, I do equipment repairs and maintaining equipment."
good,"good place to work.  great benefits.  lots of hours. If you don't mind being away from home a lot, then this is a good place to work.  you will spend a lot of nights in hotels. during your shift it is hard labor but rewarding the job can be hazardous if you are in that part of the company."
good,Good place to work for. feel they lack in competitive compensation and incentives to make employees feel appreciated.
good,I have been working for Halliburton jrc for 6 months now and they offered me one job with the intent to go to a higher paying job. well once I started I went straight to the higher paying job which would be great if they would pay me for the higher job. I have been fighting it for the past 6 months and and finally I have had enough and just went to doing the lower job again until they decide that they want me to work in the other job position again. so if you go with Halliburton make sure that you have what they told you in your offer or else you will be in the same boat as I. hope this helps
good,ok place but keep in line and wipe your nose or else! everyone wants to get ahead so watch yourself!
good,"Aprendi muito sobre operações com explosivo e radiação, os cuidados que devemos ter, visão ampla sobre segurança, meio ambiente e saúde."
good,Empresa muito preocupada com questões ambientais e sociais.
good,"Wireline Operator Driving (logger/pressure control/gun trailer) to, and from well locations. Assist in rigging up, and rigging down of equipment on well site. Prepare gun strings as needed to go down hole. Clean, inspect shorty setting tool, and subs as needed. Run pressure control equipment. Reheading per customer policies. Maintain neat house keeping, to prevent any accidents. Delivering guns and explosives to locations as needed."
good,If ejoy being with your family every night this is not the job for you.
good,"Presented technical consultation to include formation evaluation, drilling tendencies, mud systems hydraulics, well site anti-collision and Bottom Hole Assemblies (BHA) planning."
good,"Was working as an MWD/LWD. I was usually off 3-4 days tops between jobs. Great job for single guys or young adults out of high school. Alot of time away from home, but you get paid very well and also great bonuses if you complete jobs before TD date. Benefits are very good and also great retirement package. No longer working for them due to the huge drop of oil (from $140 to $35)."
good,"A parte mais difícil está sendo o aprendizado na modalidade on the job trainning, porém torna o trabalho interessante e desafiador."
good,"I enjoy working for Halliburton. My typical day requires me to evaluate a test rack that I built or I am in the process of building, or revolve around troubleshoot any PCB's that might have failed testing and train personnel on the troubleshooting and testing procedures."
good,"A good place to work, I met a lot of people from different companies, cultures and countries all over the world."
good,It is a great place to work but slow on advancement.
good,This is a good entry level job that gives many people great opportunities. The hardest thing about this job is being on call and not knowing when you are going to work or not.
good,boa para aprendizado.
good,Before each job begins safety is the number one priority. Driving to location and spotting the trucks are first then come the actual rigging up. Next it's getting ready to pump the job for the customer. Once the job is complete and the customer is satisfied we begin to rig down and on to the next task at hand.
good,"A typical day consisted of going out to the lab facility and either helping the technicians or finding part numbers on old test fixtures, I was then responsible for finding the parts in the internal database and copying or calculating all test related data into a spreadsheet."
good,"Halliburton is one of the best oilfield companies a person can work for. They have a big demand for hours worked, but you are compensated well and are given great benefits."
good,"Great company to start in oil field, great people to work with and fun. Great benefits, 401K, and hours. Would recommend if you're looking to get into the oil and gas industry."
good,"Compensation is good, long hours contribute to lots of overtime pay, plus bonuses are paid at least quarterly. There is always something new to learn because of the various positions required to complete our tasks.  There is much camaraderie, but sometimes the work culture can be downright hostile. The hardest part of the job is being away from home for 2/3 of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing new places."
good,No nonsense business operations. Ability to learn and grow is evident in the culture. Change of personnel makes it competitive. Was allowed to  work independently and present my ideas.
good,"Place to work hard and make relationships to grow your career. Oil & Gas service industry is a life style, either you love it or hate it. Those who love it, it can take you places as it worked out for me....."
good,Worked 14/7 schedule. 9 hours in the office 12 to 18 in the field. You have to take the initiative to progress and advance. Work was enjoyable most days.
good,"É uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar se você é uma pessoa ativa que busca sempre resultados."
good,Love the straight days weekends off unless rain/snow out. Love the dependent sick leave days. Very understanding bosses. Treat everyone with respect. Over all good company
good,"Great group of coworkers, cross trained with other trades learning new skills. Safety equipment and tools provided.  Good support from immediate supervisors."
good,"Decent company with interesting and varied work. My job was in a manufacturing facility not in the field, safety culture was a bit OTT considering the location I was working in, but I suppose that’s better than  poor safety"
good,"When working in certain industries you have to understand that there will be sacrifices if you work in that industry.  The Energy sector and more specifically the oil field is one of those.  You will have odd hours and overtime for which you will be compensated but this is not a 9 to 5 job.  It's about getting the job done and that will require you sacrificing time from your family and friends.  With that being said, as long you understand that fact this is a great company to work for.  They treat their employees very well and do accommodate you when they can."
good,Great company if you aren't a family man or don't mind being away from your family for long periods of time. Great pay and benefits but long hours. Safety oriented.
good,"Good people to work with, good safety culture, extremely productive environment and you have the opportunity to advance in your career quite quickly, a worldwide company so you are not limited to being placed in Australia"
good,Show initiative. Ask questions. Be willing to take on new tasks. They will provide training for mostly all tasks performed. Ability to move around within organization. Company believes strongly in safety. Learn how to LOTO if you don’t already.
good,In the time that I’ve worked with Halliburton I’ve enjoyed the work  environment and the people with in the company. It can be fast paced and intense at times but overall is very steady.
good,The schedule of only being home for 5 hours a night for 14 nights can be wearing on a person especially when that schedule rotates from days to nights. but being off for 7 days and the healthy income is enough to make you test your limits. some live the lifestyle others don't make it. they usually make themselves know daily quick.
good,"Halliburton Will never Lay you off, but will cut your hours really bad!, Take your benefits to make you quit. Starting pay will be 15.00 Per hour regardless the experience you have."
good,I don't not have a review of this company.  I feel that it is unnecessary to talk about my current employer.  THank you for reading this though.  Have a nice day.
good,"Awesome place, to learn while you earn!  The HMS gives everyone an opportunity to learn much of the ""ins and outs"" of what you are doing for the company."
good,"Great place to work, I enjoyed my time and would love to work full time there. People was nice and friendly, work load was moderate and ok, always stayed busy. Work hours were normal 8-5 for me as a contract worker, no flexibility. No approval to work remotely or telecommute which was a downer but I understand the policy. A very good work environment provided."
good,Halliburton I think is a good company with great technology and awesome training.  I think they have very good management and tons of advancement opportunities.  On my grade for management was not related with overall management but with my own particular management.  I was not too lucky that particular time.  On his defense we were trapped on hiper busy days.
good,Challenging jobs with opportunity to develop ideas that promote success. Skill sets in many types of areas are utilized. Collaborative activity a common aspect within the work.
good,Great place to work for they just need to increase the pay. The starting pay is too low for the type of work we do. They will get you your CDL though so it’s a plus.
good,"La mayor parte de mi desarrollo profesional lo obtuve en esta empresa, tuve la oportunidad de estar en puestos de alta gerencia a nivel de la sucursal en Colombia, lo que me permitió desarrollar no solo habilidades técnicas de las finanzas y la contabilidad, pero tambien habilidades de liderazgo, manejo de equipos, comunicación efectiva, manejo de proveedores y clientes."
good,"It honestly would have been a better work environment if it weren't for a poor supervisor who had a lack of communication skills. Other than that it is exactly as you would expect for the oilfield, long hours and hard work but the pay in the end is pretty good. The rest of the crew was ok and supportive"
good,the only major issues on this job is that it will not give me enough time to go back to school. because we have to leave home for two weeks to be at work location. also i have to drive six hours to my job location.
good,"I cherish my experiences with Halliburton and would always do. I now have more professional skill set on troubleshooting, diagnosis and repairs of pumps, blenders and other equipment on frac location where i oversee as an electronic technician."
good,Great place to work depending on field of expertise. As a solid control hand I had to work 2 weeks on and 1 off. Not too bad for some people but not in my case with family. Management can be sometimes slow to respond to field tech needs but eventually show up.
good,"Моя часть работы связана с финансовым администрированием и правильным признанием выручки. Тесно общаюсь с техническими специалистами. Настрой коллег всегда благожелателен, что помогает быстро решать бизнес-задачи."
good,"Rig up / Rig down"
good,A very busy fast paced company. Promoted continuous education. Lots of management to much at times.Very long hours with little sleep. Structured days off and profit sharing.
good,Halliburton provided extensive cross training during my time with them.  The annual conferences included diverse topics.  The software I tested was graphic displays of geological data.
good,"Many on call hours.  May have much longer than 40 hour work week.  The site in Farmington, NM is not as busy now as when I worked there. At the time it was a good job and good pay for where we were and what we did."
good,Good place to start if you are new to oil and gas industry as an engineer. They have one of the best training programs. Their benefits are average compared to industry standards.
good,"Overall was a good company, they do give you a lot hours to work management was ok, they know their job, they do train you well before send you to work."
good,"The company encouraged a healthy lifestyle. There were 2 full gyms available on campus, along with at least 1 healthy choice meal option in each of the 2 cafeteria."
good,"Overall, the experience was great. A little bit off my areospace manufacturing background. Always learning something new everyday, whether it was about the pumps or machining."
good,"Halliburton offers great opportunities for those who are looking to start or change up their career.  Halliburton has offered some of the best employee training and development programs that train you to do your job very effectively.  Its not perfect but for anyone looking to try a career in the oilfield with little to no experience but a strong work ethic, this is the place to start.  Excellent benefits are offered as well."
good,"Empresa dedicada a la preservación de un buen entorno laboral, buscando respetar las politicas laborales y ambientales dentro y fuera de la empresa"
good,"Working at Halliburton was a great job. It was just I was coming out of pocket more just for travel up north, than I was making. I learned a lot and accomplished a lot while there."
good,"Halliburton is an excellent company to learn and it gaves a lot of opportunities, but it requires a lot of time. It is not rare to lose all the significant events as marriege aniversary, son birthday and etc, to keep working."
good,"Interesting job, requires different lifestyle, you vanish from home for 2 weeks or more."
good,"Current Electronics management from Supervisor to Forman to Leads in Etech dept. have made this place more than just a company to work for. We are like a large extended family and can rely on each other when in need. Work or home problems, everyone's there to help you out. We have lots of serious moments but can freely joke and keep a humorous atmosphere at the shop. Safety is the main focus everyday. Stop works are respected. You are never made to feel out of place or a lesser person than any other co worker. Management of this dept. will make sure your comfortable, happy and do their best to make sure everyone is treated as an individual, and not a number. Hard to find this anywhere else. During work after work, you always have someone to talk to."
good,"Long days and/or nights. Be ready to work. Nights are hot and days are worse."
good,Very demanding job as far as long hours and a lot of work. Great people to work for and great employees. Not much for a family person as you spend a lot of time on the facility or rigs. Great for young single individuals and great opportunities for advancement. Top of the line training and they keep up-to-date on computer software and the latest industry trends.
good,"Provided a good career prospects for those that want to take advantage."
good,"Purely as a corporate entity, Halliburton is a fantastic company to work for. Incredible benefits, decent pay, lots of overtime. They hired me with absolutely zero experience, and I was offered my interview sight unseen. Only reason I left was due to too much elbow rubbing and ""good ole boys club"" mentality with management at crew level. If not for that, I'd honestly probably still be wearing red coveralls."
good,"Worked 9-12hrs a day"
good,"- Working in Halliburton is really challenging and providing good base in self-improvement."
good,Halliburton took me from a bulk truck driver to a service quality coordinator in 20+ years.  They were a very good company to work for and I appreciate all of the experience I gained from them!
good,Most days are spent performing assigned tasks. Most coworkers or managers were willing to listen rather than simply override suggestions or feedback. Self motivated individuals thrive here.
good,Halliburton is a good company to work for with competitive pay and good benefits but the work load and long hours can be hard on your personal and family life.
good,"Ambiente muito bom para aprender e se demonstrar bom trabalho, há boas chances de promoção."
good,Working here was interesting in so  much that you never knew what type of problems you would be facing each day. the workforce were good  people and tried hard to meet targets each week.
good,working there was a new experience for me.  The lab setting was very interesting. Some of the tests took a long time to get resluts which led to long hours of waiting.
good,Great place to work.  Great training opportunities and advancement. Fast paced and can be stressful at times. Knowledgeable people are always around to help learn new roles.  Management want to help in your success.
good,"If you are okay with working outside, in all weather conditions, doing difficult, dirty, dangerous work while running on about 4 hours of sleep you will be okay at this job. The compensation is high and their benefits are very good. It's a very right leaning mindset of the employees though."
good,When the oil business is booming things are great!  When there is a turn down things go south.  No security in this type of company due to ups and downs of the business.
good,"•	Assisted in the update of our local database which resulted in a better and accurated datas to our drilling software"
good,"Good company to work with.  Pay is complemented with benefits including 401K, health, dental & life insurance.  May or may not participate in the stocks options."
good,Be prepared to work 12 plus hours a day unless you are in the office. Frac works a 14 day on 7 off schedule usually 13 or more hours per day.  Typical oilfield. Management in the frac department is excellent.
good,"Great company to work for, great work life balance. You get out what you put in to your work here, things can be stressful at times, but as long as you manage your time, there is a very relaxed work environment."
good,Pour ce boulot il faut être attentif à tous ce qui est fait au sein du laboratoire.. Respecter les différentes règles et consignes établies pour travailler au sein de cet environnement.. Mais aussi maîtriser les différents modes d'utilisation des différents appareils utilisés... Mais surtout suivre les différentes formations établies pour l'avancement et la gestion du laboratoire
good,a day at halliburton was typically busy and steady work. I learned a lot about the function and purpose of the drilling tools and how the oilfield business operates. management could've played a more management role instead of a friendship with co workers. the culture was pretty good besides some of the workers lack of responsibility attitudes. the hardest part of the job would have to be staying late nights and turning around and being there 2-3 hours later. and what i probably enjoyed most was the paychecks.
good,The company has too many people working on to stuff that is a one man job. The company has great benefits but its very slow paced and the work hour are long.
good,"Halliburton has always been a straight forward company. All the individuals that I had the pleasure of working with were personable and dedicated,  The management was spot on so you never had to guess where you were or where you needed to go."
good,I started as a Service Leader in Halliburton and move to the role of Field Service Quality Coordinator before moving to Angola under PRL as Field Service Quality Coordinator.
good,"Above average for an oilfield service company as far as type of work, work/life balance, experience gained, technology, job culture, professional attitudes in the workplace.  Benefits are good as far as health insurance and 401k.  However, salary is not very competitive and there have been no raises for years due to downturn.  Management is hit or miss.  North Belt campus in Houston is a very nice work environment."
good,Good pay but can have long hours.  Work environment is good.  Very interesting technological advancements.  Sometimes difficult to move up to a new position.
good,"Very good work-life balance, perfect for employees who wants to spend more time with their family."
good,The job was good and everything was going fine until the oil production went down. They cut the extra that the hard-working employee would do instead of the office people.
good,Great place to work in everybody frendly and egaer to teach you. You are assigned a mentor so you are never by yourself .the managers in the company are Great people to talk to.
good,I am the part of a new team. Its fun to work and lots to learn. But work culture is different from a silicon valley company. This being a non IT company you will not find many techie people around.
good,"The job is like any other oil field job, get up at 3am to 7pm 15 to 16 hours daily,etc. I enjoy working as a sand coordinator as it is the easiest job there in my opinion, but the pay is horrible and there is where they get you. I notice Halliburton is greedy and only care about the Money. Bonus are t here but take months sometimes years to get them so I usally don't count on them."
good,"I loved working with the other engineers and with all the technical equipment, but it doesn't leave much for a good family life. The position also is a great resume builder."
good,"- 24 hours services."
good,"I enjoy my job, and the people I work with. I feel as though Halliburton hires the best people for their companies, because the people are what they sell. In light of the downturn in O&G, Halliburton has done its best to keep me employed, and working steadily, but unfortunately the mentorship and promotions have dwindled. It's no fault of the company."
good,"you can learn a lot from Halliburton. very friendly nature and training is 100%. I would go back tomorrow! great benefits, tea breaks and plenty overtime"
good,Starting out at the bottom is a way to learn all that will be involved to broaden my skill-base. HAL gave me the chance to elevate my responsibilities and learn O&G. Great company and great people.
good,"Work 12 hour days"
good,"Management is brought into Canada from USA, to watch over shoulder and make life uncomfortable for some. I believe Canadians are smart enough or more to handle management position. Adds to Canadian unemployed."
good,Great place to learn but not a lot of opportunities to move up. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. They will do almost anything to keep you employed even if the market isn't great.
good,Overall - clearly a place to learn and grow - an abundance of opportunities - do well and you will be noticed.  The pace is hectic yet very rewarding.  Projects are multi dimensional (across functions and global locations) - end results are rewarding as the organization is on a progressive initiative to set itself up for the future.
good,"A typical day demands to troubleshoot through circuitry diagrams, heat tests, previous failure documentation, hammer test and string power ups until the failure can be repeated to then start analyzing and figuring out which section/component is failing. If possible to repair without purchases, then soldering, heat sinking and electronic testing might be required to execute. Finally after a journey of troublehooting, reporting and documenting all testing and changes performed is required."
good,"-very busy and fast paced when oilfield is busy"
good,"Good work environment and supportive upper management."
good,Strong leadership with an environment of accountability.  Career advancement opportunities with a strong formalized process to grow both personally and professionally.
good,Safety conscious environment. There is room for advancement and promotions. I worked on a two week rotation on  drilling location. I was on call 24 hours a day so there was no set schedule for hours. I enjoyed the challenge .
good,Trabajo enfocado a objetivos y metas bajo procesos establecidos con una alta dirección en cascada.
good,"Its a great place to work if you want to learn the technical and business side of the oil industry. In a typical day, you must communicate with the client reservoir engineer, drilling engineer, any other party that may be in involved in the operations etc. With so many people from different technical backgrounds to work with, Halliburton is a great springboard to branch out to any area in the upstream or downstream oil markets."
good,Es una empresa de gran prestigio con mucha carga de trabajo cuando la actividad del petróleo era alta con pocos descansos y con una muy buena cultura de seguridad en el trabajo realizado en general una muy buena empresa con un gran ambiente de trabajo.
good,"I spent 10 years with Halliburton from an entry level position to overseeing multiple countries.  Lots of room for career growth, good pay, decent benefits, and a good culture."
good,"It is a very conservative company. Even though many BHI managers migrates to HAL, the company still has very good culture with quality, HSE, processes."
good,I enjoyed working with this company but it was very stressful always worrying about when the layoffs will be and how many people they would get.  I learned many skills by working here and the co workers are wonderful.
good,"*I learned how to maintain and work with different types of equipment ."
good,"- Working as field engineer on site, where i go with my tools to do a certain job. "
good,"La labor entre compañeros en trabajo de campo se realiza de una manera muy fraternal la convivencia en trabajo es sana, con momentos de desestres pero mostrando profesionalismo en al entrar "
good,"Had little to no bad experiences while with company. Family oriented and safe work conditions, great facility, supervisors easy to approach if need be, co-workers helpful."
good,"A good company with the opportunity to make excellent money.  With the price of oil the way it is, job security is low.  Days are very long.  Able to spend quality time with the two weeks on and two weeks off."
good,"Everyone has a ""get it done"" attitude. It is a multi-generational companies which is great because of the varying levels or experience and insights, but change management can be a challenge."
good,"Good place to work learned a lot over 18 years of service."
good,Halliburton was a really good company. They are open to listen to ideas and suggestion. I felt empowered to make tough decisions in crucial situations.
good,"Mainly Operations support. Provided technical expertise to operations' department. "
good,"Halliburton was a fun easy to work in environment, with employs that were easy to work with. A typical day at work consisted of running tests on fluid ends for oil pumps, the hardest part of the job was the getting off work at 3am."
good,"Generally you were called to location to prepare equipment carefully."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Halliburton.  The typical work day varied but that made it interesting.  I was able to learn a lot by volunteering for additional responsibilities and asking a lot of questions.  The only downside was that when the oil industry was down you would start taking on too many tasks due to the limited amount of employees.
good,"I gained many experience in my area as well as in multi-cultural company. It is different with local companies from work behaviour to communicate between managers and employees. I learned how to face with workload, how to manage many tasks with deadline, how to work under pressure.Halliburton also have friendly working environment, with many activities as a way to encourage employees and staffs."
good,Very nice place to work with ample career growth opportunities. Company takes care of the employees with many initiatives.
good,"Most of the managers I worked with were good leaders and supported the team and their employees. However, there are some managers who do not know what they are doing, yet they are still promoted to these roles."
good,There were always challenges. The people were hard working and friendly. Management cared about their people. I learned how to work with a variety of different people from varied backgrounds. In moving from group to group I learned about flexibility and how to learn quickly the essentials of the role.
good,"I enjoyed working for them as it was an interesting place to work and I had some very great co-workers, I learned lots.  Towards the end of my employment we had changed our processes and made it much more streamlined.  We all crossed trained so no one had to come back to a mountain of work after an absence or vacation."
good,"An Opportunity to meet and work closely with people. Different cultures and work ethics brought together to make a difference."
good,"A typical day at work will start at 5:30 am. I will go to our office on location; which would be called ""Command Center"". The night engineer will tell me about how things went through his shift. At 5:45 am the day shift will have a safety meeting to discuss anything that happened that night and what the operation will be that day and how to achieve it safely. "
good,"The facility at one time employees over 800 employees, being in dispatch you interacted with 90% of these people. This was a busy office operating 24/7, some times long hours. This position could be and was stressful for many."
good,to many unfair work related requirements that effect pay increase two safety policy violations per month with no work hour time to complete
good,I enjoyed working with the people in my home office because I learned a lot. The management was poor and would rarely come down to see us so they never saw what was going on. They would base decisions off what they thought they knew when our location was the hardest working and made the most money. Opportunity for advancement isn't high until the crop of coordinators retire.
good,"Great place to work while oil is up, but when it goes down not much job security. long hours but set shifts so you know what days your work and what days you are off."
good,Halliburton is a goal oriented oil field service company. Oil field work means long hours but above average pay. Good benefits
good,"ESG Managers were great, great opportunity to learn and excel. They treat contractors very well as majority of the staff roles are contract employees."
good,"Halliburton offers middle of the road compensation but tremendous benefits. Employees are expected to work hard and often long hours. Good culture of promotion from within with online course training and career path management. "
good,"Great company with huge upside. Great people, training and culture. However currently going through tough times with merger with BHI and oil downsize."
good,Halliburton is a great place to work amongst a staff of dedicated and professional personnel that makes going to work an enjoyable experience.
good,Great place to work if you can put up with the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry.  Good management.  Allowed to be autonomous.
good,"My day would start off with a 30 minute safety meeting where all shift workers, leaders, and management would meet in designated safety office and discuss the work plans far as safety measures, job efficiency, things that need to be done during our shift. After the meeting I'd go relieve my coworker of duties then we'd communicate on what he did during his shift and if it was something he didn't have time to finish I would complete it because we all worked together as a team which was something I loved about working on the rig because the comradare was strong. Then we'd do a walk around and do an inspection check on all equipment and hoses before he leaves to make sure everything is working operation. Once the inspection was completed I start running the centrifuge to remove the rocks and sand from the oil during the drilling process and loading end dump trucks using an excavator. The hardest part of my job is when we have a pump to go out in the middle of a fast drilling process because it's only one person on shift and trying to repair equipment while loading a truck and checking oil weights is pretty hectic."
good,"Being part of Halliburton team ensure appropriate leadership and professional behavior. I was provided with coaching, training, and opportunities for growth. Promoting cooperation and commitment within the team to achieve goals and deliverables. Adding value to the company's products and services. Overall a great place to work."
good,"I work a rotating shift, day/nights, 12+ hour shifts and 6/3 schedule. I work in any weather conditions. My job consist of moving equipment between jobs, running, monitoring and performing maintenance on equipment during the job and rigging up and down equipment. The hardest part of the job is working in extreme weather and the enjoyable part of the job is being outside and travelling to remote areas. I have learned how to move heavy equipment in tight spots, on extreme terrain and in extreme weather. I have learned how to run multiple pieces of equipment that provide water, chemicals and sand for the job. Management was productive and over well structured."
good,"se trabajaba de 7 de la mañana a 5 de la tarde si no habia mucho que hacer operacionalmente."
good,"It is a good company to work for. The company promotes within the group. "
good,Great work environment with a good group of coworkers. Forty hour week while oilfield is slow. Good over time when oil was up.
good,"The industry as a whole is currently in a market correction.  Therefore, there is the usual stress and uncertainty that comes with that."
good,"There is no typical day of work. Every day is different. When you drive to location with a partner 2 trucks are loaded heavily with equipment, need to be on time according to weather conditions."
good,it was a fun yet difficult job kept you on your toes my only problem with them was that the management didn't take suggestions on making it a better work environment.
good,Excelente oportunidad para conocer nuevas tecnologías y operaciones asociadas a empresa de servicios de petroleo y gas
good,"People are easy to get along with, easy to move up if you actually try.  I am using this job as a stepping stone to break into the industry."
good,This company has their people away from their families for two thirds of a year and continually find ways to cut costs which affect the employees overall compensation with no reduction in responsibilities or work load. If you dont mind being away from your family or you are single then its an easy job to make $60k starting out and over $100k in 5 years.
good,"Oilfield work is good work. As with all companies your opinion is related to your direct supervisor.  When you have a good one life is great, if not then not so."
good,I learned that working openly together as a team is a great recipe for success. The people at Halliburton were great to work with.
good,"All of the work was challenging from locating materials, ordering changes, setting up sequences as necessary and contacting engineering, warehouse and procurement personnel for appropriate materials."
good,there was a  lot of very hard work but very good rewards . I received multiple awards and large reimbursements for project success.  I understand this was not very common but they did recognize excellent results when they got them . there was limited knowledge of what the company's next move would be so I just did my best work all the time.
good,"Satisfecho con mi estancia en esta compañía, poco disponibilidad para vida social"
good,"Halliburton is a hard work company, with shifts of 14 days on working 12 hours a day and 7 days off. I enjoyed working there because it was a lot of team work, so everybody helped each other."
good,"Managed laboratory activities directed towards water treatment and characterization and organic polymer design and development. Developed formal reports for clients. Traveled globally with sales team to demonstrate treatment capabilities using a portable lab and address technical questions related to the treatment process. Following polymer development, would frequently travel to remote fracturing locations to oversee fluid chemistry and suggest changes, as needed, to optimize fluid performance."
good,"I learn hear a lot I was satisfied with my job here."
good,"Typically spend my day out in the field, working with others to provide a service to a company. Its great to work with others in a team atmosphere."
good,"se trabaja bajo precion pero con la eficacia posible, trabajo en grupo para obtener los mejores resultados y una buena comunicasion."
good,"Halliburton was my employer for 39 years."
good,I was the sole tech to 10 engineers in the development and testing team for down hole oil-field tools.I worked by myself in this job building and testing tools in locations worlwide.
good,"The benefits at Halliburton were excellent and the pay was too.  The place fluctuated from day to day.  I never knew what to expect.  Most days involved driving; however, I was mostly self directed with very little direction from management which enabled me to pursue safety training of new hires.  The only downfall to working for Halliburton was if work slowed down, larger lay offs would occur."
good,"competitive salaries, great employees. plenty of opportunities to advance, good benefits, great training ground for Oil and Gas industry, safety conscience"
good,"Great outlook for future employment within company. They are great with their training and safety culture. Halliburton has countless opportunities world wide and they are willing to train for the necessary positions as applicable. It is however the oil field, and as everyone knows, it goes up and down with the market. Halliburton would like to retain their employees but business is business. I just wish that the management I was directly under would keep to their word or keep their word to themselves."
good,"Good benefits"
good,"be involved every part and stage of job activities,"
good,"I have nothing but good things to say about my time at Halliburton, and would recommend it highly.It is definitely a place where you are well compensated, and have the ability to advance at a rapid pace."
good,Halliburton is the overall best of the big three oilfield services companies. However it is still a very market and performances based culture. I guess the best way to put it is it is Feast or famine.
good,"Here is where you want to be starting out in the Oil and Gas Industry.    It doesn't matter if your an Engineer, or floor hand, the experience and knowledge gained from working with Halliburton is the best."
good,"Good place to work, Gas and Oil can be a tough life, lots of ups and downs, I wish it was a more stable market in the US. I got laid off, but I would go back in a second when and if my job opens back up."
good,"Es una empresa líder en su ramo con políticas internas muy bien establecidas, muy rígidas orientadas a la seguridad y buena conducta del trabajador, de respeto y diversidad."
good,Very long hours are good for the bank account but rough with the family life. Hard work is a must and being able to perform with little sleep is key.
good,"I was mostly staying out on location for 24 hr. service, I would have two mud checks a day where I would have to test the properties of the drilling fluid to make sure that the properties were staying within the given parameters.  I would generate a report daily for the customers as well."
good,"Great Company to work  for I learned a lot while employed with them."
good,"The pay may be lower than other companies, but the benefits are really good and affordable. But anyone in this industry will tell you that it can collapse at any time. My yard is a good example, there for 45 years, then closed. Still, I don't regret anything. I enjoyed the job, but more importantly I enjoyed the camaraderie amongst the Cement crew. Those guys will become your second family"
good,"Halliburton es una empresa donde uno puede aprender y desarrollar muchas habilidades. Es una empresa que me deja mucho conocimientos, una gran escuela"
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo era levantarme a las 4:00 am y empezar mi dia llendo camino a la base. Ahi miembros de mi cuadrilla me estarian esperando listos para partir a un trabajo en un pozo petrolero lejos en lo profundo de la espesa selva chiapaneca. El equipo consistia en un camion (como el que usan las televisoras para grabar programas), una grua y camionetas ligeras. Al llegar a la locacion se conducia una junta de seguridad y posteriormente la ejecucion del trabajo. Al termino (el cual podia durar unas horas o varios dias continuamente) yo creaba un registro que se le entregaba al cliente. Finalmente nos regresabamos todos de nuevo a la base. "
good,"My department had an 11 day on, 3 day off schedule, 12 hours per day minimum. Our typical work day started at 6:00AM and ended anywhere between 5:00PM and anytime in the next AM, it was not unusual to be headed to the locker room close to midnight night after night, on rare occasions we would work through until the next morning."
good,As an oil field service provider the work is 24/7 and outside.  The employment is cyclical with employment following job by job requirements.
good,"Responsible for loading materials for our Frac crews on a daily basis, and receiving various types of materials from our vendors. I learned how to manage two separate crew's on a 24 hour shift and how to keep the operations working efficiently without shutting down any jobs. The hardest part of the job was learning how to prioritize jobs and assignments as well as train personnel, and maintain the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of job was being able to share all that I learned with co-works and mentoring new employees."
good,Working for this company was a great job. Just wasn't long enough. Plus being forced to write a longer review is not the way to get honest opinions freom people.
good,"Overall very good place to work, pay is decent, people are nice, benefits good, not too strict on stat/stop time, 4 day work week option in many departments. Hardest part of my job was having to haul my logging tool to different buildings on a golf cart, sometimes in adverse weather conditions."
good,"A empresa era muito agradavel para se trabalhar, pois o local de trabalho era confortavel, limpo, e as pessoas que faziam parte do quadro de funcionarios sempre buscaram ter uma excelente relação interpessoal com os demais funcionarios. Sempre buscavamos ajudar o outro o maximo que pudessemos. A parte mais dificil do trabalho era responder as demandas expontaneas , sendo que ja tinhamos previsto demandas para todos os dias."
good,You work long hours that you never realized would be asked of you. It builds good team values much like in the military due to living away from home with your coworkers for weeks at a time. all in all its a great experience and learning about yourself by pushing your limits physically and mentally.
good,"Oil Field Service Company with global reach, 1st rate technology in most product lines."
good,"As a field professional, I led cross-functional teams to deliver upstream oil and gas projects in China, India and Saudi Arabia working for a wide range of clients."
good,Easy work and a lot of long hour. Great benefits and lots of vacation hour the first day of employment. All the coworkers that have been there awhile didn't mind helping new employees.
good,Working at Halliburton was a very new experience to me.  The job itself was challenging but not over my abilities.  The people I worked with and for were from all walks of life and provided for a very diverse and interesting work environment.  The company itself was very stream lined and compensated well for the amount of work and conditions I had to work in.  When I was laid-off I did get a genuine feeling that the company was sad to have to let me go.
good,"Depending on your position, there is plenty of work and opportunities for advancement if you work hard at it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with bad management and long work day."
good,"Generally, daily job is not that technical but due to costs cutting in the company there was reduction in work force so that  each employee's work load had been continuously increasing recently. On learning - there's  a massive knowledge in intranet which has a university portal where we can complete courses."
good,Una empresa muy buena donde se aprenden demasiadas cosas dentro de la industria del petroleo y a nivel de la seguridad ayudando a ser mejores cada dias hasta en nuestros hogares
good,"A halliburton me deu uma ótima oportunidade, foi o meu primeiro emprego na area tecnica, e eu só tenho a agradecer a chance e a todos que trabalharam comigo, aprendi muito, mais do que no proprio curso."
good,Left alone to perform duties and jobs. Allowed to let creative juices 'flow'. Employees were friendly and easy to get along with.
good,It is a challenging and different work environment. Your co-workers are usually just as close as your family.Hours are unpredictable at times due to unforseen circumstances that can happen on a job such as weather.
good,Benefits are good and pay is good job requires a lot of travel and being away from home. Training is good and they prepare you for the job task.
good,"Sales management, Customer services, Client Rep, Intelligent Completions, Running the job on site, QAQC, Equipment make-up and pressure testing, Productive, good, intelligent and agile co-workers, meeting deadline, Coping with pressure of logistics and load-out to sites; Clients - Total, AGIP, EXXON-MOBIL, SNEPCO, CHEVRON, SHELL (SPDC)"
good,Halliburton is very good place to work which help not only develop your skills but help you apply them in day to day activities.
good,"Halliburton Technology was fun and laid back. We worked at our own pace and did pretty much whatever we wanted to as long as we got our work done. However, I was not paid properly or designate the right job title. I pushed for promotions as i was leading designer on multiple projects but never got it."
good,"A typical day at Halliburton cement lab is filled with fun-like challenges.  You're challenged by having to work mechanically on machines used to run tests in addition to analyzing data.  I had the good fate of running into a great crew in Laredo that was always willing to help and teach.  Management was always very willing to help and move people around if you needed to take a day off for family.  There were challenges as in any job, but I would not say anything was extremely hard as a task or situation because of the good vibes and overall structure.  One of the things I most enjoyed while working there was the fact that you had a well rounded set of tasks that gave you options to be as physical or abstract while still doing your job.  You could help with maintenance or just run tests which really helps when you're working long hours."
good,"Had a great time working with Halliburton for seven years.  I was employed at three different facilities, worked on different product lines, and liked my job at each one.  No longer employed due to oil/gas economy and reduction in force."
good,Halliburton is a good company with a steady work force. It has a great feel to the company and they take care of their employees.
good,There are plenty of opportunities to get training and learn. The money is pretty good. The biggest con in my job at least is being on call 24/7 and being away from home for long periods of time.
good,"I was a material handler, with Halliburton Energy Services, I used to help load/unload semi trucks that transported chemical agents to various fracking sites. We had anywhere from 0-30 trucks usually in a shift that was 12 hrs. and then cleaning the warehouse, and doing paperwork was done during down time. Management I wish had a better hold on what things needed to be changed for better productive work through out the day, but my other co workers were all great people willing to learn more with each passing day, and willing to lend a hand in any area which it was needed. The hardest part of the job was probably the 12 hr shifts and not getting the time with family and working 6 days on with only 3 days off it didn't give much time to catch up on sleep. "
good,"work with Halliburton nice, good team work and everyone take care for safety."
good,"Train new whse personell on safety, fork lift safety - training, haz mat clean up and disposal. Load, unload containers, Inventory control."
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Halliburton. overall they took care of us and generously paid us for our time. I would recommend any position offered. There were some downfalls in the section I worked for, but ultimately, you cant go wrong here."
good,can move up quickly if you stick with it. long hours can be hard for some.

good,"A Halliburton me proporcionou uma excelente experiencia em manutenção ,operação,comunicação com excelente cursos teóricos e práticos ,trabalhávamos com uma equipe de profissionais bastante competentes com respeito ,dedicação ,educação ,companheirismo."
good,"Irei expor meu parecer primeiramente sobre a Petrobras, pois esta era minha plataforma de trabalho. Aprendi muito com uma equipe extremamente atenciosa e unida, na qual consegui expor minhas idéias e aprimorar meus conhecimentos de perfuração e completação. Sobre a Halliburton, não tive muito convivio, porem era uma empresa excelente e termos de conhecimento e tecnologia. O única prós era o plano de carreira do setor Landmark no qual eu pertencia que era inexistente."
good,load and unload trucks monitor incoming shipments make sure all parts are on hand. provide support receiving department.
good,"Halliburton is top of the service industry chain. The benefits are top notch, the pay is great - but you will have to work hard and work along many different kinds of people. 100% travel with expenses paid."
good,"Good company willing to transfer you around departments, flexible work schedule."
good,"I had to learn a lot about sensors in the tool, and about the earths magnetic field. i was very exciting and again, stressful. However, that is the nature of the job. Coming from drilling on an oil rig, to the new world of MWD tools was the hardest. When i was (Broke Out) or allowed to run a job on my own was the best feeling in the world."
good,"Great company to work for.  Pay and benefits are amazing, work isn't tough by any means."
good,The company is busy so management likes everyone. Just do your job and mind your business.

good,"El ambiente de trabajo era agradable por que como lider del grupo de ventas siempre tenia una sonrisa o un comentario positivo lo cual se trasmitia al grupo, Halliburton fue una gran escuela que me permitio crecer profesionalmente tanto en el aspecto tecnologico como comercial a través de sus programas de adiestramiento, nuestro gerente por varios años fue un guia constante con el cual se manejaron excelentes relaciones hasta su salida, el cambio de estilo de la gerencia impacto negativamente al grupo, creo que fue lo mas dificil de manejar, ya que la motivacion cayó, lo que mas me gusto fue disfrutar de la interreaccion con mis clientes, ver las metas comerciales trazadas cumplirse año a año  y conocer personas de otras culturas en mis viajes de entrenamiento en los diferentes paises a los que asisti."

good,"Um clima muito frio de trabalho, porém com benefícios atraentes."
good,"A typical day involve arriving early, getting my machine up and running and machining various pump parts throughout the day. Also worked in QA which involved a lot of investigating nonconformance issues and coming up with solutions or at least a better way of doing things to reduce spoilage. Management is just kind of here from what I've experienced. There doesn't seem to be a lot of caring about employees. We're here to work and should be thankful we have a job. The hardest part of my job is fighting off boredom when the work gets monotonous. My co-workers are easy to work with and for the most part are very helpful and have a team attitude. "

good,2-5 week field stints working 12 hour tours.  Great pay & benefits.
good,"Halliburton is one of the most innovative and high tech companies in the Fracking industry. The equipment I work on at Halliburton is much more advanced than the equipment other companies in the same industry use. The majority of my time spent at work involves troubleshooting electronic failures on equipment, performing preventative maintenance on equipment by filling out a document that gets recorded, creating work orders, using Lock out/Tag out procedures, going on call outs to well sites, repairing satellite communication errors at well sites, and calibrating devices that read pressure, density, flow, and temperature, I also communicate with supervisors and operators on how to properly operate equipment all while practicing proper and safe procedures. I work in a very team-oriented environment with great co-workers that are always willing to help. We never leave anyone behind struggling with a problem and by working that way with each other, we always succeed. Management always provides us with whatever parts or tools we need, or if we need specific days off they are willing to give them to us and are always willing to help us whether its at work or even in our personal lives. I've learned a lot about equipment I had never seen before, mainly because Halliburton creates and invents their own equipment. I also learned a great deal about safety, H2S, and radiation. Our devices that measure density use radiation and there are a lot of safety precautions involved in maintaining these devices. The hardest part of the job is running into a problem you've never ran into before,"

good,Good company to work for. Pay is excellent as are benefits. As a drlg fluids engineer i didn't work closely with other Halliburton employees. Worked mostly on my own. The 24 hr on call was somewhat stressfull and long hours.
good,"Great company, pay is good and people arent hard to deal with. My co workers are nice and fun to work with."
good,"At Halliburton I worked my way from the bottom to the top of the frac crew that I was on. I learned to operate all of the equipment on the well, train others on how to run that equipment, develop training manuals for new hires that I didn't have time to work with, and to run the HSE side of the on site crew. Every morning I would give a brief safety meeting, give work assignments for that day, and tell everyone what type of chemicals we had on location that day. Once we were started I would check the equipment, employees productivity, and watch out for any new safety hazards. Once a job was finished we would rig down, coordinate our move to the next well, and rig up on that location so that we could start down hole the next morning. Out of my time there I received awards for service, and showed that my crew was the best in the field camp, which allowed us to be sent out to more wells than any of the other crews in the camp."
good,Everyday was a new day of learning something different about the employee and the company itself. What I gained from all this is self respect and work hard to get ahead. I learned to lead and to be self control to teaches other to follow and be safe at all time.
good,Rig up and run blender and preform maintance. Co workers where great. hardest part was being gone for 29 days but 2 weeks off paid was worth if.
good,"A typical day as a Frac Operator is that you meet up at a designated time, have a safety meeting, and travel to location via crew vehicles or DOT equipment. Have a safety meeting at the location including all 3rd party and customers. Rig up job for pressure and rate designed for job. Pump job efficiently and safely ensuring all equipment, chemicals, and proppant are running properly. Have a safety meeting after pumping on how to rig down. Rig down job safely, turn in chemicals, and maintain equipment. Pre-trip vehicles and move them to yard or next job."

good,"Good job, local so home nightly.  Volital jobs as it's the oil field, the hard part is the secrecy.  Upper management doesnt like to advise on what's going on til they've already done what they want regardless of how or who it affects.  So you have to have flexibility as you may need to relocate to other areas.  Good experience, excellent benifits."
good,"feeling of adventure, great company to work for. Oil field , when prices are good company work is excellent. would work for them again. various job locations.excellent benefits."
good,Great place to start in the oilfield with the training and classes they offer. Pay starts pretty low during training but quickly increases after about a year.

The benefits of the company were the best I've ever had."

good,I had a very good time working at Halliburton with all of my co-workers. They were fair to work with and we got along real well. Life was good working for Halliburton.
good,"As a service operator you are rarely at home. You may be home as little as 1 day between trips. Leading to being tired due to always working a nightshift. However, they do give you training schedules etc which is good for learning and they are keen for you to progress. Mainly due to being under staffed so it can feel like there’s a lot of pressure/responsibility on your shoulders. But this leads to more pay. Which could be better due to responsibilities but it’s not the worst."
good,"Progressive advancement from lead to manager, Sustainment Group. Exposure to international employees in a multi disciplined setting. Access to travel within North America in support of drilling projects"
good,"Halliburton is a great job with excellent benefits, great pay, and great with overtime. The job is tough; you're exposed to the very elements when working on the oilfield. If you're a driver, its no different; there will be long hours on the road transporting material. If youre single, this is definitely a job to look for and try to advance yourself with."

good,I enjoyed the pay as well as the benefits. The guys I worked with made it easier to handle being away from home and family. Strongly recommend Halliburton if youre looking for a career in the oil and gas industry.
good,"I held several jobs while employed at Halliburton. I was vocationally trained as a conventional machinist. I scored within the top 3 in my class and was given the opportunity to pick with department and type of machine to work on. I picked the CNC (computer numerical controlled) department. Here we would do the set-up and jobs that were entered into their system from being most urgent to least urgent. The more parts you made the better and faster your set-ups would become. I spent the last year working on the home bench assembling hoses for mobile drilling platforms and pumper trucks. I had to do this because of the petroleum industries fluctuating highs and lows. Unfortunately, Halliburton usually lays off workers every 2 to 3 years depending on the market. They would hire the employees back after a few months. I left my second layoff and entered college. Now I have just completed my Master's degree and I am actually thankful for being laid off and having to apply myself."
good,"tough environment with hard works , no any fun tools , very restricted at the laws. we are working under the direct sun and to much tension in the job"
good,Good company to work for. Hardest part of the job would be the hours at times. The unpredictability of the work load.  Fairly compensated and good benefits.
good,"was hired summer of 2012 for frac, trained for and received my class A Cdl, and worked there for over  a year and a half.  objectively, i prefer Frac to working on the rigs, but the days are long and the extremes of the seasons excruciating.  Yard time was 3am, and we were typically off by 5 or so.  a lot of beating iron, rigging up wellheads, and so on.. but mostly operating equipment.  the pay was competitive, and the benefits fairly substantially.  there are not many ways for a non college educated person to make a living wage outside of the trades, but the oil field can be a lucrative option.  Halliburton, i thought, treated me fairly.  my complaints lie more with my own personality and (my) compatibility with this line of work"
good,Worked as a Admin in the company. This was my first job ever. So I did gain a lot of experience which I could put to use in my current employer workplace.

good,When I was there it felt like you belonged in a world class organization.  People were nice and it felt like everyone was a family.  Unfortunately things changed a little with oil pricing at the bottom of the barrel.  No pun intended.
good,"excelente empresa, muy buen ambiente laboral, capacitacion constante."

good,"Working for Halliburton exposes you to challenges that make grow. Being and International company, you interact with colleagues and customers of diverse cultures and backgrounds and that is why Halliburton's work culture is based on RESPECT. The hardest part of the job is working against the competition to deliver the best in class service to the customer. The most entertaining part of the job is receiving credit from the customer for exceeding their expectations."
good,"Nice employer who provide good benefits when times are good."
good,"They paid fairly for the employees, health care and insurance, you can get very good training in Halliburton. Also the company help you to promote and grow up in your career if you want"

good,"I worked as a field engineer for production enhancement services (frac).  It was a great job right out of college as a single man.  I had the opportunity to learn the product lines and processes while getting paid a fair salary.  Lot of hours though----you got to pay your dues before positions with more reasonable hours open up."
good,"I worked as a equipment operator (frac hand) in the Marcellus/Utica. Halliburton is managed well, if you can dream it, it's happened and they also have solution. Random rag tag bunch of guys on my crew, not very good chemistry. The 14 days on 7 days off schedule wasn't ideal and expect to work 100 plus hours every week. Many other jobs in oil and gas that are comparable pay and benefits without the hard tax on quality of life. Some people love it mostly ex military guys that are use to being away for extended periods of time. Was hard labor at times but mostly standing around waiting on someone or something."
good,Excelente empresa con altas posibilidades de crecimiento profesional a nivel mundial.
good,I was an intern in the casing department. They certainly do a better than average job training their people for their roles. Other engineers were very competent and seemed to enjoy what they do.

good,"12 hours shifts, learned halliburton's way of doing things. management was good, co-workers were knowledgeable. hardest part of the job was the drill outs. I enjoyed the frac assist the most."
good,I liked my co-workers.  The benefits were pretty good as well as the compensation.  The work/life balance was great in my opinion.  The ability the flex the working hours was great.  Management didn't see to go to bat for the employees too often.  The hardest part of the job were reductions.
good,I liked the company goals and culture. A change in pay and facility(management)  prompted me to seek other means of employment. Enjoyed my time at the company and would work there again.
good,"Halliburton while on the surface is a wonderful job, does have a few draw backs.  A typical work day lasts 10 hours, and is extremely hectic, or completely boring, there is no in between.  I learned a lot about how to properly maintain a bulk plant, unfortunately I also learned a lot about how to make myself look busy when there was nothing to do.  Management, more specifically the coordinators, were always a source of confusion and frustration, as they didn't seem to understand their own job.  My co-workers were the best part of my job there, they kept everything in perspective, and managed to keep the job fun.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the ongoing requirements, that seemed to change regularly.  The most enjoyable part of working with Halliburton was the work environment, most of the people working there try to make each day as light hearted as possible."
good,"Halliburton is one of the most stable and relivable companies to work for. I work for this company for 8 years but to cost reductions i was terminated. They did hold of to lay me off until the last minute. I learned a lot on safety and procedure adherence. "
good,"Enjoy being part of the team, people that count on me and I can rely on."
good,"En un día típico de trabajo después de enterarme del panorama, elaboro una lista de metas a cumplir en ese día, y las voy tachando a medida que se cumplen, he aprendido a llevar las cosas paso a paso a no desesperarme si puedo esperar haciendo otras cosas siento que no desaproveche el tiempo, mis colegas son amenos y eficientes realizan con mucha habilidad su trabajo y tienen mucho temple bajo presión, la parte mas difícil del trabajo es tener un desacuerdo técnico y tener que señalar los errores de otra persona por escrito, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es sentir la satisfacción de haber realizado una labor  en equipo y de una manera armoniosa."
good,"Flexible work hours."
good,"Halliburton, Azerbaijan is a strong player in the Oil & Gas Industry; target oriented, aggressive on the market and focused on delivering a continuous service to its client."

good,Great benefits and good co-workers. My favorite part of the job was meeting new people through the classes I instructed.
good,Being productive during each workday. I learned many things about downhole and the equipment I work with. I enjoyed a lot of world traveling with my job in Subsurface safety valves.I also met many people in the workplace and have gained lifelong friends.

good,The former colleagues are fun to work with. They know how to do their work and have fun doing it at the same time. I would love to work for Halliburton again.
good,"- Consistent workload."
good,"Below points observed working with Halliburton "
good,"The work load was sometimes overwhelming, sometimes steady, and every once in a  while slow."
good,Was by far one of the most enjoyable jobs I have ever had. Everyday there was something new and exciting to work on. My co-workers were extremely nice and friendly from day one. Management was kind and respectable although their interaction was minimal with the shop floor employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the highs and lows of the oil field.
good,"Job culture is challenging.  Expectations are set high, 24/7/365 operation.  Demanding time requirement.  Excellent resources available, great benefits."
good,really liked working here. A few bad apples would pop up now and again. Occasionally the communication between dispatch and workers or lab workers and bulk plant was bad which slowed work and stirred the cooperates hornets nest but is defiantly a great company..
good,"You learn multi-purpose functions as the job is not your normal everyday job. You learn to operate equipment, handle chemicals, work in small and large groups. You work with computers, equipment, you manage people, schedule equipment / personnel, you work on logistics of materials and equipment. The job has many functions and you have to be willing to be out of your comfort zone. Its is not a job that is the same thing day in and day out. You can put in some big hours in some locations you can work fly in and out of others. It is a fun, challenging and rewarding job"
good,"I work a 12 hour shift performing various pressure testing and occasional cementing. In general, I get paid for about twice the time I actually spend doing physical labor and by physical labor I mean sitting on a 5 gallon bucket monitoring pressure."
good,Nice people to work with. Opportunities to work overseas. Good compensation package. Your co-workers help you. Your supervisors are nice. Is like a big family. Company give you a good training.
good,Halliburton is a great place to work when the oilfield is booming.  They do their best to keep people employed during the downtimes.
good,"es una empresa, la cual te hace crecer como personas, aprendi muchas cosas como trato con los ing. en las unidades operativas, el trabajo no es dificil solo hay que saberlo llevar, lo que mas me gusto es que se formo un gran equipo"

good,Great working environment when the oil and gas industry was high. Management and our team all worked together to keep our customers happy.
good,Great opportunists while Oil and Gas is prominent. Great potential as the Oil and Gas market continues to develop. As markets develop the continuation of progress is merciful.
good,"Work up in the Jonah field and the Mesa field fracturing wells.  A typical day at work - swap out with the other shift, get job updates, and carry on with pumping wells - sometimes it depending on where/who we worked for, we would frac 3-6 zones per shift.  Management was always supportive, but sometimes indecisive especially in the winter times - for example, sometimes they'll try to convince us to keep fracing even though we're out in extreme temperatures - overlooking the hazards of extreme temperatures.  Coworkers were very helpful in my progression from an Operator Assistant to a supervisor role.  The hardest part of the job is traveling on a 2 weeks on and 1 week off schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job is progressing from one area to another learning how to operate different equipment."
good,"At Halliburton I learned many design skills and testing norms in an industrial environment. The design team is very advanced in their engineering knowledge. At the same time, many of the design engineers need to implement and test their designed parts and assemblies therefore creating a process that provides tremendous growth for engineers. I was able to design and test my own parts and the testing apparatus for it."
good,A great place to learn and grow as your experience and qualifications  provide opportunities for a great learning curve and professional growth.
good,"I have been an employee of Halliburton for four years. For those years I have been in charge of project management and supervising employees. I enjoy the work I do because I know that it has worth, the hardest part of that however, is that the worth of the work we do is not recognized a lot of the time."
good,Good Company there is room to evolve. cam establish more connections and learn more about business conduct. many skills to be acquired and more hands on experience
good,"Starting pay is on the lower side and they make it hard to get raises with the competency testing you have to go through rather then just showing hard work. Crews are fun and bond quick with each other, crew decides on everything as a unit."
good,"Hard work, fair compensation. Facing lay offs, due to economy and oil over production."
good,The company is so big and has come up with so many policies to cover themselves legally it made doing the most basic jobs a struggle at times.  The co-workers are great and a lot of opportunity to advance quickly if ya have the drive to do so.
good,"Great company, big on safety which is a plus!!  long hours but that's oilfield life, rewarding when you check your bank account! advancement is on you against you."
good,"I enjoyed working as a team with management and employees to ensure a positive and profitable work environment.  "

The day to day work environment includes delivering expert services to oilfield companies, supplying them with the best solutions possible, and providing technical advise and suggestions on how to improve customer's operations. Management is strong but will support you as long as you work hard. Co-workers are great they're the ones that keep you going even in tough market conditions. The hardest part of the job is the amount of time involved, there are no days off in the oilfield so you have to be prepared to work 24/7 and always be available. The most enjoyable part is the experience you get and the people that you meet in the industry. The oilfield is a surprisingly small world."
good,"Se aprende a ser tolerante a trabajar bajo presión formar un buen grupo de trabajo ya que las  jornadas laborales muy pesadas , teniendo una buena estabilidad laboral."

good,"I had the chance to acquire a great knowledge and experience for over two years, and the working environment has shaped my personalty and working ethics. You learn something new everyday and the hands on experience divides the work between the office and the field."
good,"Halliburton is a great company to work for it, especially if you are an engineer. Also if you are a younger professional will be able to develop all your expertise and improve as a professional."
good,Start work at 6:00 am get your job  task for the day perform repairs order parts as needed. Most of the times a co-worker would help with repairs.
good,I was very blessed to have broken into the oil an gas industry with Halliburton.  They are to date the best managed company I have worked for.  The pay is not as high as other companies but the benefits are good and the work is stable.
good,"Long hours everyday, I learned to appreciate the time I had at home with my family. You become a family because of the long hours you work together. The hardest part of the job was being away from your family and missing out on things your kids are involved in. I love that I make a great living for my family and that I am able to provide a good life for them. The benefits are great and that's hard to come by."
good,"Pros: good compensation for graduates. No over-time. Colleagues are all very smart people. Can always learn new things from colleagues and the challenging daily research work. "
good,"12 hours a day 7 days a week. Hazardous work environment with great pay and, benefits. Living arrangements are not terrible but, not like in the states."
good,"Halliburton was an exciting job. Always something new and always busy. A normal day would consist of loading trucks, cleaning the yard, paperwork, and communicating with employees. my coworkers and I had very good communication and developed a professional friendship."
good,"Typical at work you go in and do your job."
good,enjoyed working here. good pay and co workers. a lot of work out of town good rotations but not much time home. long hours.
good,I enjoyed my time at Halliburton. They have the best equipment and training methods. It is a great place to start your oilfield career.
good,"great place to work had a big impact in my life, provided my family with a good financial stability, had good opportunity  for advancement"
good,Halliburton was a nice experience but because it is in the oil field the job security is not there. Many friendly people around you. It is a cubicle type environment.
good,"Working at Halliburton was an educational expertness. Working on meany different tool lines and testing equipment. Allowing me to utilize and develop Electrical & Mechanical Engineering skills. Throw the day to day operation of testing, tear down, troubleshooting, and repair of various down hole tools. In a strongly community oriented work environment. Were everyone was quick to help there fellow employee if needed."
good,"if you are looking for an adventure and see different areas this is the place to work at. Halliburton is a big company and its world wide in over 60 different countries. Management makes some mistakes but other than that it is a great company to work at, and if you want to expand your choices, you can request transfer at any part of the US or world."
good,"Typical day at Halliburton was between 8-12 hours a day, my job was inspecting the HOT jobs that needed to go to a district office to a field hand or a customer needed a part for around the world. We went through a lot of safety courses,technical and audit classes throughout the year.  You could not find better co-workers to work with in our department any where in the U.S. My hardest part of the job was being laid off because of the price of oil .  I always enjoyed working on different parts from different vendor manufacturers and also from our engineering department."
good,"Training and benefits are are great.  Management good, just a bad time in the market for oil.  Lots of opportunities when there is an upscale market."
good,"Managing accounts is a 24 hour job because the oilfield doesn't stop. There is typically a customer needing something ""yesterday"" at all times and you do your best to make the customer happy. Time management is essential to complete all tasks and control work/life balance. I learned a lot about the oilfield from drilling to completions and I learned even more about myself. Being honest with your customers and your own people will always promote success. Management was based on their individual personalities, wether micromanagers or more relaxed. In an industry such as the oil and gas industry, I found most employees to be very self-driven. Establishing solid relationships with customers made for the most success."
good,It was a great place to work. Till they moved people in that had no clue about what it takes to do the job. I like the everything they did till the move someone that had no clue.
good,Great experience lots of way to come up in this company and they will pay for your school if you choose to advance your self. I learned a lot about the oil field industry. Management is different dont expect to take a day off any time you want you have to have a big notice just for a vacation . Hardest part about this job is being gone all the time from family and friends but you will have that fat check coming in.
good,Overall great company. Had some issues with management not keeping they're word. Made sure the employees are well trained.
good,I learned that I can manage weather either hot or cold and working in it with my co-workers. Management was well set very organized. Hardest part in my job is working all night and morning we couldn't leave unless the job was done. My enjoyable part of my job is the employees there we all worked as a team when we got our job done.
good,"With this economy no one is safe in this company."
good,"En general se puede decir que Halliburton es una buena empresa."
good,Halliburton is a big company with a lot of great opportunities. Working for Halliburton's Baroid is a lot of physical work as well as dangerous work and there is a lot of exposure to chemicals along with mediocre pay. I loved the fact that we worked 13 hours a day so lots of over-time pay and the free food on the slope is nice as well.
good,The company is the largest operator in the country and they are present in over 80 countries. They have a global reach and a wide variety product service lines. This insures that they have a job for anyone in anyplace you want to work.
good,"This is halliburton india, they have very good work culture and challenging projects ,Highly motivated and helping employees.Working hours are more compared to all other facilities and benefits are normal"
good,"Working at the Halliburton lab has taught me much.  The challenges that are presented everyday is refreshing and makes the job well worth it.  Figuring out cement or stimulation designs, how to design them for the customer, and implementing solutions makes for productive days.  I've learned many things about oil field services science, and how much the technology has advanced. My co-workers and manager are very helpful and we work well as a team to solve various problems.  The hardest part about my job is knowing that if oil prices go down too much or the economy tanks, my job would be terminated.  I like the people I work with and the customers we work for, I also like the challenge of solving their problems with good science,"
good,Liked working with my crew had the best coworkers and friends
good,"Had to take over LGC from cross shift and be informed as how things were running, repair anything that was not working right and report to cross shift as to how things ran for my shift."
good,"A typical day in my position as Materials Control Supervisor is hard to define, because I covered quite a few plants, and it depended on where I was that day. I did a lot of downloading reports from SAP to Excel, cleaning them up and either analyzing them and determining what actions needed to be taken, or forwarding them to the PSL's(Product Service Lines) and/or materials personnel for them to make decisions. I worked a lot with the PSL's to determine what we needed to do regarding slow moving and Excess and obsolete stock. I also ran reports on missed opportunities to redeploy inventory to other Halliburton locations, and worked these reports in a proactive manner to get other locations to utilize materials that we had available. Cycle Count goals where a big priority for us, so I regularly ran reports to determine how we were doing, and if we needed to increase our efforts anywhere, I would get with the personnel at those locations to make sure we met our goals. Other regular activities included monitoring the training of employees and their competency assessment progress. In addition to that, I did the interviewing, hiring disciplining and firing for my department. Of course my team was responsible for all of the normal  warehouse duties, like shipping and receiving, timely materials movements in  SAP, MRP, sales order deliveries, requisitioning and plant material number extensions. We really got into most every business aspect and worked with most all of the different groups in Halliburton."
good,"Being a supervisor at Halliburton has allowed me to learn to lead others and work in a stressful enviornment while meeting deadlines and goals.  I have learned the proper way to efficiently run a crew that is able to run and maintain equipment, train other employees to do the same, and monitor such equipment. My crew members have taught me to work together well, despite any differences that may occur. The hardest part of the job to me was learning that you lead people and manage things. The most enjoyable part of the job is commadarity and being able to provide for my family."
good,"Apesar do dia de trabalho ser corrido, tenho total liberdade em falar com minha gerência e coordenação sobre qualquer assunto."
good,The job was easy and somewhat fun but the pay was not competitive to other companies in the oilfield.
good,"this company made me speak English, so I have started real career from here. "
good,"Durante a permanência a bordo da plataforma, operamos os equipamentos, ao término das atividades realizamos as manutenções preventivas em todos os equipamentos, participamos diariamente das reuniões com a fiscalização e elaboramos o relatório de operação e manutenção."
good,I would work for them again over other energy services. Plenty of hours and the company stretches across America.
good,"Great benifets, hours, management. You make what you want out of it, you can easily move up the ladder if you so choose to."
good,"Addressing manufacturing needs on the production floor."
good,"I worked on the backside of the oil rigs. I processed the cuttings coming up from the ground, using machinery and construction equipment. Company leadership definetly has there favorites."
good,"In a Trailer on the Rigsite, you will monitor the direction and log gamma,. Hardest part of the job is the long Hours and being away from home for days on end. The most enjoyable part is the compensation. Not to mention the large amount of personal time."
good,Always busy with my own work load and helping others getting their work done. Management allows me to take my own decisions and helpful in providing all assistance. Good team environment and love to work such a company.
good,"A typical day working at Halliburton consists of being at the yard around 4:30am, getting to location around 6am and working a 12 hour shift until 6pm, than traveling back to the yard atound 7:30pm. Thats a typical day when your on a Frac crew at Halliburton in Odessa TX."
good,"Long Hours away from home, great benefits but not enough pay"
good,"Essential work consisted select the tools to meet customer's requirements, prepare, assembly tools in the workshop, torque the connections making different pressure tested, fairte tested the functionality on the valves."
good,"Buen salario, prestaciones y todo lo que conlleva trabajar para una de las empresas mas importantes en el sector petrolero en el mundo, sin embargo el área en la que me encuentro es muy exhaustiva físicamente ya que son jornadas laborales que se pueden alargar por días."
good,trabajar en Halliburton fue una experiencia inolvidable. ya que aprendi demasiadas cosas tanto de herramientas y maquinas como los valores acerca de las 5s  el quidar el medio ambiente. y la exelente seguridad de los programas que se realisavan ya que teníamos demasiados cursos acerca de la seguridad tanto como brigadas. simulacros juntas donde participavamos cada mes área por área sin tener problemas con los compañeros todo muy bien. abia  demasiado tiempo extra y como toda empresa las cargas de trabajo que nos ponían para cumplir las metas del mes.
good,"Hard workers, long hours, commitment to safety and service quality."
good,"Trabalho dinâmico, aprendizagem contínua, gerência com credibilidade, ambiente de trabalho harmonioso, porém dificuldade na demanda e volume de trabalho."
good,most days i drove over 400 miles and was ona job from a few hours to a few days.
good,"Great place for training and on the job experience. Culture is very safety oriented, and fellow employees are willing to help with problems you may have. As with many oilfield service providers, environment is fast paced and hours may be long."
good,It isn't the highest paying service company but there is good job security and chance for advancement.
good,"Like any oil service companies Halliburton is great place to learn the trade. Training is top notch and much can be learned there. The hours can be long 14+ hours some days, but the pay check is well worth the time in the field. Maintainance days are like a regular 8 to 5 work day. Friends can be quickly made becuase of the time spent in the field. Most of the expeienced hands are willing to pass on the skills to sucede. The tasks can be challenging but not to dificult if attention is paid."
good,Heath and safety is top priority. Halliburton has tried to apply Lean to the workplace successfully. The shop floor workers are great. Not to sure about management.
good,"A typical day for me will include overseeing production processes as well as the duties and performance of a small crew. Over the years I have learned how to manage people a better degree. I have also been given opportunities to help in training procedures and counseling/disciplinary sessions. Management tends to do an adequate job of keeping the plant safe and productive but the focus on individual development is, in my opinion, lacking. I think that my coworkers are similar to those one would find in other similar places. There are those who care about their job and those who just want to draw a paycheck. Overall, though, most of them are personable and not difficult to work with. The hardest part of the job would be either the shift work or the considerable amount of heavy lifting that is required. The most enjoyable part probably the fact that even though some parts of the job are repetitive, every day brings new challenges."
good,"Empresa importante en el sector Petrolero, con un sistema de gerenciamiento y procesos de trabajo bien definidos, sistema de calidad alto y prevencion y mantenimiento del medio ambiente, personal calificado y entrenado constantemente, aprendi bastante el manejo de mapas y procesos en los trabajos para que sean seguros y evitar perdidas de tiempo y horas laborales, a ser un lider en HSE para que nuestro puesto de trabajo sea seguro, la parte mas dificil era la cantidad de material recibido por falt de espacios, convivir con toda clase de estados de las peronas, lo que mas me gusto es el aprendizaje constante, la seguridad con que se trabaja, los procesos implementados"
good,"There is opportunity for advancement, the best benefits I have ever seen, 401k and employee stock purchase program. It is an excellent place to work if you can turn a blind eye to the immoral actions of the company overseas, i.e. Iraq"
good,Hallilburton is a wonderful company to work for however the oil and gas business is an unstable one and when it plateaus people that are very good at their jobs are let go.
good,Work in the yard and rig up in the boat for offshore job.
good,A typical day at work started with doing a morning count of the iron and the other parts and materials. I would check the lists of things needed to be accomplished today and start working on the one that i could accommodate the best. The management and co-workers were all great people workers and good members of the company. The best part of the job was having the variety of jobs in a day that i had the opportunity to perform.
good,in the seven years i worked for Halliburton they treated me well
good,"The company was a great company to work for, but I worked there for several years and the money was good, the downfall was the fact that I worked 180-200 hours bi-weekly so I didn't have any time for myself so I decided to find something different."
good,"Exigente e competitiva , treina seus funcionários de forma mais adequada possível ."
good,This is a job that changes by the second. You’ll learn oilfield SOP and how to implement it as you develop. They will also teach in detail the dangers of the oilfield and how to deal with them.
good,Halliburton was good from the start with hiring me with no experience or cdl but they had good motivated trainers and paid to receive a cdl and advancement depending on your motivation
good,"The people there are great to work with, Benefits are really nice to include being able to purchase stock in the company. Insurance through Blue cross and Blue Shield is nice."
good,"Loved working for this company. Would've stayed a lot longer and made a career out of it, if it weren't for the layoffs. I myself was no laid off but had a gut feeling and heard rumors of it, therefor I took it upon myself to leave."
good,I’ve worked for this company for 13 years. Allowed me to travel all over the states and learn a lot about how the oil field operates. The benefits are awesome and affordable as well.
good,"Uma empresa boa para trabalhar principalmente para iniciante, devido o fácil acesso ao conhecimento sobre os equipamentos através dos fucionários."
good,"Good place to work, 84hrs a week, so 44 hrs of overtime, 2 weeks on 1 week off schedule-was kind of hard to get used to at first, then turned out..i liked it..not so much for my girlfriend though"
good,The only problem I had working for Halliburton was their high turn over rate. When oil prices drop they're the first to start laying people off. Other than that they have an excellent safety culture.
good,This was a great company to work for.  I learned so much while working at Halliburton and also contributed a great deal. I was given great respect there as I was chosen to stay with the company when the last downturn occurred about 8 years ago.
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo  y compañerismo en todo sentido.
good,Excelente na gestão de segurança e qualidade. Vale a pela adquirir conhecimento.
good,Good company with lots of opportunities to progress. International opportunities and travel also available.  Good strong company and very fair.  Maybe not the biggest payers but maybe offer more job security than bigger payers.
good,"At the time I was there the environment  was relaxed with opportunities to work at you pace or work from home if required. "
good,"Only thing bad about this company is when the oil field slows down, the pink slips are handed out and layoffs are implemented. Not a good thing if you’ve relocated to fulfill a position"
good,Learned a lot on keeping equipment running in field to keep job moving forward. management was good friendly and helpful. Fun environment to work in. Being away from home so much. The money
good,"A great place to work. Quiet environment and great employees. "
good,Very relaxed place to work. Easy work environment. Very safe place to work. Lots of good people. Management can't make their minds up most of the time.
good,Good place to work. Just slow on the pay raise and a little low on the pay per hour for that type of work. Lot of red tape to go through to get a promotion.
good,"I have been able to gain multiple skills during my tenure with Halliburton. I got opportunities to contribute in leadership roles, project management and product management."
good,Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar.Oportunidade de crescimento.
good,"I am working for Halliburton for almost 13 years now.  Halliburton has been my first and only Oil & Gas Company. The work culture in Halliburton is very healthy with everyone working as team. However, culture may differ a bit slightly with reference to the locations. But overall good. Salaries may not be very healthy as compared to other Oil & Gas companies but I did felt like my job was secured mostly. Even during downturn I was given options to help me keep the job. It wasn't one of the most stable situation in the market anyways."
good,Most  days are very busy. No lack of something to do. Just the nature of the business. Management has good people. The physical office is an open office concept that is great for sharing ideas or working on problems with several people. Not so good if you need to have a private conversation.
good,I never seen a person of color in management. And im no golden child so i knew my days were numbered...they ppl that i work with were good though.....
good,good benefits. most of the day went by fast always busy. the co workers were very helpful. i wanted to move up in my field of studies that is why i began to look for something different.
good,"Pipeline process services Sep."
good,"Busy most days out of the whole month. I leaned how to operate a crane, clean bits, and the bits are made. The management it's great they do the most to help you out. The hardest part is breaking out bigger bits and most enjoyable is the people you get to talk to."
good,Awesome work environment with friendly colleagues that constantly seek to better themselves. I'll recommend Halliburton to anyone that's willing to grow.
good,"A steady, pragmatic company and honest to a fault. The culture is skewed to the fluids and production enhancement (frac) side of the business, which diminishes its power to tackle Big Blue - who is more focused on higher technology formation evaluation services. A venerable, potent company, nevertheless. They still reward loyalty."
good,"With a 15 day on and 6 day off schedule, it was actually quite nice to have on most times. Lots of field work however, and very little time in between shifts to get everything done. Great people though."
good,Competitive company to work for with great people.  Management over the years has been very good to work with.  The market has been up and down and there has been a struggle managing that but overall I would recommend working for them.
good,Definitely a company you can advance within. Some rolls carry more responsibility and stress than others. Rather difficult to move from one PSL to another.
good,Halliburton was a fun place to work.  They treated us all very good. The trucks given to us were very nice and we were given the ability to maintain them on their dime.
good,I loved working at Halliburton! It was fun and a lot of growth opportunities! Management was experienced and helpful. I would recommend working for Halliburton.
good,"Great company to work for. There is career advancement, training and development and great leadership all the way around. The only down fall is the stability due to the market. This is to be expected working in the oil and gas industry."
good,"buenas relaciones de trabajo, se aplican todas las normas de seguridad para preservar la integridad de las personas"
good,"very busy, working in Egypt"
good,"I worked for this company for a few years as a field associate in the cementing service line. "

good,The people are what make it great. People are the reason Halliburton. Does well. They have a spirit of excellence. There are no complaints from me. The pay could be a bit better.
good,"Great company to work for, with GREAT benefits and fair pay. the only complaint would be that the oilfield is very up and down and hours fluctuate during different quarters of the year."
good,"Good work environment. I've been here for 6 months, hours were cut 3 months in. other than that its a good experience and theres always something to do. theres always options for transfer if your not happy."
good,It was very fast paced and had plenty of thing to keep you busy during the day or night which you worked. They have some of the best benefits in the business
good,I rate Halliburtion a 7 on a scale of 1-10 for the fairness of pay and the opportunity for a temporary to hire position.  I feel this company play an integral role in making sure work life balance is adjusted to suit most individuals.
good,I started work as an internee and I want to gain some practical knowledge of my educational degree which I did in 2013 and I did not get any stipend/salary.
good,"Performs other duties as assigned by direct mud engineer."
good,The company believes in Culture diversity. Good working environment and they focus on safety. I have learned a lot working for this company. Management also very understanding with work and life expectancies.
good,Halliburton was my first job in the pumping service world. They gave me all the training and safety courses I could handle. Very good opportunities to advance in your career as well.
good,good job if you can handle long hours. it is a good enviroment to learn many aspects of the oil and gas field. you need to be committed to a way of life not just a job.
good,Good Company. Good Pay - Cycle business causes lay offs. Feast/ Famine industry. Could do more on team building events and employee recognition.  Should improve 401 matching
good,"Good place to work at if you aren’t trying to be at home and have a family. Good people and good paying job. Awesome benefits, but the biggest con was being out of town so much."
good,"Have an excellent system of logistics for their brand name products.  Excellent warehouse management of sack product and OBM mud plant.  Not many generic products used for their drilling programs.  Since the products have branded names and also have MSDS sheets that explain what each product does.  Tech professionals will coach you over everything you need to know each product, formations, and safety protocols for each product as well."
good,"Excelente CIA, buen ambiente de trabajo y cultura laboral, políticas, normas y estándares bien definidos."
good,I had a good working relationship with my bosses and coworkers. We did work together as a team. My truck was definitely maintained. If I had a problem there were clear management channels to follow and plentiful hours. I just could not follow them to Ohio when they closed down the local yard here.
good,"Great job. Its a nice place to work at.I have learned much from Halliburton.Inventory control, Procurement, and Logistics are areas i was not familiar with before coming to Halliburton. Co-workers are the heart of Halliburton. they have fantastic people there who share knowledge and are willing to help other out,"
good,"Control measures are set up for end result delivery. Right from the start of the job, everything goes through a transparent channel and monitored."
good,I enjoyed my time with Halliburton. The pay was very nice and the people were even better. The time off and benefits offered were hard to beat. I would definitely go back to work for this company.

Activities include but are not limited to risk identification and management, incident and investigation, waste minimization, pollution prevention and control, various compliance activities and implementation of various aspects of management systems in all areas of HSE"
good,Halliburton is a big company with lots of moving parts.  Not all are moving in the same direction at the same time but overall the company has been able to grow in a down market.
good,"This was a experience that any individual should have to go through."
good,"Very challenging environment and never a dull moment.   I was always busy finding the day fly by.  The management was like the weather in Oklahoma...if you don't like it, just wait.  Always changing."
good,Gostei muito de fazer parte de quadro de funcionários da Halliburton. Excelente companhia.
good,Hired on through contract. Worked with a nice group of people. Took some time to get account setup for access to the network. IT issues seemed to take a while to resolve. Nice cafeteria.
good,"I could not say enough positive things during my 4 years with this company. I was paid well, had a predictable schedule with adequate time for personal pursuits despite working over 3000 hours per year. Although the shifts may not be for everyone, there are normal shift in other departments. The company generously provided virtually everything needed to perform my job, including tools, materials, training, safety-equipment, uniforms, laundering service and almost anything else along the way. The only thing I would improve is more specialized training for specialized job that would improve time efficiency. They do provide a platform to research and collaborate if needed but this is not usually adequate for their expectations."
good,"The company offers good opportunity for career development and continuous learning. Supportive upper management, process oriented and a dynamic workforce."
good,"Last I worked there we were on a 10/5 day schedule (10 days on call, 5 days off). Traveled a lot and spent most of my time on living out of a pickup but learned a lot about working with others and enjoyed the job with good people."

good,"Trabajo exigente por el tipo de guardias en el cual aprendi a trabajar en equipo, quizas la parte mas dura era el horario de noche/madrugada."
good,"Every day is a challenge, we never stick to a set planning, always prioritize work depending on management and operational needs."
good,"This company provides you an opportunity to learn and advance in any number of oilfield services. If you are willing to travel and relocate, your options open up even more.

good,"I worked in Cement department, it's a easy job but it has it's downs. I'm not sure if it's just our terminal, but we are on call 24/7 for 6 days. There's been moments were you don't work for one whole day, just because there is no work that day. Other times is busy, but like i said things change. This on call is horrible i think, your not really sure what time they will call you to go work, also some jobs mainily workover rigs are done pretty fast. If you catch a driling job it's pretty easy rigging up, and rigging down, but it's also boring depedning on what your job duty is. As far as hours there is times where most times once done with a job most drivers will take a 10hour reset on there DOT hours so we would sleep in the truck. Th e only good thing is you are getting paid to be sleeping in the truck for 10 hours. This also has it's downs such as once a job is done and you do your reset they will most likely send you to another job meaning you will not be going home you can be gone for more then 40 hours, It has happened to me before I honestly hated it, but other guys loved it. Also forgot to menttion about the shifts, we are on call 24/7 for the six days sounds good right? But it's not why?, well lets say you are schedule  to work MON,TUES, WEND, THUR, FRI, SAT, you are not working sunday so you are not getting paid then it gets worse. You will have SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, off so then you will only have WEND, THURS, FRI, SAT, SUN, then the pay period ends sunday. One more example You will work MONDAY, then have TUES, WENDS, THURSDAY off so that only leaves you with 3 days"

El manejo de estrés es diario, y hay que acostumbrarse a que el ritmo de trabajo no puede disminuir y no te espera. Día a día trabajas con presión, y adrenalina, lo cual vuelve emocionantes los días. Es una empresa bien estructurada, con una cadena de mando bien definida, y un aprendizaje constante. Lo más complejo se puede decir que es el desgaste físico y emocional, ya que puedes llegar a trabajar hasta 40 o 50 días seguidos, y recibir 5 o 6 días de descanso por ese periodo prolongado.

I worked with crew member from around the world, not just Saudi Arabia.

I worked on the Frac/Acid side working with Coil Tubing pumping all types of jobs from hydro jets, clean-outs, pulgs, matrix acidizing etc. I supervised the pumping side of operations, riging in-out, batch mixing tanks with different fluid systems, completing daily reports and communicating with Aramco Consultant on location. Management was very helpful getting started in Saudi Arabia and mentoring me on the way things are different in this country. It was a great experience I carry, the scenary and culture of another part of the world. It's almost like taking a vacation, but having to work while you are there. I can't really say there was anything hard about the job over in Saudi. When going overseas to do a job a person has to remember one thing. You are there to work and work only.

Everyday is a learning process because drilling conditions are not the same in every hole. "
good,The management job role has tought me alot.  Not only about people but buisness in general.  Managing is a ballancing act of people and buisness.  Using your resources to handle the demanded work load for the highest profit margin can be challanging.  I think this was the best part about this position.  I seemed to excell at it.  I find satisifaction in seeing the difference decisions I make effect our success.

E todo trabalho que realizo sempre estou aprendendo, tanto com minhas tarefas como tambem as dos outros que estão proximo realizando outras tarefas. Sou bem relacionado com os colegas de trabalho, pois gosto de ajudar e ensinar. O que acho mais dificil do trabalho é quando o equipamento tem alguma falha no momento da operação e a mais agradável é quando concluo o serviço com sucesso. Aos meus superiores só tenho a falar que os mesmos tem que valorizar mais a força de trabalho, pois é ela que gera lucro e beneficios pra EMPRESA."

I gained more knowledge each day learning how to drive the trucks better and working with rig hands helping them rig up and rig down equipment the correct safe way. Most of my co-workers were very much easy to work with. We all got along very well with each other and had a on the job friendship. The hardest part was the lack of sleep that came with the job, but we were all informed during the interviews of the hardships of the job.

Such as the new experiences and the feeling of being proud of a job well done along side with good fellow co-workers."

good,Typical day started with using various resources to make sure operations was running efficiently. Management was always there to lend a helping hand and encouragement.
good,"Good company, my group i work with, we're a family.  There are bad roads out here, from driving at night with no lights, roads that are paved and some or not, sometimes its  very stressful, trying to find frac sites in the middle of nowhere with out lights."
good,Good place to start building a career in oil and gas industry. Pay is good but competition is offering more with more job security. Benefits are unbeatable. Field work is highly recommended for better pay if family can handle it. You may be moved up pretty fast which is good but will be held accountable for everything. You will be working with a lot of different people so some individuals might be difficult to work with.
good,"I liked working there, guys were good to work with, understanding, & it was very safe, had meetings once a week, management was great, was starting to learn lots of things there, but unfortunately got layed off,"
good,"Good benfits,good job for retirement able to glow in company good place to work if you looking for advancement in the company if yu looking for a good place to work"
good,"Liked the 8 days on and the 6 days off rotation. First job with extra time off for family. The hands-on type of training was not very efficient, this left the field techs without the proper training and knowledge required. The two man team approach working 12 hours and supporting each other was teamwork in motion."
good,There is a good safety culture at Halliburton along with a good management team. I have no bad things say about the company I worked for them for over 12 years.
good,I had a great experience at Halliburton. Learned a lot and cross trained and was promoted 3 times during the times I was there. The pay could use a bit of adjustment
good,"The day at work would start with a tool box meeting where employees would express thier views about work conditions and safety observations. In the same time, the management would have the opportunity to promote the company policies. The rest of the day will be fulfilled with the work activities and some exchanges of ideas around ongoing duties, as well as regular breaks to allow workers to refresh themselves."
good,After being hired within 1 week they gave me the warehouse manager position because they felt i had great work ethic and was very supportive in my handling off all duties including procurement and dispatching of drivers. wish they never left Estevan i might still be employed by them.

good,Stressful day to day duties
good,"I enjoyed working here and grew exponentially both personally and professionally. There was a good working relationship with others and other departments throughout the organization. We also established  monthly ""spot light"" events to help different companies under the corporate umbrella understand the part each serves within the company, and the services each offers to clients."
good,"Overall working at Halliburton was a great experience, working with hard working people who work well with others and  where they stress  safety first"

good,Service companies are always solving the customers problems in a very competitive environment making the workplace a fast paced place always and developing solutions on the go to finish every job
good,5 years as Senior MLWD. Pretty hands on as MLWD & on the job training. Benefits & work life balance was good. Plenty of overseas assignment opportunities when not busy locally.
good,"Good benefits package, if you work in the field and have no problems spending long periods of time away from home this can be the right place for you."
good,"it is a good place to work for men, room for advancement is also good, once you do your competencies, management locally is OK, overall good place, great benefits."
good,"A great experience for me, I acquired a lot of leadership and technical experience over a very short time; I was left by myself with company equipment worth millions of dollars, I was responsible for employees who had spent 30 years in the company, I sometimes had to go 36 hours without sleeping, It was lots of work, and lots of fun."
good,This was a fun job to work. It was fast paced and competitive. Great for anyone that is okay with not having job security due to the oil field being up and down all the time. The benefits are of the best quality not to mention stock programs and 401K.
good,Spent 21 years working there. Oil & Gas has it's ups and downs. I was able to make it that long by proving to management my versatility and willingness to do whatever it took. Unfortunately the large recession of 2016 cost me my job!
good,"During my experience in Dubai, I worked in a multi cultural, fast paced, high pressure environment to meet deadlines. Working for Halliburton I was handling vendors located in the Middle East and Africa.Some of the challenges I had was dealing with different cultural backgrounds and explaining Halliburton's process so vendors would comply with procedures."
good,Good learning experience good people to work around. Great benefits great work environment but the only bad thing was you never knew when a layoff was going to happen
good,One of the best times of my life was spent in Halliburton surrounded with loveable people and very supportive management staff.  Was given the opportunity to rise from the ranks starting as technician to becoming a supervisor taking charge of the electronics repairs and  maintenance work of Halliburton equipment throughout the Middle East and the Caspian.  It was always a challenge but it was somehow fulfilling to complete tasks that aren't resolved for the longest time.  What was nice was that you are given a free hand to handle operations and do your thing for the achievement of the common good.
good,Offshore drilling is a complicated process and Halliburton is one of the larger players. I received excellent training and always felt someone had my back.
good,"Working for one of the largest energy service providers in the largest shale area in the world (Permian Basin) was a daunting idea when I first started, but my coworkers did an amazing job making it feel like a much smaller company.  I received tons of support from management when needed, which made me trust their decisions.  I really enjoy going to work every day."
good,"Working with top technology equipment "
good,"Early to work to meet the great staff. Worked in the shop loading and unloading wire line trucks to be taken out of town for jobs. Doing PM work on truck, trailers, and wire line units."
good,"I would like to thank Halliburton for experience and knowledge it gave to me and I do appreciate all people whom I worked with. "

good,"I really enjoyed the my time at Halliburton.  It was a very interesting and well structured place to work.  The workplace culture was very relaxed with a large focus on teamwork, health and safety and Lean 6 Sigma.  The management were always approachable, transparent about workloads and what is expected from employees.  I learned a lot about what it is to work in a cell and the pressures of working to monthly targets in what is the high pressure of the oil industry."
good,"There is plenty of advancement in the job, Job security is decent, Work/Life balance... what can I say? It's an oilfield company. Management is great, they teach you things you need to know for the field."
good,"Pude aprender mucho acerca de esta industria en la elaboración del proyecto, las personas que me ayudaron con  esto fueron muy atentas y agradezco la atención que brindaron a este aprendiz"

good,Job was good. Oil field industry was goin under due to the oil prices. Say layoffs coming so I tried to move on to a better environment.
good,"En un día típico programar mis actividades para los dias siguiente."
good,Halliburton strives to stay on the technical edge of the Oil and Gas Service Industry.  I worked with some fantastic people who are the best at fracture mechanics and microseismic mapping.  I learned to interact effectively with their customers and was in the process of learning about other product lines when the industry downturn occurred.
good,Can be very busy but management makes the environment fun and make you want to work hard because they are not micro managers. The hardest part is the end of the month because it is an extremely busy day and we have to meet me our monthly financial goal.
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday. The environment was great and the people are wonderful. A typical day for me was processing invoices for payment, reconciling accounts, distributing mail, and responding to endless emails. I loved it!"

good,"I sorted and delivered mail. Sorted interoffice and regular mail by department. Distributed overnight mail.Handled OHL, FedEx and UPS shipping."

good,"i started my s=career with  halliburton in JAN-2014,"
good,"- Приятная атмосфера"
good,"A typical day at work, Slickline operation in the well, working with braided line (fishing)  or standard operations, R.I.H standard flow control devices or retrieval "
good,"A typical day at work, is every morning attend the customers meetings, delivery the services tickets, preparing the workshops for different opportunities for new customers and customer that we have."
good,"A typical day at Halliburton was always demanding, fast paced and at the end of the day rewarding and accomplished.  One major thing learned from the Oil Industry is the VOC (voice of customer) and what it means to support operations in a demanding market.  Supporting the field was manufacturing's number one goal, keeping CRK (customer request kept) above 95%.  "
good,"Although Halliburton was very good to me over the 4 years I worked within their corporate structure, as soon as the market turned south many of the things that made them great began to slowly disappear."
good,"I made programs to make roller cone drill bits and fix cutter drill bits. I did the API threading programs for all bit sizes. "
good,"Halliburton is one of the top companies to work for."
good,"Halliburton is a good company to work for, depending on the Product Line you work with.  Most are good.  The people are good to work with and the culture is very supportive."
good,Oil prices rise and fall which creates job opportunities but also takes them away. The company itself is great to work for but I do not recommend the oil industry for job security reasons.
good,"exigentes, buena capacitacion, buena administracion y apoyo al trabajador, excelentes colegas, falta de descanso en algunos momentos, buena cultura laboral."
good,this job had very high expectations that made you learn fast and be a better person. while everyday was changing and something new to learn you could be productive and continue to learn.
good,"Rather unique position due to the nature of the drilling industry, involving being on-call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Because I have a company phone and computer it is not always completely necessary to be in the office. My direct management is great and very supportive, but because there are several  product service lines within the company, management above that is not as involved. The hardest part of the job is being on call at all times, often dealing with issues on rigs in the middle of the night. The most enjoyable part of the job is exceeding the customers' expectations, particularly in high-profile jobs involving more advanced tools than we usually run."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Halliburton, but unfortunately, with the down turn in the industry, I was made redundant. I did not want to leave and would have been happy working anywhere globally for them."
good,"This was also a great job to have with the company.  The only thing that I didn't like about this job was it was market based.  If you were caught up you will leave early or just stay home, which will cut into your hours."
good,"El ambiente es agradable, los tecnicos con los que trabaje, fueron buenos compañeros."
good,"Every day is work hard because in a team group so need people to work together. "
good,Halliburton is a place where you can learn a lot its all up to you and if your motivated.I started out at the bottom but now i'am a Foreman I let my work speak for its self I'am a born leader.But im looking for next chapter in my life I stay motivated to do great things.
good,"El trabajo como asistente de operador es físicamente muy agotador pero se aprende bastante, aprendí algunas operaciones en pozos de gas y ésto me motivó a estudiar la carrera de Ingeniero petrolero, el trato con los compañeros de trabajo es de respeto, también aprende uno a trabajar en una cultura de seguridad en el trabajo, de tal manera que todos nos ponemos la camiseta, la seguridad se toma con seriedad; todas la mañanas el gerente de la base realiza una junta de seguridad para abordar pequeños detalles que se pueden convertir en un gran problema, también enriquece al personal con algún tema de salud."
good,"Sou técnico de instrumentação, já trabalhei paralelo com alguns "
good,"Awesome place to work, good people and a good job. Work isn't terrible as long as your'e in shape. Good pay and good hours."
good,I loved working for Halliburton the only reason I don't anymore is because I don't like working for big companies and I went back to work at my previous employer in wireline.
good,"Very good work culture with a nice balance that enables ethically sound relationship building."
good,"Good career advancement, good start for a fresh graduate. Good opportunity given to learn further and had good team members to work with. International team with good understanding and excellent working culture."

good,"you will get a minimum for 40 hours a week, only slow a few months a year. you can work up to or over 120 hours a week. good place to work for a single Person"
good,"MWD is a field position, work is typically 12 hours on and 12 hours off in some cases its around the clock.  the objective is to get the job done no matter the shift the day of week or weather conditions.  working around the clock to meet a deadline on Christmas day 6 hours away from home is not uncommon.  its challenging but very rewarding, unlike most jobs, when you are off you are off all day for many days to spend with family and friends or for travel."
good,Daily driving and answering phone calls. Planning ahead for your rigs would make my job a lot easier. The company vehicle and gas card made life easier.
good,"My typical day at work would be pumping down hole with chemicals using different pieces of heavy machinery. I have learned how important it is to work safe and also work in groups. I enjoy my co-workers because they make my job easier by working together and also helping me with any knowledge they may have on the job. The hardest part is adjusting to different climate of weather because if it's hot your hot and if it's cold then your cold. The most enjoyable part is learning something new everyday, just when you think you know it all you don't."
good,A empresa oferece excelentes benefícios e grandes oportunidades de crescimento.
good,"I have worked for 3 different Majors. Halliburton treated me the best,"
good,"I had a good 10 year run at Halliburton.  In the 10 years I was there, I progressed from a field engineer to a position in Baroid's global technology division.  This was accomplished by putting forth the effort to learn new technologies and concepts that others were not willing to learn.  This is fine, Halliburton needs good field hands.  But, Halliburton is good at recognizing personal initiative, and rewarding those whose possess it."
good,"Overall this is a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of working for Halliburton is the workers. They make it worth going to work everyday and there is always a different challenge everyday which keeps the job fresh. The hardest part of the job is dealing with young people in management positions that have no idea how to manage grown men and women. Also, the super early morning shifts take a while to get used to. However, this is a great place to learn and grow professionally."
good,"loved working here. nothing bad to say really. was laid off due to oil industry is slow at the moment."
good,"A empresa tem a cultura de valorização de seus colaboradores, mas em troca cobra muito do desenvolvimento e competência dos mesmos, o que é motivador para pessoas que tem um perfil dinâmico e desafiador. Como há diferentes ramos dentro da empresa, o ramo que trabalhei era bem tranquilo, como dias e horas definidas de trabalho, podendo aproveitar mais da família e amigos. Isso permite com o que o funcionário tenha um equílibrio entre o stress proveniente do trabalho e o lazer proporcionado por essas horas vagas."
good,"- Different Multi-tasks every day, no room for boring environment;"
good,"Juntas CERO cada fin de semana, esto con el fin de disminuir los accidentes dentro de la empresa."

good,"A Halliburton é uma excelente empresa que atua no ramo de Petroleo e gas Natural. Mais nos ultimos anos seu desempenho com a comodidade da vida humana fortalece a agregação de maus profissionais, a empresa tem uma riquissimo campo de trabalho e campo de comunicação onde dar aos seus funcionários maiores recursos para melhor elaboração dos seus funcionários, mas uma grande controversa seria pessoal em relação de conflitos dentro da companhia não existe uma excelência e como deveria ser descrita ao seu codigo de conduta bem elaborado."

good,"If you are into rigorous work, this is the job for you. Most job tasks require you to be outside in the elements at all times and the work is repetitive. Working 12 or more hours for 14 days and returning home for a week. The hardest part is rigging down in the rain or winter weather to rig up at another well site. The most enjoyable part of the job is the time off."
good,It was a good company to work for. Great benefits along with a potential to make good money. Long hours and you would be away from your family quite a bit.
good,I would have loved to stay in the oilfield if it was more reliable. The just laid off 650 employees in another location. I needed better job security for my family.
good,Job was great however they they would make you work at the warehouse to do roustabout work without getting the daily bonus or per firm. They were also not ever flexible with work

good,I loved my Job a typical day would consist of 16-18 hrs' we worked between 110-120 hrs. per week we were on a 14 day On 7 day's Off schedule the only problem is there were too many Lazy and Filthy people. Many of the Supervisor's were book smart but lacked Leadership Qualities- No Accountability. Safety Procedures Highly Promoted but were Not Enforced. Management has No clue of what goes on in the Field. The more money we would make for the company the more they would take from the employee's. Didn't make any sense at All.

good,Halliburton is where I learned A lot about oil and gas. A company that takes care of their employees. Very demanding in the oilfield. Some work days required more than average

I start at the yard, download my job in hand, hold safety with all personnel going out on job, check that all paperwork is properly filled out and ready to go .I have learned a lot, I started out as a worm and moved my way to a service supervisor. My co-workers changed everyday which was always a challenge, the hardest part about my job was seeing the oil and gas industry shrink to about nothing and seeing my hard working co-workers loose there jobs. The best thing was teaching new hires how to do the job the right and safe way. Seeing people move up in the company."
good,"Good Company, however, not much potential for advancement. You have to get with this company and ride your time out until someone retires.  It can cause good people to leave."

The pay was great. Loved the fact they provided housing, the ""Man Camp"" so i didn't have to relocate. The 2 weeks on, 1 week off schedule was great.

Outro problema era a dificuldade de se conseguir uma promoção."
good,"A halliburton é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar mas só trabalha nela quem gosta da área pois é um trabalho muito árduo, sem previsões de folga e quando em folga estar preparado para receber ligação e pronto para o trabalho caso apareça, ficar dias acordados e em campo, ser companheiro pois é um trabalho dificil e por isso é importante ajudar o seu colega  de trabalho e estar preparado para as imprevisibilidades porque nada é previsível. A parte mais dificil era acordar de madrugada e trabalhar na chuva e a melhor parte eram os amigos no trabalho, dirigir veículos, operar munck, conseguir operar uma unidade e depois de todo o trabalho voce pensar ""caramba como foi dificil mas conseguimos""."

good,"Trabalhar na Haliiburton foi um privilégio de valor inestimável pela, organização, qualidade, treinamento e foco no que diz respeito a qualidade e segurança. Todo o conhecimento prático que hoje eu disponho eu devo a esta grande empresa. Tive a oportunidade de ser treinado e trabalhar com supervisores e até mesmo com a gerencia que basicamente sempre se dispôs  a nos ensinar além dos investimentos que normalmente fazem a todos os seus funcionários. A parte mais difícil do trabalho basicamente era ter que interromper alguma atividade, por não ter recursos em algumas oportunidades não eram frequentes mais o fato de as vezes não poder resolver de imediato de certo ponto me deixava um pouco frustrado, já a parte mais agradável era a excelência operacional que tanto os clientes bem como nossos supervisores/gerentes  mesmos na maioria das vezes nos elogiavam pelos índices satisfatórios das nossas atividades tanto on-shore como off-shore."

good,"Empresa munida de funcionários capacitados, responsáveis, eficientes."
good,"The work day at Halliburton is always challenging. It requires professionals innovatives and creatives to overcome the adversities of the market. The management system is very dynamic, but with the big unbalanced occurred by the fall of the barrel price, too much knowledge and experience have been lost and the course to be followed will depend on the managerial maturity in recomposing the gaps left and prepare the new hires. In my particular opinion, Halliburton is a exciting place to learn and to grow, again, I am suspicious in this matter, because I started as a teenager there and I dedicated 29 years of my life to that business."

good,"A typical work day you are up early and home late.  You learn something new everyday, management is there for you ,  coworkers become family.  Hardest part of the job is being away from family and home."
good,I started off at Halliburton Energy Services just looking to pay off my student loans and had planned on finding a new job in a year or year and half tops. Little did I know I would start one of the most changeling and rewarding careers I have had to date. Not only did I find working with Energy customers extremely rewarding but learning the aspects of the Frac/Acid product service line was extremely intricate and more technical then I originally thought.  I enjoyed every moment of working for this company and it was a difficult but necessary decision to end my career after four years.
good,Plenty of opportunity for growth and challenges. Challenging during times of industry downturn. Enjoyed the opportunities to work with operations personnel to determine customer requirements and develop solutions for new equipment.

good,"Worked long hours and always had something to do. I learned that if the pump was not fixed when needed things could go very wrong, and not have the company work to the best. Higher management was great but once it was to the lower shop leads the management was not so great. Everyone I worked for was great."
good,"good people,too much homelife missed.Pay is very good and benefits are top notch,.advancement potential is your choice."
good,I appreciate the time I was with Halliburton Energy Services. Unfortunately I was laid off during the recent energy sector downturn.
good,"Halliburton has long hours when the oil field is busy.  When a slow down occurs, the hours become more reasonable; however that is when employee's are susceptible to lay offs and transfers.  Halliburton spends a lot of time to ensure the safety of their crews.  They are also concerned with service quality and maintaining their customer base, so they have a lot of programs available to ensure their personnel are properly trained."
good,This job worked on-site the oil platforms and closely with the oil-rig staff. Required the ability to work in all weather conditions at all times of the day. A regular work schedule for myself was 21 days on 3 days off. This position was equalized by the generous salary/benefits Halliburton offered.
good,"A typical day at work, I daily morning safety meeting with a crew of 20 men discussing safety topics or changed HMS policies and daily task for the day. Also inventory of material items needed for our job daily time entry for employees"
good,"Great experience and great memories while employed with Halliburton, saw many places and met a lot of good people. Hardest part of job was being away from family and kids for extended periods of time. Halliburton took care of its employs. I had great benefits and insurance. When the price of oil declined Halliburton had no choice but to let me go. A typical day at work would be showing up to location, attending safety meetings and discussing daily job details. I was a Service Specialist  (TOOL HAND) I dealt with the company man and wire-line engineer on a 1 on 1 basis and would give recommendations and suggestions related to on-going operations while running my tools down hole."
good,"I enjoyed working for Halliburton. They provide a great support system for you to reference. They require on going training to help further your career there. I have no complaints to mention. I worked two weeks on, and I was off two weeks per month. I would drive roughly 4.5 hours to work every two weeks. A typical day at work for me would be getting up at 4:30 am to attend a safety meeting and discuss the business for that day. I controlled the drilling fluid used on the oil rig. I would check the fluid twice a day then provide a treatment sheet to the rig crew to maintain it. I would email a report each morning which included my fluid test from the previous day and the charges for the products I used to maintain the drilling fluid. I would also describe what was done that day and what to expect the following day in my report. Management was good, they allowed me to do my work. If they needed anything I was contacted. Most of the information they required was in my daily reports. I worked on an oil rig but because I was the only one in charge of the drilling fluid; I mostly work alone. I meet with the rig crew daily to stay abreast at what was happening The hardest part of my job was leaving home for extended periods of time. Being away from home is an adjustment. The most enjoyable part of my job was me being able to due my work without interference. A service coordinator stopped by each week to discuss what was going on and what I needed. We conducted the company's business and continued working."
good,"No two days were ever the same even though my duties were routine. I learned to multi-task and the ability to stop a project to handle another problem and be able to come back to that project where I left off. I would start my day with entering payroll, move on to reviewing expense reports, would usually get interrupted with phone calls or employees that would walk in with questions about there pay, expenses, or vehicles. Employees at Halliburton work as a team and are always ready to help each other to get work done. The hardest part of my job was also the most enjoyable part of my job, giving support to the field employees. This made every day different which keeps the job interesting."
good,"Working as a MWD engineer was very rewarding, due to the fact that it is the oil field, the schedule was difficult and long, not very easy to schedule anything personal.  The people were great to work with and helpful in the training process."

good,"The work is hard and is a long hours, on land had to stay up 30 hours multiple times, offshore had to stay up 54 hours, and get little sleep at both. The people you work with make it all worth while because they help each other on the crew. Halliburton is mostly about the company and not your life style, what I mean by this is that you hardly have a life while working for this company. The money is good but running and maintaining the multi million dollar equipment makes the job a little better. As with any other job as long as you work and don't hide you can improve your position and move up in the company."

My partner and I would take the bit out of the kiln and we would begin to repair the drill bit by welding in new cutter for the blades, by removing broken cutters and adjusting slightly damaged cutter. On a normal day we would repair eight bits. The hardest part would be working in that amount of heat while we repaired the bit. But the ability to see that the bit was completely repaired was satisfying."

The toughest days at work are always when the team does not get a goal together for a working day less difficult experience has told me that we should always have a plan of work.

good,"Working as a mud engineer was fun and adventurous. A typical day of work was to keep the Oil Base Mud up to spec while drilling, keep an eye on the shakers, maintain the centrifuge and test the Oil base mud at the end of my shift. You then, write reports for the company man to let him know that everything is up to par. During this process, I learned to keep up with inventory, maintain work processes and time management. Management was good. They were very helpful in any type of struggles that I had encountered. My co-workers were excellent. It was family! Anytime I had an issue all I had to do was call a co-worker and they would do anything they could to help.
