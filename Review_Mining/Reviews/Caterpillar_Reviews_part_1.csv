rating,review
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Management is focused on all of the wrong things.  They were far more skilled at finding a local bar or restaurant than providing clear direction and support to all employees.
bad,Mgmt. Doesn't appreciate employees and is very unprofessional only criticize employees in rev ups. The company is good just not ran good or professional
bad,Not good experience at all.  It’s never enough no matter how hard you work.  Bad management and they don’t care to even fix the problem.  They treat people very poorly and unfair and if you complain no one cares.
bad,its a terrible place to work. terrible management but good supervisors. hours were terrible with no flexibility. all focus was on products and not employees.
bad,"They like to wait at the time clock and ask you to work over or wait until you are driving home and call you back to work over. For what they pay, no thank you. And the supervisors are all out to get you unless you are a brown noser then you would be alright"
bad,"It's really not the best place to work hi turn around rate good pay but that about it. Operates one or more machines to work metal pieces to desired specifications."
bad,You’re jut a number no matter how hard you work.  People are very nasty.  I was the best part picker they don’t care.  It’s like a mafia even the president of the company sucks
bad,"Made 10.50 a hour but did the same job as permanent employees that made 19.00 a hour. Poor management, no team work work starts at 6:00 am but you have to be at work ten minutes early"
bad,The worst of the worst place I have ever worked...Do not go in here with experience and education..They will feel threatened. You are better off going in and miss work and be lazy... They will convert you faster...They do not want you to come in knowing what you can do or do not work too hard..They do not want a hard worker. Drug users and people that do not have goals in their lives!!!
bad,Processed invoices using 3 different accounting systems. Company more interested in volume processing than customer service. Poor unqualified management structure. Very unhappy workplace. Helping customers understand the accounting processes. Getting positive feedback from customers.
bad,They suck and wish I never wasted my time with them. Don’t waste your time if you are of color because this company is very racist especially if your a temp.
bad,The only thing this company does well is screw its employees.. The people I worked with were awesome on the other hand. Stay far far far away from this company!!!
bad,"Good co-workers, good pay. Unfortunately, management is terrible and willing to drop people in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a company to retire at, look elsewhere. Very low morale at every turn. People working 12+ hour days to ""hopefully"" keep their jobs. Sad."
bad,"Caterpillar can be a good stepping stone however it is very fast paced and you will feel as though you are not being paid enough for the work that you do. This company is constantly understaffed and you will most likely be doing work for two people. There are many uncertainties such as issues with parts you may not get a full 40 hours a week or you may have to work more than 12 hours a day and will not be informed by team leaders or section managers to what is going on, with little to know understanding when it comes to illness or personal life. Most days you will feel uninspired and worn down mentally and physically due to the work load."
bad,"If you like being in high school all over again, then Cat Financial is for you. Management plays favorites, does not promote within, and has  some of the poorest decision making ""skills"" I have ever witnessed. Typical day at work is very very routine so if you like boring cubicle office culture then look no further. The hardest part of the job is dealing with every terrible manager there, which is every single one of them. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving and hopefully never coming back."
bad,Better Jobs elsewhere.  Better jobs else where. Better jobs elsewhere. No future with this company  always looking to cut jobs. Better jobs elsewhere.
bad,"Caterpillar is a terrible company.  It is your typical EOE.  The pay isn't great.  Production orders are a toss up.  You are never given any notice of anything.  If you are a foreigner, minority, or are obese you will be treated better.  Close to none of their parts are American made.  Management is the worst part."
bad,"busy environment, people over worked and under paid.  management does not respect or recognize great work.  Interview is not a real reflect of work environment.  Focus should be on developing people and training them to move up if desired is there"
bad,"The union that supports Caterpillar, supports low productivity as well. So if a person is a go getter at the job, their co workers harasses them until the person breaks or quits the job.."
bad,"Waste of my time working for this company.If I nkown then what I know now,keep looking for a position you will enjoy going to.------------------------"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Management does not have a clue how to do anything. Yet they know every detail of how to do your job. The levels of incompetence are off of the charts for the management team.
bad,Cat is very poorly managed also dishonest and greedy cooperation. If you can find  another job I would recommend doing so.  At cat you are a Badge number  The human factor does  matter at cat
bad,Terrible they don’t care about employees at all pay was not sufficient for all you have to do. It was a lot of favoritism there some employees just got to walk around and play while you was told to do their jobs as well as yours. You could work 3 or 4 stations all day and when there is a gap they do t want to give you a chance to rest you have to move down the line to other stations the heads have no compassion for their employees
bad,As I was the only girl on the line the boys spoke to me what ever way they wanted they bullied me for months as they were full time and I was a temp the managers did nothing about it and only got worse . I tried to report it and know one wanted to know . There was a lot off favouritism with the team leaders people doing what they wanted and getting away with it .
bad,"Boring, no room for advancement, no gain sharing, no motivation, no incentives, horrible benefits, horrible management, lack of trustworthy co-workers, lots of hours with nothing to show for it."
bad,This place is an absolute joke! Even when you do your job the management will find something to complain about. Don't take care of it's present or past employees either
bad,empresa focada na seguranca e qualidade de vida do funcionario.
bad,All they do is hire people to get caught up then let you go it is sad place to work for cat used to be the high hog back in the day and the people who they pick to work full time are just plain but kissers
bad,You cannot advance without having a relative high up in the organization.  There were no promotions in Payroll in the 7 years I was there.  Zero direction from management.
bad,"I would never refer anyone to work at CAT in Athens, GA. The management is so unprofessional and very messy. There is no job security. Don't waste your time. They have a very high turnover rate. This company will fail if they don't make changes soon."
bad,This company will reject your qualifications and experience based on your race or nationality. Beware. Don’t apply here. You don’t wanna work with a bunch of racists.
bad,Unless you are a part of their click you will not advance! Very poor management and higher ups turn their heads!  Very unprofessional place to work!  Hostile work environment among co-workers!
bad,No room for advancement. You will get held back and be sent to hr and punished for things you did not do. They do not like to hire their temps on as permanent. You will be stuck making $13.76 an hour as a temp for as long as they see fit before allowing you to make the transition to a regular full time employee.
bad,"Do not work here, they do not care about there employees. They lay off like crazy and do not give a valid reason. I would never recommend this company"
bad,This Company will layoff at an instance and leave you searching for work in Peoria. In Peoria its hard to find work for Engineers other working at CAT. Terrible Management that does not have courage  to talk to you about job situation.
bad,"Employees are regarded as a libility not as an asset. Very difficult to advance or change positions or shifts, most never even get an interview after applying for a new opening although everyone is told they have great opportunity, mandatory overtime six days a week is expected with a very low pay increase annually, most get only a 2% raise!"
bad,"The management was untrained and did not know how to run their department. I paid doe insurance that was overpriced and of no use to me. I paid for insurance, but whwn I dound out I was pregnant was directed to go get medical card. I had no maternity leave paid and was treated poorly whwn I returned."
bad,"Great place for someone looking for a mechanical job, but if you think you are doing your average assembly job think again. They expect too much out of you. Pay is not enough for the amount of work you have to do. Many workers have been there for years and make about the same as someone just coming through the door. Along with wear and tear on your body. Tired all the time. They are more concerned with quantity than safety which they preach about. Only family and friends getting promoted."
bad,"Caterpillar treated Logistics like we weren't employees & I'm talking blatantly from management down to assembly employees. Worked 6 days a week for 2.5yrs w/ no raises or advancement. Build cost per unit dropped 30% after a year in production & site paid for within 2yrs and when I left after 3yrs I was making 12hr as a forklift operator. I had a disagreement during a shutdown about volunteering & I was escorted of the premises, told to surrender my access badge, told not to come on the property & HR would contact me. HR contacted me in a week & asked if I had been calling in, I said no I can't even come onto the property. I was fired for not calling in. High turnover / Revolving door for Logistics Employees. Whole Plant a Snitch / Backstabbing Atmosphere."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Collaborazione Scuola/Lavoro, poco entusiasmante, mi ha lasciato poco."
bad,"management fed a volatile enviroment,only the workers supported each other.  It was either do as they said or leave, not healthy for morale and this made it unsafe to work there."
bad,"A bad system was introduced to update there part picking practices and unrealistic numbers were given to its productivity, now more and more pressure is put upon new employees to produce better and better numbers from a broken system."
bad,"It is not the place to work. Its almost like an Cult...stay away. you will come back and thank me later. No life, Not paid for your troubles. Just stay away."
bad,I was an assembloer on the pathfinder line. i was hired three weeks after the first two.Sometimes we were scheduled 5a.m-3p.m. when 7a.m arrives there would be no parts to work with or no work or cleaning to be done. Not enough tablets to go around to trained on when the auditor point out what needs to be fixed.
bad,Loved it! Great company love my co worker. I would recommend this company to anyone that believe in working hard and enjoying great bonuses. The beat!
bad,not a good place to work.  was not good on safety! very poor management. more on production no concern for employees safety not good on training. very bad job culture
bad,"This company was the worst company I have ever worked for. Even down to the managers, if you were not a snitch then you were treated differently. I will never go back and work for them. Also drama filled company. If you had a blue shirt (temp) on and your against a black shirt (permanent) then your job was on the line. They will not listen to you, so basically if you bring anything to their attention then they look at you like drama and will get rid of you."
bad,"The management doesn't know what is going on, force you when they want, don't follow union rules. 3rd shift wasn't so bad until they decide to work 10 hr days 6 days a week with no notification. being a supplemental worker is horrible there you are treated poorly, no benefits as others but expected to work harder and longer. would not recommend anyone to work there unless desperate for a job."
bad,Working at caterpillar Global was great experience.Having hands on experience and good managerial skill. Career development programs help me a lot for better exposure.
bad,"the hr department at this location was by far the worst I have ever sen. the individual hired by ""friend"" or family"" and if you were not in the Click you were not welcome eventually but to late this facility closed for just the same reasons"
bad,"This is the poorest excuse for an employer in the World. Poor treatment of employees, and poor management ability to balance work load and skill levels of the employees."
bad,"Maintenance under ATS is very cut throat behind your back. They are never the same. One day everything is cool, then the next, it's something petty. Leadership attack you whenever they want to be picky, but try to stay within the lines of the rules. Then on other days, they don't want you to break after 5 hours of wirking. They preach professionalism, but these are little boys who throw the rock and hide their hands. Why even bother dealing with them at gatherings outside of work? They can't be trusted starting with the manager."
bad,"Stressful environment, 20 minutes lunch brake, no advancement, no vacation, no holiday pay, point system used for force labor, not allowed to go to emergency room when injured, cant dial 911 either or get fired if we do dial 911, not allowed to go to the restroom, parking is a problem, no respect for employees,and much more."
bad,fast paced and demanding at times not always but the management was the worst part about this job then the pay was not enough if you are trying to make it alone
bad,poor management let alot of employees get away with things they should of never got away with management favoring other employees. not always a safe invorment. over worked to death not enough time over they will over work you 7 days straight with no option to have a day off they will also work you 3 months straight no day off
bad,The company has no structure. They want temps to run everything and has no intent of highering on anybody. Hours change randomly and they will find a reason to terminate you
bad,this is not a good place management is not at all good and is only looking to fire you do not work here it is a bad idea you have no supporat and  the hours  sycj
bad,"I hate this place , I regret leaving my job for this company I got fired within the first six months , you can't call in or they fire you I think this company needs to be investigated ."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Management not so good to work for. To much buddy buddy  system with the guys. The say the can only give out so many excellent review.,and the guys all ways get capt out first. I was there 10 years did every thing the asked, showed up every day. bet the that did haft  the work as I did missed a lot of days got better raise. Less time on the job to."
bad,"I did not enjoy this postition. I was a member of the mechanical engineering department, formatting and reviewing Excel Spreadsheets. The staff was not friendly and the managment was not knowledgable. Workflow was not productive or organized."
bad,"Management only interested in backstabbing people, two tier wage differences, no UAW representation, inequality in comparison of women vs men. men always prevail"
bad,"didn't really thinl the company appreciated my hard work. always promised to promote me and nevr came through with it, hired  four lowsy worker to about to. the good workers get exploted and taken for granted. wish you guys he best tho"
bad,no matter how hard you work it is never noticed.  the company doesn't care about its employees.  mandatory 12 hour shifts when they get behind.  very strict break + lunch schedules.
bad,I would really give it a second thought before accepting employment at this place. It is very cut throat. But you do learn some valuable things while working there.
bad,"Management very unfair, does not treat everyone fairly. The agency staff get treated very bad. Need to brighten up their management to people who actually want the company to do well."
bad,Think twice about working here. The management is poor and needs to improve. I find that they lack management skills as managers do not to each other to reach  company goal.
bad,The hardest part of work was driving 115 miles a day. working long hours and the drive home. I learned how to listen and become a better machinist. I had some great bosses and co workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I did a well job.
bad,Caterpillar is a very big company and they don't care about their employees. If you had an issue it never got resolved even if you kept going higher on the chain of command.  Caterpillar is all about making money
bad,The most discriminating place I have ever worked. they want to walk you out for any little thing they can come up with. The union does not back up employees its ridiculous.
bad,"Constant cutbacks always make you worry about whether or not you will have a job.  People are not helpful, they are always out to get your work to make themselves more important."
bad,"Boss was terrible. Harassed daily. Reported him to the proper people. But that boss was the other guys best friend.  So it went no where . Was followed by boss in the parking lot and in the factory itself. When he followed me into the bathroom, and I didn't know it, some.co workers told me, I was done"
bad,"Just a quick one if your thinking about coming to caterpillar Shrewsbury think again, the place is run by young managers that haven’t got a clue about the real world,the older generation of managers are a bunch of bullies and talk to you like rubbish (swearing) and have got really bad attitudes towards the people that work on the shop floor, the problem is the hr department do nothing about this and just want to drag everybody through dissaplinary procures, they don’t really care as there all in each other’s pockets,it’s run like a special boys club and another thing you don’t get extra for driving the fork lifts yet if you have a little accident your drag across hot coals and there’s a chance you will lose you job,, so if your thinking about applying thing again..."
bad,"The company doesn't care about you, the union is corrupt, they will treat you unfairly. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with a social life, goals, hopes for management, or a family."
bad,"This was just not the best job for me, but others may love it. You have plenty of chances for overtime, but also mandatory OT that can be stressful when you have a family."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Dont work  there no room for advancing at all,if they dont like you they will find a way to get rid of you"
bad,full of overgrown children who find it fun to bully apprentices and make the apprentices do double the work for a lot less pay also management will try there best to keep accidents a secret as they are too lazy to fill out some paperwork and answer some questions even though that is there job if an accident occurs
bad,Great place to work if you get along with the other staff. Management had no clue hoe to run the company they had just taken over and ignored the staff opinions who had worked there for years. Most staff up and left within first year.
bad,It is a slave job. Do not work it if you want a life. They are not good with people and show favoritism. Also when they get behind there is no choice you have to work overtime no matter what. What about people that want a regular life. This isn't suffice.
bad,"It was an exciting work place, co workers were friendly. Managers were rude and not as understanding as other jobs I've worked at, learn how to treat people with respect, Jon S to be exact"
bad,"Leadership need training in tax laws.   exc. need coaching in ethics and how to treat people.  If I were young, I would be very careful of this company.  Most likely you will find a much better choice."
bad,Place closed its door while I was there. Hated the management. Never told you the truth. People got into heated debates with management. Very boring job. Made wires 300 of same wire sucked
bad,"The Seguin, TX plant is far too demanding and highly under paid. The changeover in employees is ridiculous on top of the shortage of employees. I would not recommend anyone with a family to work there."
bad,"The hours are flexible, management is somewhat professional, only con was the messy co-workers and having to do other people's jon but overall a good place to work if you have a life."
bad,"You'd think you were back in your high school days. Lots of clicks, gossip, drama, and Mickey Mouse rules. If you come in as an employment agency worker, you will stay an agency worker. The company as a whole will use agency workers as much as they can to avoid paying full time wages and benefits. You will be written up for the most trival things. This facility which is Caterpillar owned Anchor Coupling in Menominee, MI merged with they're facilities in Illinois a few years ago where lots of the IL workers moved to Menominee to take jobs at the plants and they are some of the most vile people you'd ever want to work with. I would steer clear of this place. After hearing about Caterpillar in the news recently, I'd steer clear of anything with the CAT logo."
bad,too long ago do not recall just did shipping and receiving there but the pay was very little for all the work expected found better paying jobs and gave my 2 week notice to be able to be replaced
bad,"Don't do it, poor management, not honest although they keep pushing you to be honest, Cat values in action, what a load of .... Typical day was at a trash dump, staying in a hotel for weeks, not seeing your family, management terrible, loads of snitches telling everything you say"
bad,"Not a fun place to be with all the years of lower sales and layoffs. No merit increases, no bonuses and additional work for employees with lack of recognition for contributions. Watching co-workers get walked out is demoralizing."
bad,A greedy company that will use your talent and give little in return.  They have no loyalty to America or it's workers. They move jobs out of country destroy communities that have supported them for years.
bad,Caterpillar is loosing sales and profits for continuously for 4 years which is resulting in global restructuring. it impacted lot of jobs in India as well.
bad,"they don't care much for agency workers,and your treat like an outsider very rarely got any overtime it always went to the permanent workers there was one good thing they supplied Christmas dinner for everyone who worked that day"
bad,This company tends to speak highly of integrity but in fact they are the worst at keeping promises and telling truths. The work is fast paced and you get very short breaks. There is a very high turnover rate with employees literally walking out daily. Pay is NOT parallel to the work that you do leaving employees overworked and very underpaid.. Benefits are bad and the deductibles are high which I think is due to the high number of safety incidents. This is the type of company that looks great on paper but once you begin work you quickly realize that it's headed into the ground.  Layoffs and now bonuses being cut let you know this company only cares about its money and not yours.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Does not pay well at all. Terrible hours. ILS management is a joke. You will never get anywhere unless you are female and are willing to perform ""obligated favors""."
bad,"If you intend on going to work there here are a few of the bads. All supervisors rotate shifts and department once per year. You may not see first shift for years out  after the first one if you intend on being a coach. They do try to get a new coach on first shift for their first year. Team leads.. When they first started the team leads up there has been only one opening come up on first shift in the last 6 years. There are a lot of warehouse jobs but they all pay the same regardless of how hard they are. You always rotate which is bad if you like what you are doing because if you been doing it for awhile and just ripped right out of it. They say it's cross training. So you are Expendable At Any Time.  They don't value those who like the area they work in and do a good job. Don't say you won't rotate ether. they will fire you.. seen it happen several times.. There are a few good managers and they don't seem to stay long. They get that job skill and move on it seems. There are a few who have stuck around..  It is hot. No AC. It's really hot in the Bins. Bins is basically shopping with a shopping cart. The safety manager makes every excuse in the world on why he shouldn't do his job. Good thing he is leaving so we might get someone in there that will actually make improvements. Do not expect them to work with you if you have family issues. sick or illness unless you have FML paper work filled out. I have seen hundreds of people leave here. High turn over rate. "
bad,Compensations is a lot lower than it could be. not a very good balance of work/compensation for this type of work and amount of travel/hardship.
bad,"not worth working for someone racist and rude. staff is mean is all means whether its giving you hours or just throwing you to do an activity out of the blues, and cancelling your shift an hour before you are supposed to come in to work"
bad,"Let's see every week begins the same exact way!  We hear a ""motivational speech"" based around what we're doing wrong.  First rule of caterpillar no matter what you do as an assembler you are always wrong, ignorant, and expendable!  The management with this company can't even organize bonus's to the employees on time much less tell us when we're being laid off.  This is the most dishonest backstabbing greedy company I have ever worked for and if I had the option to go back and flip burgers the years I was here instead I would this very second!  What's truly disappointing is the fact I've worked there for years and I have nothing to show for it!  No ADVANCEMENT NO STABILITY NO TRUE LEADERSHIP. If you are looking for a place to work run away from this place cause all it will bring you is wasted time and effort as they continue to use you like the tool they view you as and rake in the huge bonus the ""leaders"" are making!!!"
bad,"Management sucks, they can't trace their own names. Im positive a kindergarten class runs smoother than that rat hole does. if you like being laid off do apply."
bad,"Exelente empresa para se trabalhar, dispõe de todos os benefícios necessários para um bom desempenho profissional."
bad,"overall its all business, they dont care about you or your family.  The pay for ILS is low, there is no engagement or accountability.  More and more demands made for less pay."
bad,Conservative and not progressive. Lack of intelligent leadership at key positions. Promotions due to who you know instead of hiring for best person to perform role
bad,The job was repetitive and the supervisors played favorites so if you weren't a favorite you didn't get promoted or get raises. Also you got products which made it impossible to keep up with the quota if you weren't a favorite. Pay was very low too.
bad,"I personally would not recommend this company to anyone.  They pretend that they care about you as a person, but they really don’t. They claim that safety and quality come first, but that is not true what they care about is the bottom line (velocity).  If you are not super-fast at your job you are put down for it. You can be a hard worker and truly care about quality but that is not good enough.  The management are mostly a bunch of young kids right out of college with no real life job experience that have no idea how to treat people properly and don’t know what they are doing.  They have a code of conduct that they do not live by it is only on paper to look good. Retaliation happens all the time.  Many of the young associates have a high school mentality.  Pay is not that great for what is expected of you.  When people leave or get fired they are in no hurry to replace them, causing the rest of us to do the work of two people, till people start getting burnt out and then quality starts going downhill.  Bottom line is if you want to work for a company that treats you like dirt go ahead and apply with them."
bad,"Unstable & inconsistent work environment. No job security because of frequent layoffs. Long-term workers can't get comfortable with their pay, because due to the layoffs, there's down shifts in pay grades. Management lies to your face about company's sales forecasts."
bad,this company needs to work on understanding that people are not robots. people just cant come in to work and be like drones!!!!!
bad,"Cat is probally a good place to work but not here , this a foundary and it is hot in the summer and cold in the winter , I plan all maint job and schedule all contractor for the plant ."
bad,"They will terminate your position without any notice."
bad,"Pay well below scale. False promises of upward mobility. False promises of quality of life. Prepare to work 6 days every week. Prepare to work longer than scheduled most days with a notice of roughly fifteen minutes. This isn't optional, it is mandatory. If you are a fan of hypocrisy and place zero value on integrity, honesty, or loyalty... this is your place! Due to hours demanded, interviewing for other jobs is virtually impossible. The work is menial; job loads are unequally divided. No incentive for cross-training, though it is demanded of any with aptitude. This has been the single most cancerous, mismanaged establishment with which I have ever been employed. Inmates truly running the asylum."
bad,"When I first started working at the Caterpillar Aurora facility I really enjoyed my job. It was an enjoyable place to work with a good environment and fair compensation. Through the years of working there, things have only gotten worse. I absolutely hate coming into work now and I see no positive changes in the environment there that would lead me to believe that things will get any better.  The turnover rate at Caterpillar Aurora is crazy! Once management has there sights on you there is not much that can be done to ensure your employment. Certain people are sighted in nearly instantly and are downright forced into a domino effect of disciplinary action."
bad,"was not the best place to work, was called back in on many occasions sometimes on my way home,Bad management, lots of overtime"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"If you work at McDonalds and think this is a better fit,,,,,stay at McDonalds!!!!  They pay sucks 11.80 an hr, you don't move up, and they work you to death, says its a Mon-Thr 10 hour a day work week, HA !!! they work us everyday but Sun. No life and they could care less.  Worst place Iv ever worked!!!! And at 44 Iv been around !!!"
bad,"I've worked for Caterpillar as well as a contractor for Caterpillar.  I have never seen such lazy people in my life.  A typical work day for a CAT employee is clock in, go to your work area, then just sit and stare at your cell phone for 8 hours.  And I get so sick of CAT employees treated like they are better than everyone else.  If there is an altercation between a CAT employee and a contractor, rest assured that even if the contractor is clearly right, he will always be the one reprimanded because CAT employees are spoiled people who get paid way too much to sit at their desk all day."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, got promised the world and got minimal rewards in return, the best thing i recieved from Rogers Civil was invaluable Experience."
bad,"I learned alot from Cat logigistics, I moved up quickly from a warehouse associate to a quality inspector. The hardest part of my job was Not setting goals that would be hard to reach instead of pushing to the limit on goals. The easiest part of my job was setting goals that would be easily met."
bad,"filling inventory count,switchboards, counting inventory for my excel power point due everyday and head count who is counting everyday."
bad,Caterpillar placed a different style of Managers and that has lead to the downfall at Caterpillar Decatur.
bad,"Caterpillar is not a very nice place to work. The jobs themselves are not difficult, its the management. Managers and supervisor there are horrible, and not all but most are just power hungry and like to micro manage. Supervisors like to hide and spy to make sure your working. "
bad,not a good job to work not reliable work you to death tell theres no more work then let you go
bad,(The job - Dirty. Unsafe. Unsatisfying. Temporary. ) (1st line management -terrible. Self-serving. Lack of vision for there workers ) (UAW PROTECTOR OF A FEW. A SUPPLEMENTAL HAS NO REPRESENTATION AND YOU PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE)
bad,company & union are not working together. The union does not protect its employees.
bad,"The work force was great, the management, more concerned patting themselves on the back, and back stabbing other management"
bad,"It was a productive, hot and uncomfortable job. I had no benefits and not enough pay but the hours were wonderful, I worked 12 hour shifts."
bad,"Work contract for 24 years was black listed wasn't allowed any input. Was lied to several times held back. Reminded daily I did not have a 4 year degree and was contract period. Was one of the first contract employees to use proe then not given further training. After 22 years started having health mostly brought on by stress and depression. Detailed for 9 engineers and any problems were always my fault (low man on the totempole) was made a checker (very stressful job) in the end under new supervisor suddly could do anything right belittled, bullied lied to and not given the support I was told I would have as a checker, also My pay was cut 27 percent(only one this happen to) days after reporting I was to go in for cancer testing was fired and black listed. The reason I was told for being fired was I messed up a package, this was proven wrong finally by another checker when asked about this was told they hadn't looked at the package. Then was told it didn't matter I was still fired and would never work at Caterpillar again. A year later was given a contract position in the admen department working with adobe illustrator which I had no training with was told I'd be trained. It took 3 weeks to get a computer another month to get the required software the first drawing I was given nothing was said about the notice so I thought it only proper to ask and was told NO, then 3 weeks later was yelled and screamed at for not doing the notice. I took this position with no benifits with the health problems I had could not find affordable insurance. Was given maybe 3 hours of instruction"
bad,i was told on my start date that it was a secure job
bad,"good jobs, not managed well. doesn't respect workers. rely on my skills to get jobs done. co-workers were the best, working and solving problems before getting upper managers involved."
bad,they dont care about their employees they hire as supplementals so they dont get benifits and so they can fire them for no reason just to hire a new temp
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"I thought Raterpillar would be a good place to work but I was wrong. They expect world class production on third world wages. They would buy slaves to fill their factories if they could. Record profits and all they want to do take away from the hard working employees. If you are related to someone in management you might advance, otherwise you have to wait for someone to retire or die to get promoted. I don't understand why some employees work there 40 to 50 years when they get treated so poorly. I guess after enough years in Raterpillar prison they get institutionalized and are afraid of the real world. It took me a month on the factory floor to realize I would have no future there. Currently looking for a real job and would not recommend anyone work for this employer"
bad,"When I hired in 16 years ago I was promised a future with a company that valued employees and their families. Little did I know that I would be learning the true meaning of a company telling workers what they want to hear. A typical day consisted of dealing with unrealistic goals from management that came straight from college and have something to prove. Most of my time has been spent on second shift and having to give up valuable time with my children. All in the hopes to get the one thing I wanted most, a day shift job. With the recent labor dispute at our plant the company has shown me the true value of my sacrifice. They will do what they can to make it impossible to advance or move to a shift that is workable. The hardest part of the job is clocking in everyday knowing that I am required to give my all so that a shareholder can be happy. The easiest part is clocking out at night knowing I don't have to deal with the insanity for a few hours."
bad,In my eyes caterpillar in pontiac is not the place to work if you are a single parent.
bad,I don't like working for CAT I have a bachelor in science and this job field is not for someone whose interest is in nursing home care. I feel there is very little room for me to grow here. I get depressed even thinking about going in
bad,"okay place to work,  pay is not great they hire people with no work ethic and pay them to do nothing but the people who are hard workers get treated like dirt."
bad,"They Work you to death they have incredibly short breaks,  terrible pay long hours and sometimes not even enough hours . If you worked there before then you know what i mean. its a sweat shop"
bad,"I was going on perfect attendance for 8 years. I reported a person assault me and I got fired instead instead if that person. I’m receiving the max unemployment benefits of over $507.00 a week. Something is not right, I got screwed. Lots of Favoritism there."
bad,The only reason you would work for Caterpillar on the south without union backing is because you are desperate for work. Management is terrible and they work you like dogs. This is a terrible company to work for
bad,"Veel hiërarchieën , geen waardering en je wordt gauw in het diepe gegooid."
bad,"Bad place, forman can’t remember many details customer wanted always unsure about everything. ( think they picked him up from a farm).customers made many threats due to past experiences. For being a dealership, they don’t have any kind of training for the newer emissions for engines, lack of tooling. we learn on customers dime... also been caught many times not paying OT... HR is a joke."
bad,They lie about advancement opportunities there is actually no room for advancement to advance position no job security no matter the effort u put in to it
bad,After months of working there I got injured and when I came back they Laid me off I don’t even understood why I stayed for the time I did they work you like crazy and they always have a reason for mandatory overtime your basically working 6 days instead of 5 every week.
bad,"The Caterpillar plant treated you great but the CLS part of Cat, you were treated awful! I was full time and they treat you very unfair and CLS does not have any of the same pay or days off as the plant. CLS is the step children of Caterpillar!!"
bad,"Mold Maker is the worst job there! Hot! Dirty! HARD WORK for very little pay! Was told three months ago by Management Mold Maker was getting a good pay raise. I quit and other employees still haven’t gotten a raise! Go home everyday dirty, itching from the chemicals in the sand that get onto your skin and sometimes break you out! Management tells you, you can move up within the Company for Internal jobs but everytime you put in your turned down and a outsider gets the position! I don’t see this Company being in business for long! Always got some kind of a problem daily when it comes to running the job efficiently! Mold Maker have to constantly clean up when not busy others just walk around freely watching you work!"
bad,"They use there employees and don’t give them the proper equipment to use. There a cheap skate company that don’t wanna hire more people for what they need because there to worried about keeping bonus money for themselves..boss man has a brand new truck to haul equipment and has me delivering in a ran down f150 while he sits in the office. I’m not a delivery driver yet I’m dropping off equipment and picking it up and then having to hear there bs "
bad,"Highly stressful, fast paced bunch of rabid lemmings.  No leadership.  Cut throat managers.  Unstable working environment.  Complete lack of responsibility in every sense."
bad,"If you are a butt kisser or enjoy being treated like a 2nd class citizen in an emotionally abusive space, you'll do well at CAT. Not sure what the company was but it's a disaster in the 21st century. Some people work the system and do little others try to get the work done."
bad,Not a good work environment... Poir choice of management followed by poor management decisions.Not a good long term career. Dead end with little room to grow
bad,Worked there for 6 years and didn't get a chance due to the interview point system. The knowledge about the actual job was NOT important. Upper management have no ideal direction how to do their jobs to run each line smoothly on a daily basis. They work you excessive hours and bonus each month are not worth it.
bad,"The apprentices comments are spot on, only there to be used as cheap labour and no way a full trade apprenticeship. All who didn't get taken on were treated very shabbily. Very little job rotation so like my self you could end up with repetitive strain injuries and despite the culture of safety the management do not care if you suffer injury if you can't work your out or branded a trouble maker. "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Terrible management is killing this company. Our plant in Prentice Wisconsin had its best year ever for production and safety but they closed it down anyway.
bad,"If management doesn't know job requirements how can they know how to delegate work assignments as well as train new incoming employees. "
bad,assembly line job building forklifts.too many hours a week. barely any personal time.I was temp for 11 months before i quit
bad,Employees are made to work a ridiculous amount of overtime and they will not hire any new people.  The work load is overwhelming to the employees that are there.  Moral has hit a low and is not able to be brought back up.
bad,Worked 6 months as a temporary before coming permanent. Ready to find something more promising where there is equal opportunity for advancement.
bad,Typical day - deal with supervisor shouting that you're too slow and not perfect. Errors will get you fired!!!! You are not allowed to make mistakes. Even if you don't make a mistake they will still fire you based on what the customers say. Even though they don't follow procedures for receiving. Advancement opportunities exist as long as you are willing to take a pay cut.
bad,"As far as hourly, they treat them like garbage with the two-tier wage having the guy doing the exact same job as the person next to them making half the money. The union basically doesn't exist, which was broken years ago. If you haven't noticed they're moving a lot of their plants to right to work states (to pay even lower wages, and not having to deal with unions). Hourly employees are basically disposable!"
bad,Management is awful and fake. Find something else if possible or stay a short time. They make it seem like it's great place until you try to advance and your past work experience doesn't matter to them.
bad,"Do not work here unless you have run out of options. I got injured on the job and they wouldn’t do workman’s comp and instead made me lose 2 plus weeks of"
bad,This company is way too top heavy. Too many managers with nothing better to do than make up new rules daily and crucify anyone who steps out of line. Every blue collar worker is micromanaged to death because the lack of workers vs managers.
bad,"No direction, no accountability, poor communication, too much falls through the cracks, lack of professionalism, and many unqualified individuals in the wrong positions in the office area."
bad,"Caterpillar has changed since I started, they are no longer about the employee they are about that bottom dollar, they claim we get a quarterly bonus, we have not seen any bonus since they started that, they used to give us monthly bonuses but they had been trying to do away with that for some time now. They allow people to be passed out in their cars for five hours send them home and the turn around and let them come back, clearly still strung out on whatever so I guess if you want to work with a bunch of meth heads because you will be on the off shift then by all means come to caterpillar"
bad,"Absolutely a Place a that makes Billions and pays out PENNIES.  "
bad,Buddy system is dominant . They allow employees to harrass you and brush clear harrassment under the rug. They pressure you to find defects that are not present. Elementary type behavior amongst the employees . Team Leads discuss your personal medical business with lower level employees and plenty of gossiping and backstabbing.
bad,"First of all they do train you in a skill that is the only high point. But management causes a ton of problems, Make poor decisions, and move there favorites (weather they can perform or not to days) then expect you to work 10h shifts and every weekend they can take from you and your family they can take Contractually. I’ve been employed at caterpillar Decatur Illinois  for 2y as a welder and put up with more than anyone should have too. Bosses are more focused on what they can get someone in trouble for than getting product out. They have indefinitely fired people for the following, going to the be bathroom(leaving work area), ear plug falling out when taking weld hood off...etc. they are insane out here. Over half the workers are looking for new jobs and have t. Even here long.  Dry sad to see a company slip so far this used to be a great job years ago as I’m told. Just beware"
bad,"Start at the bottom stay at the bottom, hard to move up when there’s so many people in front of you to get a better position, the left doesn’t know what the rights doing"
bad,"Caterpillar say they believe in family time. It’s BS you work everyday except Sunday. They don’t care if your family member died. They want you there. They are doing 5 points system (which is trash) if you call in it’s half of a point or full point depending where you at and if you come to work on time and something happened with a family member it’s half of a point or full point depending where  you work and when you hit 5 points your fired.  Managers are Horrible they talk down to you like if your trash and they are all 2 faces. To become a teamlead you have to snitch on everyone to become a lead. I’ll will NEVER work at caterpillar AGAIN. the place is unorganized, you will find parts from 2 to 4 years old In the very back. Place is a joke. If you have small kids and married you will almost never see them."
bad,"Intrview is long and drawn out. The work will replace most of your life. It is hot and fast paced. The pay is not fair and they will allow permanent hires to bully temps, then fire you if you say anything. The supervisor for the main line will also refuse to file and/or simply disregard complaints to avoid having to deal with HR."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Was a welding apprentice, no health and safety, team leaders and supervisors bullies, extremely sexist. If you dont look right or have a gap in knowledge and ask a question you'll get passed on to the next person HR have no idea how to deal with anything, managers are running around trying to sort things that shouldn't be a problem in the first place. Do yourself a favour do not bother. Paycare pensions and union are available but filling out the paperwork gets you nowhere as admin is a serious issue."
bad,"The company has been very good to me.  I look forward to using my experience at another company located where the weather is warmer, the sun shines more and it snows a lot less."
bad,"I worked 3rd shift in the warehouse for Anchor Coupling (a subsidiary of CAT).  I took a job there because the company that I was at started laying me off seasonally and I was hoping to find a job that didn't do that.  I was there for 4 months and I hated it from day one. They told me that my lead didn't like women and they were right. He watched my like a hawk as if he was expecting me to screw up at any given moment. We had a male temp agency employee that could disappear for hours with no questions asked. I had another male employee using my employee number on the paperwork. When I questioned the lead I was told it didn't matter. When I questioned the supervisor she told me that if there was a mistake and my number was on it, I would get in trouble. My lead would sit in on my evaluations. He didn't do this to anyone else.That way I couldn't complain about him. At one point he suggested that if I brought in baked goods he'd really appreciate it. The people were extremely unfriendly. A group of women asked me to sit with them and as soon as I sat down one of them turned to me and said ""Don't even think of talking to me"". She didn't have to worry. I never went near her again. Part of the warehouse work involved going to their warehouse across the street from the main building. It didn't even have a toilet! You had to use the port-a-potty outside. Imagine that at 3am in the middle of January. At one point I was working over there by myself and another employee sneaked over there to try and catch me not working (he admitted this to me). They barely let me drive the forklift and"
bad,"Caterpillar is run by greedy industrialists whose only concern is the CEO's bottom line, attention is only paid to quanity, not quality. Replacing skilled labor with under skilled temp workers is the other pitfall."
bad,"Poor upper management team doesn’t care about employees work you like a robot and if U have a personal life screw it!!! Been working 2 years now and went from 7 points to 6 now 4 crazy burning vacation time just to get a weekend off, oh and if you have a child or a family at home I hope u plan on the days their getting sick because u only get 2 scheduled days off and 2 unscheduled which equals up to 4 points a year this place just sucks now"
bad,At first I was proud to work here but now I cannot look my child in the eye and say this is a place to be proud of. This is not your grandpas CAT anymore. Union and company is corrupt.
bad,"long hours, very little time for breaks, 10 minute lunch most days, management very disorganized, support staff is very unproductive, communication is biggest problem. No time for personal life, work most Saturdays, under pressure all the time, stay away from this place, they teach culture, being respectful, helpful......complete lie.....1st week was all classroom, 2nd week started and had training for approx. 4 days, moved to a new area and team lead(trainer) took vacation. Very high turnover."
bad,The managers were generally okay to work for until a unqualified and incapable manager was put in charge of the assembly line and made the job a living place in the darkness of all evil.
bad,"My advice to anyone - don't even try working here.  This place is a complete joke.  When I say ""complete joke"", I mean that literally.  Their product quality is below what you'd expect from a ""world class"" company.  You'd be best finding a job at one of their competitors for better pay and better hours."
bad,The title of this summary says it all.  The job pays well. Do not expect to be treated well by Caterpillar management.  The plant is filthy.  The air quality is bad.  We all have what we call the 'Caterpillar cough'.  It comes from the mist contaminants in the air.  It usually goes away after a few weeks of leaving Caterpillar.
bad,I have been with cat over 14 years and have seen a continuous decline of the company and how they treat hourly verses salaried employees. The company/management has no integrity in dealing with employees a supervisor will promise to help make working conditions and pay better and do absolutely nothing about it other than collect their huge stip check and laugh all the way to the bank while a single parent can't even make ends meet to support their children. This year I make less money than I did last year because of a large increase in my health care premium and this cheap company won't even help offset the cost or give a decent annual cost of living pay increase.
bad,"I was hired into an interesting position in my own profession, but soon found myself shuffled into a position wherein I had no specific training or interest. Every year I was expected to work harder in an increasingly difficult environment, farther beyond my field. I became pigeon-holed and could not escape. They refused to consider me for a position in my own field and now they are working up a case to fire me for working in a field I know nothing about. They are toying on the brink of violating my rights under ADA."
bad,"In my opinion, Caterpillar don't care about their workers. They only care about getting numbers. They make you feel unappreciated. This use to be a great place to work but poor management has ran all of the good workers off."
bad,"The supervisors are undertrained and racist. My supervisor asked the team lead how to do his job. There were double standards amongst races. If you was white you couldn’t do no wrong, if you was black you couldn’t do no right. When you report this behavior you are  considered a trouble maker and targeted to get fired. They also started taking our gain share away. They make the quota so high that not even the best and or most experienced can even reach it, then punish us for not reaching it."
bad,"Caterpillar is not a good place to work at all! They let some people there get away with murder, and they nit-pick people who go there to work. They are always looking for ways to cheat their employees."
bad,"The job was high stress. The company was always laying people off. There was no vacation or benefits for us as contractors, which is all they hire now."
bad,Overtime is required; not voluntary. Bad employee environment. Minimal opportunity for advancement. Poor employee attitude. Lack of good managerial leadership.
bad,i worked at CAT for two years. It started out great be ended up a bad situation. The company is great but the management needs to go through people skills training.
bad,Those who would work and get the job done never got any credit. Those who kiss butt and got their position because of who they knew was always praised and given incentives.
bad,"Don't bother working hard, you will get zero reward for it.  The only benefit may be that if you get your foreman to like you because of your work ethic, you are more likely to get offered overtime.  Though that is regulated by the union as well.  Working at Caterpillar taught me that my suspicion of poor working habits for union employees was spot on.  I could work circles around those lazy seasoned union employees and it was not difficult to do.  I was just trying to pass time and not be bored and would be scolded for working to fast.  Upper management doesn't give a rat's hind quarter about you.  Don't think you will be noticed by working hard."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,The phone goes in your ear at 8 am and comes off at 4pm.  Then you have to do the work that was assigned.  If you don't have your work done quickly then you are on the cut list.
bad,"It is a company which does not live up to its values in Action.  Cat use to be a great company and now all I can say is ""stay away"" . It is a waste of your time to come to central Illinois."
bad,"I started here when it was known as Anchor Coupling. Before Caterpillar took over this was a great company to work for. Now we are all just a number and the managers couldn't care less if you stay or go. The more temps they have the more money saved by management.... They have no regard for peoples personal lives. Decisions are made by people who don't actually do the work or know the consequences of their decisions. Raises are a thing of the past, and there is no room for advancement unless you are related to someone in upper management. Any new management hire is usually hired straight from CAT. Internally you have no chance to get those types of jobs. I recommend looking elsewhere. This place will only make you bitter..."
bad,Decent pay but do not care about their employees.  Management is always stressed out and then they pass that on to their employees.  Job security is not part of Caterpillar anymore.  More and more contract employees every year.
bad,"Horrible management, No room for advancement, Promoted laziness of hourly employees, Constant mandatory overtime, treats workers like they are less than human, No recognition for hard work and If you pointed any of this out they would find a way to fire you."
bad,"Was very good job when Bucyrus, once bought out by caterpillar wasnt so good."
bad,the men on the floor knew what they were doing but management didnt thus shut down!
bad,"They make record profits and expect the employees to take pay cuts. The want employees to pay more of the benefits, the pay is market based no guarantee raises. They speak of intergity, excellence, teamwork, and commitment, the only people that show this are the shop workers, the management does not live those values. There is no room for advancement without knowing someone at the top. Some of the newer managers are good, but other than they push unrealistic goals. They expect you to work 6 to 7 days a week or 12 hours days in some areas. 3 out of 4 weekend a month."
bad,"If you live to work this is the place for you. Plan on 60 to 70 hours a week of mandatory over time. There is now 70 percent temps working and not being offered permanent employment. Management will lie to you and show special treatment to some this is blatant favoritism, and accepted practice. And no job security you can be fired for no reason, the facts do not matter. This is my opinion, however talk to the many who have worked at Caterpillar and no longer there. I bet if you live in West Plains, Mo. you know someone who has worked at or working there now and none have positive comments about the factory."
bad,Caterpillar boasts how great they are to work for but in reality they do not care about their employees. Overtime is how the production crews make their money becuase they only get $10 an hour which you cannot live on these days. They talk about their bonus programs but dock their employees for everything to get the bottom dollar for that bonus. Other companies pay better and treat their employees with respect. Managment sucks and really has no authority to follow through with anything. The only enjoyable part of the job is quitting time.
bad,Overworked employees. Management does not listen and will do anything to make themselves look better. Do not quit your current position to work there.
bad,Probably the worst job I ever had period!!!! It was supposed to be 2nd or third shift. Well if you can half way weld they put you on a twelve hour shift work two days off three work three days off two. The first five weeks I was there I did one week orientation. Then the next four weeks they put me on the floor and I pushed a broom. TThen I g
bad,"Very poor management, with next to no long term strategy, also massive gaps in their knowledge of the foundry industry."
bad,Poor Management lack of information  sending more jobs to Mexico. Job discrimination only certain employees are treated fairly. Under production of new products costing jobs in the near future.
bad,always clean  managerment needed help  with experience too many safety meetings  never gave notice when we was going to work late training was good   bought boots and safety glasses and uniforms uniforms were cleaned
bad,All I will say is it wasn’t what I expected at all with them being a big company. Not understanding at all with a lot of situations. It’s like you dang near have to be a robot to survive there. Show favoritism when it comes to applying for jobs. Seems everyone is out to get everyone.
bad,"Caterpillar thinks they rule the word"
bad,"Terrible management, treat the hourly people terrible. As management reap all the benefits and bonus perks off hourly empoyees backs. Usually hire educated isiots who have no clue what it takes to work in Factory setting"
bad,"Run for your life.  I hope and pray people who work there. Cranes are operated by people who have 1 hour or less of actual hands on training. They herd new hires in as they are getting rid the people who actually do work. It’s a joke to say the least. Management team ? There is really none. They are more like bullies, whom lie, harass, intimidate, it’s truly the worst  mismanaged  place I’ve ever been a part of."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,New Boss was totally out to get rid of me. Wrote me up and suspended me for things I had doc notes for. One of them if you ain't brown nosing you ain't going to make it places
bad,Management does not care about employees. They are rude and treat people any type of ways . I was bullied by a manager who later fired me because he did not like me Hr allowed it to happen after I informed them several times! It was a very distasteful experience for me .
bad,"Upper management doesn't care about the employee all they cared about was how much money they were going to make,no advancement opportunity unless you went out drinking with a manager or you were in a relationship with a manager, very unprofessional. If you have a good work ethic and you take pride in what you do do not work for them, if your lazy and can kiss a** with the best of them then this job is for you."
bad,"Dont expect any family time. Working most weekends being told production is behind while the problem is design, engineering support, and materials. Merry go round constant change of management but process never changes."
bad,terrible place to work. No appreciation for hard work. lie to your face. micro manage. if your not the bosses personal friend you will get treated terribly .DO NOT WORK HERE! I Can not stress this enough!
bad,"Lack of effective communication!!!!!"
bad,Initially they hired saying they would need some one to analyze the logistic data. But they had a lot of backlog data entry work to finish. Which was hard for a technical person to sit and do tons of data entry work.
bad,"its not the same plant my dad hired into 40yrs ago or that i was at 11yrs ago, i completed weld school and went to my fab line only to have my weld partner let go, and was given a new one that hadnt completed her on the job training and wasnt told that i had to complete her training and I got dinged for every mistake she made. welders are also not paid what we are worth and not counted as skilled labor"
bad,"Horrible management, and the HR lady is a feminist. Most of the employees are nice minus a few but the management has no clue what's going on and know nothing of what the workers actually do and then try to tell how to do their work. Way to strick with time as well, in 2017 116 people were hired, 115 of them were fired or left. Enough said."
bad,In the last 5 years Caterpillar has changed completely. Everyone is scared for their jobs and will back stab you in a heart beat. Everyone is leaving.
bad,"Les puedo decir en mi experiencia en CATERPILLAR que tiene jefes sobreprotectores con empleados y mucha falta de criterio en la toma de decisiones y amonestaciones, son muy herméticos para tratar las amonestaciones y bajas de personal  para mi eso es algo discriminatorio por sobreproteger a sus empleados y darles trato preferencial a esos empleados que en lo personal no tienen  la más  minima idea de lo que es el criterio ni tolerancia, eso para mi se llama discriminacion, son bien lambizcones y arrastrados sinceramente por ese trato no les dura  la gente en la empresa y dejan mucho que desear como empresa por ese tipo de gente que tienen contratada como jefes."
bad,"The diversity is there and management is not willing to listen to you as an employee , your word means nothing whatever they say is what goes regarless what great ideas you might have to improve work and build relashionships within the warehouse."
bad,"They hire the worst supervisors on the planet!  Some of the employees are your best friends, but some will throw you under the bus faster than you can turn around!"
bad,so unorganized.  Unprofessionaln The pay not worth it. alot of waiting around. 36 to40 hour.  shift hours was ok. they do sell lunch which is pretty decent.
bad,"A typical day at caterpillar was started with a lean manufacturing meeting where everybody stretched and listened to production goals and any accidents that had happened on the previous shift."
bad,The management at this company is horrible. The work conditions are bad as well. Would not recommend this place to anyone and actually called crporate multiple times. smh
bad,hardworking place they really don't value the opinion of contract workers Managers pick and choose who does hard work and whom picks up the slack if you cant roll with the punches don't apply.
bad,Caterpillar is all about the good ol boy system. Disgruntled and mistreated workers. Most enjoyable job definitely has to be exercising the machines. I learned to keep my head up and to always look forward. Hardest part of the job is having to smell the paint fumes all day.
bad,"No employee loyalty, the work that I have done there over the years has brought a variety of different skills and jobs roles to light. There is no better teacher than hands on experience and self pride in personal workmanship."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"With a string of acquisitions at the top of the mining supercycle and over investment in excess capacity has weakened the cost structure of the company.  The actions being taken (massive layoffs, plant shutdowns, restructuring, management rehuffles) are long overdue and are tearing the culture of the company apart and are devastating to the community."
bad,"Typical day was unorganized and busy. I learned lots of mechanical skills, blueprint reading, and more. The management would do anything to get shop employees in trouble and/or fired. The management also hardly did anything to help or even help promote people. The co-workers, well was like working in a high school. Hardest part of my job there was worrying about if I was going to have a job the next day. Most enjoyable part was fixing and operating the bulldozers."
bad,working at caterpillar was good I learned to run machines and work with others the enjoyable part was just being there and learn more about the job
bad,Caterpillar in Athens is a horrible place to work. Management will look you right in the eyes and lie. The people there will do anything to stab you in the back including management.They just need a body in that position. They do not care about the people that work for them.
bad,Management on the floor level very corrupt.Favortisim is practiced  out in the open.If you are in their circle you will succeed if not you will be stuck. Some managers are very immature and tend to target people if they dislike them.
bad,typical factory work with production standards expected; too much separation of the have and have nots with management and hourly
bad,"I can see now how CAT Inc is a global domination.As high as they charge for their products you would think they would pay decent but they do not.CAT bought out ROI TMT and TME in San Antonio TX and Schertz,and when that happened CAT took away perfect attendance bonuses,having your own insurance bonus and lowered the monthly quota bonus from 380 to just 300 and included several stipulations in place to make sure it is as difficult as possible to get even that,ROI use to have Spurs ticket raffles for all,now they are secretly only circulated and drawn within office staff and supervisors.The environment is very very lazy with workers that just either stand around,text on their phones,a maint dept that rides around all day on bicycles and cannot fix any machine problems individually due to routine of daily non productive and constructive work habits,supervisors are also very lazy and corrupt,expect most of them to come in the next morning with alcohol still in their system,if you expect to get promoted or move around best thing to do is the bare medium amount of work,you do too much they break your back and you will never move up even if you have experience from outside the company,you do too little your fired or just stay in the same position.Job advancements are very limited and come with strict rules to monitor and regulate your pay scale,if there is an open position you can apply but expect to lose it from outside hiring without notice and if a supervisor favors a certain worker strictly on the basis of knowing them outside work such as the bar,hunting etc.When CAT bought out"
bad,"Caterpillar is laying employees off and will not give them a straight answer on how the employees who are being let go were chosen.  When you ask upper management about it they become annoyed, and defensive."
bad,Not the company it used to be. Busy through the shift. Management hides the truth. The job was great.
bad,Poor work environment. You pester the same people every year in an attempt to sell them a water filtration system. Very annoying as i get the same people at my door.
bad,Caterpillar is a great company to be employed by. The management staff members make it worse than it should be along with limited chances of advancement.
bad,This company has great potential. Unfortuantley this company has a very bad choice in management.
bad,"A typical day is okay. I go in and do the best job I can building valves so they get a first time pass and the person on the test stand is happy to be there so I do not have to have a turn in the oil too. A few of the management team knows what they are doing, but most are reacting to their lack of planning. My fellow coworkers are great a good team. Hardiest part of job is watching company pit one group of employees against others groups. Most enjoyable part of job is working with friends to laugh at the things management fry's over and over and over with every new friend or family member put in charge of something. It is like they have a 50 year old Playbook."
bad,Poor Management a lot of favoritism shown. You have to be one of the favorites to the top. Management do not have your back will throw you under the bus even if their at fault
bad,You never know when your going home or coming in the next day. sometimes with a few min notice that you must stay late or will even be called at 1 or 2 am to be told you must be early or its write up
bad,"You'll never get a contract here unless you're best friends with someone high up no matter what they say, and they will say it because they can't get anyone to work there any other way cos of their bad reputation. "
bad,"I am not enjoying my time here.  My girlfriend did not enjoy her time here. Male dominated company that is slow to grow/change.  Decisions are made slow.  Usually with some ""political gain"" behind the decisions versus for the good of the company.  Inconsistent messaging internally.  I am truly disheartened as this is not the company I thought I was coming to work for."
bad,"Pieces of garbage every last person in management....make promises they do not keep. They will step right over the most qualified person and hand it to some dbag manager's buddy who has an underwater basket weaving degree And then have the audacity to look you in the eye and say the hiring process is blind......please!"
bad,Job for life if you get a full time contract it my take a few years to get made up from agency which I don't agree with there is no benefits as an agency worker some agency workers took 8.5 yrs to be mad2 full time
bad,"If you like working far more than you're being paid for or if you like to be committed to a company that doesn't care about you, this is the place to work at."
bad,"If your face doesn’t fit you’ll be gone. Job security is none existent, pay is really good and so is the job. But management will do anything in their power to get rid of you if your face doesn’t fit."
bad,"Management is joke there. And managers are kids and unqualified to be managers.  Messy works and schedules, and  there is no training ever at the facility. The want you know everything without any type of training."
bad,They treat you with little respect.wants you to work your butt off.no room for advance unless you kiss butt. I don't recommend this place. They do pay good that's the only good thing
bad,I hated working there management was the worst I have ever seen and was treated poorly and discriminated against by a co-worker and nothing was done about it.
bad,"The parent Caterpillar Inc is a great company, however the Underground Mining Engineering business unit located in Burnie, Tasmania, Australia is not in par with the corporate CAT Inc. The employees in Burnie are treated as 2nd class. The pay rates, benifits, superannuation and Salary Grades are not in line with other units within Australia. An Engineer in main land Australia will be at least 3 grade more than an Engineer in Burnie, Tasmania. The team in Burnie is great to work with, but we're all disappointed in the way Corporate treats the Burnie employees. Once you join the Engineering team in Burnie there is no further advances. The official communication to us who want to advance in career is to move out of Burnie. My advice to anyone considering a position in CAT Burnie is to consider it only if you're unemployed and desperate to find a job. Tasmania is an isolated place and hence switching job, once you move here is impossible. It's impossible to grow in CAT Burnie too. The work nature is great, people are also great, but due to the 2nd class employee treatment the employee commitment are extremely down."
bad,Bad management and  favoritism was a huge problem at Cat. A lot of people got made up jobs. They had some people thinking they run the plant. HR was horrible too.
bad,with rolling lay offs and perminent layoff this is not the place to have a carreer. Nepatism runs rapid in this place. Safety is called important however it is often brushed under the rug
bad,"aucun suivi à part la marge, le but n'est pas le bien etre du collaborateur"
bad,A typical day at work in the Caterpillar Newberry facility is frustrating.  I learned that without a strong leadership team a company is doomed to fail and it has.  This facility is closing sometime mid 2017.
bad,Allot of the time the work is boring and mundane work.  Very process driven even when the process do not work. But management and supervisor are very supportive of their employees. It’s all about the numbers No personal growth
bad,"Serious lack of COMMUNICATION!!!"
bad,get place to work but pay/advancement is nearly impossible there.management is the worst there because they are college students with no experience.
bad,"One of the worst companys I ever worked for,Please Stay Away From Them!!!!!!!!"
bad,They only keep you if you fit in the click.
bad,I was accused of a violation of policy at work only to prove later with supporting emails that the accusations occurred outside the workplace and had been falsified by the other employee!!
bad,"When I started working for Caterpillar there was a promise of a bright future with plenty of perks. These included regular cost of living increases, a pension that a person could live on, free health care, and early retirement. By the time I was two thirds through my career with Caterpillar, the cost of living increases were gone, the pension was frozen, I was paying a premium for the health care, and the facility I worked at was being closed. Caterpillar told us how they loved us, loved our work, and that we would be together as long as we wanted to work, then moved operations out of the country."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"They overall culture of Caterpillar tractor is extremely poor in communication, especially to supplier employees, even when the information may be necessary to do the job."
bad,"Unproductive meetings / projects by Corporate goons detracted from getting my job done without working non-paid overtime."
bad,"Never working here again. Too much drama ; even if your friendly ,they will still make you seem as if your the problem. They come to work drunk and smelling like straight alcohol.  they will fire you over a few pieces of scrap. someone is alway jealous of you. they will do anything to fire someone so they can get OT"
bad,Caterpillar is heavily driven on the culture known as jobs for the boys. If you want a progressive career this company is not for you. If you're happy to plod on for the foreseeable future then great company to work for.
bad,"Caterpillar used to be a great place to work, but the attitude has eroded.  Years of service did not mean anything as my job was eliminated to ship overseas to save money.  I had over 25 years of experience."
bad,"Countless managers in roles they shouldn't be in. The working environment is like a high school and if you don't fit in to a certain group, your job is highly at risk."
bad,"lots of politics, racially motivated, no growth, very unstable, no focus etc.. Employees do a chance to grow or can keep your job secure if you are non-white.  Top management is full of greedy people."
bad,Caterpillar is going out of business at a rapid rate and is trying to force as many people out as possible so that they have fewer employees to pay when they shut each plant down and move to Mexico. Buy a Tigercat. They cost less and work just as well. I regret wasting my time with this monster.
bad,The company essentially were hiring young people straight into work to use for cheap labour with an approximate 2% making it through to the next year of employment just just as slim odds from there for progression.
bad,A typical day was worm ups and toolbox meeting then welding ordering parts and house keeping. I liked the welding part of the job. The hardest part of the job was management coming up with ideas for things that did not need fixing.
bad,"Good place to work, my job is always a challenge. But never had"
bad,"Caterpillar at the Griffin Ga plant is the worst place to work...They lay off way too much,they make employees that were layed off last year come back as temp agents,they make you work in fear every day with their defect or hit system,and I have seen people fired for really no reason and claim they violated company policy its all politcs at the plant its mostly family and friends that get hired.To me Caterpillar is the worst place to work..."
bad,Co-workers were the best and we were dependent on them. There was too much management The days were 12 hours long. The goal of the company changed from making the best machines in the world to raising the price of the stock.
bad,"Caterpillar was my ""Dream Job"". I worked there as a sub contractor for months. I tried very hard to get in and finally I was accepted. I loved my job and coworkers, much of whom I've known as from sub contracting. Training was about a month long. I learned plenty. Shortly after training we were told that we were getting laid off in a few weeks. They called me back about 2 years later for a temp position just to lay us off again. I turned down another job offer to take this, not finding out that it was a temp position until orientation started. My heart was broken twice..."
bad,union activities kept the membership somewhat happy but the main goal of manaemet was to keep the emloyees very unhappy there are people that work there right that cry every day because of the way they get treated that was a typical day working at Caterpillar
bad,Very strict about everything. Cant go outside. Vending machine items are very expensive. Production workers have to bring lunch with them while upper management gets to go get lunch from place of their choice.
bad,"When I first started there in 2016, it was good. I was able to move to an area that fit my work experience and the people were just as great. We went in at 7am and at 3:30pm we were all heading home. Mon-Fri, just like they told me in my interview. Fast forward to today, 2019. The group I worked with, started off in, we worked so well together and got things done in the time given and even spent time together outside of work was broken up and everyone got sent to different areas. If you had a crew that worked well and safe, you would keep it that way, but the supervisor didn’t like how well we all got along so they broke up the whole team. We don’t work Mon-Fri, sometimes it’s Mon-Sat and it’s no longer 7am-3:30pm, most the time it’s 7am-5:30pm. And they’ll even push 5am-5:30pm. I don’t mind working 12 hours but starting at 5am is a killer. They don’t understand that people have to get up at 3am just to be there at 5am. I have to be up at 3:15 just make sure I’m on time at 5am. They give team lead positions to people that don’t understand the job and supervision to people with no communication skills. They talk about a life work balance, but don’t show it. They preach safety, but every day somebody gets hurt. If things went back to the way it was in 2016, which I doubt, it would be the best place to work. But it’s not, this job drains the life out of you."
bad,"I worked there for a year. "
bad,Not a job I’d recommend to someone trying to have a family. Long stressful hours 7 days a week. Poor management and poor training. Pretty much have to train yourself.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Not a bad job at all. Just poor management and the way you had to achieve a decent raise. No advancement if you were not liked well. You can make money there if you work a lot of overtime.
bad,Disipline is the only form of comunication and management is working hard to devide workers against each other. The only time you are made aware of new rules is after some one is disiplined for it.
bad,"While compensation was fair, management and staff were difficult to work with, and it did not provide the work family balance needed.  The atmosphere was not conducive to a cohesive work environment."
bad,22 years of service and they are closing.  No job security.  Terrible management.  I once was a great job but has not been in years.  I thought I would get my 30 years.
bad,I enjoyed working for the Different dealers.  Analyzing is the biggest part of my job and there is nothing more satisfying than finding that hard to locate part and get the customer up and running.  I would say the least favorite was the stress but overall loved doing what I do.  I am all about satisfying the customer.
bad,"Caterpillar makes good products and has lots of good engineers.  However, management gets in the way and makes everything more inefficient.  To try to satisfy Wall Street, they'll lay off whole buildings of people, either permanently or temporarily.  Then they'll be in a rush trying to have the remaining people finish the work because there is still plenty of work to be done."
bad,this company treats its workers unfair. typical day is checking parts with gages. I became good friends with all my coworkers. the hardest part of the job was making sure parts ran perfect. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be lunch so I could talk to people n meet new people.
bad,Company does not appear to be in touch with the real world. The workers for the most part were good and nice to work with.
bad,Good skills learned-Loved fellow co-workers-Management was a total good ole boy situation with o regard for rules and safety guidelines.
bad,Work is nice and easy but management can't control the drama and high school mess that goes on there. You will not see eye to eye with most of the decisions that take place rather through management or your Coach who is your leader and one mess up can cost you your job.
bad,Management was very poor. Managers were very rude including the HR Representative. I was treated unfair. I was lied to about my family medical leave. I was fired after I was told I wouldn’t be until they received information from the FML team and I was still terminated the same day I received my papers from the fml team.
bad,This was a great place until the recent manager who did not like me because he did not believe girls could do the job correctly. He was sexist racist and had favoritism.
bad,Caterpillar is the greediest company ive seen the UAW is a complete and utter joke.... supplemental employees for two years hardly and pay raise just to get laid off. Top out pay was 17.40 till 2018! What a joke
bad,"Fast paced,  some organization but not much, on your feet the whole day with two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch, you never know what time you will be getting off until right before time, management is poor and needs to be reevaluated, the employees are ok however its pretty much everyone for themselves"
bad,it was a nut and bolts job that was decent pay. Logistics and parts ordering was a joke.  They would hire literally anyone to work there doesnt matter if they new what a wrench was or not.
bad,No raises for hourly employees for 8+ years. Upper management has drove business away from quality and fixed on only stock holders. CEO is retiring so hopefully things will improve.
bad,If your not one of the Boys its not for you!!!!! If your not from around there then you not fit it.  No Chance of advancement if your not the TEACHER'S PET ;(.
bad,Learn something new. Get to meet new people from different places. Have weekends off. The pay is not great but anything better you would have to take a good drive.
bad,"I was told I would be make a lot more money by the end of my first year come to find out I was lied to so if they tell you something get it in writing. "
bad,I'm getting laid off sometime before December 2018 after 22 years of service. Always some sort of disappointment with this company. Upper level really has no common sense.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"My supervisor actively avoided accomplishing goals, so that he would continue to have goals the following year."
bad,"A Caterpillar me ajudou muito no desenvolvimento da minha carreira profissional, pois aprendi a trabalhar com ponte rolantes, montar peças de tratores e utilizar instrumentos de medição."
bad,"Coming into work 15 minutes before shift starts and report to post on time to relieve the other officer. Work as a team, very helpful and willing to share information. Friendly people also pefers to work alone.Doesnt work with personal life. Insuring financial abilityfor my family."
bad,I got to see a tractor being built form the frame to the finish. It was exciting being able to drive a D-6.
bad,The management sucks. Everything is micro-managed. The team leads and supervisors talk to you any kind of way and getaway with it. Human resources doesn't help with anything.
bad,"Excelente empresa, oportunidad de aprendizaje y compañerismo."
bad,"The company isnt the best they make a lot of empty promises of advancement"
bad,You can get walked out in a SECOND!!!! They honestly do not care about people and their families.  They hire and fire every day.  Revolving door.  No retention.
bad,Was a great place to work until lay-offs started taking place or unexpected terminations. Really interesting and exciting job until work was slowly phased out and everyone was laid off.
bad,they are more focused on how to fire people than their own production dialling company cause labor relations especially and hr they coast by to get a check tell the business fails
bad,"That place is ran with poor management  and if you will be singled out and bullied if you are not liked. They break federal laws , if you have fmla for yourself or a family  member. The people  that see over  do not know how to do the jobs in the workplace all is seen is numbers. And if you dont have them you will be a target!!  Ita a depressing environment your so called union brothers and sisters are SNITCHES. And will smile at you a and cut your throat  in a heartbeat.  DO NOT GO TO THIS HOLE ITS bleep  ON EARTH!!!!!"
bad,It was a very stressful place to work. Didnt care of you were sick or kids. Management was rude and disrespectful. Pays good only if you were company. Supplemental didn't have any say so in anything and was treated poorly. And also too much drama
bad,They play with ur points in 90 day i got a good review been there since jan. 2019 still make 13.65 and they dont roll people over to full time this place is a joke
bad,"Good pay. A lot hours. No benefits no support from your manager, lead or anybody on this company. They turn their back on you if you get hurt. I say this on my on experience and other people. That is really sad."
bad,"They are a hypocritical company that doesn't care about the contracts nor the employee's for there company. I had a security job I worked for Caterpillar years ago and was released due to illness and collected unemployment. I came back to caterpillar for a desktop support job and my old boss from security ended up making me lose my job, saying I was fired under bad conditions and caterpillar would not allow me to work there any longer and that was my first day as there new desktop support after I few up to Chicago for training for an entire week prior. Caterpillar does not care what happens to the employee's or its contractors. Do not work for this company."
bad,"Helping the company run smoothly, helping trailer drivers with loading their trucks so they can depart to a different location. Helping repair any other problems or concerns."
bad,Aprendí interpretación de dibujo y uso de instrumentos de medición
bad,Good and very large company with annual turn over of around USD 50 Billion. I would like to work in the company in future. Best of luck.
bad,"on a daily basis:"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Filling out safety checklists, managing team members, shipping, loading trucks, picking and packing orders"
bad,"awful place to work. Management is heartless and callous. ALL they care about is product and profit period. Just read up on the I.A.M. union strike in Joliet, IL in 2011."
bad,the job was like working in a slave house and pay was not worth the head ache
bad,Good working environment. May be a place to retire from with exceptional benefits.
bad,"This company only cares about it's CEOs getting rich, not about the people who actually manufacture the product."
bad,"Worked with great people, loved the skills I learned and the job i did until it moved out of the country. Most of the management were decent, my foreman in particular was excellent."
bad,"deixei a empresa em 1999 em busca de um progresso maior para minha carreira. Hoje vejo que foi a decisão mais acertada que eu tomei, já que cresci profissionalmente e tive oportunidade de conhecer outras plantas CNH n o mundo e participar anualmente de workshops em outros países."
bad,Muy buena empresa y tiene oportunidad de crecimiento ya que tiene muy buenas prestaciones
bad,"I have worked at the swlc location since May 16th. We have been undermanned ever since. Long hours. You see your Co workers more than your family and they seem not to care! Over worked and way under paid. Had three interviews and not hired on because they know who they want to hire before the interviews begin. Waiting on fourth interview that they have been dragging their feet feet on since beginning of March. Lots of favoritism. Team leads can't be team leads because supervisors like to pawn off all their work on them, so some people get away with things that aren't in the standard work. When I try to say something about it to the team lead I become the bad guy! This place is basically a sinking ship without the bodies to bale them out!"
bad,Working for dsi in cat was awful. Management calls you while drunk and is rude. Very unprofessional. You get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.
bad,"A typical day at work, would consist of working very hard to meet customer demands. Over time i learned how to schedule which orders to do first to improve on time shipping. Working with independently and with others to complete tasks."
bad,"Caterpillar was a terrible place to work for. I was strung along for 14 months without benefits, without sick days only to be laid off. All the other union workers could get fired and get their job back, oh no, not me. I had to pay union dues but with NO union backing and if I lost my job I got nothing!! Caterpillar has gone down hill from what I hear it use to be!! The only thing I gained from there is better knowledge of hydraulics which seems impossible to find a job doing this again anywhere else."
bad,"Overworked, no respect to employees, and managers get ""revenge"" on workers by increasing workloads and overtime. Quotas were introduced and increased regularly."
bad,No job growth unless you are a good ol boy. Type of place that wants to have change from the bottom up.  Applaud the safety culture however when you have to call an all hands meeting for when someone gets a paper cut it’s a little much.
bad,If you are looking to make money after high school this is the place. but if you are trying to support a family find another place of employment. Money is great because of all the overtime but that's what also makes it bad you dont have time for family and those who you need to take care of.
bad,Every day is different due to employment turn over .Poor Management. Family culture. Inspection due to machine and tool damage. challenging daily block amount.
bad,If you like working long hours for low pay and having no time for a life outside of work then this is the job for you.  This is a place where you'll be forced to work long shifts at least 6 days a week and when fatigue results in an accident or injury it'll be blamed on you.  I have never worked at a place that cared less about balancing an employees work and home life than this place
bad,"No employee is comfortable with fear of losing their job as Caterpillar slowly leaves the community."
bad,Production rate too high and this causes work defects. Management cares more about production than quality of work. This creates poor work ethics.
bad,"Not at all what I would have thought about a World Class Company, treated the employees like you where just a number, I personally heard the Plant Manager  state in an employee meeting that we all where replaceable, and that anyone could do our jobs.."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Caterpillar is the worse place to work at. Everyone acts like they are in high school. Management has no idea of what they are doing. And If you are a temp worker and the place shuts down for a day or two you do not get paid.
bad,The fact that I worked for 2 years with no Benefits and the fear of losing my job and any moment was horrible
bad,"This company is very hard to advance, if you don't know anyone in a higher position you're going to be  stuck going the same thing for most of your time there."
bad,"Team Caterpillar only worries about team Caterpillar. If you are supplemental, you have no benefits or job security. The union will not help or protect you as a supplemental - BUT you will pay union dues.........AND they can keep you supplemental for UP to 2 years. "
bad,"Just be aware that you NEED to be related to someone higher up in the company to advance. Education, abilities, skills, and past performance mean absolutely nothing here. I expect this kind of nonsense with a family owned business or government jobs, not at a Fortune 50 corporation."
bad,Fair pay but very monotonous doing the same thing for 10 hours a day will wear you out. Been at the company as a temp for over eight months now and still no word as to when or if I will get hired on as a caterpillar asscociate. I recieve no benifits and have had no evals or pay raises.
bad,Pay was good benefits too but not now it's use and abuse. A lot of nepotism goes on.its what can you do for the company but nothing for you overworked and underappreciated
bad,"Was promised a career if I hire on, but I've yet to see one advancement to another position since I hired on.  After the 6th interview for another position I decided to no longer work as hard or as fast as possible anymore. I watched people that didn't work near as hard get moved up because they cheesed with management while I had my nose to the grindstone.  I had no AQE's put out twice what my colleagues did."
bad,if u don't get there 10 minutes early everyday or if ur not up to their expectations for production numbers they do all they can to get rid of u. they claim quilty is most important next to safety but at the end of the day it's all about numbers.
bad,"This place is a real wild card to work for depending upon what department you end up working in, and what team lead, and supervisor you get. Most people that worked on main line never smiled , and did not seem happy. Many people that they hired never worked in a plant or construction before, yet because those inexperienced people have worked there a year or two the company culture acts as if they are golden. I would not recommend being a hand at this place. They hire too many people that are not worth having at the company, yet the ones that are worth keeping, are paid the same as the worthless ones. It is frustrating when they hire people that look like they have done hard time in prison, and place them on the same pay scale as you, and place them next to you to work with. Seemed more like a half-way house at times. The place would talk and promote safety, but it was very unsafe. This was due to the people that did not have a real back ground in any field like that, yet CAT would hire them, and say they'd train. Cat's training was pretty  basic if non-existent Working in the white collar departments might be good, but hiring in as a hand is not. Maybe if you never worked in that environment before it is okay, but do not hire in with any real industrial back ground. Plus, I have personally seen Cat's management go, and fire people that were sick, but did not have enough sick time/points to call in, yet the people that called in had the flu. Again it depends on what supervisor you get. It surprised me how Cat was ran. They might have a great product, yet that does not mean a"
bad,"Day starts out with company propaganda and safety discussions as are numbers from your well rested supervisor. In the warehouse you will grab a cart and your pick sheet and either put away frieght or pick freight for delivery.  You will be powerwalking your entire shift and hot."
bad,"With the commute, it did not pay well enough. The company machined large engine blocks, and as a lead I was required to set up the line daily, change tooling, write reports and job process', but with a 45 minute commute, I did not feel it was worth it any longer than the 4 years I was there."
bad,If you like getting laid off all the time or at least every other year than this is the place for you.  You are part of a Union that unfortunately has no power left these days.  Great co workers but lazy management.
bad,"Company has competitive wages. Terrible work culture. Your experience can go either way, depending on where they put you. Most supervisors/team leads play favoritism. They will threaten to walk you out over ANYTHING. No job security. Ok job if you can deal with being constantly being belittled and under trained."
bad,"As a big business, the company does well to produce good quality products and is extremely efficient. However with efficiency comes strict and hard work, all of which go unnoticed and not rewarded or beneficial to a healthy functional career."
bad,i was welding at caterpillar and i wouldnt advise anyone to waste there time cause they pay you bare minimum and the team leads and upper folks have the nastiest attitudes as if they dont wanna be there themselves
bad,"Fala-se muito no bem estar do funcionário, mas na prática é diferente"
bad,"If you like giving up all your time to basically live at caterpillar then you'll enjoy working there. They say a four day work week, thats a laugh. 98% of the time you work weekends. The pay is okay if you're inexperienced. If you have experience it's pretty low pay for all the time they expect you to put in. Great co-workers and you can learn a thing or two from some of them. All in all it would be a solid place to work if they got their act together and gave their employees more time at home with family."
bad,"So top heavy with managers, you may not even know who to report to. Mandatory overtime on weekdays and weekends leave little time with family. Inexperienced and ineffective management lead whole departments into closing down. Dealing with management is like dealing with the DMV on the best day and like dealing with a sleeping sloth on the worst day. The jobs being performed in my area should have been at least 2 labor grades higher but management would not concede and align the pay with the work."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"No work/ life balance extremely fast pace, very short breaks , 30 min breaks. 7 days a week work 10 hours per day mandatory! Supervisor is not understanding of time needed off. Very safety conscious to the point they make things up to complain about. I would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to go to CAT.. CAT laid off at least 10,000 engineers last time.. Now they are begging them to come back.."
bad,Work environment is very stressful and cut throat. Very low morale for the past 9 years due to change in management. Can not trust the managers and the decisions that they make for the best interest of the people and company. Everything is very secretive. Very depressing atmosphere.
bad,"Contractors treated as 2nd class citizens. Not allowed to participate in Caterpillar activities because we were under Volt's health care plan. When I was laid off in 2009, Volt gave me two sheets of paper-where to find free food and where to find free shelter."
bad,"For a brand new plant, management is terrible. I'm not a union guy but this plant needs one."
bad,"The company holds it's employees in a continuously adverse environment and there is no need for that except to keep heat off the execs. The work stations are called cells and the barbed wire around each facility is faced inwards, so you have to appreciate them letting you know exactly how they feel about you."
bad,poor supervisors u are just a number there layoffs u could work for six months and be gone for six months .supervisors want u to fear them . knowing thay can stop your job at anytime .
bad,"Nice place to work, Has some challenges. Developed a lot of good relationships and learned a lot. Enjoyed the team work.Most of the co-workers were good to work with/"
bad,"I do not have much to say. I like to stay as positive as possible. I did learn a lot by trial and error. I was able to bring a lot of job related skills with me, and just took the initiative to learn more; and then was able to train all other employees that were hired in afterwards."
bad,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, but management treated employees very poorly.  Seniority, not work ethic, held precedence."
bad,Caterpillar is a destructive company that only uses OPACC calculations to make decisions. The value of employees is not appreciated and each employee is treated like a number. I worked in the Pulaski VA facility that no longer exists. Employees with over 20 years experience were simply handed a severance package instead of trying to maintain that knowledge base and appreciated 20 years of loyalty.
bad,Constantly worried about a layoff.  No communication to disprove the rumors spread.
bad,they tell you that its room for advancement but the truth is that they will work you hard as they can before they hire you full-time
bad,The bad thing about this company is they do not practice what they
bad,The co-workers are great! The management doesnt help much. The hardest part of the job is staying awake. I've been aboard 4 months i still do not have a log in to the computer nor a laptop which was suppose to be done in the first week. Im still not clear on what my actually position is or when i'll begin working that positon.Im currently not doing what i was hired for.
bad,I don't think you really would want my honest review for this company
bad,"Horrible place to work.. alot of favortism , you get paid more if you know the boss or if he likes you thats a fact! they dont care about your personal life they hire people to work swing shifts then put people on steady 2nd so there stuck and ruin there life,,..the one boss got grabbed up by a employee for good reasons yet the boss is still there and is descrimation against employees . i would not tell my worst enemy to work for cat in houston pa.. maybe other plants are different but this plant sucks"
bad,This is one of those jobs that everyone forgets that you are a person and not just a number.they pay very well but lay off alot and you can go from a level 4 to a 2 in one day and that hits the paycheck very hard.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,To much micro management expectations are not real want 100% on drawings. advancement are not there. only so far you can go deadend job. remote location very high turn over rate. Was there almost 6year and even got screwed on the exiting had to pay them.
bad,It's such a easy place to work but the managment is pretty worthless and the HR department is garbage!! They give out stupid prizes in the safety drawings they do but you always have to track down someone from HR to get it if you win and half the time they don't remember if you won or not! There is people that have worked there for 20 years that dont make 20hr!Don't waste your life here!
bad,"Mala organizacion y administracion de ciertas áreas dentro de la empresa, poco sentido profesional del personal encargado, mal actitud de lideres y supervisores en general."
bad,The supervisor I had was young and dumb. Look like he was fresh out of high school and couldn't tell his head from his feet.They laid us off and we had only been there for 6months.
bad,not good job too work at too much drama on lines. just not good place too work a lot of back stabbing assembly line benefits are not good insurance deductible is too high for family
bad,If you want to constantly not get paid a bonus and want to continuously be told that you are not good enough because you and your team did not meet company metrics then please go to work here.
bad,"work all the time, Sundays off. mandatory overtime every weekend. no real home life. this is all i have to say about them. .................................."
bad,"Do more with less should be their motto.  You are expected to manage whatever they throw at you without direction.  If you ask anyone for help, it can/will be used against you. People are afraid to speak their mind for fear of being fired, they call it ""laid off"" without a return date."
bad,"I can only review the plant in Sanford NC. My experience here as an Assembly Technician was good as far as the actual work goes, but the culture of employees is one of the least desirable places to work."
bad,They expect you to work every minute of your shift! I work hard and expect better incentives and basic human rights.Caterpillar tries their hardest to prevent legal (work comp) issues from happening that people have gotten fired for being careless.
bad,My years at CAT were filled with a lot of learning of the manufacturing environment.  they paid for me to finish my degree but then wouldn't hire me for a professional position.  I looked elsewhere and found a better paying job.
bad,"Caterpillar used to not be a bad place to work but recently they cut our bonuses and said it was because of employee attendance which was a complete lie. The managers get huge $10k bonuses and also 401k bonuses when the associates who actually do the work get whatever they were getting cut, and our slogan is 4 walls one team! If you are a complete lazy moron you are more likely to get promoted then the people that work hard."
bad,"Clayton Caterpillar is based on the GOOD OLE BOY system. If management dont like like you you wont be able to move up. If you are related to the top person you got a job even though you dont really have the experience. Pay  per year is ight above federal poverty level. Billion dollar company and you have employees making 27 or 28.,"
bad,"I worked there for 11 years and rarely did I feel my employment was safe. The culture is very cutthroat and it seems you are always wondering what others are saying about you. The work is not hard or demanding for the most part, but training is almost nonexistent. You will be taught how to load/unload parts if you run a machine, but little else. There are good people there, but learning who they are takes time. When business was going well; they want you to work 12 hour days and seven days a week. When business is not going well; you are at risk of being laid off; and there is little time in between. I am not a fan of that type of culture and I can not recommend it as a place to work."
bad,"My thoughts on the Caterpillar apprenticeship scheme are as follows we where given targets to abide by and we were promised that if we met those we would make it through the stages to secure long term employment, however this was not the case. "
bad,"Very poor management."
bad,"bad pay"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Management asks you to perform a task with out any direction, and if not preformed properly nothing is said to you about it till it is to late and you are being let go. People you work with pass on the blame of what they mess up on you and you are not given a chance to defend yourself or explain your side of things. You are not asked to work over time but are told that you have to, and if you don't you are charged with not showing up for work."
bad,Its not the best place but not the worst. It's hot. Everyday you do the same thing and they make you feel like you are just a robot. The preach safety but management makes you do unsafe things everyday.
bad,Management is a clique. Experience is not looked at when promoting the favorites.
bad,"There is a lot of cronyism and favortism, and they keep changing the rules to suite the current management team. The managment team changes constantly and you never get a proper reveiw. Each supervisor usually justs copies from the employee's last review and maybe change a number or two. How can a supervisor do a fair review if they have only been over a team for less than two months? This is just one example of what a employees deals with on a daily basis. The Cons of this company outweigh the pros anyday. Caterpillar used to be the premier place to work, but now they are just like any other, they offer the same wages and benefits as area companies.They used to value their employees, but no more. If you need a job, go ahead , but do not expect much, unless you happen to make it to the good 'ol boys club."
bad,"No room for advancement, only certian people were groomed to advance. Supervisors lacked management skills. Some of the co-workers was good to work around. The hardest part of the job was coming in to work and not getting a proper turnover from the previous shift."
bad,A few times a year we are able to let loose and have fun normally it comes with free food. During these times production is most high because it is a more relaxed environment and everyone is less stressed about work. Management is really hard headed on quite a few things and they don't listen to the employees and if they do it is quite rare. I enjoy the diversity in the people there are a perfect mix of every age and race. On second shift we all get a long for the most part but its like a big family once you're better known to everyone.
bad,My time working there was very enjoyable as far as the coworkers me being from up north coming to the south I thought I would be treated different but I was totally wrong great group of coworkers from every department even HR now as far the work policies and hourly pay and benefits they all suck and I’ll leave it at that
bad,I gave this company 8 plus years and they never considered hiring me on as a full time Caterpillar  employee. I did exceptional work for them. I even transferred to Decatur that has hardly any minority workers hired on in the office environment. They had a position available that I was more than qualified for and was never given an interview.
bad,"They always hang a feeling of insecurity over your head.You never know if you are going to have a job from week to week. It,s the only company I have ever worked that I was afraid to buy a new car because I didn,t know if the job would last that long.The important thing to caterpillar is, whatever is best for caterpillar. The longer you stay , the more they take away."
bad,Employees constantly talk about eachother. Typical high school drama there. Management favors certain employees over others. Employees take short cuts. High turnover rate. Employees dont properly train new employees. Management talks a good game but dont back it up.
bad,The older you get the harder it will be to succeed at Caterpillar.  Find an internal person to champion your career (someone who can speak positively and passionately about your skill set to others) in order to keep moving forward into challenging positions.
bad,Cylinder packs area has many problems and the management wants to blame employees for any mistakes and either get them fired or lock the employee in to a job they hate
bad,"When I first started at this place, everyone was on the same team. Over the 13 years I was there it became about doing more for salary employees to make more money, and low compensation for hourly employees."
bad,Nothing to share. Pay raises is horrible workload os not evenly distributed among employees. Favoritism is ridiculous and if you speak your mind about anything you become a target and either you quit or get firedfor something petty but they will justify it on paper for corporate.
bad,"Your typical day after start up meeting is work, be productive, be safe and have quality of work. Management are ok, but they need to be in the same page and be more consistence with the policy for everyone. The culture is a challenge and people get use to be pamper instead act as an adult. SAFETY is to the extreme and ridiculous. The day more enjoyable in March when the incentive is coming if goals are met."
bad,"If your smart and only looking for a global company to put on your resume Cat will do that. Hardcore friends and family rein supreme there. Doesn't mater how limited their intellect is or unqualified they are, friends and family will get promoted. The smart and capable people they have to hire most likely will never advance there because they have no friends or family that can replace them. Their stated values in action are untrue and only used as a punishment tool for nonmembers of the friends and family network."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Did not like how management deals with situations very poorly theres a lot of favortisome around the warehouse they never resosl v e anithing. And pay sucks
bad,"While the benefits are good, that's about all I can say for this place. Idiots run wild here, with little repercussion, and if you do work hard and do a good job, well you'll end up doing their work too. Promotions are based on ""diversity"" not actual performance or qualifications. Do yourself a favor and run quickly in the opposite direction."
bad,"Cat used to be a great company to work for, with engaged management, friendly culture, teamwork, and an annual employee survey that the company 'seemed' to care about the results. Not anymore though."
bad,Glad to be out and able to get a job where it is a fair place to work just the way management liked to keep conflict between employees favoritism is no secret  there
bad,These guys have no mechanical aptitude and are just too busy trying to follow some made up code of conduct phony baloney instead of figuring out how  to do something the  correct way.
bad,"Management is merely there to babysit. Management needs to actually learn what it means to run a production line. "
bad,You were expected to do as told and were not allowed to be your own person. Management did not appreciate workers who contributed. It was truly not a good place to work. Employees were never valued for their contribution.
bad,"Caterpillar doesn't care about its employees. The rate of layoffs is astounding. No one really feels secure in their job. Also, Caterpillar is severely outdated. Competitors are updating their technology, their whole way of doing things (allowing more people to work remotely for one) while Caterpillar is very behind."
bad,"-strenuous on body , conditions unkept "
bad,"Please keep in mind, this was a few years ago and things may have changed."
bad,"Mandatory overtime due to reasons beyond your control.  Poor order management, unrealistic production schedules."
bad,Come Christmas time you gotta watch yourself because that's when they cut cost... which means they can cut you.  They are big on safety though.  Plenty of overtime. Managers are pretty cocky and snooty.
bad,"Caterpillar is a place where you are trained to handle all forms of work. with Cat experience as a global village, you can work anywhere  in the world  i recommend Cat to upcoming youths. because their is a learning ground. where you  a get a multicultural system. in terms of on job training,  Caterpillar is a place where you can gain the following experiences: High sense of commitment, Diligence and Strong motivating ability.Fast in learning, Highly resourceful, full of initiatives and easily challenged to fully utilize the potential within me for making significant contributions and changes,Ability to meet job deadline and targets, Strong leadership qualities and full of goal achieving drives. and also training are not ruled out."
bad,"The company was great for me for most of my nearly 39 years.  Now, the culture has changed on short term focus, and poor employee support and engagement."
bad,Working for this company was ok to a point. All the inter politics and managerial bulling was to much. Overall the job itself was steady and not that hard.
bad,There is a reason they are fighting a 2.6 billion dollar tax evasion fine...Unethical even though they stress ethics and living by their code of conduct. Just don't.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Currently not good, for what has been a great company for many years.  Good history, now downsizing and selling off products and divisions. Would not recommend for my child or friend to work there."
bad,Caterpillar is on a downward spiral and have been letting thousands of employees go. They are outsourcing every possible position they can to save money and not have to pay benefits or salaries to American Workers.
bad,"Company is only interested in the profit - moving product into a politically unstable environment rather than continue to manufacture in America."
bad,"Great products, significant outsourcing to China. Enjoy working with manufacturing team and customer service. Products are diverse and funding is challenged."
bad,"They used to be a good company.  Pay was good, benefits were excellent.  Now, their management is lowering the pay and benefits to 'industry standards'.  Management are now FAR too scared about 'industry standard' pricing of their stocks to take care of their employees any more.  Notice the irony there, so they are reaping what they sowed.  Ha."
bad,There are to many people trying to run the same department. Not enough regular workers. No team(s) it is all about the person themselves.
bad,Corporate greed is ruining what was once a great company. It's a shame that they don't value their employees or the work that they do.
bad,They lay off everyone so it's a nice place to get quick money for the time being. There is no where you can move up in the company.
bad,Managers were rotated frequently. Unqualified employees were promoted to positions they should never have had. Constant company/union strife. There was always a sense of layoff or plant closing. The company doesn't stand by their own rules and decisions. Headcount loss is part of the CAT Production System; the CEO and his minions get raises and bonuses when people are laid off.
bad,"the department I work in is the best out of all the others because we get our work done and pride our selfs in our work"
bad,Great place to work if you do not have any expectations for advancement. Management has high expectations for production workers without providing the necessary equipment to always do the job safely. Management has no sense of cost management except to temporarily lay off relatively large portions of their workforce.
bad,"To many lies to trust anyone above the team lead position. job was very boring, when i started there they told us there would be many level 3 positions open for bid but after nine months there were none and after 10 months they didn't lay us off they separated us permanently. with two weeks notice and not much more than a kick in the seat for our troubles"
bad,"Day starts with a meeting on what needs to be finished an what need to get out. I have learned a lot about hydraulics, ordering parts, team work. All the management can depend on me to do what they ask of me and more. I work very well with others love being part of a team and also am able to be left alone and get the job done. The hardest part is waiting on parts that is out of your control. The most enjoyable part is taking something that does not work and making it work better then expected."
bad,Busy work schedule with challenging projects and deadlines. some of the people are good and fun to work with. Its challenging to be a change agent in the company with a top down work culture. But there is lot to learn.
bad,i work with a lot of good people my crew all work together. management need improvement.
bad,No real concerns for the employees. Too long a shift and no home time
bad,alright place to work. clean warehouse nice people. equipment was still new when I worked there.
bad,"I was paying union dues, but not getting union coverage.  This was to last for 2 full years before I would be made a full member of the union.  Employees would come to work drunk and get fired, yet the union would get them their jobs back as well as pay for the duration of the time they were off.  Management was a mess.  Upper management seemed unaware of realistic expectations for production.  Managers and supervisor didn't want to listen to suggestions, or give opportunities to young employees.  Would not recommend anyone working for Caterpillar.  Horrible job culture.  Most employees I worked with despised their supervisors, and would take as long as possible to perform certain jobs so it cost the company more money than it should."
bad,I enjoyed Caterpillar for the most part. I was there as a supplemental worker and I really liked being able to learn different assembly lines it made the job interesting and not quick to become boring. Co-workers made training fun and they were very helpful and patient. The hardest part of the job was learning the names and numbers of the parts that's needed to assemble everything.
bad,"a typical day of work consits of a start up meeting followed by stretching and then to your roll over to weld large mining truck frames. not much fabrication required as everything is tacked up in fixtures. i've learned how to refine my welding skills to their finest point. for a company of this size, they are mismanaged at almost every level. never seen a company that can't get parts monday thru friday, but always seems to have them on saturday.the hardest part of the job is being on an off shift for 5-7 years before getting to a day shift that dose half the required work.the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the quality and quanity of my work is better than those that have been there for 30 years or more."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Caterpillar started off being a promising company but as a began working there I realized that their values towards their employees were the same as those at sweat shops. We do large amounts of work and are treated as if we do not exist.
bad,Buenas experiencias en el área de trabajo y buen aprendizaje
bad,There's way better jobs around that pay more. This place blows. They don't care about their employees. You're easily replaced. They need to pay their employees more.
bad,Long hours 50-60 hrs a week for low pay and no recognition . Management doesn't know what there doing. They promote people that have zero knowledge or experience and then overlook people with skills.  Conditions are rough it way too hot in summer and freezing cold in winter.
bad,You go in thinking your going to make alot of money. But in reality you make average pay you just have to work ALOT of overtime to even bring home enough. NOT WHAT IT IS CUT OUT TO BE.
bad,Management tells you what you want to hear and then goes on doing the exact opposite  the company will lay you off when it’s convenient for them and move you around to other departments and cut your pay  they don’t care about you  you are just a number
bad,"I didn't ask enough questions to do my job to the best of my best, so I was let go from the job, I would tell you to ask every question that you can, I was worried that I was bothering them to much to ask"
bad,"a lot of meetings - not all value added"
bad,"CAT is the business model champion of temp worker firings the day before conversions to company employee.  If you want ANY SORT of job security, don't look here. I was converted within 5 months but still had no job security and was eventually laid off with ""call back rights.""  Avoid this company if you want long term employment."
bad,"Overall, learned a lot from working there since Caterpillar has many different types of hardware/software to work with but their 2nd/3rd level IT was impossible to work with and they consistently uploaded patches to overall systems that would break said systems on a constant basis. The management also removed a lot of the autonomy we had to operate and micro-managed us to the point where we were no longer allowed to leave our desks unless we had to use the bathroom."
bad,"If you would like to waste your time with fat overpaid rat managers that their employees like pets and have a fair monitoring their employees. I would never suggest wasting your time with them. If you want to really make money with the service you provide for a company do go elsewhere. I had seen a company like this before in Virginia the condescend people in the interview process make them believe things then they process their own hard earned money and energy to get out to these companies to work and the fat cats play their little childish ""company management games"" STAY AWAY at all costs."
bad,is an ok place to work if can't find any thing else i guess. Seems most every one that works there is dissatisfied. Unbearable working conditions! union just takes your money. Extremely out of touch management
bad,Working at caterpillar wasn’t something I was excited to do. It wasn’t a bad job but it also wasn’t something a person could be happy with going back.
bad,"The facility where I worked is corrupt. Your constantly working overtime, which is great for somebody who wants that consistency but for me I have a healthy and happy life outside of Cat."
bad,good location fun equipment trained to  run  a lift truck and got  to explore large machines their  working and function...………………………………………………………………...
bad,"Provided electrical wiring in a manufacturing/production environment; Responsibilities included but were not limited to performing subpanel layouts, drill and tap holes, wiring of sub-panels, door devices and other power equipment, wiring using wire way and loom, wire bundles without the use of loom or wire way referred to as free-bundling, wiring of  relay circuits and performed daisy chaining with most common wires in drawings,  performed mechanical assembly on switchgear/switchboard, mounting all pertinent equipment.  Provided advanced work with wiring diagrams, Harness Assembly Drawings (HADs), Wire Harness Masters (WHMs) and specialty cables to include build-up techniques, tooling and test equipment."
bad,The whole warehouse environment was absolutely unsafe and the management is absentee to say the least there is no work coordinating at all and the wages are poor
bad,"Cut throat environment,  If you were not office personal they would treat you different,  Pay was horrible cant raise a family with an assembler pay working for cat.  Taking all those dangerous risk with any thing can happen at any time"
bad,Never work there! Ever? It started out wonderfully. Then for some strange reason the atmosphere changed. Filled with thick racism and negativity. Be careful if you do decide this is the place for you.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Was here for a year and it was a year too long. Management was very demanding, which isnt bad, but even if you did exactly what was needed, they would still find something wrong you did. More complaints than compliments. BS safety rules that nobody really followed"
bad,Employees are pushed constantly to go faster and make more money. Management changes almost daily. New rules are routine and change constantly. Management style is reactive not proactive. Everyone is just a number in the system. Management is poor but employees are very nice and great to work around. Very stressful work environment when it comes to rules and management.
bad,"The location of this particular location is working against this otherwise good company to work for.  Since the people who work in this area are less educated and less experienced, those who have previous experience, particularly factory experience, are not in a comfortable work environment."
bad,this place is to learn mechanics and how the big tractors excavators work. learn how to drive them. and work in a manufacture position.
bad,although the company did place me with a job quickly the experience was not a enjoyable one.  for all the we are behind you and we are here to help you they do not go to bat for their employee's.
bad,"Promotions based on whose colon you gave a hickey. Managers are a joke, they received their positions due to time with company verses talent. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to work here."
bad,"Poor management, no real leadership, to much favoritism which cause a lot of people a lot of stress, I would not recommend this place to other people because mostly management"
bad,"Days were long, the work was hard, the people suck, but the money and benefits were great. Mandatory overtime is required, almost every weekend. Management expects a lot out of you."
bad,Ever changing pay and benefit plans that hurt the employees.  Lack of job security and advancement for all but a select few.  Accountants and HR are running the company into the ground.  Lack of clear leadership.
bad,The job is very high paced with little pay advancement for the required work. The company doesn't value employees when i first started i had a much higher view of the company than the reality.
bad,"What was once the best job in the area, is no longer. Every year something else is taken away. Expected to pretty much live there. They do not care that you have a family. Managers are moved around so much they barely know where going on."
bad,"When you work for a big corporation you learn that no matter what you do, you always going to be just a number."
bad,"Management always over your shoulder, and a lot of empty promises. Constantly building up stock to make layoffs. Pretty low morale all around, including veteran employees."
bad,"I spent 11 years at caterpillar, my first 2 years were contract and you used to be contract for 2 to 2 1/2 years and then get an opportunity  to go company. Today contract employees are more secure then company. I enjoyed the experience I gained with the job and gained many skills."
bad,"Caterpillar's management is in a cost savings state of mind.  Therefore, job stability and advancements are not possible at this time.  Also, most of the IS jobs in East Peoria will be moved out of state and will be filled with consultant employees."
bad,"A typical day at work was very simple, repetitive and in some cases dangerous. I learned proper technique as a Forklift driver i also learn certain and important aspects of logistics. Management was still fresh. My co-workers was wonderful."
bad,"The work was very repetitive and automated - i became bored."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Not really an ok place to work. i would not recommend this place to work. Not a transparent facility. Favoritism is heavily practiced by management. If you were on night shift like i was...then it was almost as if you were forgotten. every aspect of your repairs made on your shift, even though correct and solid, was second guessed by day shift and redone. Management in Maintenance was atrocious, led by an inexperienced manager that second guessed his supervisors and heavily practiced favoritism between a few employees giving them preference of hours with working overtime instead of being fair and spreading it across the department. Advancement was a joke and not there. No training plan or evidence of company providing any type of training."
bad,Must say my supervisor was really good to teach me all the work and guided me to choose the correct path and this is where I am now
bad,"Was once a great company with strong corporate IT leadership.  After three different CIO's in four years, currently lacking sound IT leadership.  Currently going through massive downsizing.  IT directors made decisions who to keep and cut without even asking input from senior managers who knew skills of staff.  Nepotism played a larger role in determining who would keep their jobs than performance and competence."
bad,not sure if any company out there is really concerned about its employees but I'm willing to look and move from Illinois to find it.
bad,"My least favorite job, because the wages does not match the job i was doing. The work was difficult and very understaffed."
bad,They hire you send you to school keep you 6months then lay you off it was such a waste of time to even go through the process i would not work for them again
bad,the only thing good about caterpillar is the co workers you get to meet. I will say I did have a couple of nice supervisors.
bad,"Advancement didn't exist and the turn over rate was threw the roof. This company had just started and a lot of this where not in place and it took time. The pay was not as good, and people like me maxed out with the first 2 years. My job description was very hard and was mostly what they had to do that day or where they needed help."
bad,I try to come to work everyday looking forward to a productive day .I concentrate on the job at hand and enjoy good relationships with all the people I come in contact with.
bad,Not a bad company but there are others better at dealing with employees needs and priorities.  The company is very old and very rigid so there is very little interest in its management to make the company fun to work for.  Basically it's a job you do every day..
bad,Too many levels of management make getting things done in a timely manner difficult and being recognized for accomplishments even more difficult.
bad,"CAT hired me on, trained me for three weeks, worked me for 4 months, and laid me off. There is no job security here. Even some of the multi-year veterans got the cold boot. They have worked a loophole in with the union in the form of hiring ""supplemental"" workers. As a supplemental, I did not get full benefits, I was subject to layoffs with no warning, no severance, and no call back, and I paid union dues with no representation and had absolutely no voice here. CAT is largely moving overseas and does not seem to care about the American worker any more. If you want a stable and secure job with the means of buying your own home and raising a family, this is not a good choice. Consider your time at this company temporary and prepare your unemployment paperwork now. Also, some of the lower management was poor. Some of these guys had no knowledge of the machines I was operating, acted like they had no manufacturing experience at all, and seemed generally out of place in that environment. The only benefit from my time here was the job-specific training I received to become a CNC specialist. This is something you can take with you and it looks good on a resume."
bad,"Safety meetings and daily job assignments are reviewed at the beginning of each shift. You need to work and keep your opinions to yourself if you want to advance or get pay increases. The corporate culture is presented, but is not followed. Co-workers are easy to work with, as most employees keep focused on staying busy. The job can and does get difficult if you have ideas that are above your pay grade. The best part about Caterpillar re-man in West Fargo North Dakota are the uniforms they provide, as it is very dirty."
bad,"I learned an awful lot about the Taleo system and was involved in:"
bad,"I cannot answer this question.  As to Bucyrus, the company was fantastic and I looked forward to work every day.  It was hard work but working with other people was a great experience."
bad,"The job is a good job but the management is bias to certain people. they show favortism and only promote those they favor. I leaned how to use hand tools and how to drive skidsteers. Most of my co-workers worked together well and we were like a family. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management and keeping up your speed for 10hrs a day. I liked the job and my co-workers it would be a good place to work, if they would just get better managment."
bad,Working for caterpillar just made your days seem worse than if you chose not to go there. It was referred to as walking into prison for at least your 8 hr shift if not 10 since they forced you to be there. Management was poor in my area and his manager did not seem to care so management is highly lacking.
bad,decent place to work. work is not hard to do. very safety oriented
bad,I was responsible for the day-to-day schedule of the GM in addition to the visitors' experience and the employee communications. The reason I put the review summary as such is because of my personal experience with one member of upper management. I don't believe this organization is as it represents itself to be and the environment I was expected to excel in made it impossible for me to do so.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,Cat well I dont even know what to say. Its a good place to work sometimes but other times its not good.
bad,"As a cat employee I feel I a not paid as well as I should be for the type of work I do, The manageent teams do not have all employees doing equal amounts of work, for example, some employees only do half of the required work and they do not get diciplined for it and others are expected to pik up the slack."
bad,"Picking part's none stop, you learn how to be safe, management really don't treat you like a person, co-workers are friendly but shouln't get to close. Everydays was a new mission, I enjoyed the money."
bad,"Double standards, unfair hiring practices, mediocre pay, outdated equipment, unfriendly work environment, weak union representation, you're just a number to them. If you really need a job then apply now, its better than starving, but not by much."
bad,"Caterpillar Logistics Clayton is a production 1st plant. Don't be fooled by the rhetoric about ""Safety 1st Culture"". I was there for nearly 8 years and watched the job change for the worst. The favoritism is rampant. If an employee is a pet of a supervisor, that employee will not have to worry about production quotas. If you don't hit your quota, you are out the door. This causes people to cut corners and work products out of FIFO(First in First Out). Everyone is looking for the easiest parts to run with the largest quantity. Meanwhile, parts go out of standard and customers consistently receive orders late! I only worked in the Inbound Processing Center. The other two departments could be different."
bad,"Loved my job and colleagues, but trainers and managers will stab you in the back at will. I was let go because of machine failure even though I told my team lead there was something wrong with the machine from the beginning of my shift. They like to say ""it's always done this...get used to it""."
bad,Caterpillar is a world known brand that is active all over the world and provides employment careers any where in the world. You can see there machine practically everywhere you go.
bad,Good ole boy atmosphere and hard to advance although coming on board with years of manufacturing experience. Good coworkers but they start most as temps.
bad,"I was with Caterpillar for a little over fourteen years. It's a job that pays the bills. If you need the extra money, you have to work a lot of overtime. 12 to 14 hours a day plus the weekend. "
bad,Great job for someone who is early on in their career. Not suitable for those wanting growth and opportunity. Complete disconnect between management and hourly. Extreme micromanagement. Lack of understanding of employees personal life. Overall a pretty mundane job that results in stagnant burnout.
bad,Major lack of communication amongst staff. Overtime was only given to the favorites. No room for advancement nor time for training. Management doesn't know how to communicate properly (they withhold information for their own benefits)
bad,This place is not for everyone. The turn over rate is ridiculous and they do not care. Management needs more conflict resolution training. It's not very diverse and HR department is no good. Worker are encouraged to apply for new positions even though management already has chosen a person for the job.
bad,building tractors from the ground up learning how to put fuel tanks and wiring and transmissions and seals and o rings just a interesting job.Great place to learn about tractors
bad,"Very hard to rate because they use Temp workers from an agency (the one I was with) to fill the roles of entry level positions. Said agency takes a large cut of what Caterpillar pays out for your work. It then takes on average over one year or more before Caterpillar's HR department decides if they want to offer you a direct full-time position with their benefits. They were quick to offer any Overtime shifts/hours to the Temp workers because it cost them less than paying the full-time employees Busted my butt, working third shift, (and covering other shifts when their own employees would refuse them) only for them to let me go because I was a few minutes late reporting to work (while sick I might add)."
bad,"A typical work day (IS related) is demanding and very competitive.  Experience a high hiring turn around hindering team work. Bureaucracy and redundant process improvement initiatives slows productivity and efficiency.  Changing work culture and corporate values have become more political centric.  Emphasis on providing short term solutions.  Promotional opportunities are slow, limited, and partisan.  Gaps of communication exists between management and employees.   Offers external training courses to acquire or increase job skills and tuition assistance for obtaining degrees.  Significant intellectual knowledge resources left the company without a succession plan in place or complete transitional training passed on."
bad,"I could never seem to get hire in from temp service and if they dont like you they will try to find anything paddy on you to let you go and has nothing to do with your job preference, over time volunteer hours you put in and so forth.. If the Big Men over this company knew how they really do ppl I don't believe they will like it because they want ppl long term and reliable instead of not beening able to keep people."
bad,"Lots of wonderful people working at Caterpillar however, management seems intent on wrecking the place. Constant changes in processes, contant meeting for no purpose, suggestions made by workers very rarely taken seriously."
bad,I love working there at caterpillar fun place to work the people you work with are good people you learn alot from working there and to add to your resume I loved to finally see an learn how those tractors are built and put together but it like they use you for work untill they don't need you anymore they pay is outstanding that how they get your attention but it just not promise now I see why people say you can't pay me enough to go back an work there
bad,It's a job at some point. The culture focus on friends and family. Management was all a bunch of friends or family members just collecting checks. No one knew anything about logistic or operations.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"Great people there,nobody last long the team,leader I had was,racist and the coach was young and,just wanted to sleep with pretty,girls very 2 faces i,loved the job,but was a waist of time they treat there temps like garbage"
bad,"it was ok ....but some supervisors took it to the extreme....going overboard ,,,,abusing there authority....I went to my immediate supervisor and told him the info and I started getting watched...."
bad,"Benefits are ok typical 80/20. Management will not verbally say it, (legal) but you have better work 50+ hours a week minimum or you will not last long. Caterpillar is still the good old boys club, so be sure to suck up every chance you get."
bad,management is garbage place was great to work but now it is not great company preaches that it cares about the employee and that is not the case they are always looking for a way to teminate the employee
bad,Many employees work in fear of their employment ending so they will do whatever it takes to cover themselves and make others around them look bad. This created a negative work environment.
bad,They bring you in on their in-house temp service. They dangle 'full time' employment in front of you but that might take over a year of you working 50 hours a week with mandatory overtime without warning. If you have no life its good for you.
bad,"A workplace without a future. Workforce has been reduced from several thousand to less than 150! I expect that trend to continue until they no longer operate in South Milwaukee, WI. It's a dangerous work environment with very heavy parts and equipment. It's good pay for the short term, but don't expect to be able to retire from their."
bad,Caterpillar is going through hard times within the IT space.  Political correctness has subverted common sense.  Knowledgeable leaders are uncommon as they cannot justify multi billion dollar efforts such as migrating to SAP.  Nor can they justify spending millions on consultants promising 100 day results when they have yet to produce any results 2 years later...good thing Cat is not a technology company.
bad,"Si bien es una gran empresa multinacional, los chilenos nos especializamos en arruinar grandes cosas, y aquí hay un gran ejemplo. Gerentes y subgerentes chilenos de algunos departamentos que te obligan a firmar un documento para renunciar a derechos laborales básicos, quieren hacerte trabajar bajo el artículo 22 sin cumplir ningún requisito para que te lo apliquen, maltrato laboral, jornadas extremadamente largas (18 horas al día), es cosa de que vean en la inspección del trabajo las quejas qué hay por el departamento de servicio al cliente."
bad,"Not to recommend as jobs are not stable."
bad,Poor overall leadership and inflexibility has led to the closure of several plants.  Poor forecasting led to poor investments.  There was a push to hire outside people for leadership positions instead of promoting from within.
bad,"Caterpillar has a good work/life balance. They offer a good compensation/benefits package and the company matches 6% in the 401k. But the biggest drawback is the sales/revenues have been declining for four consecutive years in a row, so for millennials like me who want to step up in their career..there are hardly any opportunities for personal or professional growth. The company has laid off over thousand employees since last year(2016), so there is hardly any job security. Although I hear a lot of people say, if you stay with the company long enough in this downturn, you'll be surely rewarded at the end."
bad,"Caterpillar tells you everything you want to hear coming in the door and delivers ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. "
bad,"High paced and constantly changing.  "
bad,"A typical day - involves fixing issues that everyone else creates and trying to get people to understand basic common sense knowledge."
bad,"Managers of all level behavior just like the moment right before Titanic sunk, take advantage of their power in hand large or small, and get rid of those they do not like and keep their buddies regardless they can/will do the job or not. The current situation allows those managers to behavior like this openly and legitimately without worry about any ethic rules. Nobody care!"
bad,The company has changed a lot in my years of employment. The senior management all seem to be budget gridlocked. Just a grind on today's bottom line. There just doesn't seem to be that can do attitude versus surviving ongoing force reductions. There just doesn't seem to be long term strategies to deal with making the company a strategically better company.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,I worked for CAT during one of the worst times financially in history.   My review wouldn't be fair in relation to the many years the company thrived.  I will say that currently I would not consider working for another CAT.
bad,"This organization has squeezed on the employees for way to long.  For most employees the work life balance is poor, expecting employees to work all hours of the day will continual reductions in the work force."
bad,"At anytime your job can be removed. Uncertainty about the future. Poor Upper Level Management. Not much to do in Peoria, IL."
bad,"une bonne entreprise dommage quelle est fermée."
bad,The work at Caterpillar is not really all that difficult. But the overall management people skills are lacking and they take a toll on individuals.
bad,"There is nothing hard about this job it just take so long to get hired on"
bad,"The people are great, good environment. Faced paced, enjoy working with others."
bad,"I had great supervisor and meeting people and helping my co-workers were the highlight of the job. Everyday was different but fun at times, but the hardest part of the day was down time. I learned a lot in the management side of the businesses. Team lead, safety champion, Green belt training."
bad,"(Perkins)"
bad,"great pay, learned alot about assembler, mechanical work, painting, hard working off shifts with a family, great health insurance, all in all a great place to work when there is work and not having to deal with numerous lay offs"
bad,"Busy and productive, but lacked supervision and support during overloaded orders to support assembly lines."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work, most of these good reviews are all management, and being as they spend more time in meeting's in an air conditioned office and very little time on the shop floor i guess i could see the 4 star rating's."
bad,North Dakota Catapiller has a long ways to go you upset the wrong person they can fire you on the spot. While working there for almost 3 years I saw at the least 12 people get fired for various things. This is not a stable enviroment to work. There is even a term amongst the employees called Hatchet Thursdays. The Managment can do what ever they want when they want and throw some bull at you when you do something they do no not like. I would not reccomend Caterpiller North Dakota to anyone ever. They underpay you; they are one of the lowest paying production plants in and around Fargo ND.
bad,The hardest part of my job is the physical labor .The most enjoyable part of my work is the quality that cat puts into there products and being apart of that on a day to day basis Im simply not fashioned for this kind of work.
bad,Rules are applied one sided  what applies for non management does not equally apply to management unfair culture. I was let go for somethings  I've  seen managers doing on a daily basis ( using company computer during work hours) I've seen coworkers chastised for conversing during work time while managers do it freely with no repercussions because that is no one their superior there to keep them in check.
bad,"A empresa é ótima, mas quem administra o time de produção geralmente são parciais a quem eles tem mais afinidade."
bad,"Typical day is 6 to 6"
bad,"When I worked here I felt like the pay wasn’t there for what I was doing. I did more than what they would pay me for and after a while, I had gotten tired of them taking advantage of me."
bad,"I liked working at caterpillar for the first year but after we caught up on the build being behind from Harvey things started going down. They cut all overtime, cut back than less that 40 hr work weeks and were looking for any reason to let go of people."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"During my eight years, I saw a lot of division at Caterpillar; management versus assemblers. There was an unhappiness that seemed to permeate throughout. I worked under some terrific managers, and alongside some amazing assemblers, but my skills in the admin/clerical/education field were not utilized."
bad,If you want to advance plan on kissing the managers butt. The manager watches out for his friends.The buddy system runs this company. With unfair reviews
bad,"I liked working at Caterpillar, I had the opportunity to do a lot patient teaching and had the opportunity to work autonomously and was able to come up with my own ideas on how to present the information to all the workers."
bad,"Typical day would be assembling, fixing and ordering parts for bulldozers. Learned a lot about engines, bulldozers, and pipelayers. Management was very unprofessional. Work place culture I would say much like a high school. Most enjoyable thing about working there was operating the equipment and working the repair floor."
bad,"Cat can be an okay place to work, but the management (especially beginning around 2015) is extremely out-of-touch and vindictive.  I and other employees have been illegally targeted, and the company's current strategy developed by the CEO is focused solely on profits.  Cat preaches safety, but there's a lack of follow-up on actual issues putting employees at risk.  It could be okay to pay the bills, but I wouldn't recommend it long-term."
bad,"It’s not how we’ll you do your job, it’s who you sit beside of at lunch and where you sit in the lunchroom. If you sit at the right table, you get to move up."
bad,My Training in Allied CAT Engineering & Services Ltd Lahore (CATERPILLAR) Company has provided me with a solid base and broad understanding of industry operations and practice.
bad,"The hours were very long, and the wage achieved did not compensate for the length of time being there. All in all, an unsatisfactory experience of employment. That said, some really good people work there."
bad,"I am always applying for a job or internship in the company but they always telling me i am not qualify. But they gave job to someone that i trained in the company, they are in favour of native then foreigners."
bad,The people are great to work with.  The work / life balance is good.  Job security is always a question even for high performers.  The executives chase the quarterly stock price at the expense of employees.
bad,"Many people sent packing after decades of working there.  Many like me with 15+ years working there terminated due to poor management style expecting that the number of resources in the division were unnecessarily high.  Now paying contract workers to come in at 1/3 the cost to do our jobs.  Thankfully President Trump is trying to change that back to US Citizens doing the work and not undercutting the US worker.  Salaries are the number one component preventing businesses from exceeding their stock market analysts estimates, and many companies are being pressured to reduce resources to meet expectations."
bad,There is no room for advancement  here at this company. Management does not recommend  any job openings to the employees or try to put in a good word for them. They try to keep good agency workers  from getting a full time position with the company to satisfy their own selfish needs.
bad,"Poor Upper Management- they say they have an open door policy, but they do not; Pay not equal to work- I was hired to do one job and ended up doing 100 times more; Stealing American Jobs over to India-because of Poor Upper Management lies, deception, and dishonor was prevalent. I saved the company 1000's of dollars and their thanks was to let some Indian guy steal my project and end my contract;"
bad,Don't Appeciate hard worker just do you anykind of way works you unlimited days with no days off just unfair I think if they would listen to their employees they would be a better company stop letting people that don't want to work get over on the hard and dedicated worker until then they will have a huge turn over rating.
bad,"Caterpillar is undergoing stressful times due to loss of business, and the effects filter down to the rank and file manufacturing employees. Most employees haven't seen a pay raise in years while the company continues to push them hard for increased productivity and longer work hours. The general attitude at the company is bad and getting worse."
bad,Been working here for 17yrs. There is nothing really I would like to say about this company at this time. Maybe later I would reply back with an overall review
bad,Culture has totally changed. No longer the great organization it once was. Successively large cuts in personnel have really hurt morale for those left.
bad,"Excepted buy out plan to retire, right decision since they announced plant closure one year later. Discusded that in 2011 took away pension for salaried employees that hired in after 2005 without any thought of time served or age,  401k is time based , also those of us that said we would go back to the shop were told no,it would not be allowed, what kind of a company does something like this. And putting employees so far behind stockholders is not a good recipe, working with shop floor employees that hated Caterpillar is not only difficult ,but unnecessary."
bad,"As I was both contract and internal at CAT, I will say I worked through some hard times for the company.  It was a bad environment to always be looking over your shoulder and waiting for your day to be let go and then be in hopes for them to call you back on your 2 month lay off.  Needless to say, of the thousands who have been laid off in the last year in central Illinois alone, I know of a handful that have been brought back."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"No upward mobility without a degree. No tuition reimbursement with BCP division so the company is not willing to invest in their employees and retain them.  You are hired to do one job. There is no organized career path. HR is completely unapproachable. Managers work scared if they speak up or challenge anything they will get fired. If you are not part of the 'good ole boy system' then you are on the 'outside'.  Unfortunately, some of the best employees they have had thus far have all left for better opportunities elsewhere."
bad,Senior leadership has put stock price before welfare of people...building are old & outdated...not sure how they are going to retain talent or recruit young people....feels like OLD MAN COMAPNY and is slowly dying
bad,"Compensation and/or pipe-dreams is what keeps people at Caterpillar.  A typical day can consist of working your tail off to achieve your goals for the company, or just sitting in a cubicle doing nothing... and management will see both of those the same way.  Leadership does not recognize the performers.  If they didn't pay well, all the talent would leave in a heartbeat.  Atmosphere is political and dated. Majority of people in management are not proud of their position... and work day-in and day-out with a bad attitude because no one really wants to be there.  Decent growth potential, depending on how sales are at the time."
bad,"CAT pays well, but you never know when upper management will decide to remove, relocate, or transition your position.  Even as an engineer for 7 years, there is no job security.  There are plenty of people with 15+ years of CAT engineering experience who have been eliminated on a whim.  There are a number of stories where a facility was closing, so they found a new CAT job and relocated to a new city to keep their job.  Two weeks later, there were major cuts again, and they were let go again.  In Milwaukee we are being forced to move to Arizona and given 1-2 years to relocate.  If we do not relocate, we are let go.  Bucyrus which is now CAT was in Milwaukee for over 100 YEARS and is now moving to AZ for things that only makes sense to upper-upper management I guess!  CAT is a cyclical company, every cycle they say that they are going have a core group of employees, when times are good they hire contract workers, when times are poor they keep the core group and restrict contract workers.  I have yet to see this occur.  "
bad,"It's not a good time to work at caterpillar, with all the reductions in the job work force.  I would recommend looking elsewhere, projections for the next year are low and Cat has plans to move things to Mexico."
bad,"Great co-workers, mid management tries very hard with ever changing goals from the top and very restricted and dwindling resources. Pay is respectable but jobs are being downgraded to lower salaries."
bad,"Nice company to work. Good compensation. But no job security."
bad,there are good managers and bad managers filling in Cat. Bad ones can make up story to get rid of employee. HR helps them to avoid to be punished.
bad,The trend to just one product has risk that is passed on to the employee. The endless moving to find the best TAX deal makes it like working for a circus. 3 or 5 years at best.
bad,When I first started working for Caterpillar I told everybody I met that I worked at Caterpillar. After about 2 months I didn't care who knew I worked there. When you are a manager or a plant manager its smart to at least know the job or jobs it takes to run a successful operation. Well not at Caterpillar. If you don't fit in with the good ole boys then they will weed you out eventually.
bad,"With a work day starting at 6 am sharp, you start out with a 5-7 min morning meeting, after which you'll be moving full speed all day, with only one 20 min paid lunch. Building heavy machinery according to blue print and standard work procedure, building your own sub-assemblies there is always work to be done. "
bad,I've been involved in two indefinite layoffs and three temporary layoffs in the past nine years. Its a very immoral way of doing business. People are being laid off and the CEO receives a raise and big bonus. Very Immoral!
bad,"No raises for the last 10 years, overtime taken away, and no room for advancement within your job title. I have learned alot about supply chain, material procurement, and dock receiving and shipping."
bad,"company was good learnt a lot on machines of diffrent make of diffrent countries ,& met lot diffrent country people learnt diffrent langauges ,weather conditions were good & bad also ,its ok aftre all wel & good,"
bad,"Ok but the union and company were always battling, hostile environment!"
bad,My responsibilities changed from one day to the next. The market of the industry is very unstable.
bad,"Many new supervisors lack experience to properly and safely run their lines, they do not comprehend how a tractor works to make calls on assembly or quality. Many have a cut throat attitude and blame others for their mistakes or lack of work efforts to save their own jobs and fire innocent people. There are some great people as well that I loved to work with, most of them have retired or were let go during the recession.I guess with any place you will have your positive people with high integrity and you will have the others that got the job because of political ties and no knowledge or people or assembly or communication skills. Many of the new generation of employees lack values and morals and while I embrace Diversity, I do not care for the lack of work ethic nor lack of respect many have for people or property. I guess thats why they end up having to call back retired people for help because out with the old and in with the new didn't quite work out."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"New management style propaganda introduced yearly and never actually followed. Employee survey participation strongly encouraged and results ignored. The Forest Products business unit has never maintained profitability and never will. Integrity of safety program is abominable to the point of fear to report. International cultures in factories abroad are embraced and success follows, however southern culture is scoffed at and ridiculed creating adversarial environment."
bad,"Poor Leadership, Go elsewhere.  Management is unqualified.  Goodl ol boy mentality.  oftentimes goals are set too high and not realistic.  Accountability not equally held - Favoritism.  Not worth the stress and headache.  Go work somewhere else."
bad,"You will gain experience in all things Logistics and while advancement is advertised it is often difficult to obtain within the plant."
bad,"They employ management/supervisors with vendettas against the workers."
bad,"continued progress daily, 5S program, robotics overall, daily functions with my employees and management. Safety programs and PPE. Assembly Dept. robotics dept."
bad,i felt like management was unrealistic about how many parts could actually picked in an hour and they do not have sufficient training and give mixed messages on what they want from their people .
bad,"the job was super beneficial to my growth as a welder, but overall it was not a very good place to work.  management always seemed unappreciative even if you staid late or worked extra overtime to keep up with production schedule.  as for advancement it always seemed to be a case of who you know not what you know"
bad,This company would be a great company to work for only if they didn't lay their people off every other year. You never know if you'll have a job tomorrow or not.
bad,Management needs help with organizations. Very clean for a warehouse juat need to get organized. Good pay and great benefits. The hoyrs are nice as well.
bad,"Sehr Job unsicher, Amerikanischer Arbeitsweise, Nette Kollegen"
bad,Good for people who are new to welding or would like to do the same thing over and over. Not for people wanting to improve skills.I did not enjoy the lack of leadership in certain areas but they put a heavy emphasis on maintaining safety.
bad,Company will make you a number.  No matter the time you put into it.  The countless hours of unpaid overitme make it a little hard to give a good raiting.
bad,"CAT is a good starting job or those who have no work experience. But not long term, the turn over rate is high and right now cat is ""restructuring"" which means weeding out a lot of people in order to save money. So, if you don't mind working in a fast paced environment with little to no commutation from management and a uncertain future with only one positive factor being pay and benefits and dealing with a lot of egos, then CAT is for you."
bad,A typical day at work for me was the same come in and clock in and start my day of work. I learned how to load and unload parts. The management was good and the co-workers were good as well but one of the hardest this at the job was when someone goes on break and you had to push a part that was over a thousand pounds and the most enjoyable part was finishing the job and then clocking out.
bad,Not a very pleasant place to work. Most of the people I work with were very nice and they were the only thing good about working there. Management was terrible.
bad,I really enjoy my job and the people around me at Caterpillar. I do not agree with the direction of the company or some of the company policies that are taking Caterpillar in the direction it is headed so I am looking to better my self by moving on in a positive manner.
bad,"The work is really basic for 13 pound an hour and the lads are superb. But that where it ends unfortunately the management have ship in and ship out for the past 5 years they will haul as many trucks out of you from january to august  and promise you the world from when you come back that the orders have picked up and its a more stable place with no layoffs this year and have you working your A**E till about august/september and then the agency working lads who work nonstop during this period to be shown the door year in year out, when clearly they have over planned from the beginning of the year, either the management are disillusioned about how good their truck actually is or they plan this every year to save a couple quid on wages over the christmas period and when the lads come back february time after because they start them on the lowest wage again. If you see a position for a welder/fabricator in peterlee at CAT STAY AWAY unless you only need a position for a couple of months ... No matter how hard you work over this period you will not be kept on, no matter what they promise you it is all lies ignore it all.. The core lads don't call it black september for nothing"
bad,I enjoyed the people that I worked with.  Made a lot of new friends that I will have for a lifetime.  I enjoyed doing what I did at caterpillar.  The hardest part was probably the heat in the summer time.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,I have learned alot at Cat about manufacturing and have for the most part a good bunch of co-workers. The hardest part is lay-offs
bad,"No matter what you do, management will never be happy.  During meetings, they give a lot of non-answers.  I wish they would answer questions directly instead of dancing around the subject."
bad,I was a Section Manager over a assembly line that builded genorators. Pay and benefits was good but disciplinary actions was not consistant. I got to travel meet new people and attend some college courses during my time there.
bad,"Work was enjoyable with co-workers, some supervisors need better training to learn how to deal with non-management personnel. Diversity is not a strong suit with Caterpillar and the open door policy gets you walked out for voicing any concerns. Co-workers are afraid of management for fear of being fired for speaking their minds.The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers worked as a team as long as the managers left them to do their job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with negativity."
bad,je préfère évoluer dans une entreprise avoir des résponsabilitées devenir responsable de ligne ou d'atelier ou meme d'équipe!
bad,"You don't want to work there and have an opinion that's contrary to that of upper management, it will only get you in trouble. People are disposable throughout Caterpillar and that's one of the reason profits are up, employment is down - they work your behind off and expect you to take it without any lip or mind of your own."
bad,I did not like the work I was assigned to do. It is a good place to violate your time and get paid for your time there. I do not have any positive thing to talk about the company.
bad,This place lacks good management is very unorganized doesn’t choose good company’s to order they’re parts from so you spend 3 to 4 days a week standing around with nothing to do waiting on parts.  But yet your supposed to look busy!!! Then because they screw up they force 10 and 12 hour days and weekends to make up for they’re mishaps.  The pay is good and if you can ever get converted to full time status employees the benefits are good.   So much drama in they’re it’s like being in high school a lot of lazy people work they’re  not great training or teamwork at all!!
bad,Was a great place to work enjoyed my job there learned alot of new things.. Just felt treated unfairly you pointed me out for your mistakes. When you started paying me i never missed a day other then oversleeping one sat and was 30 min late.
bad,"Not well compensated for the work environment. No opportunity for advancement, corporate office screens applications, so you can be turned down for an internal posting without any feedback or interview."
bad,Caterpillar is a fast growing company the pay and benefits is good and there’s a lot of opportunity for someone to be promoted into a higher position . It is clean and climate controlled .
bad,"I actually work for a subsidiary of Caterpillar, called anchor coupling. I have no issues with anchor coupling. The problem I have is  with Caterpillar. They inadvertently siphoned $66 out of each paycheck for months. After being patient and notifying them of the discrepancy they admitted to taking the money but refused to repay. So I stopped  providing my electrical services i.e. stop going until they paid me. Probably don’t need to say, but  they fired me .  Which is fine because I don’t want to work for someone who doesn’t pay their bills. With this economy on fire, I say it’s their loss. They have a world class maintenance department and they pay around 30% lower than market value."
bad,"I worked at caterpillar for one year exactly, and during my time of employment I was considered an “supplemental employee” which means you make the same wages as a full time employee however you don’t receive any type of benefits. My pregnant girlfriend ended up very sick, and In the hospital, and within that time I wanted to go to the hospital with her, and they told me if I was to take the two days off without being full time I’d be termniated. They definitely do not care about their employees, and you’re just another working ant at the plant. They could let you go and not think twice about it. I don’t recommend this place."
bad,With mother dying and job performance slacking the company had no compassion for what was going on at home of which caused more personal problems. Supervisor was more concerned with looking good for management not caring wether or not his employees succeed or fail.
bad,"I am a contractor to Caterpillar Forest Products in LaGrange, Ga. I work remotely from my home in the Richmond, Va., area. I interface with management and trade media of the forest products industry and provide content to the trade media."
bad,It was a company that did subcontract work for a major manufacturer. My job was basically receiving inspection. There was very little opportunity for advancement or pay raises. Some managers or lead persons did not have a degree nor were they as experienced as the people they managed. The manufacturer shut down and moved operations to other states leaving the contractor out of jobs in the area.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the hands on work. I learned how to work and maintain equipment.  The hardest part of the job was just the hours
bad,This job was ok. Management was rather cynical about company prospects.
bad,It was a buddy system for management. Workplace had some diversity. Hardest part of job was moving tons of pound 3300 diesel heads and engine. Harassment and bullied.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,"ya no es una empresa atractiva, solamente queda el nombre"
bad,"I was very happy to get this job I had struggled financially for years in Ms. Low wages for women, but as a woman a mother I don’t recommend no life work balance"
bad,"Work you Into the ground, Pay you little, no benefits, lie to you about hiring on, poor management. Mandatory overtimes, and then lay offs."
bad,Great place to work if like being belittled by over paid management who have nothing better to do then mess with and threaten employees. Had one good supervisor the rest act like you are a worthless. It's good pay and good benefits but not worth the headache on everyday
bad,"moved quality jobs to mexico. no choice for leaving, unless you wish to be moved to another area on another shift for different pay after being there for over 13 years"
bad,"There is a a lack of long term vision from the top, unless you count ""making more profit"" as a strategic goal.  The company no longer value its employees and many older folks are demoralized and just buying time before they retire at age of 55 (to collect pension)."
bad,"Working Third shift I believe just made the working environment a little more difficult for me. My supervisor was good, he hoped whenever we needed help and was always positive with us and never negetice like the rest of them."
bad,Some of the Management of the company is lacking in their people skills.  I feel that some of their managers will tell you what you want to hear when all you want is the truth.
bad,"Der vorherige Firmenbesitzer Bucyrus war sehr erfolgreich und zukunftssicher. Der Caterpillar mit seinem falschen Prozessen und Umstruktrierungen hat den Arbeitsplatz unsicher, bzw. ohne Zukunft gemacht! Leider!!"
bad,I worked there for 10 years I gained good knowledge of the product. I worked with grate co workers. The down side is management and the lack of advancement
bad,"Manque d'employé,il faudrait plus de formation pour les nouveaux arrivants, équilibrer les salaires ."
bad,"Working in Caterpillar through an agency since September 2015, experienced 4 rounds of lay-off happened and hundreds of people kicked off by company due to the short-vision previous CEO and vice president. Work load is ok, 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. No opportunity currently to be converted from a contractor to a full time employee. Will not recommend any one join this company at this moment."
bad,Job title switched after hire. Was assigned job I did not want with people I did not want to work with. No work life balance. Favoritism throughout the company.
bad,"Caterpillar is a very large company. It is hard to not feel like a number. When times are good for Cat, it's a great place to work. When times and financials get tough for Cat, you might lose your job."
bad,"The workday was not bad, Lots of meetings, taking up a lot of your workday making it difficult to complete your work in an eight hour day, also overtime was not allowed."
bad,"Caterpillar provided me financial assistance on both of my degrees a few years ago. Most of that is gone now. In 22 years, I'm sad to say the work life balance and overall moral is at an all time low."
bad,My typical day at work would be seeing the season's change and meeting new and interesting people on a day to day basis. It was a job and we worked around the clock.
bad,"New managers were hired, and production workers were let go. Asked too much of employees for too little pay, not enough time to perform duties, no over time, no appreciation, and too many women chauvinists."
bad,"Short Breaks, No Proper Recognition. They make promise that they cant keep. We are under paid and if you work out in fabrications building your in for a rude awakening to thought of caterpillar being a good job."
bad,"I am tired of review the same company over and over again, this site makes you do this i don't know why this is my second time reviewing Caterpillar."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
bad,The economy is taking here and over seas causing a lot of lay offs.  Tough to get any type of promotion with so many people that have graduate degrees.
bad,"good work place, great colleagues, "
bad,"Todos los dias son divertidos, nos dan nuestra programacion de cuneros a contar y  cada quien trabaja siempre persiguiendo  mejores objetivos ya sea personales y grupales."
bad,"•	Ensure customer service is of the highest standards at all times. "
bad,"Caterpillar, is an awesome place to work, people, structure etc:  However, I am in a temporary position in the Global Financial area which offers NO permanent position.  I value their business practices as well as the longevity of the company.  I also understand today's economic uncertainty's.  I would like more than anything like to become a permanent full time employee with CAT and I will keep working for towards that goal."
bad,Do your job and try not to advance you wont make a target for yourself. Most supervisors are great but a few that feel threatened if you try and advance to quickly.
bad,Amazing how one company can destroy another company.  Three years ago Caterpillar purchased Bucyrus.  In that time South Milwaukee facility has turned into a negative atmosphere of work.
bad,Great easy going job. Perfect for younger people because the job security isn't strong.
bad,"Upper management had unrealistic idea that people did not want to do a good job.  The majority treated people like a number."
bad,boring no challenges
bad,"A day at work starts off with an approximately ten minute safety meeting, talking about any near miss or injuries that may have occured. After we get dismissed we go to our machines and start the days work. I've learned a couple different things from CAT! My entry level position was deburring parts! After a few months they promoted me to a CNC grinding machine! The job consist of taking off microns of material off a part and polishing after reaching your desired measurements! There are also set ups of the different parts you have to do consisting of changing polish paper or changing out the centers the parts go on also possibly the grinding wheel, along with other general maintence of the machine! The foreman are all amazing! I have nothing but good things to say about them! The people that work there are also very nice! The hardest part of the job I'd say is doing the set ups! The most enjoyable part of the job is for me is making good parts! There is no better feeling then getting a part thats perfect end to end!"
bad,Mantenção simples e fácil!
bad,"I liked working here just not forever. It's like winning the lottery just to get benefits. Hours are okay, but if they need you, prepared to be forced to stay."
bad,Learning process is very slow. Most people are lazy. they start talking about lunch since 8 in the morning and take 1hour of lunch. come late to work and leave early ( only cat employees). Less value of agency peoples. They make agency persons to work hard and make them stay longer ( no overtime). Do reply to your emails or phone calls. terrible place to work. you have to do same thing every day. Managers are nice but you don't get chance to talk to them. they will never find out how much work you do. eventually CAT employee ( hoop team lead) will take credit of all your work. there is a politics is going on everywhere. You will not get any credit of your work.
bad,Ils embauchent ? Car je retournerais bien chez eux.
bad,"Great Benefits, many perks on the job but really needed to work more on integrating things better."
bad,"None of the managers endorce the rules. Every shift is treated differently."
bad,"Working at caterpillar is great they are 100% the right ace to work, great environment, helps if you have a concern or can’t get the job fast correct."
bad,Poor management decisions led to closing of our facility.  My last supervisor could not handle the position and did not handle criticism well.  Even when she ask your opinion.  Our opinion and expertise held no value.   HR was a useless position.  She could not help with any problems or just refused to.  I asked for my final pay stub on several occasions and have never received it.
bad,"My most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work everyday and learning something new, seeing all of my coworkers and working hard together as a team to complete daily task. Being able to Interacting with my supervisor whenever i needed anything or had a problem that needed to be fixed immediately."
bad,Its An Alright Place To Be. I Enjoying the team environment they have.
bad,It was okay I guess job wasnt for me though. Your breaks are short even though they are paid for a 10 hour to almost 12 hour shift. Yeah the people are nice and some are helpful at least.
good,I worked my tail off for them .I went on vacation came back was told I was no longer needed . I was a great employee that worked hard for almost a year. I guess if uper management does not like u for being loved by other worker's and being brown .  Than u can't be part of the team.
good,"Not a bad place to work but not a good place to work at. Definitely a job to get on your feet, then split. They don’t hire internally so good luck...."
good,Worked at cat for a year was promised raises that I never got. Asked about promotions got a stock answer with no results. The management is a joke and treat you like children.
good,"To ensure all material is available for assemblers. Process scrap material, and to return any extra material on the line. Do cycle counts to ensure MRP and MTS match and do adjustments accordingly."
good,Favoritism at its finest. Work is fast and work is slow. Get in trouble for standing around when there is nothing to do when it is slow. Get in trouble for others lying about you to make sure they stay the favorite.  Uniforms are mandatory but seems they hire young kids that only want attention and cause drama and dont take the job seriously.  Worked a year and worked hard but you can't beat the young ones who seem to have some power over the team leads due to the flirting and jealousy over others.  I'll never work there again
good,Start with daily meeting and stretches. Learned more about assembly. Management very  highly stressed. Watching products take shape with teamwork between workers
good,It was an alright job to have to make some money and get by. It takes all of your time with mandatory overtime on the weekends. I worked several weeks straight with no time off.
good,"stress was through the roof. long days and management (in some areas) were very unforgiving. When lay offs came, the axe was quick to fall. not much job safety"
good,"Extremely Repetitive mindless jobs"
good,At this job is there is no suck thing as not having work because there is always something to do somewhere on either line. They expect you to help everyone when possible.
good,"its a great place to work. good benefits and great jobs but management is not the best it could be. no communication skills, lack of concern for own team, never around to help with issues or even care to show up to talk to anyone. poor management skills no doubt."
good,"caterpillar is a decent place to work. it has many great benefits for most employees. I must say that depending what facility you work in, cat could be a good place to work."
good,Management knew and did nothing of the bulling of females by other females.  Safety was a requirement however not inforced by upper management. Confidentiality was non exsistant.
good,"Fast paced worked assembly line, assisted other job duties when needed. Company had benefits once you was hired permanent also provided training for new employees"
good,"Management unstable, working conditions horrible ,no room for advancement, no overtime, no recogntion for hard work and no raises"
good,Hard for advancement and people that work here are from generations of family members.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,not a secure place to work no benefits. always change your schedule
good,The job was great the management is very poor and if you have a life threatening situations going they dont care they will can you. The pay could have also been better.  Overall i wouldnt recommend it
good,Poor Work life balance. Favoritism. No advancement. Good Benefits. Pay Okay. Holidays off. A lot of overtime. Extremely strict. No room for error. Job culture.
good,The job is a fast paced job but easy and repetitive. Management does have high expectations and sometimes unrealistic goals. The coworkers are great and the team work is very supportive. The benefits are good.
good,was let go from work with no explanations and no write up or attendance issues. management would just spy on you at work instead of confronting. low pay.
good,I'd rather not say anything.  I'm bitterly disappointed that Labor Relations is still stuck in the 1930's.  If your self esteem is so low that you can endure being treated like a indentured servant. you might fit
good,"I gained a lot of training and experience while I was with Caterpillar. I originally hired in under Bucyrus and Caterpillar bought the company one year after I started. So the change was swift with many internal changes. During this time, it appeared management who were formerly Bucyrus were confined to new guidelines they were not happy with at all. There were just to many changes to quickly. During this time a lot of political changes which caused a huge downturn for mining global.  Long story short, I meet a lot of awesome people while gaining valuable experience."
good,Workplace culture is cut throat if you are not in with the right people it does not matter how hard you work or how good you can do your job you will not move up.
good,"I am responsible for several specific machines. The day starts out with an assignment (down machine) at times assigned a job on equipment that I am uncomfortable to work on due to no training."
good,Caterpillar was a good place to work. I enjoyed my time there and kinda misses it now. I gained a lot of experience that I plan to use and gain more at my next place of employment.
good,"Education and training provided is best around in availability."
good,It is an ok place to work. Long way to walk to get food in only 10 minutes. I find it to be very stressful at times. I have learned a great deal on team work and what it really means.
good,Having the camaraderie with the other guy i have worked with in all the jobs i have worked just enjoin the team work and all the good times
good,The only work they have to offer is during the Spring and Summer seasons. This would be a great job for someone who is home for the summer from college or a high school student.
good,"I am currently having issues with the management at CAT. "
good,worked 12 hours a day 6-7 days a week to met production for the end of the year. After catching up they let some of the new hires go.
good,Management is only looking out for themselves.  They will force long hours unpaid and wont allow anyone to leave a job unless upper management gets the promotion and then they are gone in a heartbeat.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"On most days I would spend the majority of my time taking care of issue the arose on the shop floor. Once or twice a week I would take care of the engineering changes for the new product or existing product and integrate the changes into the current assembly operations. I would also create or improve the 3D drawings that are used a reference for the operations. I learned a good deal about the system that we used on a daily basis SAP, AIS, GEMS, MESA and HVC to name a few. The management was alright though I did not have much interaction with them. My co-workers were excellent and helped make the work day fun. The hardest part of my job making sure I was always doing what was in the best interest of the company even is that meant telling a technician ""No"" to a request that was made. The most enjoyable part had to be my co-workers."
good,"A routine based work, though i did learn may new things like working with SIS, DBS, SAP, that was a multi tasking but at the same time motivation level was never boosted up, no rewards/benefits policy. The managements managerial skills regarding equitable disrtibution of work was quite poor. but, inspite of all this considering my end i did learn new things but at my own from my co- workers or consulting differnet people."
good,You run to production targets at the cyclic rate with mandatory OT only to be laid off when the back lot is full of equipment that has not sold. Don't get me wrong the place has some good people and managers but they are few and far between. The way the company structures incentives has the management team focused on the wrong things.
good,has to be the worst place i have worked the management is corrupt you only get a contract if you know someone higher up the ladder and when deadlines are running late the quality goes out the window. most team leaders are just out to impress by the number of parts there shift can get out and not the quality and safety or maintenance.
good,Non e' chiaro il ruolo in azienda. Tante pretense da parte del Management ma nessun strumento a disposizione.
good,Great people to work with . Management not so sure about ! Slow advancement . Great benefits! Health care is top notch ! There safety program is one of the best !
good,"ok place to work some fun things but not many"
good,"j'ai eu la mauvaise expérience de travailler avec un directeur qui tiens pas ses promesses, je me suis retrouver dans un poste non pas celui  pour lequel j'ai négocier sous prétexte qu'il y'avais un manque d""effectifs et que c’était une bonne occasion pour moi d'apprendre sur l'entreprise et que c’était juste pour un ou deux mois max et que je prenne mes taches, je me suis retrouver dans un poste que je voulais pas pendant plus de 08 mois j'ai soulever le problème a la Direction Général et ils ont rien fait a mon sujet ils ont voulu me changer vers une autre branche de l'entreprise mais j'ai refuser car jetait déçu du management"
good,"The caliber and external image of this top Fortune company did not match the internal Culture or management styles--especially, with regards to people management. The morale of employees was low and they appeared in a daze most of the time with muted tones . Perhaps the trauma of a recent layoff still shows up in those that remain? It feels toxic. "
good,It’s a very stressful job every shift blames the other for their mistakes and no one is held accountable for their own doing. Very stressful environment to work in. Management has a lot they need to approve on stop playing favorites and treat everyone equally. Work has slowed to a crawl and no one is getting any overtime at this point.
good,"Typical day was long and hard"
good,Stressful... afraid to make mistake. Afraid minor mistake will result in loss of job. More value in external people than internal. No career development / advancement.
good,It’s ok to work here if you don’t mind putting your family on the back burner. You will find that you give your life to this place and they will turn their back on you so quick.
good,Management is terrible they dont treat people like people just slaves. Other then that it was a good learning experience. If they could control management it would be a better place to work.
good,"At one facility I worked, I can only say it was one step above a death camp.  Plant manager threatened everybody's job on a daily basis.  He took all credit for other's great work and blamed anyone else for his moronic ideas.  The other facility was very good to work at."
good,"Caterpillar is one of those companies where everything is about Caterpillar.  You either bleed yellow or you don't belong."
good,"Worked there 32 years know all the axx kissing that MUST be done top be treated like a humane , pay is good , but they expect you to do the work of their axx kissing boys."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"I learn a lot about the diesel engine , very sad management does not know product knowledge, To move up in company its not about skill its all about talking about your self to the right people"
good,"doesn't really work if your very family oriented, but good pay, so it is worth it for some people. employees are not appreciated enough.  velocity, velocity, velocity."
good,This is a great company stuck in a small rut with it's internal management teams is certain area. I could learn from opening up to other business and leveraging its talent
good,"Work Schedule : 6am - 4:30pm"
good,Good example of a company that puts pride in it's end product. Functional areas are silos and virtually impossible to move between them even if you possess competencies.
good,A day would start out with a meeting informing everyone of the work load for the day. Afterwards the work load is distributed out over everyone. The orders are pulled by the forklife Cherry pickers so safety is a big deal. The supervisor would lighten the night with a order filling competition with filling orders correctly.
good,"The company is constantly trading cost reduction for quality"
good,Caterpillar has supported my family and hometown for many years.  They have a very cyclical business and are in a low right now.  Job security is not very good and moral is very low.
good,A good place to work and work with other groups. Cyclic business opportunities. Good people in the teams. Enjoy the nice cafeteria along with your fellas.
good,except for pay the worst overall job experience.  terrible communication don't expect to ever be treated fairly or of any importance
good,"I worked for Caterpillar for 3 + years.  I started out as an administrative assistant then was promoted to an STD Rep.  I liked the corporate environment, but the economy made it difficult to retain a position."
good,Excessive weekly and weekend overtime due to process constraints and quality issues.
good,Machinist now working in the warehouse because of all the layoffs.
good,"Empresa com ótimos lideres, salario e benefícios deixam a desejar, não se preocupam com o crescimento dos funcionários."
good,"Management more focused on maintaining padded metrics and worthless audits rather than on actual production efforts and issues.   Shop floor supervisors are responsible for anything and everything possible whether relevant to anything or not.  Mid management is disconnected from shop floor manufacturing operations.  Company wants to be industry top except for pay.  Company does not follow its own guidelines for ""attract and retain valuable employees""."
good,"Became a machinist, enjoyed career. Long hours, Very skilled machinist to reach expectations of job."
good,"Monday thru Friday work, majority of the time every 2 out of 3 Saturdays are forced. Good pay for simple work. They dont take safety very seriously. You are 100% just a number to them. Union job, but the union wont do a thing for you, unless you are a ""fulltime"" employee. Say goodbye to your family if you work here."
good,"Good benefits, salary bands are wide so push them up very much a hire and fire culture. Many people promoted through right place right time not skills"
good,Money is decent for the work. Bosses are bad. There’s always lay-off rumors. Always worried about job security. Over all the people are nice and make it worth while.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"If you're not one of the good ol' boys you're dirt. If you're a temp agency worked, you're lower than dirt. People have been here a long time and are intimidated by young people. So youre not treated well. Be ready to work your tail off for no recognition. The pay is great but not worth the mental abuse."
good,"Since 2015, people are worried about their jobs, and work to ensure others appear at fault for any issues. Culture is no longer that of pride of work."
good,Management pick and choose show favorites it’s like a cult to many old heads topped out don’t want to work cause they capped off need to start firing  from the top on down. The company is a good company it’s just the people make the culture bad
good,Caterpillar is a ok place to work I thought going into it that it would be more organized but the way they run the facility is very unethical they make you work threw your breaks unless your caught up on your work you can't take your breaks then you get two 10 minutes and a 20 minute lunch for a 10 hour shift from what I have seen if your looking to move up in a work place there good for that along as you
good,The job isn't bad where there's work. You spend some days or weeks waiting on materials. There isn't much job security since they layoff. The supervisors try to intimidate you more than work with you.
good,The hardest part of the job is the long hours and the most enjoyable part of the job is going home. Safety is very important at this facility and there is a great emphasis put on it.
good,"Have learned quite a bit working for this company. Was promoted from within, but that has changed in the last few years to give preference to only those with college degrees."
good,Supervisors are allowed to use bullying and intimidation. Team leads are overworked with no extra pay and promised advancement but always looked over.
good,Good money long days lots of work out of town 60 hour work weeks short times off .ok  people to work with time off need to be higher up for time away from home.
good,"Caterpillar is a wonderful company to work for. Pay is alright and benefits are really good. It is a revolving door of managers coming and going who have turned it into a mess of disorganized chaos. They come in, shake things up for their personal advancement and move on. If you make a mistake they leverage it into a termination event rather than offer counsel or alternative actions."
good,"The job is easy and the pay is good. You are assigned to either inbound light  side or heavy side or you get assigned to outbound light side or heavy side. set up your vehicle and do your own thing from there. minimal supervision. It does give a lot of over time, which is good but they make it mandatory and usually don't let employees know of mandatory o.t. till the last 30 minutes before leaving. which is not legally ok. and becomes inconvenient for those with kids in childcare.  as far as training in different areas of the job if you are a female you literally have to beg to get trained. and even when you get training you will only get to do that part of the job once or twice if any at all."
good,Caterpillar is a wonderful place to work according to the employees who came from other facilities. This one seems to be having a lot of issues teething. Management laughs at the idea of work/life balance. Here is a novel idea: take care of your employees and they will take care of your customers. Caterpillar sometimes struggles with that concept sometimes.
good,Working there showed who not to work for. It's a Midwestern company and their culture is not to my liking. However if you enjoy the midwest caterpillar is the place to work
good,"Just another factory job ,working here is nor what it used to be. Overpriced ins. , some bad management a lot of unneeded programs aimed at increasing production."
good,run out of parts sent home early learned to be patient giving anyone that will take management positions with no experience positions the work culture is depressing and cut throat hardest part of job is working safely because of other workers with no factory experience the most enjoyable part of day is being able to work a full 8 hrs and 40 hour week to pay my bills
good,"Mining industry. Very unstable. Too many ""feast or famine"" times. They only care about the stock holders. Employees mean nothing to the company. Very unfriendly to the union workers. Highly skilled machinists running million dollar parts are compared to an everyday small CNC button pusher."
good,Not a terrible place to work if you don't mind repetition and no communication whatsoever with your management team. There is almost no chance of moving up in the company because the entire warehouse is just workers and then a few managers.
good,"I spent over 20 years with Caterpillar Inc and had some great opportunities.  In 2010 is when things really began to change. Caterpillar decided to freeze pensions, reduce healthcare benefits and stop some of the things that made the company a great place to work.  Caterpillar began to promote undeserving employees to leadership roles and from outside the company and it certainly changed the company a lot.  Without the Caterpillar Dealer Network it's highly likely that Caterpillar would not be around today."
good,Great place to work if you're equipped for long hours and non stop work. Expect mandatory overtime on a daily basis. If you're in shape and work hard you will succeed in this fast paced environment.
good,"Supervisor deixa a desejar, não procura funcionário para saber o que, e como está o aprendizado"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Company had provided good benefit and paid well to employees, however, management did not value employees, there were chaos when restructure. there was a lot turn over and laid off during the time I was with the company, negative culture from top management and among employees."
good,Caterpillar reman was a good place to work. I learned alot working here and met alot of good people. They always looked out for their people and had weekly events where they gave back to the employees. And holidays were acknowledged by the company.
good,I was able to continue with gaining great experience in my chosen field in the role of a material handler and forklift operator; I have more than ten years in this line of work and enjoy it.
good,"Good and innovative work place ,wondfer ful team work ,fine working place and environment not bad,only one obstucle is there is no Job surity,it is the only draw back"
good,Caterpillar does a good job in the current industry of attempting to being as diverse as possible in a drastically changing global environment.
good,The management is getting worse by the day. Would not recommend to anyone any more. Used to be a pretty decent company to work for.
good,No job security due to bad market.Least professional growth opportunity. Good work/life balance. Too much work load due to budget constraints.
good,"No job security"
good,"A typical day at work would be going to my machines and starting the day and before you know it its over. I've learned a great deal about various machines and all the components it takes to assemble a fuel injector. I also learned a lot about myself and what I can achieve when I put my mind to it. I loved and got along with all my co-workers and most have become a member of my family, and we would do anything to make sure not only ourselves but each other are successful and they were what made the job worth it. Management on the other hand is a different story. They have been caught sabotaging peoples machines and admitting to human resources that they had and they were not reprimanded for it. They lie or tell half truths to cover their own butts, when Caterpillar strives for honesty and integrity. Id say half of them have no clue as to the processes of the different components."
good,Caterpillar provides good challenging work for their engineers. There is great opportunity for engineers to learn about new methods and technology.
good,The decisions that have been made in the last few years have cost the company a great deal not only in sales and revenue but in people as well. Poor forecasting has led to major restructuring / downsizing. Not THE place to be until someone can come in and sort out the mess that has been made
good,"Write Jobs related to SAS/JCL for needed Data, Review business needs and implement solutions to improve velocity. Looking for a stable and well established company for a promising career."
good,"Great company overall, just a bad place for forward progress at my specific location. For the most part at this particular branch, promotion is not determined by who is the most qualified or who can do the job the best, promotion is rooted in personal relations and not work ethic. I have seen on many occasions,where individuals who laid down the foundation for standard work at this facility, have been passed over for junior associates a fraction of the experience, I can understand this to a certain degree, however, in this case  the situation is gone a bit out of control for my tastes. Management, for the exception of one or two rates a 3 out of 10 period. The worst thing about the job is that this facility is probably the lowest paying facility of its kind in the country. The average pay is $12.00 an hour."
good,"A typical work day is to be self motivated and work through the daily work load with numerous interruptions and meetings.  Working in an environment where fellow workers are not very friendly when walking through the building. Most employees walk with their heads down so they don't have to say ""hi"".  "
good,"Caterpillar has great pay and benefits. "
good,I  good place to learn and experience supply chain management and the advance planning and optimization. Worked around for 12 months.
good,"My typical day at the office starts with going through my manager's inbox to look for important information that he either needs to see first thing in the morning or look for action items I may be able to complete for him.  I work with Executive Assistants to schedule meetings for my manager with Vice Presidents, Group Presidents, and occasionally with the CEO of Caterpillar.  I screen any unknown incoming calls to see if their questions or concerns should go to him or be forwarded to another business unit.  Throughout the day I monitor his calendar and meetings to be sure that he stays on time or if his calendar needs to be adjusted due to unforeseen interruptions. At the end of the day I go through my manager's schedule for the next day to make sure each meeting has a location listed, agenda if necessary, and teleconference numbers for call-in meetings that may be at another office building/facility."
good,Caterpillar wants you to come in everyday and work as hard as you can and get nothing in return. The harder you work the more you are treated like a slave. Management thinks everyone should work for nothing and like it.
good,It is difficult to advance within the company because of the hands-off approach exhibited by management and upper leadership. Expectations are unclear and there does not appear to be any long-term business plan beyond moving manufacturing overseas.
good,"This company will make you believe it is the premier show it claims to be, but fails on many levels. There is a negative energy coming from management. The smile in your face and stab you in the back kind of energy. The factory workers are similar. Everyone is very cliquey and unable to see strengths and weaknesses, let alone, capitalize on them. Overall, this company is typical and a typical company is not a premier company in my book."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Overall, I am not very happy with my Caterpillar experience, however, they do pay well. I feel like for my level of education (Masters) and experience (5 years) I get paid well. I have been looking elsewhere, but haven't found packages that match it for the cost of living."
good,"Caterpillar is a good place for job security and gives you and opportunity to grow in the production field. they have benefits like vacation and personal time off, health insurance, and 401k."
good,Good place to work but terrible management. Good benefits and pay but the company always acts like they can replace you at any point in time no matter what you do there.
good,"While Caterpillar has decent pay for our area and also decent benefits, a large fraction of management are difficult to work with. Culture focuses on Safety, Quality, Velocity, and Cost in this order. You will often find management pushing Velocity over Safety and Quality, but they are careful to never say as much. In Start-Up meetings many lecture on the importance of Safety and Velocity but will two hours later come by various work areas pushing velocity and not hearing a word about the risk of safety and quality in doing so."
good,"Had a lot of work to do in small amount of time. At times it was stressful to keep up with the line. I don’t me mean your tact time, sometimes it doesn’t take all your time for the line to move!"
good,"Layed off after working only 3 months.  Two weeks before the layoff I was working 12 hour days.  The week before they cut out all overtime, then the next week I was layed off."
good,"I worked through 7 layoffs as they sold off most of there small drilling products. "
good,Not a bad job Not a great job good benefits lots of layoffs to many downsizing just when you think things are good they downsize or layoff.  they have a lot of mandatory weekend. you work 6-7 days aweek for month you do get paid for your overtime it's a job
good,The wages are too low for the type of physical labor required to meet ever increasing production numbers. For a company making as much as Caterpillar they could afford better wages than 14/hr. Also any chance of achieving maximum pay levels only happen after you've been there 10+ years.
good,"Worked there for a year or so. They promise the moon and stars at interview but don't deliver. I was hired on as a forklift driver and never received an opportunity to run equipment. Extremely repetitive/mind numbing tasks picking/pulling parts for 8hr. There's no room for advancement (all associates are paid the same)."
good,If you join this company and decide to become part of the UAW union it will cause contention between you and management who are not part of the union. A very 'us' vs. 'them' attitude between regular workers and cat supervisors/management
good,Have many skills not recorded by company for consideration. Skill set not utilized after learned. Would have been good team player. Worked well individually and as a team.
good,"typical day - stressful, what was learned  didn't matter management does not care, management needs a lesson in humanity, workplace culture lack of professionalism and manners, harded part of job getting information to do the job, enjoyable part of the job going home."
good,It had great benefits when I started. Then there just started to take motor and more away. The pay wasn’t going up with cost of living. Union was a joke wouldn’t fright for what was right.
good,"Come to work, work your butt off, worry about having a job due to continuous cost cutting.  CAT is definitely not what it used to be and the public has finally taken notice.."
good,Typically the day consisted of moving parts from one location of the plant to another.  Constantly replenishing parts that were consumed on the production line.
good,"They are not a bad company to work for but not the best. Some management are good guys, while others are out to get you. If you really need a job then take it, otherwise look somewhere else. I work somewhere else that pays less buy I am a lot happier."
good,This started off to be a great company to work for. I was looking forward to retiring from this organization. But they Do not give women the chance to excel in the company. Promotions are based on favoritism.
good,"The job was temporary,  most of the time i countrd parts and took inventory,  other time i took parts from the unloading dock and distribute to the proper place in the storage warehouse.l"
good,"No benefits, no remorse for you having a disabled child and missing days due to medical needs if your not full time even when you work 80 work weeks for them."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Having worked at the company over 20 years I guess I expected a little job security.  I relocated from HQ due to that group being eliminated only to find the business unit I landed in closing up shop.  I lost my job a year after relocating my family across the country.  Senior leadership is very poor and the company has been sliding downward the last 10 years since commodity prices plummeted.  There is absolutely no job security even if you agree to relocate and remain loyal to the company.  I was also given high performance reviews but none of it seemed to matter.
good,"So overall the job was good. However they had to call an ambulance on me because my chest was hurting and I was having trouble breathing, which is understandable. However; they fired me the day after I came back with no reason."
good,"Was a good company but closing, do good and hard work get moved up and maybe hired into the office. Some bad managers no training and love walking people out."
good,Great place to work if full time CAT employee.  Not so great if contract or staffing.  Only full CAT employees have company benefits which are better than most companies.
good,This is a very stressful job at times learned alot and had good people to work with pay was not that great until I got a good manager that saw how much I actually did
good,Considering they are part of a multi-national group the company's attitude towards progress and advancement was somewhat less than impressive. I highlighted many areas where the company was failing to meet its own standards and specifications but received virtually no support to help m to improve their systems.
good,"The work is ok, but too much cutthroat actions on the personnel side. Anything to get ahead and they are ruthless, management has not stopped it. I feel very few people enjoy working there now that they are cutting salary and not people that do not belong. IF you have education it is a target to cut you, so they keep high school grads and cut college grads."
good,"The people you work with are usually are hard working toward a common goal. Management is not focused on employee satisfaction, though. They do not understand FMLA law, or work restrictions. There are double standards when it comes to expectations and job performance. You could do the same job that another person has been doing, in their absence, the same exact way, but it's not ok for you to do all of their duties. You get punished (bad review) for going above and beyond to get jobs filled and completed."
good,"This company is very friendly co-worker but the company is very unstable as far as job security. For the last 6 years of working with caterpillar, we have like 6 time of mass reduction."
good,Managing entire ERP project operations with a view to achieve business objectives and ensure optimum utilization of available resources.
good,Good place to work. I can prepare my day out the day before. There is nothing hard about my job except the company pilling more and more work on me without any compensation. Most enjoyable...I get off at 4pm
good,The people at Cat are great to work with and dedicated but they are being punished by poor decisions made by upper management. Acquisitions and new product line introductions coupled with downturn in commodities sector have resulted in recent layoffs of many long time employees.
good,"Due to continued down turn in the Mining sector, the threat of lay-offs, and frequent management turn over in the past few years have created a stressful work enviornment.  Most co-workers are dedicated smart people. I can not say I would advocate working at the Denison facility."
good,"Unhealthy stress filled work environment. Hours severely decrease after peak periods. Supervisors are unfair, do not understand situations, and don't hear the needs of employees."
good,I would work at the assembly line installing fuel filters. the management would make me feel like they were better than me. as if I was replaceable but they weren't. they made us feel like were not capable of doing our jobs
good,I come to work at 7:00am I have a break at 9:15 lunch is at 11:45 last break is 2:00 and in the time between all the breaks you dont stop if your working on the line other departments is more slack than others you work your tail off to get advancement and it never happens seems like the less you work there the more opptunititys you get it is a very hands on job lots of mechinal work I have learned lots in the time I have been there management is ok some managers like for you to suck up to them to get where you need to go co workers are great its what makes your job there so much better team work is great there and safety is a very big issue there. the hardest part of the job would be standing in the same place all day doing nothing different really. most enjoyable is working with co workers
good,Having all the tools to complete the job with good quality and in a timely matter. Building engines thinking safety comes 1st. Good team players.
good,"Day starts at 7.30 AM. Reach office and take a look at emails as there could be few of them which needs to be attended to urgently on matters like tender authorization,pricing etc.Monitor orders placed by dealers. After 10 AM discussion starts with dealers on pricing, competition activity, upcoming new business, parts availability, inventory position. "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"long day, good honest hard work, great team, engaged co workers  the hardest part of the job was being there two and a half years and still being a temp knowing i would be paid off before the full timers."
good,"A typical day at Caterpillar usually starts at 5:30am since you will be working constant overtime because of poor planning, parts issues, and over production.  That is unless management has forecasted poorly then you will be either temporarily or indefinitely laid off."
good,"trabajo muy competido se trabajaba sobre presion y aprendes a realizar muchas actividades y en mi caso particula a operar una buena cantidad de maquinas, la parte mas dificil era lo retirado que me quedaba el trabajo y la poca fexibilidad en los horarios."
good,Would not recommend to work at. The job is very inconsistent in regards to rules and expectations. Constantly revolving management as well as revolving door for employees. Mandatory overtime often given with only 1 to 2 days notice. On one occasion we were apparently overpaid on one of our bonuses and they decided it would be in our best interest that they subtracted the difference (anywhere from $10 - $350) on our Christmas paycheck. Treated employees like high school students. Instead of a normal break setup (2 breaks and a lunch) they changed to 2 20 minute breaks to gain more production from employees.
good,"Some great people to work with. Opportunity to really own your work. But management has to many ""supervisors"" and not enough ""leaders."""
good,"Lost major customer contract to competition."
good,You will not get ahead in this company without knowing people.
good,"This is not the company it was ten years ago.  Good place to start out, but do not stay.  Most promotions go to special program employees.  Employees not in the programs are leaving to find jobs with upward mobility.  Poor job security."
good,to use to dealing with unions and don't know how to care for the workers and understand quality care breeds quality people that make quality parts
good,Caterpillar is an okay place they have good pay and benefits if you are a caterpillar employee
good,"Pros"
good,The day begins at 6:30am. We have our 5 min meeting and learn what job we will run for the day. I have learned how to assemble large engines for mid-range trucks to oil pumpers for oil rigs. The management is based out of Illinois so they rotate out every 2 to 3 years. I love the people I work with because we have worked together for a long time. The hardest part of the job is it looks like they want to move our work to another state. The most enjoyable part is feeling proud to be on a job for almost 15 years.
good,"I was hired by Volt and placed at Caterpillar. Volt did not offer any benefits such as paid vacation, health dental etc."
good,Its not a bad company to work for as long as the Union doesn't bend over and take it from Caterpillar. UAW 974 in East Peoria is a WEAK union. The pay at CAT is good just no job Security for the first 2 years unless you know someone in management and they convert you.
good,"I get along well with management and co-workers . A typical day at work requires employees to over work themselves , to meet the company's demand . I feel that , with the size of the company , they sacrifice the employee for the company's financial gain . Employees are VERY overworked , and not always appreciated . The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the ever changing demands of the company . By this , I mean that some of the quotas the company sets , is unrealistic for most of the employees . The more employees do , the more the company expects from them , even though it is difficult to meet quotas ."
good,Enjoyed going to work daily. Management and co-workers were fun to work with.
good,"My job was very routine. I would pick up job tickets from Loading station three times a day to attach to part. I would deprep parts by removing tape, caps and plugs and check for defects. I learned to operate tools to correct minor mistakes. I'm glad I got that opportunity. I enjoyed the people I worked with. We worked well with each other and made a good team. The hardest part of the job was when parts would get backed up in a station before or after Deprep, then I would get behind or when the lines went down and would have to wait for it to get fixed. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a job to go to, though brief, and the salary."
good,An old company trying hard to keep eveyone happy..Training is long and hard but most of the time a struggle to fit in to your normal working hours.
good,Sistema de trabajo apropiado pero mal llevado por las personas
good,"The work was hard. It was freezing in the winter and smoldering in the summer, but I enjoyed it and excelled nonetheless. As a supplementary employee, I was layed off when the bulk of production was transferred to Arkansas"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Picked up my assigned Rf scanner at the beginning of my shift that was preloaded with orders. Picked my orders, shrink wrapped and staged for pick up."
good,"Caterpillar has changed since the 2009 lay offs of 2,500 people and many severed as their job was eliminated. Not that many were hired back and now they are in a hiring mode in 2012. Projects were initially based on Six Sigma teams and then Caterpillar Production System (based on the Toyota Plan) became the continuous improvement vehicle. I gained a lot of industrial experience and Six Sigma. The niche environment that I was placed within did not allow for much cross-training that would have broadened my work scope."
good,"Uma rotina de de viagens,porque eu sou técnico de campo."
good,"My typical day at cat was show up, clock in, do highly repetitive work while the boss nags at you for hours on end for stuff he doesn't need for the next three months, clock out, and then go home repeat. As far as the co workers went i worked with some great people both young and old. To be honest it was my coworkers that made my time at the company a great experience."
good,"I haven't been able to get a promotion since I started there, even with ample metrics and supporting activities. Very difficult to get into other similar fields. Very competitive and no options for promotion. They've essentially priced me out of equivalent jobs in the local market, and I feel like I can't leave because other businesses wouldn't pay me the same, unless they are Fortune 500, and those jobs are few and far between and usually require a bachelor's degree."
good,"No diversity in promotions but good pay.  They talk about development but don't live it. There is very little work/life balance. Employees are expected to work at all times, weekends, nights, etch."
good,Fascinating place to work building locomotives.  A dedicated group of professional electrical assemblers and welding fabrications.  Solid focus on quality as well.
good,"An important thing to remember, is that in all matters, the well being Caterpillar comes first. Many hour cuts and policy changes make hardships for employees, and are aimed at saving money, which Caterpillar is very fond of keeping for itself. One year can be 70+hrs/week, the next 40hrs without a taste of overtime."
good,"There is never a ""typical"" day at Caterpillar. I learned that every decision comes from above and it doesn't matter what needs to be done, it needs to be done immediately. Management only cares about getting the information they want as quickly as possible, from my experience. The hardest part of my job is that it is forever changing and there is no ""typical"" day. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I can first hand see products being created from scratch."
good,I did main assembly at caterpillar it was a wonderful learning exeperience as well .the job i had there such as pinning main frames to sub frame attaching various hose and wires to drive trains and trans mission it was a bit dangerous wen bolting and setting transmissions an flying motors and exhaust cage over drive train
good,Its ok to get a start here at Caterpillar but not a good company to retire from. I think the rules and focus on safety here are just a bit too strict.
good,"Only fire fighters are recognized and promoted.  Management does not reward those who meet goals and prevent issues.  There is no socializing with co-workers, no celebrations of weddings or births, nor flowers sent if parent/spouse passes away.  Most engineers are project managers and do not get very many opportunities to apply technical skills.  You write your own performance reviews because management is clueless on what you have to do because they never did the work themselves.  The executives believe any manager can manage anyone.  Thus, they have no clue how to get the most out of someone nor what is required of a job.  Over the last 10 years, most of the jobs have been transferred to agency jobs making projects even more difficult as agency workers come and go regularly.  Caterpillar pays well but do not expect other benefits."
good,no job security need a better organized training program for new employees tries to make it a safe work place cafateria food is good supply all tools to do the job
good,Good job to come in every day but like most jobs it depends on the managers and coworkers but if allowed to do your job it can be good and there can be an opportunity to grow but then that depends on the economy. this would be a good place to work but the economy is so uncertain.
good,Several amazing leaders making big changes inside the assembly lines. Senior leadership is stagnant and preventing succession possible.  Serious gaps in HR departments ability to protect operational turnover and hiring practices.  Lack of vision and employee engagement with highly capable staff.  Senior staff not engaged in day-to-day operations preventing growth and ability to meet productivity.  Great safety culture to the point it prevents production throughput.
good,"Salary not being paid for the past two months that's why I am shift and change my mind.salary must and should b important.. For my family problems, and my 2nd position also a important"
good,"Once a pinnacle of integrity among corporations. Now, going through troubled waters. After a hellish period of incompetent leadership, Caterpillar is having a culture crisis. "
good,"Industry got very bad so did our work environment . We were expected to do more with less .Less people ,time ,equipment ,(tools ,fans ,air conditioning)."
good,Some rough times but all was pretty good even through the rough times. Had a great career with no regrets. Even through the 2008 bad economic times the company remained fair and did what it could to keep employees and protect the corporation as well.
good,"Typical day - be in by 730am and hope to be out by 9pm"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Used to be a good place to work but has become very numbers focussed and employees are looked upon as a number and not a person, chopping and changing shifts to the detriment of the workforces lifestyle."
good,"Some people are better then others, professionalism is lacking in some areas including management. Its kind of like high school, cliques etc. Pay could be better, insurance is pretty good though. No work life balance unlimited overtime."
good,"work is easy good overtime money but expects you to have no life."
good,"Made a good salary here for many years and learned quite a bit about engine development and design.    Work was sometimes difficult and demanding,  but in general was more productive than many places.   There were some challenging problems to solve which kept things interesting.   "
good,It was a great workplace but the threat of outsourcing or going agency is always looming . We stand to lose all of our CAT benefits.. You are able to experience  so many different job roles while working there.
good,Caterpillar is a great place to work if you are a male. I had to fight for every single career opportunity while working harder than any male coworker. They were also paid better salaries. I've had great managers and horrible managers. If you work for corporate Cat you are better off than working for ex Bucyrus. We were paid lower salaries and had no sense of job stability. Management were always changing directions and there was lack of communication.
good,Its great to work for a global company and encounter life long friends and experiences.  I enjoy the potential of diverse business opportunties and leadership development.
good,"Caterpillar management is so focused on all of the drama of pushing their way of production that they refuse to listen to average common sense discussions.  "
good,"Pay and benefits were excellent.  Workplace culture is very negative. Site management is still very old school, ""get er done"" mentality.  Witnessed many examples where processes, including safety, were ignored to get the job done on time.  No cross cultural engagement/understanding between departmants, everyone is out to benefit there own area first, regardless of upstream or downstream impacts. Lots of blaming, finger pointing, etc."
good,El ambiente con los compañeros es bueno pero la administración es deficiente.
good,"Caterpillar in general is a good place to work.  However, it is not a great place for working moms, as you're expected to be there at least 50 hours a week, call in for meetings overseas in evenings and be there at 7 am for meetings.  I commuted an hour and this just didn't suit my lifestyle.  Also, during the downturn, multiple other jobs' responsibilities were added to my already full schedule."
good,"The company is moving to Mexico. Job security is a concern and very uncertain."
good,The most enjoyable is you are off all holidays. That allows you time to spend with your family and loved ones instead of being at the workplace on the holidays.
good,During my time at caterpillar I have had the opportunity to grow and expand my knowledge of assembly work along with gaining excellent management skills.
good,I worked there for 8 years and learned a lot about corporations and unions. I was very discouraged in 2014 when the price of commodities decreased and Caterpillar began to layoff its skilled work force.
good,It was announced in January 2017 that the Aurora IL. facility was shutting down by the end of 2018 and all production lines will be moved. There is really nothing else to say.
good,Being over-run with supplemental employees. No job security or loyalty by upper management. There are numerous other places to work that have respect for their employees.
good,"Poor corporate management has placed Caterpillar in a position where it is no longer a dependable place to work.  Changing market conditions cause upper management to react by cutting workforce and benefits.  Caterpillar is no longer a steady place to work, rather people will work there for 2-3 years and then look to move on to a better environment."
good,"Very poor executive management at this time, much chaos at this time. New management is not long term Cat people, have just recently thrown away long term Cat history of headquarters in Peoria, IL."
good,overall not a bad place to work. depended on the manger you reported to. Some mangers were good to work with easy going and understanding and others only cared about not stopping the line no matter the situation.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Caterpillar makes outstanding products and the hourly workers are top notch. The pay and benefits are good but the culture is very tense and stressful. Due to high level strategic mistakes along with a slow economy, Caterpillar has had a number of years with poor financial performance and has repeatedly cut back the work force. "
good,"As the market declined the mad scramble ensued to reduce overhead to ensure the stock prices could still pay out....once a shear reduction in forces was proven to not be enough, facilities were slotted for closure."
good,"Pros....Decent Pay/Work indoors/fast pace work."
good,"With the recent downsizing of almost 15,000 employees and the movement of the corporate headquarters, there is a lack of confidence in the company's future plans. Those who are fortunate enough to still have a job are unable to move within the company for these reasons. There are still facility closures and movements happening, so the work environment is stressful and uncertain."
good,The BHEDC part of Caterpillar is a great place to find an entry level position for 3D artist. I have found the work environment to be helpful. I have continued to learn and apply new skills will my short time at Caterpillar.
good,Work is good decent co-workers. Has the potential of being a better environment. The only true issue is management decision-making.  When that is corrected it will be a better place.
good,As i Working in Design field as a Quality checker past 3.5 years and learn about the Electrical component used for Harness and my management and work culture is good
good,"Caterpillar was once a great company to work for, not so much anymore. Closing down facilities to buy product from China. No one is held accountable. Communication is awful"
good,"This is or was a great place to work. I started years ago with plans of retiring, with the frequent change in the mining industry, its tough to build a house on the idea of being with the company long enough to pay it off."
good,after 10 years working in the same building as a material handler you are still unable to advance because you do not have a degree and only a ged but you have done just about everything there is to do logistically
good,"Due to huge sales losses over the past few years, Caterpillar had to make some hard decisions. They decided to make up much of the deficit by eliminating employees. I respect that but the way it was done and the amount of technical expertise that was escorted out the door is hard to imagine. I worry about their future."
good,"Set up, program and run my machine. everything that i needed to know with machining on a boring mill. I learned how to be a good leader from my manager. could have been better but was ok. Setting up a new part because of the size of it. Completing a part on my machine."
good,"I learned lot of things like workplace culture, leading group of multiple people. Hardest part of the job on the field. life balance can varies in that."
good,"If you work for this company ,you better watch your back.  They try to find reasons to fire people.  If you get hurt there, they find ways to not pay you."
good,"Caterpillar offers great pay, but as for work/ life balance, there is none. Last minute changes to shift and hours were a daily thing.  70 hour weeks were normal."
good,"Cat used to be a very nice company to work for about 10 years ago. Today, the management has soiled the reputation of the companyas being one of the best companies to work for."
good,"Caterpillar is a great stepping stone. The bad part about yhem, is that the upper management treats us like, we're just number's.... The HR teams, are extremely hard to contact, and once you do get ahold of them, theyre rude, and unhelpful."
good,"If you fit in the management clique, you will go far. Accountability and ownership from management is non-existent.  Most agendas are committee driven, with no oversight.  Many projects are started by committees, and then assigned to people outside of the committee. Credit goes to the committee for starting the project, Committee has not accountability for the implementing or maintaining anything beyond that. "
good,"Good Platform For NPI Engineers. "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,No job secruity what so ever within this company. I love what I do but i dont love second guessing my job everyday. If you can get on fulltime it is much better but being contract is no job security
good,"Lots of management favoritism tword their friends regardless of work abilities, attendance or work ethics. Best thing about working for Cat for me was my coworkers, everyone got along great, I made a lot of good friends. Typically my work day was different every day since I was a hard worker and eager to be versatile I was used as a floater , some days I did a lot of forklifting other days I operated any number of assembly machines."
good,"Productions is a roller coaster, when Cat is busy they love their workers, but the minute they slow down, they get rid of their help"
good,Shop was semi-clean and people were ok to talk with . Some workers are willing to help although you have your grumpy workers that have been there for way to many years and all they do is complain or work 1hour out of an 8 hour day
good,The job description said I would have to know how different device communicate with each other and work with them. Instead they had me sending firmware to their devices with a poorly made GUI. The work was so repetitive I was able to write a program to do all of my work for me and once I showed them they gave me access to some of their APIs and wanted me to work on building them a new GUI. However their APIs didn't work very well so I couldn't do much due to being limited by them.
good,"Forward thinking initiatives and opportunities to innovate and collaborate are available at every turn, however frequent corporate reorganizations become counter productive."
good,"Lots of favoritism, things being pushed under the table, logistics management is the worst that I have seen thus far, no advancement, the plant is divided with separate benefits, bonuses and insurance, they write you up with no solid evidence of anything that was done wrong, they nit pick and harass you because they would rather you walk out then go through a firing process, not to mention the management to employee relations, the list can go on and on... I gave 3 stars because if I were with another department I may some what like it there."
good,You can excel at this company if you are a focused individual and goal oriented.  Focus on improving your abilities and advancing yourself by obtaining education and you can go far.
good,"delivered and put away material to the lines "
good,"Great place to work with great people around.  I report to a great Manager who guide me along the way during my service in the company."
good,"Before Caterpillar took over, there was Texas power systems. It was a fun positive place to work at until cat took over. Management is the main problem there. They don't seem to take care of there people. They have favorites even though they don't claim to be that way. I loved the job but the management was surely poor. Also you would get written up easily if you were not a favorite even when my child was in need of help caterpillar would not support you unless your child was disabled."
good,Cat was a good place to work. Learned alot and worked with many great people through the years.Benefits and bonus were very good.
good,"Caterpillar is an extremely large corporation that offered me the opportunity to further my leadership skills and manage a complicated SAP implementation process.  The bulk of my time was spent meeting with business management to define business requirements that result in new enhancements or site expansion.  I relayed these requirements to technical team who coded and tested the resulting enhancements.  I communicated these results back to the business for their approval.  I also met with other teams to verify proper integration of their planned implementations with my team's process / system.  "
good,"logre validar un alto nivel de conocimiento tecnico en el financiamiento de equipos, buena relación con el personal y validación de sus funciones especificas, pero sostengo que es una organización que le falta formalizar mucho su estructura, algunas veces muy débil en todo aspecto, razón por la que ha tenido bastantes cambios a la fecha."
good,"Trabalhei como  estagiária e aprendi muito com todos os meus colegas e supervisores."
good,"I  have worked in a Caterpillar Corner as childcare assistant and I found it a very rewarding experience."
good,"job is interesting. everyday bring a different set of challenges. this is not a repetitive job, there is always something new"
good,"Début 7h30"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Although a substantially strong company, they are experiencing the economy like everyone else.  For the time being, the focus is on cost reduction with the most common method being reduction in work force."
good,"This would be a great place for new hires to work and learn. The company benefits are great and the option to move to different departments within the company is quite lucrative. This helps for employees to gain experience in various fields or departments within the company."
good,"The company has many strong points and a lot of great people, and is surprisingly sophisticated in some ways, but seriously lags other companies in some important ways. Great opportunities exist for international work - they operate in ~200 countries - and are involved in much more than construction equipment.  "
good,"The several advantages Caterpillar had are now all but gone and are no better than the average large organization. Conservative and slow to change, they are looking overseas to save money from moving work to lower cost areas of the world. Lost touch a bit with what made them who they are."
good,"Overall not a bad company to work for. They are very big on safety and quality. However, the management and trainers are absolutely horrible. I was just as clueless about my job when I quit as I was on day one."
good,Great coworkers not so great management. Good consistant work. Great HR and top management.
good,"llegabas atu maquina no habia juntas de arranque de turno."
good,Little chance for advancement.  Lacks training not a good work environment for myself.
good,Fast Paced aftermarket parts shipping business. Understaffed under funded and archaic systems. No investment in the people or systems for the South Milwaukee plant. Make do and work faster thats it.
good,not much positive I can relay about my experience at Caterpillar. 2 tier pay scale is a big issue. I am under the old salary of $25.25 an hour. no raises in 14 years. loss of more benefits every year but we hear their profits are 15 to 20 billion dollars each quarter so I would take less money to work for a company that really cares about the employee's!
good,"Caterpillar is a good place to work to earn money.  Caterpillar is not like it was 25 years ago, the people worked hard and were paid for it.  Now to get anywhere in the company you need college degrees, which was my fault not having, not anyone eles's."
good,Productive with CNC machines whether it is a lathe or machining center. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different people that I work with or get to make parts and products for and how they the parts or products are involved in making this company successful.
good,"Spent most of my time sitting around reading books I chose afte rthe first 2 months, despite being in a training program that guaranteed new experiences. I also spent a lot of time asking around for work, trying to find projects where help was needed. Co-workers were either great or terrible, not good at including others but friendly. Management was good, HR was not."
good,"Great people to work with, devoted and loyal employees, lack of communication from management,"
good,It is work in todays economy and they are trying to get it right.
good,"i did Quality Assurance, Document Verification"
good,"A day at work consists of 8 hours of creating and testing control systems. Majority of the work includes adding a new feature to the existing engines. Being a fresh graduate, I have learnt a lot here. Everyday is a learning day, everyday there is something new to learn. Co-Workers are typical, kind,helpful,moody and numb depending on their workload. the hardest part of the job was to figure out how the system works on your own.no documented help for new people.Best part of my job is working on control systems!creating and testing simulink models. management is very vague,no team building activities,no job security."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Love my job, except that I was a temp waiting for a year and half for the hiring that would`nt come."
good,i will start my day by doing a vehicle checklist to make sure my lift truck is up to standards. i had great co workers to assist me with some task but most of all it was very fast paced.
good,My day consist of running a Mazak machine and buliding parts according to a blueprint. I check the features of the part and make any necessary changes.
good,My typical day at work was very busy. what i learned was how to drive a forklift truck. The management there was very strict. My co-workers there was very devoted. The hardest part of the job was working under extreme weather conditions. the most enjoyable part of the job was loading and unloading the semi trucks.
good,"The day would start with a line up of customer demand, along with a timeline to completion. Everyone worked together as a team offering assistance to anyone who needed it."
good,Pontiac caterpillar is the lowest paying cat facility. Can’t transfer. Union is a joke. People are backstabbers and talk bad about employees to the managers. Managers have people take pictures of bad work and believe what someone says about who did the work. There is no accountability for management
good,The work is not hard but they could pay more for the work we do. The supervisors are sneaky and devious. Most promotions are given to caucasins. If you have a problem they take it as a joke
good,Ok place to work but advancement is based on who you know not what you know.  Lots of favoritism by upper management and human resources.  Strict attendance even with medical documentation
good,closed plant; no work available any longer at the Montgomery plant even though it was the most productive and safe plant in Illinois; no further comments on this work place
good,"Interested in advancement? Hope you are good at workplace politics, never mind your work ethic or skill set. A lot of ex military at the facility I worked at. They operate in a military fashion there."
good,It depends on your supervisor and core team if it’s a good place to work. There is a lot of favoritism. Not all policies are followed for everyone. All in all not to bad of a place to work
good,It’s a good company to work for with compensation & benefits The problem is management & not caring about the people that work hard for them everyday You just never know when parts may become unavailable and prevent work
good,The only way to advance in Cat is to suck up. Job performance and attitude will get you no where. This place continually focuses on it's commitment to shareholders instead of the people who make the company great.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job and I am very passionate about every aspect of what our group does.  From a properly designed system to processing the system correctly to ensure our customers get a quality system."
good,The pay and benefits were good but it was impossible to get an advancement even with years of experience. Unless you were in with the in crowd or a favorite you can not get a better job there. I don't recommend unless you want to stay in the same job forever.
good,"I have worked in different areas within Caterpillar and in my role of A&D team Leader was  a great experience.  "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Try your best to prevent injury for yourself and others. I learned how to run heavy machinary. not enough supervision. people lie about your actions to make themselves look better. made alot of friends
good,The company operates very differently depending upon which area you are in.  There are certainly some pockets of excellence.  Change is the only constant.
good,Promises of advancement and pay increases not kept or take way longer than promised. New plant manager is cutting costs and employees while demanding more production. A reactive company rather than proactive. They could care less if you have a life outside of work. Not uncommon to only have one day off or no days off in a week.
good,"It’s a cool place and decent pay. But the people of management make it hard to like the job. They aren’t reasonable people at all. The employee should feel welcomed and happy to come to work, not uninvited or like they are being pressured."
good,You want to move up? You better brown nose it. The job itself isn’t hard.  Very hard on the body.  Really wished they paid a little more to at least keep up with cost of living and wear and tear on the body.
good,Fast paced and attention to detail is a must. Pay is starting to become competitive but advancement into important/ critical positions is difficult. Safety is also very big
good,Not an overall bad place can be long days no job security if your agency if you are well in with the management you will get a full time job the place is known for stabbing people in the back
good,"Worked for 9 yrs in quality department through out several branches."
good,the closing put me in a very desperate position.  Having to find a new job at the age of 63 and a half has put undue stress on myself and my family.  This sucks.
good,Fellow workers good. Hours and notice of overtime bad. Not able to plan anything. Also dealt with enviromental conditions. Continuously changing management.
good,Lost a job and need to find one.  Needed to have an opportunity to transfer to another job which has not been provided.  I need to secure employment since I have two children ready to enter college
good,"I learned how to build and dismantle construction grade tractors. From the engine to the frame. There isn't much of a culture. Lower management is ok, upper management is bothersome and petty at times."
good,"When you have done everything asked of you and still can not land a job, it is disheartening. You spend time rounding out your resume, finish your Bachelor's and anything else asked of you and continue to be looked over, it gets old. Much why I have considered leaving after 15 years of loyal service."
good,"Great placed to work great people to work with, but management is absolutely horrible, they change their minds in second on what orders are running and what to do next."
good,Cat is a large factory environment with many different types of employees.  Work environments differ depending on which part of a particular plant in which you may be working.  Hardest part of the job was trying to please several different people with different goals.
good,Caterpillar Inc. is structured for future growth of its employees as well as it's global and domestic product markets.  Has many resources to expand it's markets by developing new products.
good,Has been a great place to work thought it would be my last job. but the company is more worried about it bottom line than keeping good workers that build a great product working to make the company better.
good,"Although a stable place to work, the ethics and values shown by executive leadership leave much to be desired.  Caterpillar's new strategy is to hire from external sources, leaving many experienced, loyal professionals with limited job opportunities."
good,It was a good place to work until now. Closing facililty to outsource the tools (buckets...ect. to other countries to manufacture. Culture is not the same as it used to be.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Typical day consistsof assembling various caterpillar products.  The company is very safety oriented."
good,Very driven enironment with little wiggle room.  Its a 3 shift a day company and that is the attitude in and out of the office.  You work when they say.
good,"The project that I was working on was really awesome in my opinion."
good,"Worked thru a temp agency for Cat. I was led to believe that I would be made permanent with in a year, that is not the case. Also, when I tried to upload my resume for a permanent position with them, they never received it due to an error on their part, but choose to ignore it anyway and refused to interview me."
good,I would rather not give a review. It is a ok place to work but too much politics. Its the Caterpillar way or no way. Very liberal place to work. Please don't hurt anyone's feelings.
good,Morning meetings was the start of the day. Team lead was never on the line due to wanting to be under supervisor or running around talking. Team lead does not take job serious and will come at you with sexually comments about how to be hired permanent. When reported nothing happens due to company protecting their on and supervisor just gives a slap on the wrist. If you are a temp you will be treated unfairly and fired fro accusing or telling on a permanent employee.
good,A good workplace with strong values and great history. Provides each employee ample time and support for personal skill development by offering regular training.
good,"getting up very early in the morning to work hard while management does absolutely nothing, you can't rely on them for nothing even to tell you that you have the day off"
good,It was a great learning experience but the hours were stressful and you're constantly inside the building with having no room to just breathe. I wouldn't go back because you would be working 13 days on and 1 day off.
good,"Local dealership and not the mother company,"
good,I liked working there but the drive was far because at the time I was living in Lockhart.  I learned how to do masking and demasking on engines. The bosses were pretty helpful and the breaks were good
good,This company has great standards spelled out for everything. They will not hesitate to shutdown a division even though management says they are committed.
good,"Work Life balance is good."
good,"My direct supervisor and area supervisor assisted me every chance they got to try to bring the safety problems with my work area to the attention of the appropriate people, However we always got the same response: ""We're working on a solution, we should be able to roll it out within the next couple of months."" Your employees safety should not be an ""in a couple of months"" priority, it should be as soon as humanly possible priority."
good,"Very safety minded, also looks out for the employees. They are very goal minded to build the best product they can. The training you have to do their is 2 to 3 weeks before you go to the floor and work."
good,Long-time Caterpillar employees are preferred over external experienced employees working for the company. This drives decisions during layoffs and promotions.  There's constant downsizing due to business cycles.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Great company, they were shocked at my aerospace precision. I took their layoff voluntarily....I was a strike breaker....never again. I felt for the poor strikers....."
good,"a typical day at work was riding around on a picker all day picking and pulling parts, lifting 25 to 35 pounds all day and checking numbers.  I learned a lot about warehouse work, like how parts are stored and how inventory is kept. the management was ok but you had to be a cat employee to be heard, and everyone I worked with was a temp. and my department did not hire on. so there were no benefits. the hours were not so good but the pay was."
good,"I've been working at Indeed here for more than 5+ years and it has been a good learning throughout my career. The people, culture, management, and work/life balance are all incredible! Not to mention, this company is Technology & Innovation based. Growth opportunities here are immense."
good,"This is a company straddled with petty workplace politics and no employee growth. Middle management is not employee focused. Individual performance goals are not well in line with overall company objectives. There is no exposure to good business / engineering practices, standard processes or even good engineering softwares that are used elsewhere in industry."
good,It is a typical large company where politics rule. It does offer a wide array of job opportunities and advancement. There are many great people there.
good,"Overall a terrible workplace with outdated working methods and less then average senior management."
good,"Caterpillar Inc is one of the few companies which has a well planned Supply Chain and Logistics Function. "
good,"Caterpillar Work Tools was an acquisition by Caterpillar, Inc. a few years ago.  This creates a challenging environment to transition the Work Tools management mentality to align with the Caterpillar culture."
good,Company is inefficient in use of manpower and manages through chaos and rolling initiatives.  Management cares more about their image than the success of the company.
good,"Looking for a company closer to home with room for advancement for me to use my skills and share my experiences."
good,"Non stop welding and fabercating, high stress, co-workers single others out. Was not a good enviroment. the team leads were always mean and rude no one cared about quality."
good,"Caterpillar is a great place to learn and grow your ability to design some really cool equipment. However, ever since 2008 they are laying people off every other year. So your job is almost never safe."
good,Good place to work. Employees did receive increases. Insurance and benefits were decent. Layoffs did happen often during my stay
good,"A typical day at work involved countless change overs and setups. Heavy parts to lift and tooling. CAT was my intro to CNC and so began the learning process. Management did not work cohesively with each other which in turn led to lots of miscommunication, jealousy, and lack of team work. My co workers were the other friction welders and while management was never on the same page we were. We all worked very well together and helped each other consistently. The hardest part of the job was the countless changeovers and setups which involve alot of heavy lifting and aching muscles the next day. The most enjoyable part was the team i worked with, we kept each other in good moods and all communicated any issues or concerns with work."
good,"this is not easy to write a review for this company. "
good,Great engineering and very cool brand management.  Tough environment with commodity environment. Need to leverage data to win in the future.
good,Excellent experience in heavy equipment manufacturing. I worked there as a temp and tried to get hired directly before finding work elsewhere. I did not agree with how they would hire employees off the street and have temps that had been there working hard for months train them. Most of the best workers I met there worked through the temp agencies.
good,"i gained alot of mhe experience while working there, but like any job you have your good days and your bad. I sometime believe that they have in mind who the want to get certain jobs"
good,"Bringing all part,s of a generator together .learning new skill,s in new engine,s. Friendly workforce and work friendly place to work..work need,s a lot of concentration to detail but in the end you get a sense of pride when you see the finished engine leave your bay."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Dead end with moves to bad locations to play the shell game."
good,"Overall a good company, due to economy, not a secure company to work for, much work with less employees so not a great job work/life balance at this time, low employee morale and negative work environment."
good,"my manager was fair and attempted to allow a balanced life/work environment, however (as typical in fabrication work) the environment was hot and uncomfortable"
good,Nice people to work for.  Some of the management really needs training on how to work with people. I enjoyed working there but did not like the crazy hours.
good,"My supervisor is an enjoyable person to work for.  There's too much red tape but that's probably normal.  They make a diligent effort to ensure your career is going in the direction you want it to go.  My colleagues are pleasant.  There is continuous encouragement to automate the more tedious parts of our jobs, to both save money and to also help our jobs be more interesting."
good,"Too many insecure and unskilled people in too many important positions. A degree/deliberate brown nosing will take you a long way. The people on the floor suffer for it while those incompetent protect their positions by blaming people who, unknowing, cannot defend themselves."
good,"My daily job at Caterpillar was to check in all trucks , verify all contents, gate and accept and unload all trucks. I also stored parts to assigned locations and did order filling as needed.As part of Caterpillars CPS(Caterpillar Production System) I worked directly with all team members to insure all goals were meet and that all our customers needs were reached."
good,"Briefly, Caterpillar is a mediocre place to work. If you need a job then it is for you. However, management has no transparency."
good,"At the camp, I worked with a lot of kids who all had different personalities which taught me a lot about people and made me very well-rounded and easy to work with."
good,go place to work decent money really good workforce management and teamleader skills need improving but a good place to work all round
good,Currently no advancement opportunities. Co workers are great but supervisors give you more work with out advancement opportunity. I learned a great deal about relationships with your customers in my time there.
good,"worked so much so never had time to enjoy family."
good,"Typical day at work would be carrying out Continuous Improvement of facility operating system and Safety management of processes, procedures, and personnel."
good,"Very little support or communication from Caterpillar or contract employer.  Often people are promoted to supervisory roles with no experience or training on being in a management role.  Probably was a great company to work for 20 years ago, but I've seen a lot over my almost 5 years and am generally disgusted at the way things get handled from every level.  Be real with your employees and treat them well and they will stick around for a long time."
good,"Empresa conceituada no mercado no segmento em que atua, com bons pacotes de benefícios."
good,"Caterpillar is a good place to work for someone looking to simply maintain the status quo and play the corporate political game. I learned that it's really all about who you know not necessarily what you know. If you become best friends with your boss and his/her boss, then you'll do just fine when it comes to job security and advancing in the company. However, if you choose to share ideas or beliefs that are different than your manager, then you can count on being black listed and not advancing at all in the company. This not only happened to me, but several others I got to know while working there. My advice is to be careful and play the political game well if you want to advance at this company."
good,I have worked for Cat for 20 years and it has become a unstable work environment.  The future of the facility I work at is uncertain and I can tell it is time to move on.
good,Caterpillar is a very good company to work for if your a full time cat associate. If you work through a temp service at cat the experience is not as pleasant.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Safety is the biggest factor when running crane and moving pieces and structures in an environment such as a large weldshop. Coming from a faster pace foundry job, the slow down of mindset that was needed at Caterpillar was an adjustment that took several weeks. But once it sunk in, it was never forgotten. It doesnt matter how much work you have to do, or how fast you need it done. If you cant do it safely and in a manner to where every one, and thing are unharmed or damaged, then priorities need to be re-evaluated."
good,The goal is to finish your part of the tractor in a 8 hour period of time without making any mistakes. Safety was also the number one goal.
good,"Overall Caterpillar was an acceptable employer, with decent pay and benefits, but very broken management way too many chiefs and not enough indians.  Engineering is a nightmare at times it could take up to a week to get one simple measurement revised on a blueprint and still not be right by the time it traveled across country and back.  The best part of the job was the guys on the shop floor, overall a great group of folks to work with, it made all the rest of the downsides worth putting up with.  Always making each other laugh and helping each other out, we spent a lot more time together than with our families, always watching out for each other and having everybody's back."
good,"A typical day at CAT depends entirely on the management of one's department and/or team.  My department mandated 10 hr days and preferred half-hour lunches, but others would work less with longer lunches.  Team members are quite knowledgeable and friendly."
good,"i enjoyed working here and always tried hard to meet my targets, the hours where long with early starts but this meant i had time to spend time with friends outside of work. it was a good temporary role for money but preferred my other jobs i have done."
good,"Following Standard work instructions,  working safely with others to produce quality products."
good,Get your job assignment and go to work. Had all your drawings and where to find your parts. Hardest part was some pretty heavey lifting. Some managemnt was good others not so much.
good,at the beginning of my career caterpillar gave me a high scope to learn job responsibilities and helped me grow all-round. Job security is the major con which forced me to look around for jobs else where
good,A day would normally start with a quick start up meeting. In which you would be updated with any news that occurred since the last time you were at work then you would receive your duties for that day. From there you just do your work until it was time to clock out with two 10 min breaks and one 30 lunch.
good,Again factory so you're doing the same thing over and over. The management didn't seem real concerned with what you had to say. The people were great for the most part (maintenance thought they owned the place) but we all got by. It was a layed back factory meaning that it wasn't near as fast-paced as S.I.A. Very much safety oriented though.
good,"air conditioned building"
good,It's not an easy place to get on permanent. You have to be friends with certain people to get a permanent job out there.
good,"Work was steady and decent.  While I was there they however never hired any temps in, despite interviews and possible job offer.  Temps weren't treated quiet the same as hired employees."
good,The job was a good job.  The benefits were good and my coworkers were good.  They need better management.
good,Overall a good environment to work. Very enthosiastic co- workers. Good additude from almost every employee. A very well place to work.
good,"Would not recommend anyone to this company for a career.  After 8 years of service i am treated like a new hire.  When you work hard and give them all you have, they do not even give a thanks, but point out any little mistakes.  If you need a job, it pays the bills, but they have lost their values toward their workers."
good,"Overall, Caterpillar Inc. is a good place to work, its safe, employees are great to be around, I was a 3A assembler there and was demoted to 2A along with other coworkers. Been laid off on TLO three times and June 5, 2013 I and other coworkers are being permanently laid off so stability wise its not good for me and my family. I need to find a stable and long term career so I can provide for my family and know that the bills will be paid. Working at Caterpillar I am unable to make long term financial decisions due to the fact that I never know when I will be laid off next. Working there is enjoyable, I know my responsibility very well, I am good at what I do. I enjoy being around the people I work with. the management is oaky and the only reason I say that is due to the fact of what I and other coworkers must go through.    "
good,"A typical day at work for me is to concentrate on being safe and performing safely. I've learned to never take things for granted while working at Caterpillar. You can have a job one month & not know if you will have one the next. My co-workers for the most part were pretty good. It changes a lot because you're constantly bounced around. The hardest part about my job is the fact that I never know if I'm able to pay next month's bills, other than that I enjoy some of the people and supervisors I have came across."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,I assembled tractors D6 thur D11 and also worked in repair slab is anything under driver module.
good,The current situation is that we are implementing a new ERP system and upper management is not willing to dedicate the corporate mandated resources to this project
good,"Safe clean working environment,with adequate training for day to day working.Enjoyed working on the shop floor again after being in management role for many years. Downside was that to get on within"
good,"Company doesn't value family, no company should have workers work on Christmas day unless it's a gas station or something of that sort. They are more concerned about safety rather than having happy employees."
good,only a temperary postition
good,management is bias to non veterans. so u can not advance if you did not serve in the armed forces
good,Working side by side in a company doing the same work and being paid less for doing the same Job isn't very ethical.
good,I'm grateful for the job opportunity here. Worst management I've ever encountered in over 25yrs. Company has great benefits. Management is most definitely racially biased.
good,"Management does not listen they need to do a top to bottom and get new players or you get the same results.  You are able to write your own check. Easy work ,but if you have a family when there busy there's alot of mandatory overtime."
good,Pay is fair. HR awesome but shift coaches and leads not helpful to new employees. Lot of work expected in little time. When asking for clarification on duties coaches dismiss you. The leads are holding a pointless position. They don't assist or do anything other than good around. Also use derogatory terms jokingly
good,Work is fun. Lots of OJT. Management SUX! Hardest part of the job is showing up to work on time every day and having to be politically correct all the time
good,They look for people who are satisfied with doing exactly what they are told. Not expected to have an an opinion or have any input in what is going on.
good,"Title tells you all you need to know. This is a decent enough company went you are in a job, however they will use and abuse there temporary work force and lay you off with no notice. Ruthless!!"
good,"Great people to work with, money is decent the job is easy but you never know if or when you will be laid off. You can be told a day after your last shift not to return so then your jobless with no notice"
good,It was a great job great people only thing was the pay wasn’t good the environment and culture is Awsome though they really make you feel like your a part of the family
good,Your experience could vary widely based on your department. Fabrication has several departments that could be challenging or inviting. Assembly and Logistics both have several departments that could deliver drastically different positive or negative experiences.
good,"On a typical day, I inspected engines to verify if operations built the engines correctly. If issues were found I wrote BIQs (built-in quality trouble tickets). These tickets were used to help operations and the engineers improve the manufacturing process with a goal of building engines with zero defects."
good,"I was a welder at Cat for a year and a half. It is spray weld and it is much hotter that regular welding. I would suggest investing in a good pair of personal welding gloves. Cat will give you everything you need to start. Boots, hood, gloves jacket and chaps. Meet many good people and learned about welding in a production environment. They use the 6 Sigma approach to manufacturing, so very structured. Pay was okay. I was in the school of thought that certified welders pay scale should be elevated over those walk-ins with no formal welding training with degree. But that seems to be a non-factor."
good,Easy job. Machining and operating. No room for advancement. Schedules always changing. Could be 40 hours to 60 in a week at the blink of an eye. Raises are yearly and normally are around 2-3
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Worked in the gauge crib setting the gauges for the machine operators. Learned how to use a variety of gauges and how to trouble shoot them."
good,"Un trabajo pesado dependiendo del puesto que es colocado,se aprende de todo,y mas a soldar,lo mas difícil es el tiempo y la paciencia para terminar tu trabajo."
good,"The place is depressing.  The atmosphere in general has been affecting me, along with the people I work with and the fact that I run night shift. It would be different if I were able to move up, which i've tried, but have found myself unable to do so due to whatever excuse can be chocked up at the time.  Benefits are stellar, but not entirely worth my time."
good,I’ve worked in a few different departments in Cat. They all where fast pace when the machines are running. It all depends on your manager. I’ve had absolutely great management and I’ve had very ignorant management. It makes your job heck of a lot better with a good manager. Supplementals don’t get jack for benefits. You have to work your way to getting them. Started on CMO side at Mapleton. Pay started at 19.60 an hour!
good,My time at caterpillar was great. It allowed me to learn a lot and grow at what I was doing. I had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people and build great relationships..
good,"Management is very demanding, whether production increases or decreases, expectation stays the same. Clean facilities, decent place to work other than poor management decisions"
good,"It has different culture as compared to IT MNCs, lot of benifits are missing . However , good pay package. Bad job security for IT folks."
good,"I first got to Cat and thought I loved it, but I soon realized that it was much more toxic of a culture than I realized. Angry teammates, absent boss, quickly had much much more than I should have forked into my plate."
good,"The only real reason I am still at Cat is the benefits package.  Blue Cross is one of the better insurances out their.  So many decisions are made by management, that do not improve the working conditions, despite the hourly employees objections."
good,Pretty Decent Place! I Grew Close To A Few Co Workers And Learned A Lost About Myself Working There! Management Was Ok! There’s Really No Room For Advancement And You Can Kiss Personal Time Good Bye.
good,"A great place to work. One of the best places to work. The labor is easy.The poor management, they talk alot about being here for you and working as a team but they truly don't care."
good,"I believe Caterpillar is a good place to work if you want to make a good amount of money. Honestly, I think they pay too much. The work is easy. I was an assembler then went into quality and both are very simple. The overtime is a bit ridiculous. Since I've worked there, we have been forced to work 10 hour shifts four days a week and about three Saturdays a month. Management often favors day shift employees by letting them go home early even when their work isn't done but forcing 2nd and 3rd shift employees to pick up 1st's slack on top of finishing their own work. Management also has a bad habit of lying to you. They'll tell you if you complete ""x"" amount of work then you don't have to work Saturday, but we still end up working Saturday. The only way to move up in the company is to have a Bachelor's degree. I'm pretty sure they've hired supervisor's off the street with a degree in basket weaving. They have no sympathy and won't even work with you if you have a death in the family. Unless it's your parents or your kids. Say you have a kid that DIES, they will give you THREE excused days off. Three! If they don't like you, they will watch you like a hawk, waiting for you to make one tiny screw up just so they can walk you out. Some managers enjoy walking people out. It's a union and management hates that. They also hire anybody with a pulse and complain when we aren't making our build rates. 60% of employees are either straight from high school, straight from prison, or straight from fast food. Which isn't always a bad thing, but a lot of people will screw around all day instead"
good,"Caterpillar is a huge company, but the management is very similar to the middle age times (specially in IT). Tiny minds, huge egos and closed groups unfortunately will destroy the dream to work in a great company."
good,"They make almost everyone start out at supplemental employees management walks people out left and right the good workers get tossed a side and written up while the bad ones with quality issues and attendance problems will always get priority. I dont like the way management treats supplemental employees they treat them disposable and like trash there needs to be equal treatment to all by management and when they bring it to HR or labor relations they tell them your supplemental so management can do with u as they want.so So the write up procedures and ruels they have in place dont apply. So moral of this review keep your gead down get union protected asap and dont get on the ""new"" lines stay with the established lines and you will do fine. Lay offs are horrible they will lay thousands off just to rehire 2000 more people for less pay and less benifits. If you like temporaty jobs or unstability in a company this company has your name on it apply but id have to say pay wise is great overtjme is a plus you can make more than a salary person just being straight production."
good,the  job was good & most the people were alright the layoffs bite they have a good retirement plan & good insurance I would go back if I could but that is a pain
good,"Caterpillar is a good job to work for. But for certain race of people its hard to get ahead. Teamwork is at a low, but employees make due with whats given."
good,I only liked working there for a short time because I was able to catch up on bills working 70 hours a week. But it takes a toll on your body and the managers were not professional.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"It was an alright place to work at, just being on your feet all day in steel toed boots on concrete kind of sucked. People there were kind and respectful. It wasn't a bad place to work."
good,Is a job really hard to become full time... to much overtime you basically work 3 weeks with no days. You can apply for moth to become full-time and have no luck....
good,"Very cutthroat environment with little to no acknowledgment of accomplishment, long hours with very little time off, but good benefits with matching you at 401K"
good,Ok place to work if u dont have to ho to docots visits or dont mind running out of parts every week. Good pay and good benfits. Slow to do any papet work or anything related to hr
good,"very demanding, management was poor and always changing, mandatory overtime very often, very little reward after years of service, layoffs every 5 years"
good,"Great place to work, however poor management.  Financial mismanagement led to several people losing their jobs.  With that said, very sharp people and a good culture."
good,"A formal organisation which management culture changed with the origin of the top management (european versus american). Very conservative, strong company culture."
good,"I work with Caterpillar during the time of significant downturn in company profit so my experience with the company regarding job security and advancement is not that great.  However, the work environment is pleasant enough."
good,"A lot of changes going on.  Take on too many projects at a time straining resources and work/life balance.  The changes in management have led to a poor workplace culture though I expect it to change once management changes are stable.  The benefits are good, decent time off, can be flexible."
good,Would love to return as a full time employee. It was hard for me to move up in the company after earning my Bachelors degree.  Having the degree with no experience made it very difficult to move up.
good,"In my almost 15 years at Caterpillar, I've had two good managers. The others have been mediocre at best. "
good,Load and unload with forklift or stand up forklift  product to be distributed to other repair centers. Inventory management and product loss. Pull specific orders for stores.
good,c est  une bonne entreprise mais aucune possibilité d'evolution ainsi que de contrat en cdi .
good,Average manufacturing environment. Work load is not strenuous. Advancement is available. Not enough promotion of training and improvement opportunities.
good,"fast paced, the work is fairly easy once trained. work a few overtime Saturday. People are friendly easy to talk too. Training is good, and safety is important and stressed a lot."
good,I do not intend to write a review.  This is an inane requirement to insert when all I want is to be considered for one of the jobs that was posted.  Do you get it?
good,great job. not enough pay. need longer breaks and lunches. under staffed. need better management and a better plan to get things finished in a timely manner.
good,"Caterpillar Inc is a strong company with a strong work ethic.  The culture has changed and the pension program has been removed, allowing more mature leaders such as my self the opportunity to look outside for work.  Not sure how this will impact the company, but I would always recommend it as a good place to work and develop."
good,"If you are needing a job this will do. There is no career advancement and compensation is low especially if you are a contract employee. You don't seem to matter to actual CAT. there is no type of time management for projects, everything is last minute. The worst part is they try to nickel and dime companies to create parts and not worry about reliability."
good,"Company has become really big. Changes to adapt to new age of economy require agile thinking. "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,In reality its a good job with good pay. Only drawback is you can be supplemental for up to 2 years after they hire you. recently it sounds like they have gotten better at that. I would work there again as well as recommend it for someone trying to change there life around.
good,"Nice place but a bit outdated systems and surroundings which is a shame for such a large company, if your face fits you will do great if not you will struggle"
good,lo que me gusto fueron las prestaciones mas que nada
good,"My review will unfortunately be biased because I currently work at the facility that is closing by the end of 2018. However, if you are looking for advancement then it definitely depends on who you are related to or if you are a ""YES"" man."
good,Good schedule. Bad management & leadership. The leadership team here does not have as much integrity as you would expect from a large corporation. Also there was no room for advancement here. most employees in leadership positions have been there for years.
good,Cat is a good place to gain valuable experience with a large organization.  There are cycles where plenty of resources are available to make yourself shine and advance.  For core skill folks there are plenty of places to make yourself essential.
good,was a good company to work for pay was ok but could of been better job cells was poorly organized and not very worker friendly and very small didnt have proper gauges or measuring tools
good,"Pour :"
good,Highly political environment. Seems to have regimes in different business units. Never stay in one place too long. Culture is the leader does no wrong unless they get caught.
good,don't have any remarks for this company. This company was close to home and the hours were good. Don't have any feedback to recommend to this site.
good,Caterpillar had a good work culture and a really good facility.  Downside would have been the hours that where forever changing.
good,Caterpillar set high expectations for the engineering department as well as manufacturing in the since of FPY and OTD. Working with customers or field support on a regular basis mixed things up a bit for the teams. International business was always great as well. Enjoyed the atmosphere but not the micro management.
good,"Good job if you can keep it, many business units are very cyclical. Mgmt employees can get tuition reimbursement if working in the right business unit, but depends on how well business is doing for that area."
good,"buenas personas en el sitio de trabajo."
good,"Good not great, but it pays well. Bad locations to work, illinois based company. Good projects to work on, but people seem too confortable working there."
good,Very stressful environment as far as job security with current economic mining conditions. Which makes productivity difficult. Cat will do what Cat has to remain profitable and supply value to its shareholders.
good,"Great place to develop as an engineer / leader.  However, Caterpillar is fighting headwinds that are currently causing the business to shrink.  In conditions like this, it is very difficult to offer employees any type of developmental / promotional opportunities."
good,A typical day at Caterpillar is very busy. I learned how to drive a forklift and tugger. I rather not say anything about management. My co-workers were good worker also. The hardest part of the job was staying on management about ordering parts for the line. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing i could o my job.
good,"Political, good old boy system of running a business.  Employees thought things would change after Caterpillar bought the business, but nothing changed in management."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Learn how to root cause and fix problems. Great team building skills. Pay is good if company is doing good. Slow advancement but much to learn and a big place to grow.
good,"In order to have Leadership Opportunities you have to be selected by a panel of 8 Junior Level Managers vs being able to apply for Management positions. In addition, you have to be a member of a particular program (Finance Foundation Program or FFP) in order to be considered for Leadership roles."
good,"When the economy is good, Great place to work!"
good,"Quality amount of day for a day"
good,"Since being hired on as a full time employee a few years ago Cat has seen negative sales growth for the last 42 months. Constantly re organizing the structure and leadership, lack of merit pay increase in 2016 and decreasing short term incentive plan"
good,"Good Team and good support from the managers and co-workers."
good,"good coworkers, management is horrible which is why the place is closing and caterpillar is selling out to overseas production for components so the ceo can make more millions like he dont make enough already."
good,Management is ridiculous. They place no value on their associates or having a personal life. Caterpillar seems to be a sinking ship as a company.
good,"Existía un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno. Aprendí muchisimo acerca de manufactura."
good,"Days are normally busy with steady work and projects. "
good,it was a great place but it slowing started going down hill. there was no room to grow or move up.It was not such a bad place to work but management changed and so did the culture
good,melhorar o processo de plano de carreira.A empresa tem um otimo ambiente de trabalho e bons eneficios.
good,use an employee for a specific purpose then use dishonest means to dispose of them. I have never been subjected to such treatment by  any other employer
good,The shop floor employees really have a need to do a good job and make quality parts.  Sometimes they feel frustrated at having to wait while approvals are made to continue manufacturing but they usually spend that time cleaning up or improving the organization of their working area.
good,"Lot of work seemed like busy work. Pay was pretty good for the work. They really only hired local talent. It was not a really stressful position, but it was not very rewarding."
good,"Everyday was the same and everyday there was a problem between the union and Caterpillar."
good,We go for Team building events on a quarterly basis to connect personally with the employees. This is a great opportunity to understand individuals outside the work environment.
good,"The Caterpillar of old is not like the current day Caterpillar.  Overall from a benefits and a place to work in Central Illinois it is at the top of the list.  However idea and innovation from employees struggle to make it up to upper management.  Supervisors lack some adequate training, but I feel that is usual in this day and age.  Overall a great place to work."
good,"People are cool, Management could be better. Know what needs to be done everyday, not micro managed.  It pays the bills, lots of OT in the summer."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"10yrs working here, had some good times and some not so good times. Co-workers were great and like a family. Management was good also."
good,"* Day started at 3:45am in the morning Monday-Friday"
good,"Each day was a new day here.  There was always new learning experiences around every corner but the proper training was never given.  If you weren't willing to learn on your own, you wouldn't make it.  Co-workers were fun and always willing to lend a hand.  The hardest part of being here was the unorganized warehouse and the constant glitches in computer programs.  I did, however, always manage to make the most of every day by striving forward with my strong work ethics and ability to learn quickly."
good,"it was a good place to work and people where also very friendly too,i enjoyed it especially on the picking department going around with the   power picker sit on and ride along picking the order items"
good,"learned how to work on the line and check machines for defects"
good,"My day with CAT is a very busy day. The day in filled with sales, customer and dealer support at every angle to make a sale in the belt systems group."
good,"This company lacks communication in every aspect that you can think of. The managers give you a work environment that makes you feel like they're watching everything you do and they also don't know how to show appreciation what so ever. My co-workers are good people, they are the ones that keep me sane in this place."
good,"It's a high paced manufacturing environment. Be prepared to work hard, and there will be frustrations along the way. It's an incredible experience, and they certainly do make you work for your money."
good,"Typical day included answering a lot of incoming calls and remotely resolving a variety of PC related issues."
good,"I found working at Caterpillar to be entertaining as you operate in a very team oriented role, therefore there are always people around you to communicate with and you do not feel isolated. A typical day involved producing one part of a machine until we hit our production target for the day. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated towards the end of the day because the long hours and manual work proved tiresome and taxing."
good,"In a typical day, we would line up the products that needed completed by the end of shift. I have learned many things about the factory world. I enjoyed painting and knowing that we were the last stop before the product went out the door to the customer and knowing that we did the best possible job to ensure the customer's satisfaction,"
good,"Caterpillar is a good company to work for. It has a family enviroment and care about their employees. There so many people(employees) that are working so hard and it makes it hard to move up in the company. Having to start from a temp service makes it extra hard. There are some co-workers that wants to help a person get better and there are some that do not care about anyone but themselves. I met a lot of cool people that I stay in contact with now. At the end of the day, when work slow down cuts are made."
good,A fast paced environment with opportunity's for advancement
good,"*platica de arranque, *aprendi otras posiciones  de aplicacion de soldadura (tubular), *sin comentarios, *haces muchos compañeros pero pocos amigos, *estar incado soldando la mayor parte del turno y calentar el material,*terminar de pagar el hogar de mi familia "
good,"BUENA"
good,"I'm just a contract employee that started out when the company was still Bucyrus; in August it will be 3 years.  "
good,"I started out working directly for Caterpillar in May of 2005 as a Parts Kitter.Then just two months into my employment I was given the opportunity to Train & Certify as a Mig Welder into the next four years.In June 2009 I was placed on Indefinite Layoff with approx.#400 fellow,(hourly),employees.I was called back to work May of 2010;but not as a welder...as a laborer in the Paint Dept.,of which I sacrificed a $3.84 drop in my hourly pay just to get back into my employment status with Caterpillar.In October 2011 I was free from my bid-restriction;(thanks to my long layoff period),and I bid into the Tractor Operator/Assembler's Job.Overall I declare that Caterpillar is a good strong company that you can engage in a long-term career with;.....just so-long-as-you are able to somehow avoid rolling layoffs and indefinite layoffs from the company management team."
good,"A typical day is that we do repairs on 240 ton trucks after the truck has been started and ran. We fix leaks, faulty parts, and make sure that nothing rubs against each other like tubes or wire harnesses. After all repairs are done, we disconnect anything attached to the machine that makes the truck run and drain and cap hose and wire harnesses ends that are exposed. This is preparing the truck for shipping. When all done with all of that, we use an overhead crane to load the truck on a semi-trailer."
good,"The job itself is varied and can be rewarding but at the same time very mundane,Co workers consist's of two groups agency workers referred to as ""TEMPS"" or full time workers there is a big divide between the two very often resulting in agency workers being spoken to and perceived in a different manner,Management always seem to battle against each which does result in shopfloor workers feeling the brunt of it.All in all this may sound like a negative review but after being an agency worker for three years i do feel let down and dont feel appreciated."
good,"I was thrilled to get a job here. At first, I thought that I did not know what I was doing but then the work I was doing started to go along with what I was learning in class and that made it easier to do and understand. After many of months working here, I realized that I do not want to do accounting for manufacturing."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Inputing information in the main computer to determine how to load a trailor with a forklift. Enjoyed the work and people around me. Hardest part of the job was the lack of supervision in the department and as a whole company.
good,En general bueno buenos compañeros atentos a cualquier duda aprendi bastante sobre el uso adecuado de herramienta la parte mas dificil era el salario es poca la ayuda para estudiantes.
good,"Because of low amount of orders, some projects were stretched longer than necessary."
good,"A typical day starts with me checking my work schedule for what needs to be done for the day. Order parts ect. tack parts to compactor wheel. Hand weld parts that robot can't reach. Place wheel into robot and start up.When wheel is done take out of robot inspect for weld defects clean spatter from wheel,place wheel in inspection area for final inspection before painting."
good,If you do not mind actually working hard for your pay this can be a great place to work!!
good,Drive forklift and watch machines as as machine operator.Make crates for tha order that went out and learn how to drive a forklift. Hardest part of tha job was to learn how to drive a standup forklift.
good,"My typical day at work consists of moving parts from one location to another. Management overthinks things sometimes, which makes some jobs more difficult and time-consuming than they need to be. My co-workers and I know a better way, but it gets ignored. There are too many hands in the pot to get anything productive done. There is a lot of overtime. In fact, they ask for it every weekend. I like the people I work with, and my immediate manager. Pay caps after 3.5 years unless you move up a pay grade by getting another job. It is really hard to even get an interview for a job if you don't know the hiring manager."
good,"A empresa é boa para trabalhar mas as pessoas que trabalhavam em cargos comum que foram promovidas para gestor tratam as pessoas com inferioridade e com despreso, pois deixaram o poder subir em suas cabeças.Em vez de as pessoas mostrar que teve um cargo melhor , trabalhar para ajudar a si proprio e os colegas acabam prejudicando a empresa com o seu autoritarismo."
good,"demanda mucho tiempo extra en la empresa, tienes que quedarte mas horas"
good,I did not receive much guidance for day to day requirements. I spent a large amount of time teaching myself what i needed to know. Everyone was friendly but too busy themselves to teach me what i needed.
good,"Good Place to Work till it closed, Good Hours, Easy Location."
good,"Pleasant work place. Small groups with specific focus in different areas of technology.   Each group can have its own politics and good or bad work, social or any other company metric."
good,"I met great people who were very supportive and helpful. Learned to operate industrial machinery. Very good management, except for a couple of micro managing head hunters. Supposed to be 4 10.5 hour shifts but were forced to work 5 days a week, sometimes 6 days. Very little work/ life balance."
good,Would like to work there again. They treat you fairly. I enjoyed working there. got to meet new people and learn new skills. They helped me with a lot of new skills
good,Supervisors are pick favorites very often and if you are not one of the favorites you get screwed over quite often. Pay is decent but most definitely could be more.
good,"Disheartening, especially when it came to a ""lull."" You can get the general feeling at the time of a ""lull"" that they are not concerned about the man that actually works for their living. As long as those in the upper eschilon are receiving their pay off of the sweat of the brow of the man ACTUALLY working, it's ok."
good,Working for Caterpillar requires a strong individual who can withstand lots of highs and lows with a cyclical business environment. High demands for administrative assistants is daily occurrence.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"It is a very clean place to work. You are able to w0rk a lot of overtime, there is some advancement but not able to advance quickly..The staff is great to work with."
good,"Its alright, just show up and dont get hurt, ask for help if you need it. Be on time for everything, clocking in and out for shift start and lunches, and learn everything you can"
good,"Work can be repetitive but overall a good place to learn about machining and machine operating. The drawback being that when you get hired in with no experience you are hired as ""supplimental"" meaning no vacation, no paid holidays, no sick time and you can be let go for anything under the sun."
good,"We had to carry out task on daily basis, and make sure all tasks would be achieved, also is a good place for team building skill and working together as team."
good,I've been there for a year very great worker I went from 18 to 16 wondering why did I work so hard to get the 18 to drop bck to 16. Still not company so they can let me go at any moment
good,Doesn’t pay enough and cut out all the overtime we worked i hate it here no good advancements not paid properly for the work we do and tired of the good old boy system
good,It was little laid back but you work until you get off. Hardest part  making sure parts was out on the line on time. the most enjoyable aprt was getting paid.
good,"I enjoyed working at caterpillar, however I was part time and they done away with the shift I was on. I was working part time while going to college. The people where easy to get along with."
good,It was a good place to work. Company was very big on safety and continuous improve. Company was very big on culture and making sure every person was included from management down to the temporary workers
good,I was working through a temp service so I dnt kno if anything changes once you are hired direct. It wasn’t really the job that I thought it was. But the people were nice for the most part
good,Société qui j' fait un moment très agréable et un excellent experience dans domaine du maintenance des engins
good,"Favoritisms and no respect from some managers. Tried threatening people’s jobs if they didn’t get what they want. Turn over rate was kinda high. If someone got hurt, they looked for reasons to get rid of them due to liability issues."
good,"too repetitive, same thing over and over. I got sick of it as result of it being way too repetitive. flexible schedule but poor management sorry but I don't recommend this place to work at"
good,"They need to work on teamwork, employee morale, and less separation between management and employees.  Benefits such as retirement plan and medical and dental could be improved."
good,Could be better at work life balance. This is a critical part of the business. Caterpillar does well with managing people. Would perform better if everyone followed the established processes.
good,"Very hard to get full time benefits, everybody unless your a welder or engineer is a Supplemental Employee for at least 120 days, but they only do conversions when 20% of the plant is supplemental and can only be SE for 2 years and they can you or forcefully convert you. You have 1 month to pay the union or you get canned. Best advice is wear your PPE, no cell phone at all and make no mistakes."
good,"Working at cat was a roller coaster ride..its a ok job i learned how to drive a forklift and reach truck..i work 2nd shift i was the only woman and I felt like a piece of meet i told hr nothing was done. I gues he thought i was only trying to get off 2nd shift..my supervisor he new so he a robot..you get 10 vacation days and 3 sick for the whole year..you can only use personal to call in or if your child was sick..so when i got a flat tire i got wrote up for being 5 min late..saftwy is a joke if u make a mistake you will get wrote up and sent home..the job paid my bills a little bit but it wasn't for me"
good,"A typical day at caterpillar would require me to set up a machine according to blue print, change bearing blocks, run a part, and measure and inspect part to ensure the quality is correct! The job itself is great, the management and the discrimination is what was intolerable."
good,"They treat incoming employees like garbage and put them through a 2 year probation period with no vacation and no holiday pay. They can move you around anywhere and cut your pay. It all sounds great at first but you quickly realize it's all about seniority and favouritism. Only stay cuz the pay is decent, but as a supplemental if you sneeze or cough in the wrong direction they can and will fire you."
good,"I was never fully trained on jobs I was expected to do. Some points I realized I wasn't trained properly by anybody. Everyone I worked with had different ways to do things. Many rights and many wrongs. Supervisor didn't even know what to do with half the problems I went to him for. Got in trouble for things I didn't know about that weren't in the hand book or anywhere, so I would have no way of knowing what to even ask about."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,could have been better for i was just a temp position. still enjoyable and easy experience. management cares for you and theres a lot of opportunity to move up
good,I was only here for a short time during college for summer employment. Work was enjoyed and got paid pretty well just to clean up dirt. The co-workers seemed to have a lot of fun at work.
good,"The management is poor, what I can say. In other things are OK. The people are very nice and Job is good. I learn more about 6 Sigma. The workplace culture depends from management. The management to need to learn how to work with people."
good,Plenty of vacation time. The first five years I worked there were pretty good. The next five were a struggle financially and always a clamor to keep your job- budget cuts and severance pools every time I turned around.
good,"Okay I'm gonna say this. This place has great benefits and everything, but there are day where you just wanna scream until you can't talk anymore. I love my job here, but sometimes no common sense."
good,Poor management. They are overworked and dont care. They get caught up in the gossip. They ignore things they shouldn't. Manager on 2nd shift is under trained and doesnt listen.
good,Place full of different culture and friendly people. Repetitive work that required focus and manual labor. The managers were somewhat strict but also understanding.
good,The hardest part of my job is working in the hot building.  I do alot of lifting somedays. I spend alot of time on a fork truck i stay very busy. I begin my day with trucking and setting myself up for the day.
good,"Fast paced and busy days,the management was mediocre at best but workers were good people and worked hard for the most part. The hardest part of the job was the down time. Made long days. I really enjoyed learning the products testing my abilities"
good,I've been a welder for 30 yrs in which 18+ of them was at Caterpillar.Welded on large trucks and at one time the motograders.Not a bad job except from inexpeience throughout the shop including welders assemblers and most of all management.
good,If you are looking for a place that gives you direction in your job. You will not find that here. You as an individual have to determine everything and training is next to none. It is all accomplish on your own
good,"We worked four ten hour days Mon-Thurs. 6 am- 4 pm and had off Fri-Sun. most of the time unless we were behind. If behind, we usually worked eight hours on Fri. from 6 am - 2 p.m."
good,"Caterpillar was a very friendly, and calm environment to work in. There hard work of commitment to making the environment safe was very comforting. All around an excellent place to work"
good,"This has been my third time as a Design Engineer at CAT. I appreciate there loyalty and willingness to always hire me back, however I've always had mixed feelings about working at CAT. Now that I'm older and have more experience I have to say it's a rather joyless place to work. Maybe it's the culture, maybe it's the location, but I see a change in my future."
good,My review for working at Caterpillar. For me was kind of stress being one of few. Individuals who knew almost the whole entire production line. And being moved from ops to ops with in the day and also training all the new employees that would start with the company.
good,I experienced a lot of discrimination while working for this company. Management was not always fair. There was different standards for different groups of people. Against people of color and women.
good,apredi mucho acerca de como trabajan las empresas hoy en dia
good,"Good place for diverse and multi-cultural team"
good,Company is Fine. nothing wrong with the company.  It is a job to do and they have their place.  I am forced to write this review by Indeed.  there is n
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Very quick pace work with a lot of overtime hours. Time and a half pay with all of the overtime hours. Management was good as long as you did what you are supposed to do.
good,The company was good to work for but most coworkers weren't that friendly. I worked in different areas and found this to be true with all of them. The salary and benefits are great!
good,Had 18 years with a company that strive for safety first then customer a nice place to work for wasn’t enough room for growth but excellent for A single person with all the overtime you want
good,catapillar is a typical production facility. better cheaper faster is the slogan most managers use. environmental convienent to operators climate controlled.
good,"Why I am in Caterpillar:-"
good,"Typical day starts loading trucks and doing grief .We are a year into this new system and everyday new issues arise ,it is challenging i learn new things every day .I  have learned so much in 14 years and gained a lot of knowledge from driving a cherry picker , ,fork  truck, flat bed , propane truck ,Cushman . i have capability to pick a part pack and ship to customer . Load and unload trucks store material use hoists . Build an engine from start to finish worked the assembly line , after paint assembly .Management is just like any other company the good ones stand out .The culture is a tough one I have been in work groups where we work as a team and on the other hand  work groups that do not help each other at all. It is always great to be on a good team. Makes your job  more pleasant , and the days go by smoothly. Hardest part of the job sometimes is the pay check .I work 7 days a week if needed and sometimes feel i must to make a better life for myself .I have met some extraordinary people over the years that are near and dear to my heart and for that I. am grateful"
good,it was a regular place to work. the pay wasn't the best but it was money. it was fast pace and management sucked. if you got hurt they would fire you.
good,Was a good place to work but didn't enjoy the 45 min.- hour drive every day. Got along good with section foreman and some upper management and employees. Did my job by myself the last 4+ years there.
good,I cannot speak about other plants but Aurora was an ok place to work. But they are closing the plant shortly. So no future here. Maybe at another plant.
good,I worked in a production area and the hours are what made me leave the position. I had a long commute as well. I feel that I never got to advance within the company.
good,"Caterpillar is a great place to work, the only problem is that the CEO want to move operation down south, and forcing people to look for work somewhere else."
good,Not a bad place to work. Just like all places there were good and bad things about it. A lot of weekends worked and favoritism but the work wasn’t necessarily hard. Just fast paced
good,"Good ol boy network, MAGA attitudes, if you are different than the demographic - you will suffer, The higher management is oblivious to this - very political in a seemingly a political environment,"
good,Should make temps feel as equivalent to permanent employees shouldn’t have temps training temps and not getting proper pay for it could give temps a better incentive for the work they provide for the company
good,"caterpillar is a good place to work if you do not mind forced overtime, making decent money and being away from your family a lot.  Saying yes all the time to management requests helps you to shine at Caterpillar."
good,"It is a cool laid back environment. They greet you with a smile , very friendly people. They work with you on hours and also provide it if overtime . Easy to adapt."
good,"Was a good employer while it lasted, all gone now. Not real crazy about the union,but it was closed shop, had to pay dues. Miss the people I worked with."
good,Loved working at Caterpillar. They paid great and gave raises often. Plus bonuses.  The have full benefits and offer health coverage.  They pay you for a thirty minute lunch.
good,"i didnt work here long. the people seemed nice. hard to understand "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,caterpillar was a fun and enjoyable workplace. I liked the people I worked with as well as the supervisors. they seemed really caring and attentive to all employees.
good,"Pretty decent place to work for.  Great benefits, but this has been a very long time ago and I am not sure that my evaluation is pertinent anymore.  NC."
good,"I have nothing to comment about.  I am staying neutral with my experiences."
good,Good place to work but not at all good pay for temp employees..... and why do i have 2 do this ...dang it. i didnt ask for no review. work wherever you wanna work STOP GOING OFF REVIEWS!
good,I left the job because I found a job closer to home. Management really values people who brag and puff out their chests. That's not me. That was another reason I left.
good,"Supervisors were not very interested in employees.  I assessed and interviewed potential employees for factory work  At the main plant in Lafayette, IN and in Greenwood, IN"
good,Good Company to work with as I worked with this company for a very short term for the Design Solution Review as a SAP MM lead for an already SAP implemented project.
good,steady work some room for advancement the insurance was not very good and the management needed improvement. The company struggled with prioritizing what was best for the employee
good,"There are some departments that don't support older workers and slow their advancement opportunities."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the mechanics out on the lines.  They treat me with dignity and respect and just overall, a lot of fun.  They love to joke around with me because I can laugh it off and don't take it personally or give it right back at them.  "
good,Shady management.  Upper management says do this while section managers try to stop certain things. Puts employees and team leads in difficult situations.
good,To many bosses and union isnt strong they dont fight for you. I was laid off twice in almost 9 years. Pay isnt good enough for cost of liveing if you have a family after they take out everything.
good,it is a factory job you work inside and get a total of 3 breaks 2 15 min and one 30 min the work stays consistent so time goes by fast and the bosses are okay
good,If your a good worker you do most the work why other stand around because they can do job right. They have you work but off for a part and when we get done it stays here for a week before they do anything about it
good,"The company awarded me many opportunities to learn, but I was put in the position of so much administrative duties that I felt like I was not able to be a hands on type of supervisor that I was hired for."
good,I learned that safety comes first no matter what. I learned that the small details matter. I learned that quality is more important than quantity. Hardest part of the job was being stuck in a detail booth all day.
good,I was a contract employee working with CAT. I had tried for different positions but was not hired on. I felt that since I was a contract worker that I wasn't given enough of an opportunity to advance and prove myself as a dedicated and hardworking employee.
good,"Although the second shift crew wasn’t very big , we all worked together and helped each other out when we completed our own tasks. We were a very productive crew that made sure everything was either completed or very little to do for the next shift coming in after us."
good,"Caterpillar was a decent company to work for, but sometimes what management promised and what was delivered was contrdicary. If the plant had not relocated, I would probably still be working there today."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,A typical work day at Caterpillar starts out with a group meeting & warm up exercises. The team leads inform you of the tasks & production goals of the day. We work in teams in certain areas & some are auditing jobs. Most workers are friendly & do not mind training you on different tasks. The hardest part of the jog is reading the blue prints from the computer when you are new. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new experienced people & enjoying the full cafeteria.
good,good company to work for plenty of progression but salary does not comply with the job roll. In all good company but improvement on wages required. thanks
good,They were a good place to work but they kept you for a temporary worker for a long time or the temporary workers were always laid off. But now they have closed down in Newberry SC.
good,"worked 8 hrs a day, all breaks & lunches were paid. good facility. learned how to used different types of tools, good pay. a lot of teamwork skills & a good work team"
good,good job overall i would recommend this job to any one who enjoys hands on work and decent hours. the hardest part would have to be when short handed you may run multiple stations
good,They are always hiring and can't people. Or use them for a short time. stop trying to branch out and stay where you started. Stop taking advantage of good workers like us.
good,Long days. I enjoyed people i worked with. I often worked by my self. There was nothing really hard about my job i was a painter. I enjoyed the money.
good,"I hurt my back for putting in work and making sure everything gets done ans send out on time for them, literally doing everything I could for the company  and always taking overtime. I ask for mutiple choices to make things better in my area, when my back was sore,  Eventally I hurt my back and was on 10 pound restriction no pay no nothing, there was people there on 5 pound restriction still working but hr counties to say they didn’t have work for me, most bosses are pretty decent and mike the manager in york pa facilty is awesome! However hr is really the ones you gotta watch for, & a lot of bosses move to funny."
good,"CAT was a pretty relaxed work environment, not enough chances for advancement though.  Good management, would be a great job is compensated a little better."
good,"During my time here at caterpillar I've had several jobs all which a level of being able to read and understand prints and you must be able to work in a team environment as well as,individually"
good,"Caterpillar is shutting the doors in Waco, Texas.  With that being done all the production is being transferred over seas.  With buckets moving to China and Hammers moving to South Korea.  Losing our jobs here."
good,Piecing together parts or placing the finished parts onto an Engine.
good,very easy job barely get dirty unloaded semi trucks with a forklift truck and place materials on the train properly so it doesnt fall and desinated areas
good,very fast paced but steady job work friendly environment great on safety. managers were OK seem like they had their picks just lacked on career advancement
good,Poor work environment.  The pay is lousy.  No insurance or benefits.  Poor management. Very non friendly work environment. Didn't feel like I was part of a team.
good,"Worked all over plant. No set department, no set job. e. i. Installation, troubleshooting, air condition, hydrolics, hydronics, boilrds, fire systems, paint booths, High voltage up to 25kva to control voltage,PLC's, robotics."
good,"Great place to learn and build your career.  Dedication is expected at 150% at all times.  Life, work balance is sometimes clouded and difficult for working women with children.  Very male dominated culture."
good,"poor management, long hours, you don't have social life because you have to work over fifty hours a week and it was mandatory, and always there were issues with the machinery and RF scanners gun."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"empresa com oportunidade de crescimento,revendedora Caterpillar,para todo estado de SP,agora chama-se Sotreq"
good,Decent Place to work.  I worked there for a few years.  I enjoyed my time there.  They do layoff quite a bit.  There was plenty of people that were employed there
good,Good place to work nice people vacation time is a bonus managers  try and  treat you fair 4 day work week is good when you get it opportunity for overtime if you want it
good,it is a standard factory job they pull the manditory overtime card a lot and make you stay ridiculous amount of hours but its good pay if you actually get hired on with the company.
good,Wasn't hard work at all. Just heavy lifting constantly. I felt that i should of been getting paid at least 10.00- 10.50 a hour. Plus i got paid when i took my lunch break so thats a plus. But its only 20 min.
good,bel experience de plus de 10 ans dans cet entreprise
good,"I have learned MS excel and 50% of SAP. first week was very typical because eveything was new to me , the place,work life etc.Therefore after first got familiar with everything."
good,"didn't like this job at all, wouldn't tell anyone to work here need young people to work here not older people might be a good start off place for young people"
good,"low pay, high volume work. Safety is #1 and a lot was learned there. Don't care for the low pay to high risk/volume job. CAT is a major CO that doesn't care of the little people. Big promises of personal growth and no delivery."
good,"Professional setting"
good,"A Typical day at Caterpillar I would Install Turbos and Wiring on Harnesses on a variety of engines, the reason for leaving was I was Excepted in the Sheet Metal Local #1."
good,"Typical day would start by getting count of the amount of boxes that needed to be built. Would build boxes, staple to pallets, and stack on top of each other. Used forklift throughout the day depending on task."
good,"Start when you are a young recent graduate and you will have a long, lucrative career at Caterpillar.  Be wary if you are a mid-career hire as Caterpillar doesn't always value ""non-Caterpillar"" experience."
good,I got in as they are signing a new contract with the union. The new employees ended up getting paid less and would never advance like the older employees.
good,was never hired as a fulltime employee due to the fact that the location was being shut down and all hiring stopped. it was fun working there and enjoyed the other employees
good,Caterpillar does a lot of hiring and then laying off so be prepared and I wouldn't recommend moving your family for a job here or you might end up having to move again.
good,no time for family or school this job also didn't care for its workers either they are very strict on sick days and also you can only have a couple of claims
good,This is a great place to work for when it comes to a global company.  However the employees are not always treated with value and respect as defined in their Values in Action.
good,work is fast pace.  The front end of the business was fast and a lot of pressure.  Need to multi task and be fast on your feet at all times. You work with the dealerships making sure their satisfied as well as the customers. The dealer and the customer were your clients to please each and everyday as well as the people inside the building.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"low salary should be paid more than the current pay rate."
good,I have nothing to say about my time at Caterpillar. All you have to do is look at them on paper and they are exactly as advertised. The only way to know more is to research
good,The company is going through growth and it was a good place to work for. It was just not the career path that I am looking for to advance my future. The company in itself was good.
good,I work several job with in my caterpillar career. I had some great managers and other not so great. Working for corporate America is a job that require you to sometimes to not keep your morals. However if you are lucky that you have a great management with morals you will do fine . They offer workshops to enhance your skills. You have the opportunity to advance if you continue to work on enchancing  your skills.
good,"Starting with what's great about Caterpillar, the culture is generally very welcoming. Most people are very willing to teach and help you out (provided they aren't urgently busy). It can be easy to feel lost in the crowd since it is a larger company, but by the same token it's very easy to develop a widespread network."
good,"Caterpillar is a well known established company. Great pay, easy work however, I was hired as supplemental help and I had high pay with no benefits and was laid off after only 6 months. No job security."
good,"Overall, my time at CAT was good. Pay was fair, and I excelled in my field. Caterpillar Spokane DC, unfortunately has a high turnover rate, much in part to unattainable metrics for new hires and over excessive rules designed to make a safer workplace, but often times not needed. The theory ""it only takes one person to mess it up for everyone"" definitely applies to this facility. A lot of good, hard working people have been separated for the most trivial things."
good,"I learned alot at caterpillar.I got my tuuger license,and my forklift license. The people there are very friendly. Its a cool fasted place to work at."
good,It was an ERP (SAP) implementation. Dealing with barely available subject matter experts. Design documents were not very well written by major integrator. Workplace culture was little less than friendly.
good,"Great place to begin your career, need to be more inclusive. I have gain multiple experiences in several areas of management, logistics and working with people in general."
good,The logistics side really has no room for advancement.  Management has been in place for years and do not intend to leave anytime soon.  I did take away a new understanding of manufacturing and transport.
good,Completed an internship for SCSI and was hired on full time after I graduated.  The salary and benefits were not up to par with other manufacturing companies.
good,Repacking or rearranging items as they come in from the dock to be delivered to the main line. The hardest part was keeping up with the demand from the line if the build was high or if we got behind do to the lack of parts.
good,"For young dynamic engineers Caterpillar is a great place to work , enhance skills and contribute towards building a better future. "
good,Caterpillar used to make you feel like you were one big family but that has all changed now. Management is out of touch with employees and only cares about stock holders.
good,"I ran a plasma cutting machine. It was big and the parts were big. Took hard work to get the job done. You were sweaty, tired and sometimes sore when you went home. I always knew i did something productive. They offer plenty of hours and good pay."
good,"Caterpillar has good benefits and a competitive salary, but unfortunately it's not the same company it was 10 years ago.  After the mass layoffs conducted in 2016, it does not feel like a very safe place to work, and culture has gone downhill.  Upper management has done little to improve the culture and motivate employees/make them feel valued."
good,At that time it was a very relaxed place to work was there for a long time the Company stressed that we were family which I enjoyed very much. they paid for many classes an d certification to add to my training.
good,"Caterpillar was a great place to work, i worked there for 15 years. The work force is union and the employees are great and hard working. They would do whatever needed done. Most managers were good and would coach you if you had any issues. The plant however is closing down in 2018 and relocating."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Overall not the worst place to work, but you will not have a social life. They offer outstanding benefits and monthly bonuses, but require working 13+ days straight at 10-12 hr days, sometimes with an hr notice. There is a lot of favoritism shown with middle management, and advancement depends on that rather than skill set."
good,"Working on a factory floor is exactly what it seems. The work is generally boring but comes with decent benefits and hourly wages. Caterpillar would be a decent company to work for as an engineer or other position, but working on the floor is tremendously boring."
good,It was fairly new when I worked there. They were still working out all the kinks with that being said I not sure how they are as of today. I know people that work there some of them like it but others don't.
good,"Working on the the inbound side is great. Order Picker, RF Scanning, Validating and Receiving is my job, among cross-training  doing other things. Cycle counting."
good,"Good place to learn discipline and many things., Things are well planned and systematic way of working culture is found., Nut outdated people out there."
good,"Through fiscal year 2010, Caterpillar divided its products, services and technologies into three principal lines of business: machinery, engines and financial products for sale to private and governmental entities. Starting in 2011, Caterpillar reports its financials using five business segments: construction industries, resource industries, power systems, financial products, and all other segments. The mining sector is down due to the economic cycles"
good,Great company to work for just needs more work for their admins.  Doesn't seem to have enough work to fill the day.  Such a skeleton crew that there aren't enough people to do what needs to get done
good,It was an OK place to wotk. Vending machines were free and so was the coffee lol. The other employees were great and we had just as much fun as there was work
good,I worked at CAT for 12 years and it helped support my family. Way too many ups and downs. You never new if your job was safe from layoff. The pay was great and the skills I learned from the job I will have the rest of my life. I would never take any of that back. I'm just glad to move on and grow in my career.
good,Shipping and receiving of parts. The job was temp and the management is not very adequate. Office is by the airport and sometimes hard to get to. The job was second shift and I ran out of things to do.
good,"During the 80's and 90's it was a great place to work with great benefits, educational benefits, work place training and a supportive management team."
good,"Due to continuous layoffs, job stability no longer exists and there is a steering away from work life balance due to lack of coverage for needed activities."
good,caterpillar is a wonderful place to work with friendly people. They main goal is to teach and to make you  the best at whatever position you are required to work
good,"Caterpillar provides constant changes based on what you would like, never are bored and if you're self driven there are always opportunities to find projects. "
good,Not wanting to review at this time. Was separated from the company six months ago due to poor conditions of the company............................................
good,Es una empresa que da mucha oportunidad a sus trabajadores es estable y aumenta la confianza en el trabajador a desarrollarse en cuestiones para aportar ideas para que la empresa hacerla crecer
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Traditional Company"
good,"Even in 2017, in factory settings, being a female is a disadvantage. It's definitely a male dominated culture,  My co-workers are amazing and I enjoy the challenges; however, getting stuck in a role is a possibility."
good,Nice place to work/Collaborative teams/ amazing company culture. Flexibility on the job. Learning curve. Very nice culture. Good management. No precise job description
good,Worked for GSND during my time here and management was HORRIBLE. Luckily BCP took over so everyone is receiving the pay they should. Getting days off even when you have PTO is like pulling teeth. A lot of overtime and non-understanding of family life.
good,"Great opportunities, solid middle level management. Job security is an issue. You feel like a number at Caterpillar, you can be let go at a moment's notice."
good,"When times are good, things are great. However, the company has been on the decline for the past 4 years. Layoffs have been common, no merit raises for 2015, poor bonuses, no overtime allowed. Facility implemented a 9/80 work schedule to improve work/life balance - that has been a nice change. Continue to wait for mining economy to turn around..."
good,I lost my job because of honesty. If you don't suck up to the right ones you may not be there long. My supervisor in FABS didn't have my back and I worked my behind off for him.
good,It can be rewarding. Work is not extremely hard as a assembler. Directions are provided on how to build the product and there is always support to make sure the product is built correctly.
good,"The company is good, and the people working there are for the most part enjoyable.  However, they are in a severe down cycle, and layoffs have been happening nearly every day for about three years."
good,Uable to comment as working for Neovia. though previously the whole site was CAT. The takeover by a US company took place shortly after my employment starting at the Dsford site. However I will say both companies are very enamoured of graphs and metrics!
good,"My thoughts of Johnson Electric are in the middle of the road. I worked there for 4 years and loved the people I worked with in the lab. Liked my manager most of the time and got along great with him. Salary was really low. Worked a ton of overtime though. Lots of hands on projects in the lab. Any problems were your problem, there wasn't a support team to help you fix anything. Overall was a good experience. Would have liked to see a bump in pay for how much work and problem solving we did there."
good,"Compensation is good, the upper management leaves much to be desired.   Colleagues are professional and are united in making the best product possible for the customer.  Upper management gives the impression that they are only interested in the short term bottom line, and not the long term future of the company."
good,AS it was a long time ago when I worked for Caterpillar a lot would have changed since then but overall it was a good company to work for and my colleagues were also good people that got along with each other and myself with ease
good,"The dealer network is a terrific system and the customers are the best in the world.  A company this size allows for job movement, including laterals and promotions."

I had great co-workers that helped each other and would not hesitate to share knowledge.  I learned so much regarding Caterpillar from the concept of a tractor build to the actual production build.

The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great teams of people and the feeling of a successful project at the end of the day."

The hardest part of the job was Caterpillar was not strong in communicating operations changes.

good,In the warehouse as a lead ive learned how to maintain my work flow with less emloyees daily. The hradest part of the job was to accomplish the work task in a short period of time. I really enjoy being challenged in what I'm trying to accomplish in my daily task.

good,"empresa con gran oportunidad de crcimiento"

good,Good days and bad days like any job. Very good people to work with. Good supervisors that care about their people.Some days you can have a lot of fun and still get a lot of work done too.Not a lot of job security and a lot of stress because of that problem. Most enjoyable part of the job was the life long friends that you make while doing your job.
good,Nice company where you will have  wide variety of oppurtunities to work and learn about engines and heavy equipment industry
good,"this is a job that is detailed orientated, supportive group. in the past 10yrs  I've worked several jobs     from safety, accounting, customer service and now parts authorizing"
good,"A typical day at work at caterpillar for me is badging in, going to line up meetings, and finding out how many engines to build each day. I report to my station with all the proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). From that point my day technically begins with building engines on the marine line and I love it. Everyday is a different, its all about being safe, getting the job done sufficiently, and learning a better way to be successful at doing both. Management work with their employees to create a safe working environment, all co-workers try to work together and get along. The hardest part of the job for me would be when we get new engines that I am not that familiar with. But at that point, I focus more to be successful on building this new engine. The most enjoyable part of the job, is that I truly like working on engines."
good,"A good, very conservative Fortune 500 company working on diversifying and updating its employees and workspaces. My management has been supportive, although they could work on transparency with employees. My typical day involves answering emails from global clients, working through questions and issues with clients, calls and meetings for various projects and writing/editing content for our internal and external websites. The hardest part of my job so far has been working on a project for our new website, as I was not on this project from the beginning. It was hard to establish the necessary relationships and understand the project, but I've had great support from management and colleagues. The most enjoyable part of my day is working through issues with clients and finding results. I also enjoy working closely with my colleagues to execute anything from small tasks to large, important projects and presentations."

good,"I wrote, implemented and managed an Access database for Caterpillar Paving Products in Minnesota. The database was created to track tonnage and parts so that an more efficient inventory could be tracked.

good,Typical day starts with madatory stretches after a safety meeting and previous days news. Didn't learn much do to standard work. Management is non consistant.

good,Caterpillar is a great company to work for but they are moving to Mexico in early 2018 . the people here are great and the work is not that bad
good,Worry to much about stock holders profit not employees or quality. If your not in the click with management you will not be promoted into salary position

good,Great place to learn the industry standards as well as the definition of brand loyalty. Hardest part is accepting you are only a small piece of the pie and many times your efforts go without being noticed. You are just a number
good,It was easy work most days. The people that hire other employees didn't pick the best ones to do the jobs but we got things done.
good,"You are just a number.  There is alot of unknown with this company.  When you went to work, you weren't sure it would be your last day, or if you were going to be laid off.  I felt very insecure in this company."

The day to day work and interaction with other product teams was the most enjoyable part of the work, however, I was a contract employee and always looking over my shoulder at the global demand for mining equipment which always led to lay-offs."
good,"New green field plant. Management wanted to repeat their processes from their previous location. This hindered new development of in state contracts. Great co-workers and work ethic. Need more variety of work experience to bring in more ideas, most employees had only worked for this one company since college."
good,Customer satisfaction and maintaing a document was key for my job
good,When you go to work at Caterpillar many people came in thinking that within 90 days they would be hired on. Not in this facility. They rarely do any permanent hiring so working thru the temp agency is a normal process with them.
good,I work a temp agency inside the ware house and the work was not bad. the micromanagement was annoying to me. what bothered me most they expected the temps to perform at a high level like the full time. with a lot less pay and no benefits or job security.

good,"My 11 years at Caterpillar were very good years at East Peoria site. The job itself was very learning oriented, as quality control, it was my job to over see allot of good work that CAT did.

good,I worked the weekend shift and enjoyed the people I worked with very much. We had a great team in place and together we could do any project that was put in front of us. I learned that being responsible for the team was a rewarding and sometimes complicated venture but nonetheless embraced each opportunity as a chance to grow. The hardest part of my job was to remain focused on one task at a time since I was responsible for several projects over the course of the weekend. The most enjoyable part of my job was building relatioships  with the team members and having them trust in my abilities to lead them and get them the answers they needed throughout the day.

good,Interesting place to work.  I am in the quality dept as an inspector.
good,"On a typical worked day I attended toolbox talk with supervisor and fellow employees prior to the start of the work day. Work included but was not limited to tacking welds prior to part going to the robot welder.  During my time at Caterpillar I leaned to read blue prints to company specification. My most recent supervisor knew how to work and guide his employees to do a better job. Most employees got along and work well together with other employees."
good,"Caterpillar is a good place to work, but currently the economy is very slow for the company and they are doing alot of layoffs and reduction in thier workforce."
good,The company requires average work days 45-50 hour work weeks. This company has good employees but the benefits are barely par for a large corporation. The management seems unsure of its direction and the hardest part of the job was the unclear direction and goals of management.
good,The union here will not support you but will take dues from you. Other than that good place to work
good,"I machine shaft pinions and bevel pinions to size operating a Cincinatti external stepgrinder, blue print reading layout plan was required.

good,"I began building my parts to put on my tractor while associating with my fellow co-workers. I typically learn something new everyday whether it be about my job or the people I work with. Management are very nice and unlike some jobs they actually hold conversations with us. The hardest part of the job is trying not to get hurt, there are many ways to accidentally harm yourself or someone else. The most enjoyable part about my job is getting to know my co-workers and of course being able to build a tractor, not many people can say that they've built a tractor in their lifetime."
good,"Stable work, but repititous ... I don't have alot to say about this company, it was just a job"
good,I learned how to use many different types of machinery and the people I worked with were a good people to work with.
good,Loved the people and they did what they could until I had to go!!!!There is much room to grow here with this company!!
good,The most I like about the job is the people I work with everyday is a fun day. There are people there that treat you like family. The job was easy to learn due to me being a hard worker and the fact that I learn fast. I learned how to work in a fast pace place due to getting the material out in a timely fashion.

The hardest part of the job was keeping up with their quota, therefore there was much overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was them helping me get my, ""GED."" Soon after that my daughter was born and I took a turn for pharmacy to be around my children more."
good,"mgmt has no clue,engineers not a clue either, what looks good on paper doesnt always work"
good,"The company is very conservative with rules and processes, but they pay very well and have a great internship program."
good,Company is very successful but has trends of rocky roads in the market. Leadership is well taught and helps one to be successful in any role.
good,Work is not secure and plans are made by managment but not followed.
good,They switch out supervisors to often. You cant have a good repoor with your supervisor.
good,I worked on an individual project that involved building a system that allowed divers to communicate underwater with voice transmission via a modulated laser beam. In my second year I completed a group project which involved equipping a robot with suitable hardware and software in order for it to compete in a gymnastics event.
good,The hardest part of this job was the distance I had to drive everyday.
good,Your hired on as a temp. they promise you raises and this and that which never happen. You may or may not be hired on full time but youll never really know cuz reviews are non-existent. Its a good job to hold you over for a little bit but definitly not a career choice. youll also notice there is a high turnover rate. for $10/hr itll pay for your gas..
good,If you like shift work it's the place for you. If you seek first shift look elsewhere..
good,Good company to work for. Work culture differs between product groups but generally good. Great benefits. Work life balance is okay okay. Job security and advancement -okay. Management - okay. Overall- average experience.
good,Caterpillar was a very good company but they did not have any work life balance in management you are expected to work up to 7 days a week with no compensation for overtime.
good,Work was easy. I was a supplimental so no benefits. Was offered a lot of overtime. Was not advanced to full time so was laid off. I liked my job but again no benefits.
good,"My team leader would give us all the tasks we needed to get completed at the beginning of the day, see if we had any questions then for the most part let us do out thing."

good,Caterpillar was a great place to work for my first job they train you they give you like time to catch onto the job they had like company picnics they had a gain sharing where they would give some of the companies profits to employees based on production and attendance and overtime hours overall great company to work for
good,"Caterpillar is a great place to work. The pay is excellent for salary employees. 401K plan is good, Health care can some work but nothing that would be a deal breaker.  Working for them allowed me to learn and develop my skills and I had a lot of help from my managers."
good,Lost my confidence in Cat when they just shut our plant down. I had planned on retiring there. I worked there for nine years and it is just disheartening.
good,"empresa possui ótimo ambiente de trabalho, mas peca na questão do plano de carreira para funcionários de ensino médio/técnico."
good,"Great place to work if you don't mind sweating, getting dirty or working in a factory. The hours and schedules were fair, as well as the pay. Keep in mind you may be laid off."
good,"As an intern, my work was reliant upon communication with my supervisor.  If I finished my work, we were to report to them for a new assignment, which was hard if they were out to lunch or in a meeting (which they always were).  This resulted in lots of time stuck at my desk tidying up my space to keep productive until my manager came back."
good,"Created family environment for myself"
good,Limited career opportunities outside of Peoria. Vague policies that management implements as they see fit.  Constant turnover at all levels.  Absolutely no job security.
good,work over the 10 hour shift almost every day. over worked and underpaid. expensive healthcare. 30 minute lunch short breaks. tobacco and smoke free campus
good,CAT is good place  to work with lot of learning opportunities depend up on the group you are in.  it is a stress free job place but without job security.
good,"high pressure environment, long hours."
good,benefits and pay is good co-workers and staff are great they do on the job training such as learning how to operate a forklift they have job advancement opportunities if they don't have lay offs
good,"This is one of those jobs where if you were to leave for 2 years and come back the entire staff will have changed. Due to the constant changes in the company, it deprives employees of stability within the company."
good,The only problem I have working at Caterpillar is the promotion process. I feel that it could a lot better than what its been during my 6 years . I feel that they have overlooked me on some jobs.
good,I enjoyed working the people during my time working for them. but they are no longer in it for the long run of the employees and are falling victim to the economical changes.  although management could use some help.
good,Good place to work very excellent benefit package. Excellent employees that you work with . Possibly a good place to retire for some people. All around ok
good,"Caterpillar has excellent compensation packages, benefits, and people within the organization.  They are a global leader in their field and have a brand that is recognized globally"
good,"Moving work out of northern IL area so there is no future for those in this area."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,the overall experience was good the pay could be better. the attendance policy and new hire policy needs to be revised. benefits are amazing and discounts.
good,A great place to learn invaluable skill sets under fast paced environment that sets ship date goals to get the product out to the customer in a proficient manner.
good,"Day-to-day: Firefighting, very few roles set a project plan and continue to execute to it."
good,Good environment. Grate hours and pay need to look more at the employees ask about there thoughts. I would see a lot of favoritism. But overall I would say a good place to work at.
good,Good Company. Work life balance was good. No much opportunities to grow. Management can be better. No much learning opportunities. Lack new technologies.
good,"The company has changed a lot over the years and has become one focused on short term results i.e next quarter. Currently they are not in a such a good shape, but it will come around."
good,Cuenta con un ambiente de trabajo agradable sin embargo al no tener  oportunidades de desarrollo hace una empresa con un ambiente laboral no tan agosto para permanecer
good,"Caterpillar is an extreamly large corporation and with most this size they suffer for operational direction confusion.  Strong initiatives to reduce cost, but in doing so they often sacrifice other aspects of the business."
good,"Good Pay."
good,"Caterpillar as a company is Awesome. The management in Sumter, however, is poor. They base their decisions on personal information not job performance. They do not like when employees go against them. They do dirty things and hide it with the paperwork. Has the potential to be a great place to work with better management."
good,"Daily work:"
good,"Good experience, You will learn a lot, good Culture but there is no job security, I had friends that they lay off him after 5 months.Right now (2016) they are in good condition and they decided to lay off more than 30000 till 2018"
good,A typical day at work is being able to get the products out and meet all production goals.In a safe manner order to keep production going to the main plant.
good,It's decent place where you can make good money but they care less about your family. They give last minute changes to schedules and they assume you got nothing better to do than work for them. Now you can make good money here but if you are not prepared to deal with jerks and last minute changes all the time and ridiculous layoffs then this is a decent job.
good,"The mining industry if a tough industry that fluctuates dramatically, and unfortunately the industry has been in a recession since shortly after CAT purchased Bucyrus.  Not to mention that CAT way overpaid for the company, though Corporate refuses to admit this blunder.  Instead, they just continue to drive the business into the ground.  It's my opinion that CAT bit off more than they can chew with the drills business, and have done nothing to help the situation during the downturn but make it even more difficult on themselves in the long run.  If the drill business survives until the market turns, they are going to have a difficult time responding to the increase in demand since they have laid off the majority of experienced resources that know drills.  There have been multiple rounds of layoffs, and with all the people that have been laid off that produce and add value, management has basically gone untouched.  Management is needed, but when your workforce is dramatically reduced, then you would think management would be reduced as well."
good,"not a very secure company to work for, false communication for management, creates bad morale for employees, very hot in building, always cutting back and short on employees to do the work demanded by management. swinging door for employees."
good,"At CAT there is a very strong focus on dealer relationships, at times this clouds the necessary decisions that need to be made but overall this is a good place to work."
good,"Diverse project teams pulled together by project lead engineers.  Due to sheer size of teams and projects progress can be slow, but strong team experience can shorten lead times."
good,My position was eliminated due to market conditions.  Caterpillar was good to work for and benefits were ok in this market.  Caterpillar is a very large company with many employees.  Product knowledge of their newly acquired product lines was lacking.  They used much contract labor from India.  The results lacked accuracy.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"When the economy is doing well especially in the resource and mining industries it is a great company to be a part of. But these industries are cyclical which can make job security shaky."
good,ok. Life and work balance. coworkers are good. not much growth opportunity. Compensation is not good. overall work is good. not good location in term of job relocation.
good,"It was a good company to work for. Sad they are closing down the building and moving to Mexico."
good,"My typical day at work involved managing my existing projects and customers / stakeholders . attending concept meetings to decide on future projects .. leadership , coordination and facilitation of project and system related issues supporting the Peterborough UK , China , India & USA engine facilities ."
good,I have learned that it takes a team effort most days to complete tasks.  A day may included burr audit or cap wherever I am needed the most.  Our supervisor trusts us to do our job safely and promptly.  When the blocks come down to wash and prep rusty the audit process takes most of the 8 Hour shift to complete.  It makes it harder to complete my job and deliver a quality block to assembly.  I enjoy the respectfulness the guys treat one another with on my line.  It says a lot about a person.
good,"Work culture and work life balance in Caterpillar is the best. It's a people company. There is no pressure in work."
good,"Caterpillar es una empresa con muchos Valores, una de las pioridades principalmente es la seguridad. Se preocupa por la gente en cuanto a la Seguridad.Hay eventos deportivos para las familias."
good,"Almost everything about Caterpillar is good. There is some leadership that needs to retire and there are workers that need to get booted. I learned by my recruiter emailing me that if Caterpillar is paying Volt at a $50 per hour or above bill rate, then the contractor (me) will be paid at most $35.00 per hour rate."
good,"Quality is a high priority in my day to day activities, working with the operators to upkeep safety and correcting any concerns which appear through out the day. Out laying the required targets that are involved for the day and helping my fellow Team Leaders resolving issues keeps it a busy and enterprising day."
good,"Good people to work with and for, but the business is sometimes unstable. Lots of lay offs over the last 5 years. Some of it is job market, some of it is business direction."
good,"I liked working there , my co-workers were nice people ,Management was nice to me .I had a scheduled day doing the same required process, there were no hard parts to the job . I liked the fact that the company did things for it's employees and families. I learned a lot about mechanics of different machines and how they operated which was a plus for me because when I got hired I knew nothing about mechanics or machines."
good,I enjoy my field of work with Caterpillar and wish to advance my experience and knowledge in the electronics field. I have worked with some of the most amazing analytical minds in the business and have wanted to pursue advancement myself but there is little opportunity as a lab technician to advance further without completing a four year degree in an engineering related field. Caterpillar removed their tuition reimbursement program for my department during my 3rd class to complete my degree and therefore I had to quit pursuing it as it was too costly at my salary range. This is a great company to work for and I would recommend any person with an engineering degree to pursue a career here.
good,"Caterpillar facilitates employee inclusion and has a very pleasant work environment. Work outside of hours is common, but comfortable. Benefits are good and improving each year. "
good,me enseñe a tomar desiciones sin equivocarme ya que debido a las diferentes areas donde trabaje tuve varias formas de trabajar sin estresarme aprendi a escuchar y ser escuchado me gusto por los constantes cursos que brinda
good,It involved documentation work as well as the coding and testing. It was for both desktop and web applications. Learned a lot about the manufacturing industry event management system.
good,work with co-workers to pick and store parts  take parts to dichtrains load and un load parts from trucks. Like working with co-workers
good,"nice memories of time spent in the company, if only wages were adekwantne to the work done I would have again been.nice atmosphere and compliance with health and safety regulations are firme This made it a one of the best in whose worked"
good,workers were nice management didn't have a clue most of the time what was going on but the workers did luckily for them a fun place to work with overtime always available good canteen very cheap overall not a bad place to work
good,Great place to work. Great supervisors. Not so great job security.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Multinacional que dá condições e ambiente de trabalho propício aos seus funcionários.
good,"This was my first time working in a family owned area. The food was excellent, location wasn't the greatest."
good,"A empresa me deu grandes oportunidades de como é estar inserida dentro de uma multinacional, fazendo com que me preparasse para o mercado de trabalho. Tive contato com pessoas de cargos de alta hierarquia, assim, podendo observar as tomadas de decisões, além do dia-a- dia de cada um. "
good,Caterpillar Global Mining in South Milwaukee is an okay place to work.
good,"Every day, is a different scenario. While it's a company I love, there is allot of insecurity which goes along with it."
good,"Caterpillar  has changed from a company that valued it's employees, to a company that is focused on exclusively on the bottom line.  The atmosphere has changed from one of pride, excitement, collaboration and partnership where jobs are secure to a culture of indifference, conflicting priorities, lack of general direction and ongoing fear of being downsized."
good,"•	Supported Windows Server 2008 R2, work with Active Directory to set user permissions, add/deletes Group Users & Account."
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, somente não possui possibilidade de crescimento/plano de carreira para estagiários."
good,I have been working here for almost 3 years and it seems to me that working your way up from the shop floor is near to impossable. I have applied to many positions at least 20 job posting and only heard back from 1. It would also seem that no matter how hard you work it reslly does not get you anywhere on the floor.
good,Found my jobs at Caterpillar very fulfilling and enjoyable.
good,"other than the Employment Fluctuations nature of manufacturing, I enjoyed working there...Very good work environment for technical minded individuals. Lots of room for growth."
good,A typical day consist of using blue prints to build  components and test them to spec. I've learned to build and test a large variety of components. Co workers are helpful and knowledgable. Hardest part of the job is  new managment not knowing or telling future goals and future of company
good,"In order to advance in this company you have to rub the right elbows. Also there is no fun at work at all. Expect to work 9 hour days without a break or any type of diversion. They do reward the hard work with high pay, but sometimes that is not enough."
good,"Environnement de travail agéable, culture d'entreprise très marquée"
good,"as much as i wanted to love the place it felt like i kept getting beat down. union shop so skill doesn't matter, only seniority based so you notice disciplinary actions getting handed out a bit much even if your intentions were good. in the three years i noticed my annual income decrease each year and the origional job i hired at was nowhere close to where i ended at due to seniority. i hear it used to be ideal but it got hard to get noticed"
good,Must think and be prepared for quick change. it is a easy job and only hard if you make it.
good,"I enjoyed working here. My reason for the low stars is that Management had worked out a deal with the Union to not provide benefits of any kind to new hires for a period of up to two years. Due to a work shortage, I was laid off just before I got to that point. Everyday, the threat of being laid off increased and it was very unsettling."
good,"It was a great learning experience. Grenville, SC is a great area to work."
good,"A typical day at work is fun, productive and get to hang out with some cool co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be finding the parts that you have to run next. The most enjoyable part would be getting to go outside for lunch with some co-workers."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,as a teem our day would start with a short meeting and the I would lead stretching that would tack about ten min. then my partner and I would set up to start our day of welding we had one weld the was hard to do. had to crawl in a hole from the top the hole was 12'' by 20'' once your inside the hole it was 24''x24''x6' and it was hard to move. your in there for one and half hours. and your partner fire watch for you we had a good teem of workers crawlers was a family we did things outside of work together some would bowl and others would hunt and fish. we welded mostly heavy steel bevels and stack welds from 3/4'' to 6'' plate it was a fun job and rewording at the end of the day to see what we had be building it took 8 to 14 weeks to build a crawler and it weight was 79 thousand pounds
good,"Good compensation.  Good career options and trajectory as long as you're in the Peoria, IL area.  Good culture in the Peoria area."
good,"Most days at Caterpillar are packed full of work that needs completed in a timely manner, using overtime if necessary.  I learned how to weld together frameworks by following standard work procedures.  I have always enjoyed working alongside my coworkers and built many friendships that have stretched beyond the workplace.  The hardest part can be completing all the desired work in the amount of time given.  Although, this can also be an enjoyable challenge to work hard through the day and also gives the opportunity for overtime if needed.  The most satisfying part of my job has always been observing my welds after finishing them to admire how nice they look.  "
good,"The work was not to much to handle. I learned how important teamwork is by working at Caterpillar. I've learned how to satisfy consumers, and how to enhance my professionalism. I spent my most enjoyable times socializing with my co-workers and actually planning together how we could make the work that we do; become more effectively, but easy and safe. The hardest part was working when we didn't have any work to do. That made for a long day.The typical day at work was meeting a goal at the end of each day. We had a certain amount of material that needs to be packaged, counted, labeled, and shipped, and my team and I was good at getting the job done."
good,- Job Pace is slow
good,"a typical day at work was alright, it was different each and everyday. i learned how to communicate with more people of different ethnic backgrounds. the management never really was vocal with myself which i thought was wrong. if your in a manger position than you should be vocal with ALL your workers. the hardest part of the job was actually just knowing where to take the load after you finished building. the people were really nice(co-workers). you could talk to all of them without being disrespected and that always made my day."
good,"ok place to work for. management seems to have problem pleasing the employees.some of management won't listen to the employees,while others will do everything to help you.co-workers were ok."
good,Tough place to work overall pay was very good can be dangerous because of large parts on assembly
good,work culture is not very friendly. You work hard but management does not give any recognition.
good,not a bad place to work but no very hot place to work. well managed safe but work is repetitive and low skill required making it get a little boring as there is no challenge whatsoever. good co-workers but overall there is just no job security
good,There's work all the time. Life gets busy at work. But the co-workers will make sure that you have an equal amount of fun.
good,Cat is a wonderful company with great employee. The manager valued your time and sought to make sure the workloads were balanced.
good,"The company I currently work for CATERPILLAR Is a manufacturing facility and has no room for much socializing. Although the supervisors are fair to ther workers the company itself does not value its' employees not even thier management personnel. The only thing this company values it their stock holders. Not the customer or any one else. The only thing they will protect is their image. They even threw out all fans and chairs on the factory floor thinking the workers would work harder if they had no place to sit around. Until someone passed out and fell and hit there head did they bring back the fans. The pay is currently fair and you only have to work 3 of 4 saturdays and they dont force you to work Sundays but you can. medical benifits are fair for now but that is changing, the retirement program is gone but they offer a 401k program for anyone under 20 years of service."
good,Overall Caterpillar is a good company to work for however it is not the greatest. In my four years there as a distribution/warehouse employee I went through probably about 10 different supervisors and I worked in the same area for most of that time. The attendance policy is acceptable but nearly impossible for most people. 3 call in sick days per year and if you hit number 3 you cant miss any more days without suspension/separation for a whole year exactly on the date on which you hit number 3. Again this is doable but sometimes people have a bad year with attendance which leads good employees to getting fired. The management was also very unprofessional. Curse words were used regularly within meetings which I found to not be so good for professionalism by management. Using slang and curse words during meetings seems so unprofessional to me.
good,"Most days it is very stressful. For all the headache and stress that you do have it does not go in hand with the pay that you make an hour. I am trying to further my career, become more knowledgeable, and make better money."
good,I feel like they only should hire and have people do the job that can get the pay of the job they are doing. Other than that it's a great job. I would recommend anyone to work there just pay them right.
good,Good and safe place to work but many opportunities for improvement. There are many good people in the workforce but the heavy production demands often result in frustration.
good,It is a good place to work if you like physical work. It can be a hot and dirty job but challenging. It is a stable job with a strong demand for the product. It has good employee benefits.
good,Work was fairly fast paced but not overwhelming. Employees were nice and willing to help when it was needed. Pay was very well and benifets were great
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"I liked that you could work by yourself and you were also allowed to help others.  Overtime was mostly optional.  Caterpillar lacked apprentice programs, thus limiting individuals within their job."
good,Meeting in the mornings to discuss the days agenda. How to be patient and learned to lead. The culture was pretty stressful. Worrying about lay offs. The most enjoyable thing at work was learning
good,"Lack of people skills for some of the managers, but overall a good place to work but there is a lot of different personalities but if you give a 100% to the job you will have a good career"
good,"Experienced a lot of negativity from other employees, and bad attitudes. Training on machines needed improvement. Was not adequately trained in some areas."
good,I really enjoy my job out there. I was converted to full time in only 4.5 months. And if you’re converted it makes a big difference. One of the cons I experienced was getting a new boss after only 2 months and they don’t share notes. I recently won a job bid for a higher paying job. Also if you’ve worked there a year and are full time you can transfer to another plant in whatever state you want. The Layoffs is obviously the biggest con but if you’re a great employee and have a lil bit of seniority it may not even effect you. Plus you can draw unemployment until they call you back.
good,"Tryggt bolag. Stark ekonomi. Långsamt. SMART-goals. Befordringar kan upplevas som politiska. Det är troligen viktigare att göra rätt internt än att fokusera allt för hårt på kundvärde. Mellancheferna håller bolaget i ett järngrepp."
good,"Trabalho bem dinâmico, experiência em movimentação de fabricação e estoque com uso de equipamento móvel, coordenação bem profissional, ambiente de trabalho bem agitado, dificuldade com relação a adaptação com a movimentação."
good,Management at this location a very bad lack of communication from day shift and night shift. Changes dont happen unless its forced by outside influences. If you like overtime they give it out because of the bad turnover rate. Your only allowed 3 call ins per year and PTO does not scale with length of time you work for them.
good,"Not a bad place to work, a lot of changes has been made and management and rules constantly change. Pay is decent and overall relaxed friendly environment."
good,"Excellent job as long as you can keep it. Benefits were excellent, most of the employees were easy enough to get along with. Management however was another story. What they wanted you to do for the same task/mold/job would change almost daily. Each supervisor also has their own agenda. At least one employee was fired because a supervisor let them go home early, and then reported them for doing so. The employee was told they walked out without permission and were escorted from the premises when they came back to work the next day."
good,in assembly I learned how to build a lot minor subs to help build tractors and in tube assembly I learned how to operate a eaton lenorad cnc tube bending machine
good,Working at the local cat plat was a good experience.  the only problem was i knew it was going to close down when i got the job. The work was rough but doable.
good,Good career great opportunities to further your knowledge and career. Good people to work with. The only down side is all the hours away from home and when you do get time at home you are steadily working from phone or laptop.
good,Abgesehen von dem Management ist die Arbeit sehr gut. Man wird immer wieder durch neue Arbeiten gefordert und die Teams sind sehr gut zusammengestellt. Lediglich die Vorgesetzten können nicht zwischen Arbeit und Freizeit unterscheiden.
good,"I enjoyed not knowing what to expect with my job on a daily basis. I learned something new everyday. I understand and respect the decisions Corporate America Companies make. We the people must adjust, adapt, and move on."
good,"Good place to work good colleagues, management is not that great always want to follow old process. Good travel opportunities company is great, good salary"
good,"If anyone line big yellow machines , engines, generators and then Caterpillar is fun place to work, only problem for me no chance to grow. Otherwise I have learnt a lot in my 4.5 years as full time and 2.5 years as supplier to caterpillar, I wish I had opportunity to grow in this company."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"good place to work when the sales are good, stay hourly as long as possible once you go salary they will own you and work you a lot of hours by putting a lot on your plate"
good,"I enjoyed my job , a typical work day was filled with 10 hours of building cables. Training  people on new and old processes. I enjoyed working my way up from being an assembler worker to working in the engineering department with a wonderful supervisor to from whom I have learned and accomplish a lot."
good,My overall view of this company is that it's a great place to learn and understand the culture of business. Also this company spends time training emp
good,"Resolving the tickets for  the client"
good,"Caterpillar is a good company to work for.  The pay and benefits are competitive.  Potential for advancement is great.  They promote life values and uphold them, which many companies don't do."
good,"Flexible timings, lots of learning opportunities, discouraging innovation, lack of growth opportunities"
good,"Working on the C-15 assembly line. Working as a team makes the work day go by easily when everyone involved has the same goal in mind. Being a team lead, came with also having to do work on a regular basis."
good,"brilliant job but only if you are full time and get on  well with people, expect alot of angry managers due to not meeting targets (not your fault)"
good,Hardworking teams lacking good leadership. I worked with very smart and dedicated people. The new Chicago headquarters may blow new life into this company.
good,"Some of the management really sucks some of them don't even know what they are doing. And you basically have to suck up if you want to get promoted once there's a job opening that you're interested in. They expect you to do other people's job even though it's not in your job description to do it, which I think it is totally unfair."
good,"We pull work order, load and unload the truck. Great location and safe place to be with co-worker. when working as a team. Plus nice benefits you can smile about."
good,Mining industry downturn has affected its growth potential. Otherwise a good company to work for. When the mining industry picks up Caterpillar might do better
good,"I was trained very well on this hotel, I gained confident and have a wonderful experience through the members of superiors, lots of fun and good experiences happenings"
good,Big facility. A lot of people.  I feel like its one of those work places where you have to stay to yourself and just do work.  Overall it was a great place to work.  A lot of friendly people and the pay was good.
good,"El horario de llegada es bastante flexible y define tu hora de salida, hay espacios para breaks, el almuerzo es bastante amplio, hasta el momento todos tienen muy buena disposicion en caso de dudas. Aprendí bastante acerca de todos los productos financieros que Cat Financial, además de experienciar la realidad del ambiente de trabajo en Chile. Los Managers son muuuy amables y a pesar de su escazo tiempo siempre tienen minutos para atender dudas que a uno le surgan. Los colegas son todos muy simpaticos y amigables, como dije anteriormente se da un ambiente grato. No hay nada dificil. Y lo que mas me gusto es la flexibilidad que tiene la oficina, en cuanto a horarios, trabajo y breaks."
good,"Testing fuel systems for maximum engine performance and emissions."
good,"I am fortunate to work at a facility where the people are committed to their work, the quality of our product and making a difference. They are Team Players from the top down and generous with their time to a fault, both professionally and civically.  "
good,Compensation is very good. Medical insurance is OK. Allow employee to work from home two days a week which is nice. Coworkers are friendly and helpful.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"the work day was productive and fun my output was 94%"
good,"Caterpillar is a place where you get the job completed in this order; safely, with quality, quickly, with cost in mind. I have enjoyed working for Caterpillar and the culture that has been developed here is outstanding. There are many good experiences to be had working for a Fortune 500 company and it helps to give you an edge going forward. The hardest part of the job is to make sure you are managing your time wisely and completing projects and tasks on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are part of a great work atmosphere and part of a good culture,"
good,"Overall a pretty decent company to work for"
good,Caterpillar has been a good place to work at. Work hours are Mon-Fri 7am to 330 with some overtime when needed. The work is easy and people are easy going friendly and willing to help in any way they can. The hardest part of the job is knowing that they will be closing in months to come and having to start all over again. I have learned so much here about generators from assemble them to testing them.
good,"This was a decent place to work, they have announced recently they are closing the doors. The bennefits were excellent here as far as insurance and retirement. They did require many hours of mandatory overtime though, and it took away from home life when it was every week. Hard to climb the ladder for advancement, but once upon a time it was a stable job, so we thought."
good,Good company for the personal growth . opportunity to learn cross platform which makes every day challenging and keep you occupied .Teams are really amazing .
good,Lots of great opportunities at Caterpillar to develop skills and find what you like doing by changing jobs every three years.
good,"Caterpillar was a fun place to work due to the people that I was working with."
good,"Conservative culture, very process driven but this leads to process excellence can see why this is a Fortune 50 company with a 80+ year history of growth"
good,Caterpillar is a good paying job with great benefits but be careful of supervisor that want to make a name for themselves
good,Ok place to work but if you do a good job they will just keep giving you more and more until they break you. Our location has always been the last stop for all equipment before it went to the junk yard so we never really had nice things.
good,A day at work consist of constant lifting and moving. There are a lot of different ergonomic movements that are hard to work through. The co-workers are not always the nicest people to work with. I have learned how to use different torque tools and different bolts and fixtures. How to assemble different parts for the tractors. The hardest part of my job is the hours and the people that I work with. The most enjoyable part is when 3:30 comes and I get to go home after a long night at work.
good,El desarrollo constante hace mejorar el nivel de conocimiento y motiva a la constante mejora continua en general el ambiente de trabajo agradable y la diversidad cada ves se muestra mejor.
good,"This Caterpillar facility builds after-treatment emissions products for a variety of machinery to include: Stationary generators, locomotives, ocean vessel, and Caterpillar machinery."
good,Um lugar onde se tem muitos beneficios porem a chance de se crescer sem alguem conhecido te empurrando e muito dificil
good,Excelente ambiente laboral aprendi a rotular un poco porque no es tan facil
good,"Most days are steady in terms of the workload."
good,"I liked how I was able to take care of my family while I was there. there were good people who worked there also. but like I said when management changed, I don't believe it changed for the good. It was more on people having there picks, rather than right being right and wrong being wrong. nine years I was there with no write ups, no safety issues, no attendance problems. And one day I was there, and the next I was gone."
good,The job itself is great. The supervisors are great. The job security isn't that great but that is more on the economy and not the company.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Failed model engines so uneven work timings."
good,Being able to lead a facility of 160 employees and walk the talk.   You have the distinct ability to lead and develop their careers even if they thought it not possible.  Being able to take a facility that was underperforming and develop it to where it was starting to see very positive results.
good,"busy from beginning of shift to end made the days fly by. i gained more variety of forklift experience. My co-workers and the management are very nice and professional. when it came to difficulty, loading the trailers would be would be at the top of the list. But when i finished loading on time it gave me a great sense of satisfaction."
good,good company.  managers sometimes not trained properly before starting job.
good,"I enjoyed working there.  Got a little too hot in the summer months, but they office balanced things out.  Felt as if things could have ended better amongst us but i feel as if the lady that was hiring the temps could've used better people skills."
good,You go to work you take three little breaks then you go home and do it all again tomorrow.
good,"Set times for work, polite co-works. Many levels of support from quality, to materials, to management"
good,"tipical day at work- My co workers and i have a toolbox meeting and talk about safty and prodouctivity "
good,job experience was moderate at best the work environment was uncomfortable that if other supervisor did like you as a person you be fired or fired you for no reason that was not even work-related. pay was excellent and production was great. the best time was working with my coworker they made the job easy
good,Always wear proper personal protective equipment
good,"There was always plenty to be done, but expectations were generally too high. Management had very poor communication skills. The company itself makes questionable decisions and does not invest in its employees enough. Co-workers on the shop floor are all good people, corporate employees where very shady."
good,"I worked in the forge shop where they made links for the track type tractor treads. Variety ofdutie that included polish dies, grinding dies to make links conform to specifications. Also remove broken screws/bolts. The last 2 plus years I was there I also was in charge of the bolster area. Disassembling bolsters at the end of a production run. Disassembling, cleaning, checking details for wear, replacing broken/worn details, working with toolroom to get new details made or with scheduler to get new parts ordered for bolsters, reassembling bolsters, making sure the calculations were correct for working height of bolster."
good,"Decent place to work, but no room to advance. Safety is a top priorety."
good,"azienda ben gestita "
good,"I enjoyed working with Caterpillar, until restructuring started and they axed a bunch of people. Total shell game and glad I've moved on to other opportunities."
good,All around there needs to be a better work environment. The managers need to be managed. They need to treat their women employees with more respect. Money was good though.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,I liked working at caterpillar but there where sometimes where we had to work on day that where giving off and then we weren’t allowed of because of managerial.
good,I used to work at catapiller driving forklift it was a good job they treated me fair the weekly pays were great and the over time was great also you get two ten minutes break half an hour lunch break and it's paid the supervisor was a good guy my attendance was ok and I love working for the company.
good,"Needed better training on some machines, making sure operators are competent before letting them operate alone without more experienced operators monitoring operations. Would reduce chance of accidents."
good,"Caterpillar is Caterpillar. My experience has been good. I have had good training, good management on the loca level and been treated well. The pay is good and the work is reasonable. The job security is as with anything with Caterpillar, dependent on bottom line and stock holder share. You dont hire on to caterpillar without knowing this. So with that mentality i have few complaints."
good,la politique HSE/LCC sont respecté ce qui donne une environnement de travail agréable.
good,I worked at Cat while i was attending college. This position worked well for me because it allowed me to study in my down time. This is a great job for anyone who likes a slow pace work environment or any college student who needs to work while attending college.
good,"Melhor ambiente de trabalho pelo qual já passei;"
good,strenuous job but pay is good. people are friendly. but an education is needed in order to advance.typical day is in a team environment and you  move really fast.
good,"I can’t really say much about caterpillar it was a ok job while it lasted , I just feel like they could be more lenient towards the new employees that come in but I guess they’re strick no matter if your new or not ."
good,"Pay and benefits are top of the market, but restructuring is a way of life at Caterpillar. Addtiionally the company is shrinking its foot print to be Peoria or China. This creates much stress in understanding if your job will be moving. If you are comfortable with relocating this is not an issues. If you are a dual income family this is difficult as eventually you have to decided who's career is going to move forward."
good,"It's an OK place to work. Not great, not horrible. Some decent people work there and made good friends, but in most cases there is few advancement opportunities and pay is OK, but not great."
good,Los días en caterpillar suelen ser retadores por el compromiso que se tiene con los clientes.
good,"Supervision on trades personnel / pre-starts, apprentice training / parts / plan project lay-out job QA standards."
good,"All the emplyees has to do all the type of work like from requirement testing,System testing, Software developement,Integration testing."
good,great company far benefits helpful eager to move on to the next conquest always has company's best interests in mind.  with restructuring occurring perfect time to enter the company and climb the ranks
good,good place to work but the layoffs are regular.i learned alot despite of it.being a storage controller i learned all the different parts to make up a engine and to see how everything works together.
good,"Get co-workers"
good,"From a labor to a material supervisor I was able to learn, grow, excel, and educate within the corporation while not having to relocate."
good,"I really enjoy working with the people on the shop floor, they are friendly and work well together, but it's the environment that is not very nice to work in its very hot and dirty, and currently the job is very much hands on with little to no support from upper management."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"I feel that management at Caterpillar, does not communicate well with employees and workers, instead of facing issues or problems head on, or team leads and section mangers tends to send texts back and forth, to handle situations, instead of speaking to the workers to resolve those issues. There are times when the lines are full, or stocks run out of parts, and it seems like there's a problem when workers are talking to pass time, after sweeping and cleaning work area, when I I feel that all workers should enjoy coming and going to work, instead of making a stressful environment. I love the job, the co-workers in my department, we all feel like family, even spending time with each other families outside the work place. I learned to keep an open mind, and focus on what ever task that needed to be completed, even when someone is not having a grate day. We work hard as workers and never get appreciate for doing a great job. Each morning before our shift began, we huddle up and have a moment to check in with each other, to see who's out and not feeling well before, heading to the line. I'm always someone who's looking to better myself as a person, absorb much information and knowledge, that's needed to complete what ever the job is."
good,I worked 5AM to 3PM shift. The supervisor manages 2 valve streams and spends only 5% of the day in my department. There is several personnel who do just the minimal amount of work to get by. Management always disciplines everyone when it is a few that don't do their job. There is no recognition for employees who do way above what is expected of them. A lot of co-workers are friendly and get along with each other. The hardest part of the job is the high absent rate of a few co-workers while management while allows it to continue with no discipline action.
good,A good employer with a strong focus on safety to employees. Opportunity to advance knowledge and position in the company was available. A strong American business culture (although hard to take at times) has ensured the company's long term success.
good,"Ganhei muita experiencia , acumulou um peso em meu currículo , empresa muito boa de se trabalhar , ótimas instalações"
good,It was a great place to work before caterpillar took over. I planned on staying there until I retired. The co-worker were some of my best friends it was a great place to work when it was bucyrus
good,Management well taken care of yearly and production employee's are expected to do more yearly with very little to no compensation.
good,"Good Place to Learn and develop my skills, "
good,Nice environment to learn and work Golden gate and data guard stuff worked with offshore teams and SAP teams to proof the business module.
good,"-	entering and tracking orders"
good,"a typical day at work was fast moving and enjoyable. they trained me in safety, blueprint reading, quality control, crane operations, assembly, proper tool uses. the co workers were easy to get along with and easy to work with. the hardest part of the job was waiting for the tools and parts to either be repaired or replenished. The best part of the job was knowing that i was producing a high quality machine."
good,"Strong Safety awareness  for all employees, team oriented and always trying to keep staff motivated and content to be at work by great incentives,  continuous learning for all employees, great benefits  and vacation time off.  You felt like you were working with your family, everyone was very nice to work with.  The hard part of the job is hoping we had a job due to the mining economy in the past years"
good,"It's a good place to work, great people, great enviroment, good job"
good,"everybody is very professional."
good,"•	Responsible for the safe and efficient operation of reach-truck forklifts, standard forklifts, 10K/30K skid steers, tuggers, cranes, boom trucks, and hoists."
good,i was installing the engines and transmissions to the r2900g underground loaders
good,"A empresa é muito boa para -se trabalhar é uma emprasa que valoriza seus funcionarios ,tem uma grande preocupação com a segurança de seus funcionarios."
good,Could improve with communication. Do more with training new employees. Too much work place politics lot of ted tape when nack from medical leave. Not.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"You are expected to make quota of a certain amount of parts, which can be a challenge with someone with periodic muscle loss and/or  strength due to a medical diagnosis. They agreed to make accommodations due to medical challenges and they did not comply."
good,"On a typical work day. I'd be in a reach truck, order picker, or forklift. Safety was the number one concern in the warehouse. Next was how productive were your numbers. That's what kept our jobs."
good,"Overtime promised, but that was happening only in some departments. The drive from SA to Seguin was hurting $$ otherwise it was a great place to work."
good,"Hace casi 18 años que estuve ahi, asi que no creo que sea buen referente en mi opinion, pero cuando labore ahi, faltaban recursos humanos, y me toco dormir y bañarme en la empresa para cubrir el 2do y 3er turno"
good,very multicultural environment. Its hard to get into leader positions if your not in the ole buddy click. The pay is fair for the responsibilities. More pay would be good
good,"es una empresa mundial-mente reconocida, por lo cual, esta comprometida con los trabajadores y el medio ambiente"
good,Expectations were high but I feel that created an environment where employees took pride in their work.  They knew they were help creating a good product for the customers.
good,Unfortunately for me Caterpillar decided to relocated to another state and I was not able to continue working for them.  I had a great job with them and I really regret them leaving the state
good,Enjoyed the teamwork and brand awareness. Management was very open and skillful in communicating to the team. Manufacturing processes were very clearly defined and job role well distributed to workers.
good,Great Company but less opportunities for advancement and major layoffs. Overall the company is a good company other than the points mentioned above.
good,"Run an hourly worn tool report, pull worn tools off Mazak machines, refurbish tools, drop tool back off at the Mazak machine. You have to be organized, pay attention to detail, prioritize work load, problem solve and be able to multi-task throughout your shift. With getting training on how to build the tools, I also learned what the tools do in the machines to each part that machine is running. My co-workers are easy to get along with. The hardest part is having patience and understand that everyone does not work at the same pace. I enjoy working by myself because I can organize my shift and routines to my liking."
good,"the managers need to work on communication."
good,"Typical day is running 5to6 presses producing,inspectingand cleaning mount parts. I've learned a great deal of integrity and team work, also safety. The hardest part of the job is coming home safely every day. Best part is coming home to family."
good,"Located in South Milwaukee Wisconsin, Caterpillar Global Mining formerly known as Bucyrus International, Inc. is a very process oriented. Bucyrus was acquired by Caterpillar in 2011 and was quite a culture shock for former Bucyrus employees as Caterpillar values quality over quantity."
good,"Get to work, have a meeting, exercise then setup my machine if we have work.Learned about cuplings sizes and shapes and the dangers if not put together properly. Management is good. Coworkers are ok. The hardest part of the job is when we don't have work and have to look busy. The most enjoyable part is when they give us lunch."
good,"Worked 2nd and 3rd shift went over with the person from the prevoius shift what was going on. From there either I had to do rework or just star welding then grinding. I also tacked and preped in Medium Wheel Loaders and ran a CLOSS robot on Large Wheel Loaders. I never welded before i got to Cat but i went through a 6 week traning program. Some of the managers i had did not have any people skills at all, but I did have awesome co-workers with me. We helped each other in anyway we could and you learned of each other. Getting burn marks on myself really sucked but I loved making something out of nothing, it was like art to me."
good,"I think caterpillar is an overall good place to work. However, They have a hard time keeping managers employed because the amount of hours they have to put in or because they simply just dont work out. Most people start off as a temporary employee and then if you were chosen you would become a permanent employee for caterpillar. The downfall with caterpillar is that it is very hard to become a full time converted employee because of the fact that you may have a new supervisor every few months."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"It has been long since I worked there, things might have changed now. I started at Caterpiller, for a fresh grad there was lot of trainings available for you to learn and do the job well."
good,it was a great place to work. the only problem is my group leader played favoritism when it came to females. i overall enjoyed my experience at caterpillar
good,Solo falta mejorar el salario ya que por el trabajo que realizas no está muy bien remunerado
good,"Overall Caterpillar is a great place to be employed, like all jobs some of the people are unfavorable, the hours are good as well as the pay, the environment is cooled and heated according to the weather so it's always comfortable to work"
good,the people there are amazing and fun to work with. the job wasn't hard. the hours were pretty decent. the benefits were outstanding great. the company has many ways for you to excel in the company.
good,"Excellent Job, and culture, and employees at the working level.   Unfortunately, upper leadership lacks vision and they're taking the company in the wrong direction.  Focused more on shareholder value versus the customer or the employee."
good,"The workload for my position with Caterpillar was fair. However, I was the victim of a business decision by the company to save money that resulted in the closure of my plant. Because of this, I am not sure that I would ever want to work for Caterpillar again."
good,"Handlinh Lead Project of Visionlink Project which is integration of Salesforce.com via SOAP API writing Apex Class , VF Pages and batch apex as per the requirement."
good,Great place to work had fun learned a lot as long as you can keep up without falling behind. not a bad place to work at management was OK for the most part. be honest hardest part of the job was keeping my eyes open at then end of shift.
good,Good Company to work with. Mostly work life balance is good about this company. Good work culture and no micro management
good,pull orders drive forklift get things ready to ship load truck some ups
good,1. Safety First
good,"job ok need more pay"
good,A typical day working at caterpillar was easy and interesting I met nice people along the way while i worked there. A couple things i learned was how to drive the stand up forklift and also how to go high into the racks to get parts down. The hardest part about the job was learning how to drive the fort lift. The most enjoyable part about the job was the people i met and the people i work with day in and day out.
good,"klasseren"
good,Good place to work for someone just starting out. Insurance and benefits are great. Have opportunity to advance but you have to apply for and get called in for an interview.
good,The  work place culture is very good. The people that work for there are like family. It is very enjoyable to work with such great people every day. Thats what I enjoy the must about working there.
good,"Overall, I great place to work and friendly and loving environment.  I ran a lot of machines, and wont list them however we imputied offsets and manual offsets to make sure parts were in spec.  Everyone was very friendly and to this day still wish our ending was a different story."
good,"é dez ....pra mim foi excelente trabalhar . eu queria voltar á trabalhar de novo se eu tivese  uotra opotunidade eu estaria la de novo com maior"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"First enginnering job experience, applying basic task and quality analysis"
good,"I love my job, but I just got semi-promoted. So I am still in my old role, but took on the responsibilities of another role because my company is being budget conscious and decided not to fill the roll with a new employee, so I’m constantly struggling with time management. I now have two bosses that I report to and keeping track of everything is a little overwhelming, all though, I’m sure as time goes on it will get easier. :)"
good,"It was a fast paced laid back work environment.  I enjoyed my team and how they hired from within, they do care more about the retiring guys and making ure they are taken care of as opposed to making sure the newer guys with 10 or less years in company have anything to look forward to."
good,"team leads are some what ok "
good,"My summary is all that is needed to be the Caterpillar motto.  Mention it to anyone that has either worked there or is working there and they will agree with it.  The company has so many meetings about the meeting your going to have and then a meeting after the meeting that you talked about.  It truly is a wonder how anything gets done with management as they put in such ridicules processes that cause double work only so they can promote their own agenda and work their way up the corporate ladder instead of helping out their team.   Some managers have backbones and fight for their teams, but unfortunately they are few and far between.  Usually those are the ones that are getting ready to retire anyway, so they don't care what top management thinks.  They moved a lot of their support overseas which makes sense because they are in a different timezone from the US and expect to have them work tickets that they can't really work.  People stateside expect support, but no techs left to support during normal business hours.  Just sad all around."
good,"A job is a job. Pay decent.OK management. It's all about safety until its time to those numbers , that's when safety goes out the window.People that don't deserve it always get promoted just because they have a degree, but not work experience."
good,"i have worked there for 32 years and have enjoyed it. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful. There wasn't really a hard part of the job because i enjoyed doing it .I would like the challange and satisfactsion of doing prototypes of which we don't do any more, so really i have lost some of my skills"
good,"This company has some nice people, but the managers is what makes this place a difficult work environment. They are very full of themselves/ rude. Would not recommend"
good,Raises are almost non existent unless you're liked by your group manager. They have never paid bonuses ( if you want to call them that) on time. Advancements will not happen unless you are in the little circle of good old boys. Caterpillar as whole is a great company. Corinth Reman facility was a joke.
good,"Overall a decent place to work, easy work for decent pay.  Frustrating because of the way they hire supplimental employees. Work hard and follow the rules and don't miss any days, and they end up converting someone that just hired in. Even someone that has missed a bunch of days."
good,Used to an environment promoting Teamwork and Excellence but that had gone by the way side. It was impressive that I knew my Team members birthdays including there wives and childrens names and birthdays. Now I know too much. Its not about the employees anymore.
good,"My typical work day varied as I held many positions during my tenure with the company. "
good,"Daily routine consist of a daily work flow so being bored is not really an option. Have learned how the logistics business functions from receiving the product, packing the product, shipping the product and storing the product. There is a hassle free policy in place so that other employees harassing or giving others a hard time, creating a hostile work environment will not be tolerated. There is no really hard areas in the facility because they actually take the time to show you all the aspects of any position you are assigned to. A enjoyable time for most employees is the gain sharing that is paid out every quarter. It normally averages around $300 to $400 per quarter unless the organizations sales have gained, then your pay out will increase accordingly."
good,Not very family oriented. When I started there 13 years ago we had a family day every year and Christmas Parties that included everyones kids. Now we are lucky to get a Christmas/Thankgiving party for the associates.  The culture of this facility has really gone downhill over the past 5 years
good,Safety introduction trainings are to be more detailed and more visual images need to be available  in various working zones across the facility of the company.
good,"On a typical day I arrive at 7 clock in, attend morning meeting then get to my station and set up my computer and gauges for the day. Then inspect parts as they become available, log non-conformances, and repot data."
good,"Caterpillar was new to our area and had a lot of growing in their leadership and hiring practices. It was an enjoyable job and I liked my co workers.  The work could get tedious but we were kept extremely busy.  I learned about the workings of plant work and mandatory overtime, point system and computer analysis of calibrations.  Despite my injury on the job I enjoyed my time in their workplace."
good,"The work environment at the logistics facility is very stressful,employees are often asked on a very short notice to work overtime.There isn't very much room for employees to advance and when there is they often hire someone off the the street with less experience."
good,Work was always challenging. Never knew what you would be facing one day to the next. Quality inspection and cycle counting were a big part of this job.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,A company with employees that were willing to go beyond their means to make the product the very best in the world and took pride in their work.
good,Currently on a hiring freeze.  Minimal chance for advancement.
good,"Caterpillar is an industry behemoth. However, the upper tier management seems content with playing catch up to the rest of the world. In times of economic despair, Caterpillar seems to trip over stacks of dollars in an effort to pick up nickels and dimes. Their recent history (~5 yrs) they have shown that they are willing to sacrifice experienced employees when times start to get rough, then have to scramble to restaff when things turn around. If you are a salaried employee, you stand a better chance to maintain your job. However, if you are under contract, you are just meat for the grinder. Despite the differences in experience, even if you out-qualify a salaried employee, when things get tough, you should start looking for new employment. Caterpillar would rather maintain lower quality/less experienced personnel at a higher pay than keep more experienced professionals that are paid less."
good,rapid and on point work.
good,"I enjoyed working for CAT overall. I homed in on skills that I didn't use for some time, and meant a lot of great people. Management is Cat biggest downfall. Employees should be based on skill levels instead of friendships."
good,go into work check the 40 or so diff areas that i knew the job and find out witch one was the farthest behind and work in that station that day. the next day the samething all over again
good,"The Driveline/Transmission Reman facility in West Fargo is "
good,Limited move for growth and new job opportunities.  Management is very strict to the point of being restrictive.  There is no room for innovation and most employees only show up to get a paycheck.
good,Skip I do not wish to participate in this survey.  Why is this required?  Please do not continue to ask these questions.  I am just typing to get to 150.
good,"As Team Lead of Team Lead of Hosting Services Infrastructure Implementation team, I lead a diverse team of IT infrastructure professionals serving as technical experts who oversee or participate in a variety of analytical and technical assignments providing compute, storage, data protection and network connectivity within Caterpillar data centers."
good,"If you love manufacturing this would be a great place to work. However, the company does not do a great job with culture. Horrible annual cycles of job freezes and poor planning."
good,"Days are fast paced"
good,Caterpillar helped me better my communication skills and work skills.  Their are many different cultural people that come to work there. I learned more about other people lives and it helped me as a person.
good,Not a bad place to work money was good but the work environment wasn't stress free as it should have plus they didn't take time to train fresh new employee's who came into the company .
good,"Caterpillar has great benefits that make employment awesome. My only real complaints is that management is lazy, and my facility shut down and moved production out of the country."
good,Good place to work overall  well reworded for hard work very hot in summer and cold in winter they have a good canteen were meal are subsided so cheap
good,I am temporarily considered a temp worker with no benefits. Working 40 hours a week Monday  thru Thursday. I enjoy my job having opportunity to learn how to operate large crane.Transferring tractor from dolly to jig.Then installing rollers to tractor.
good,"When I hired in, it was a company that was as loyal to its people as its people were to it.  People did spend the extra time to make sure things were done right."
good,The environment  inside caterpillar is awesome. And the working condition is related as Per their designation.job nature in logistics is complex. Satisfaction guaranteed is the main key.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"The work was easy, I learned how a engine was made and installed fuel injectors, engine heads and gaskets. It was unknown however how the schedule looked until the Wednesday before the weekend. We had a strict days off system (Sick days, emergencies, personal days were all pulled together into 5 days off for the year), little chance of advancement."
good,Organization was a nice place to work and meet interesting people. A lot of change management initiatives to help employees during the acquisition to Neovia.
good,"groupe international, dans lequel j'ai pu faire évoluer mes competences en gérant 4 marques différentes(Heritage brand group): caterpillar footwear/sebago/Harley Davidson et Wolverine"
good,"good training.Industrial machine maintenance of production machinery. Production personnel input maintenance concerns on local computers. Then equipment down ticket is issued into system. Duties consist of accessing plant maintenance program located on computers throughout very large facility. Then repairing mechanical and electrical problems, ordering replacement parts from storage, frequently delivered to site. Certified to work with live power under 600 volts."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Caterpillar, but there is an attitude by management that the hourly workers are the enemy, even in the non-union plants."
good,"For some people, movement is very easy from position to position, for others the process is very tedious. The ""process"" is followed up until someone decides not to."
good,"I have been with CAT for 16 & 1/2 years. I have moved up throughout the facility by being a leader and doing what was asked of me and more, to excel, and become a prosperous employee. I have lead my teams to success and trained each of them their roles, using Sarbanes Oxley guidelines, Caterpillar guidelines, and pure professional relationships. My team is one of the best teams as far as performance, attendance, and responsibilities. the hardest part of the job, is dealing with very demanding managers who aren't fully trained in the area that I am in charge of."
good,"worked any where from 8 to 16 hours straight, built parts for a fuel injections, and fuel pumps all day long, worked on a assembly line some times as well"
good,"Manage new product introduction program and project schedules, as well as program and portfolio management."
good,overall it was a good job early start but early finish I was there two years but the work died down and a load of us got laid off.
good,"Management changes a lot. "
good,"was a machinist for 10 yrs a lot off ups and downs lay offs and call backs , union is week but still takes there dues , its good pay when the work is available"
good,"no job security. They are all about the share holders and profits, to stay competitive they take from their employees even when there are record profits."
good,"- learned many CAD skills and project planning "
good,the position i had with the company was a fast paced  but the other people i worked with were friendly and understanding.my supervisors and trainers were very supportive.i enjoyed the job most days.
good,Working with 5 Managers it takes a calm collective person to be able to take things in stride and prioritize tasks.  Not only do I do the things these 5 managers ask I also have their section managers and then the team members under them that could ask me to do things at anytime.  There is great flexibility and focus on team work.
good,My Caterpillar facility requires a lot of walking and lifting.There is a lot of turnover of Associates and Management.Culture depends a lot on immediate supervisor.I enjoy the pace as the day goes by quick but have to lift a lot from up high and stoop a lot with heavy items.Learned use of RF Guns.and UPS and Fed EX shipping systems.It's not a bad job but I miss assembly work and prefer it to logistics.
good,It's not to bad of a place to work for. My job has me working out side in all weather conditions. I work alone about 95% of the time. I drive various vehicles to store parts into location.
good,"This really is a great job if you want to have no life outside of it. 60 to 70 hr work weeks that pay mediocre and alot is taken in taxes. Great family vibe if your put with the right team, alot of kids work there so there is a pretty high turnover rate. Very low tolerance for being even a minute late."
good,"A day of troubleshooting of C32 Caterpillar Engine over heating, i learnt how to apply seven step diagnostic.troubleshooting principle. A good work place safety culture was observed. The hardest part was the removal of defective water pump. The most enjoyable part is the installation of the new water pump"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"enjoyed working there for 17 years ...the work was good and you always got moved about on different jobs .great pension scheme .share scheme,good pay health and safety was excellent"
good,"This was a great place to work.  We had a great project team and we all worked and helped each other virtually.  Very team oriented. "
good,when you think of caterpillar you think of a strong company however the distribution center i belong to lacks great leadership management does not follow up with supervisors and its commonly known on the warehouse floor that once you become a supervisor you can slack off because it is whats visible. Lack of advancement in the company unless your willing to relocate to the midwest. overall if you have the work ethic to come in and do your job you should be fine but in every warehouse you will have childish issues you will run into.
good,"Caterpillar is a great, industry-leading company to work for to gain experience. Their Leadership and Technical Development (LTDP) program is an outstanding three-year rotational program designed to provide broad experience within a specific functional area. Offered great leadership opportunities and project experience. However, there are many layers of management, a lot of rules and regulations that hinder continuous improvement and creative thinking. An old culture and way of doing things limits creativity in the organization. Very political organization forces one to get to know the right people in the organization in order to advance in certain areas. Company currently downsizing making it difficult to stay positive and secure."
good,"Too many layoffs...."
good,"Bom local de trabalho, atividades bem divididas entre os colaboradores, excelente tratamento entre funcionários."
good,"era muito bom, a cada dia eu aprendia algo novo, foi uma ótima experiência."
good,"Overall Caterpillar is a decent place to work. Job is fast paced and makes you feel rushed the whole time you are there. This causes stress for all employees. We work four ten hour shifts, which makes for a three day weekend which is a plus. I have learned a lot from working at Caterpillar for four years but get the feeling of being ""stuck"" and I am looking for advancement so I can really put my skills and knowledge to the test!"
good,Business was being sold by Caterpillar and I was downsized. Interesting work but the physical working conditions were not the best.

good,"Long work days and weeks, most average 50 hour weeks. They have us come in early and stay late. If you need time off, you have to use your vacation time first or they deduct your time off from that. Bonuses are late. There is definately a buddy system here. Rules don't apply to everyone."
good,"Throughout my time at caterpillar, I learned a lot of production elements. It was sometimes beneficial in recognizing the company but the emplyees always were in the shadows."
good,"Enjoy work I do but there is no advancement in this department and in 2013 13,000 people were layed off from Caterpillar. I need the jobsecurity and advancement in my career."
good,"When I worked here, management left a lot to be desired.  Basically,  you were given projects and certain responsibilities and left alone.  I had fell through the cracks and was not pleased with it."
good,"Rever procedimentos e normas antes de executar qualquer tipo de atividade."
good,Körde truck mest hela tiden och tog emot gods och levererade godset till olika avdelningar. Och sedan plockade via truck och lastade godset för leverans.
good,"my typical day at work was to start off by a team meeting, then we would stretch.After stretching we would inspect our equipment to insure that it is in presten working order. I leared how to work an over head crane and also use torque tools. My co-workers were very helpful to help you understand the job. the hardest part of the job was having no work."
good,Good work place and offered a lot of hours but couldn't move up the ladder.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"It's a decent place to work with good benefits. Still uses the good ol' boy system for promotions. If you want to move up, it's about who you know, not your qualifications."
good,J'aimerai bien revenir en tant que l’ingénieure quand je finirai mes études.
good,Due to their high turn rate they have a zero tolerance policy for just about anything. Very strict on their rules around the place of work/ work zones
good,"Buena empresa el problema que los cambios de turno son cada 2 semanas, y eso es desgastan te para el cuerpo."
good,"Caterpillar is a good place to work. Pay could be better. Work/life balance could be better. Much mandatory overtime could stretch into 70-plus hour weeks. Lots of management changes, too."
good,"I was a contract worker. Caterpillar contracts out a lot of its work as the company is moving forward with its plan to ship most jobs out of the country. They were good to me, but I knew my job was temporary."
good,This company was overall balanced making it an alright company to work for I think it really taught me and showed me many things I learned many skills I will care through life
good,"L'environnement de travail est bon, suivant le poste occupé sur la ligne de production l'effort ne sera pas le même mais le salaire oui."
good,The plant where I worked shut the doors. It was a decent job that I enjoyed working. It had the usual management not always listening and the higher ups getting much more than the actual workers.
good,"Empresa em si muito boa,porem pecam na admistração"
good,"Your experience will differ based upon the division you work within. The P&L groups seem to have more job security, but the old school loyalty that used to be present at Cat has diminished based on the constant restructuring and the diminishing benefits packages."
good,Its fast paced. Team leads are not qualified to run a team that large of employees. They dont work with you on family issues. The pay is ok if you want to be ran in the ground with overtime. 10-12hrs a day 7 days a week. Not suitable if you have children. You won't never see the grow up. You may apply for a job of your interest but once you get hired in the plant they will put you wherever they want within the facility.
good,"Work you a lot to justify not paying competitive wages."
good,"Work will go in waves, from extremely long hours and lot of overtime to not having much work with cut hours or reduction in workforce. This is dependent on the market, when minerals and oil are high expect mandatory overtime and when the resources are cheap expect layoffs."
good,"its a good place if you know someone that can help you advance in positions. If you don't like long hours or having your questions neglected, then this isn't for you."
good,"Manager could have been nicer. I liked the job just not the manager. He didn't know really how to help us. He thought he was better than everyone else, and when we asked for help he thought that we was stupid."
good,It’s for the most part a good job but depending on your supervisor it can be a little stressful the hours will be at the least Monday trough Thursday some times weekends and if something goes wrong on the line it could mean you being off a couple of days
good,Lack of mentor ship for agency employees. Absolutely no opportunity for career growth or advancement. Agency employees are treated as dispensable members of the workforce even if you have more knowledge and experience.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Caterpillar in Athens, GA was a new manufacturing facility. The environment was intense as there were deadlines that had to be met under any circumstances. Because it was a new manufacturing facility, all employees were required to work long hours in order to get the manufacturing facility running"
good,"Typical day at work starts with Meetings with global teams "
good,"My wife worked there for 5 years and she loved it!!! I was part of all kinds of activities with the Caterpillar folks during that time and loved it and made lots of friends. The I became part of the family when I got hired. Then business slowed and I was laid off 7 months latter not because of anything I had control of. Then 6 months later a week before Christmas my wife was laid off also. We still have friends there and business has picked back up, but they haven't called either of us to come back."
good,"employee harassment  very common  supervisor  non  helpful "
good,"come in stretch, have daily meeting. then i would go to station and get things ready for shift to start. Get my crew ready and change out tools and anything else they needed. when shift was ready to start i would mark how many parts we have done help crew with anything they needed help with, took parts that were in tubs over to shipping. At end of shift i would do paper work clean and turn off machines"
good,"Its a very good company"
good,I have had the opportunity to learn global procurement strategies and product strategies after starting as a Design Engineer.  Caterpillar has provided excellent career opportunities to this point.
good,"Powerful engineering organization,  Professional behavior.  Interesting products and technology.  Shareholders needs are placed before employee needs too often which is ironic since in our current 401k world of investment, the employee and shareholder are the same entity."
good,"Good, caring staff."
good,"Not the company it used to be. "
good,"Definitely enjoyed my work experience at CAT, however if you are working as contractor there, I would not recommend, as it will take forever to become full time and forget about pay raise."
good,"It was an okay place to work, until they began laying off and changing over management.  Management is not very supportive.  Difficult to get direct answers despite their repetition of ""we will be transparent with you"".  It's a great job if you don't need to put in years until retirement....you won't make it.  Also watch out for very lazy co-workers who will act busy when management comes around and take credit for everything you do."
good,"It is not easy to work in the plant that I was in because there were no  consequences for the use of profanity and that is a really big deal to me. However, the work was easy and laid back."
good,The organisation has provided enough knowledge to work in any corporate and has kept the words of the Fortune100. It has a flexible set of rules
good,Shipping machines and parts domestically and internationally. Paperwork preparation for shipments including export documentation. Worked with some of the best people I know. Managers were approachable and supportive. Hardest part of job was adhering to the specific requirements of individual customers. Enjoyed working with different entities in different countries. What I learned?  Everyday had something to learn just by virtue of the position.
good,"Caterpillar is a good place to work but the pay and chances for advancement are limited. There are resources available to those that the Management chooses to offer it to. Though not so much as those who request it to better improve their abilities."
good,Lots of opportunities to learn about their business and get some work experience of a production line work. Including career options.
good,Wasn't hard work and gave breaks every 2 hours. Had a paid lunch as well. Was supplemental so there wasn't any benefits. Being supplemental made it unsure of the future.
good,In the 6 yrs I have been there I have learned my valuable people skills .Was a   little frustrated by lack of opportunities.But I have given my best
good,my mom told me not to say nothing if it wasnt nice. but i will say i felt under the gun all the time waiting to get layed off even though i worked my way up to team lead in several departments
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"The best part of this work was watching our Dealer community achieve growth.  Through consultation and expertise, we would work hand in hand with these privately held business.  In doing so, we created strong relationships built of trust and respect.  The work was challenging and very personally rewarding."
good,"Cat work tools has potential to be a great work place the management is severely lacking proper skills. One of the only CNC/ Welding manufacturing companies that are air conditioned, there is no dull days constantly being moved around to new areas and taught new jobs. AC doesn't work as well as it should."
good,at first it was like my other experience with cat at the dealership level and then they hired two managers from outside that did not know the caterpillar way of doing things it was just numbers and if you didn't like there is the door didn't like that feeling
good,"Red tape and highly politically charged environment, new employees were outsiders and only the exceptional ones survive."
good,I enjoyed working there for almost 20 years. was sad to see them close the doors. I met a lot of awesome people and will  never forget them.
good,It's what you'd expect with one of the world's leading companies.  Lots of high up business decisions are made with no personal feel.  It's a very secure work environment though.
good,"Great focus on machines and the industries they support, conversely, very poor innate leadership due to a total lack of focus on the real asset of the Company, which are it's employees.  Build leaders or properly recruit them and the Company would prosper that much more."
good,"A typical day in Caterpillar is very demanding as everything is manufactured just in time, so working to dead lines is important. It has a lot going for the company with all the training it gives and all the health and safety courses with ( stop to fix ) ( dynamic risk assessments ) but the down side is very few contracts are ever issued to agency workers."
good,"this is mnc company, here back hoe loader, small wheel loader ana many big construction vechicles manufacturing. in our division gearbox assembly.............."
good,Good training & business plans. Culture is declining....little to no recognition.
good,"Was given a lot of experience of welding and repairing equipment, but no room to improve I felt like."
good,"A lot of success, some co-workers were a true pleasure to work with and the others we were stead fast in the CAT goal and achieved all goals set before us."
good,"After purchase of Bucyrus International, Milwaukee facility became a very stressful place to work at for all manufacturing areas."
good,"I enjoy working with everybody. I have learned so much. A typical day at work is auditing, auditing, and more auditing. The management is great. I wish If they could spend more time mentoring the team members. Speaking for myself, there is nothing hard. I would like something that could challenge me. The most enjoyable part of the job is collaborating with other team members to work as one. I am all about Team work and getting the job done."
good,No room for advancement as I was only a supplemental employee and was never converted to full time.
good,"A typical day at work includes receiving, inspecting, packaging/ repackaging parts of varied sizes and weights."
good,enjoyable place to work.. good atmosphere.. management was great
good,i enjoyed working here and i learned alot . the job security is not there which is the bad thing you never know when your days are up
good,I worked weekend shift.it was a good job for the hours.one of the best jobs I have had.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Very good place to work overall, kepted really busy, learned how to build different types of tractors. Schedules were well balance for social life. But poor management by refrence, could not keep good employees because of pay or somewhere in that nature, a lot of the times were very short staffed on assembly which is where I worked so you had to cover as an individual sometimes 2 to 3 stations at once a lot of the time and it created some arguments and other frustrating situations."
good,"I absolutely love the work I do, I love the hard work, hands on learning, and all I do on the line. Otherwise, I am not a fan of the management, or communication in the work place."
good,Decent place to work.  Management are idiots and I mean duh idiots . Benefits are really good but every contract they get worse . All the overtime u could want and slot of paid holidays
good,The culture of the business is to have as many temps as possible do the grunt work for the higher paid permanent staff who can later be terminated. Not a secure workforce which also means the quality of work varies due to high turnover of staff
good,Pontiac is a fast paced high volume extremely high precision facility that makes fuel systems and Aftertreatment products.  There is always change as emissions get tighter.
good,"La planta tiene poco tiempo siendo parte de caterpillar por lo que aun está en transformación al CPS, el cambio está siendo muy rápido y se está acercando rápidamente a establecer por completo la metodología caterpillar"
good,"As a servant leader, started mentoring the team and training agile practices to the team, implementing the scrum artifacts and scrum events. I am implemented Scrum artifacts while handling teams and facilitated Scrum Ceremonies like Daily standups, Sprint Planning Meeting, Sprint Review Meeting and Sprint Retrospective meeting. Empowered self-organizing and cross-functionality of the team. Helped the team to do the PI Planning for all the iterations."
good,"Empresa en crecimiento, un reto constante, es un aprendizaje y crecimiento personal"
good,"entreprise sérieuse ,d'appoint sur la sécurite et la qualité"
good,"There is much to learn working here. Things never seem to slow down which makes it an interesting place to work. If you are not willing to learn, you will not make it far."
good,They treat you as part of a family.  It's a great work environment especially if you do not have a lot of experience in the manufacturing world.  They are very good with their training program.  The pay is decent but it takes an exceedingly long time to get to the top of the pay scale.
good,I enjoyed going to work and talking to everyone that was at my work station. I liked how everybody was alway joking around and not letting anything get to them.
good,"I loved working at Caterpillar. It was a great place to work. Paid weekly, bonuses, unlimited overtime, great insurance, and vacation time. I enjoyed every bit of it."
good,While Bucyrus was around it was an interesting place to work with exciting new projects both of existing products and also new machines for the industry.
good,Ok place to work. You may experience lay offs and job moves with pay cuts. The company is constantly restructuring its global footprint and slowly killing the skilled trades areas of their shops.
good,Good place to work.  Caterpillar offers many opportunities for someone who would like to make a career out of one employer.  I would recommend this place.
good,Good company with quality products. Benefits are good. Stable job with no layoffs. Advancement process does not mirror company values. More who you know than what you know.
good,"It is a fun place to work with a bunch of very smart people around. Trying to solve real world engineer problems everyday. If you like logic and physics and mechanics, it is the right place to work for."
good,I enjoyed my time at Caterpillar. They have a breakfast and lunch cafeteria as well as plenty to space to eat. The place is rather large so expect a good walk.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Job is not bad my secition manager was good. Job is faced paced and pays well. Job gives you a lot of overtime. You would work saturdays and Friday's if you work down the hill
good,Working for caterpillar was fun and educational for me. Didnt realize that caterpillar was as huge as it is. Would recommend a job to all that i think would consider working for caterpillar. It is a great company to work for.
good,"I absolutely loved my job and the team I worked with at CAT. The mining industry at the time was slowing and even though my job was secure, I did not feel that I would be able to advance to what I was working so hard for. "
good,"Es buena empresa tienes todas las prestaciones pero el único detalle es que casi no tiene tiempo extra, tiene buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"There were over 4,000 employees at this facility when I hired in . I have had the opportunity to meet and work with some of the best/top caliber  professional people in our American workforce...."
good,"A productive logistics company that takes work ethics, values, and diversity very serious.  The company that supplies worldwide parts for anything needed for manufactoring."
good,not crazy about how they hire a lot of interns from local high schools with little to no welding experience let alone any welding experience. its production welding and gets a little old after a while depending on hundreds of suppliers to get parts to you on time with the very intense build schedules that you have as a welder. overall its a good place to work and the benefits are great. Hope you are ready to work if you get into production welding because business is booming right now.
good,I cannot say how it is in any of the office work as I work on a dock but in the office.  It is much different where I work compared to any other offices.
good,"A typical day at work starts at a fast paced but then slows down through out the day. Learned many things as ready serial numbers, working with scanners, and learned how to drive a fork lift. (reach truck and stand up)"
good,"Good place , great company, gives good compensation for freshers"
good,Caterpillar is a good place to work although I did not like the long hours. made my work/home ratio off and I didn't have enough time to take care of my family properly.
good,"Caterpillar is a large corporation with many opportunities if you are in the right department. There are many meetings, not a lot of time to work on developing extra skills or job shadowing others."
good,"I worked up to a manager lever after 17 years.  I learned a lot about Security issues at each facility and location in our area.  It seemed each facility had it's own workplace cultural.  We just got a new director and of course he brought in his own group of security managers.  There was three of us that were laid off when the company had a big layoff.  A lot more managers left once he was hired on.  "
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."

good,There are many opportunities for advancement with Caterpillar. The culture is always fast paced and interesting. Unfortunately the culture can be negative at times.
good,"It was a good place excepy for the mangement , but that usually the case in any plant,, the people got concerns and opioions but nobody wants to listen or they do but never do anything about it..Thats the the problems the workers know what well work to get out a good product and they may have a easier or effective way to do it but you take someone higher up and the worker dont know anything or it can't be done if Mangement would really listen to the workers who do their job everyday they would have a better company and employees that want to stay and do their best for that company"
good,Caterpillar claims to be people oriented.  They are not. New managers are put in place with no knowledge of the commodities and expect answers to questions that are unanswerable.
good,Work is more important than their employees. Decent place to work only when full-time. Contract employees are not respected enough. Feels awkward sometimes.
good,It was a great experience. Had enjoyed my time there but they had outrageous amounts of lay offs. Other than that there was an awesome work environment.
good,"Not really sure what other departments did with reports. Felt more like reports were used to simply be filed, not reviewed. Overall, good job, but very little to no career advancement"
good,The job is very nice. Its not very productive so its really gives you the opportunity to learn many things on your own pace. Management is always there to help in any way as possible.
good,"Good Team environment, fair communication, poor management -unfair discipline to hourly associates.  Workplace culture is good.  Excellent engineering department, unfair treatment of temporary associates"
good,Good place to work. Good ethics. Not too much work stress. Good work life balance. lots of new learning. good colleagues. location suitable for families

good,The work was pretty basic in the warehouse and order selection.
good,it was real fast paced. met some great people there. some of the supervisors there was a lil snobby but most of them were really good people. the hours can be a little stressful but the pay was great.
good,I wish I could have moved into a first shift position. If that would have happened I would still currently be working for Caterpillar. I learned allot at Caterpillar

good,"Cuando eres practicante, es una de los mejores lugares para trabajar. Son muy flexibles para el tema escolar y te apoyan."
good,"multiple areas to work, cross training in other areas encouraged, safety taken seriously, training on equipment could be better, expectations of work not consistent"
good,Overall cool job cool people. only worked for a small amount of time but overall very helpful and encouraging and motivating workplace. would recommend
good,"can be fast paced, usually a good schedule, very diverse, physically exhausting at times, climate in building can not be comfortable, you get to meet a lot of different people"
good,"Recent executive decisions, layoffs impacted number of employees.  Career growth opportunities are limited in Peoria location, not sure what will be left at Peoria location moving forward."
good,as long as you came to work on time and did your job usually there weren't any problems. Caterpillar was real big on safety so you had to make sure you could work at a fast pace and safely.
good,"I did a lot of things at this job it is a fast paced , demanding , very detail oriented job. Accuracy is a must. It is challenging and can be overwhelming."
good,"Its a very Nice company to work,"

good,Nice corporate to work with. Good internal opportunities. Employees are interested to be part of such big organisations and seen many well experienced people working for about 15 years in same corporate.
good,At caterpillar there were times that were rough but most of the time it was enjoyable working for this company. We had a set number of production we had to get but most of the time the workers had fun while doing it
good,Good place to work except for the disconnect between the union labor force and Management.  It needs addressed.  A better relationship would benefit all involved.
good,it was ok the floor made my feet hurt really bad hours were a little flexible i just wish i could  get more leeway with being late or having  misconceive
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,I definitely learned a lot working there. Fun place to work and met a lot of very good people. Only negative thing is they do quite a bit of layoffs and I didn't like that.
good,"It is a good place to work when you are not laid off.You get to work with alot of good people on a daily basis but, some employees promote a racist , entitled mentality there."
good,"The management can be doggy.  If you start off as a Factory Worker, expect a huge uphill battle to get to the office.  Even having a bachelor degree in the factory will not advance you.  The UAW is useless and pay has stagnated."
good,"Shift work as an order picker, trial period roughly 90 days. Good management, employee exercise period.  Atmosphere was all about quotas . Hot in the summer, scanners went down a lot."
good,its a good place to work if you have the right supervisor which is most of them but when sales are bad it becomes very stressful and cutthroat even if you have an excellent work record. theirs always going to be some stress in that situation but some supervisors tried to make it as hard as they possibly could. compensation was very good and work groups were usually very happy
good,Empresa boa para trabalhar mas com poucas chances de crescimento dentro.
good,"Aside from the politics of the company generally, the people were nice to work with. I was not prepared for such a tight, buttoned-up corporate environment at the time, but was still very successful at building trust."
good,"Boa empresa com excelentes técnicos, boa dinâmica."

good,This was a great job and opportunity for my first professional welding experience. It was unfortunate to see this company close this particular plant.
good,"Challenging, interesting work Good pay and benefits for management employees. Good place to be ""from"" when changing jobs as Cat is generally looked upon as hiring great employees."
good,"While Cat has provided a good life for my family and I for many years, things are changing.  The philosophy is different.  The job is unstable.  There is little long-term reward for years of priceless contributions."
good,"Caterpillar is a large international corporation headquartered in Peoria, Illinois. This has both positive and negative aspects which include the access to training and resources. The negative aspects include the policies and procedures that come from corporate that don't always ""fit all"""
good,worked overnight at the seguin location and loved the people i worked with!!!...it was like a family everyone looked after each other and helped out....
good,Company is going through severe economic downturn but will become strong again. The management has to make unpopular decisions sometimes but tries to minimize the impact on the employees.

good,Company provides extensive training to understand Company culture and values. Most employees enjoy working at the Company and are provided career choices to advance in the organization.
good,Caterpillar was a good company to work for. It felt like I was more apart of a family than just having co workers. It was a really laid back friendly work environment. I enjoyed competing against others for numbers.
good,It was a easy job but there was a lot of stuff going on at the shift I was working at he time and they laid us off.it was just that they had a lot of friends on one side to which caused drama for everyone and they were very high ranked then us so you know.

good,"I support value streams in a manufacturing environment. If there are processes, work procedures or safety issues I would take the lead to resolve them."
good,"Days are long and can be stressful. The work is hard and I would not recommend it to anyone with physical disabilities. There are little advancement opportunities, and when they appear you have to compete with everyone in the facility for the position, which makes promotions very unlikely to happen."
good,"Joliet location was very hostile in the beginning, but the environment improved greatly under new upper management. Company overall provides excellent compensation, educational opportunities, support for obtaining professional certifications, opportunities for career advancement, and a general culture of teamwork."
good,"Good cross-functional teams, with interaction with staff in other countries. Constant change and restructuring caused a drop in morale, otherwise the culture is diverse and inclusive."

good,"caterpillar have a policy for employing people on a temporary basis, as a result you have no job security and no redundancy when laid off. This is not the most satisfactory state of affairs."
good,"Morning or evening meeting before starting, learned all about fabrications and welding. Manager was a nice person, he always made you feel needed and had time for any query one had. Good team of inspectors but had its ups and downs, resolved one on one."
good,"quick advancement when the times are good and quick to cut when the times are bad. Not much sense of job security as when the times get tough, layoffs become the first route to better the situation."
good,Working for Caterpillar was a great placement for a student who has never worked in the IT sector before.
good,"Very good work culture, colleagues and managers are very supportive"
good,"overall, good worklife balance.  The employees are professional and very easy to work with for the most part. Work hours are flexible as long as the work are done as expected and timelines are met."
good,"The work day was pleasant and fast paced. Skills development and educational pursuits were encouraged and paid for at company expense. Management was good, and my co-workers were experienced. The most difficult aspect was the large work load, but it was manageable. The most enjoyable part of the various jobs was the interaction between the company and the dealership network at large. It was interesting to develop solutions for real world needs."
good,"was promised a job of a life time, Worked hard for a fair wage and gained much experience. then Caterpillar Joliet decided to make the move to Monterey  Mexico.  After 23 years the dream collapsed ."
good,"Its been good to work with Caterpillar since its a MNC company all should work with the culture putting safety 1st. But its quite difficult to find a growth,"
good,"The company has a lot of locations to choose from, and usually offers a competitive salary and market comparable benefits."
good,"I have worked here for 10 years.  The benefits are decent.  However, the ""Good ole boys"" club can hinder ones career.  You have to be in the right place at the right time."
good,"It's a typical work environment with some co-workers you can count as a team and some others that are unhappy and complaining about everything. Part of this problem is the lock of communication from management to production employees."
good,"Standard large corporation. Could work there for a life time. But there has been too many swings lately and like other corporations, too much politics"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Great learning environment for deep expertise and work life balance.  Lacking in advancement opportunities and job security.
good,This company was okay to work for they have a benefits package that is second to not one place I have worked at. The day to day operations of the job can get pretty repetitive but having a set schedule everyday is nice and getting 3 days off Friday through Sunday was a definite bonus for sure but the hours being on second shift were pretty bad though it did not leave much in the way for personal time unless you just did not sleep on Fridays...
good,"A typical day at my job begins at 7 with our team meaning where our jobs for the the day are assigned by our boss. I go to my assigned bench, check what is the most needed work, take that card and build it using a print and Caterpillar Standard work. As needed I will order parts and give my boss any updates he may need. After lunch I talk to the quality people to see if there is any potential problems I need to be aware of. At the end of the day I record my tact time to get my production time."
good,"Caterpillar is a great company to work for.  But it has been said losing employees is a manager condition, not the company itself. Reasonable pay for reasonable work.  Good leadership with those in charge, but favoritism is a big issue here.  This is on the managers not the company itself."
good,"Caterpillar is a decent company to work for.  They have changed a lot over the years.  Some things for the better, others for the worse.  It's hard to go from assembly to salaried."
good,"We did quality inspections of all Caterpillar products (marine motors to screws, and inspection of the correct color of paint). We had different situations daily (which was a challenge and I enjoy a challenge.)"
good,assemblage d'engin de chantier commencé en poste (ligne de montage)  puis sur l'assemblage de machine sur poste fixe et j'ai fini par aider les nouveaux arrivant et les diagnotics de panne
good,"everything was fine,so,as soon as i a m into ruby on rails my team members and i used work hard for the project.so,we really worked hard to implement and satisfy the client."
good,"The R&D work is great, stimulating and the reason going into work every morning."
good,the time that I was employed I gained so much experience both as a welder and as an engineer. I also built so many work relationships as it will hopefully help me in the long run.
good,"Safety oriented company, good team work ethics, Fun atmosphere  but the job gets done in a efficient manor. Management team is excellent."
good,"Managing the warehouse and inventory control team is a fast paced high pressure role. Responsible for creation, implementation, and sustaining all warehouse processes is demanding. Building a great crew willing to go the extra mile made everything worth it in the end."
good,A typical day is quite varied. At times it is a juggling act as different things crop up during the day. Sometimes the juggling act was made up of tasks that all had short deadlines. The management in our group lets us get on with the task at hand and supports us without hovering over us. Teamwork among us is highly valued and everyone knows they can go to anyone for assistance.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,You work at a face pace. You also work a lot of hours. I think that they should review the point system that they have. I also think that they should take in consideration absent if they are doctor appts or court it should be a base to base case if you should receive points.
good,good company to work. friendly environment. but dont hire full time employees. contractors are completely not feeling secured.
good,"Fun place to work with management Not all about the number but how you personally grow and development. Very fast past, a lot to learn each day."
good,Very fast paced with a lot of ups and downs. Can make a lot of money fast but can be on the street in a matter of minutes. Has the ability to be the most dominating corporation in the world if the economy turns around.
good,"Great place to work for with good benefits . Lots of fun activities for employers and friends and family day.They have good Quality work history.Hard part is working in the heat. Management was good to the employers.  I learned more in working with JDE, and the GUI screen. The growth of Caterpillar is world wide across the nation"
good,At the start of each day I would chair a meeting with my team of PQC's to discuss quality of the products being built on the mainline to try and alleviate any recurring defects found during manufacture.
good,"Work days are full of learning. Robot welding, mig welding, flux welding, the place is one big machine. Management is all about production. Co-workers help when they can. breaks are the best."
good,A typical day was really laid back. My co-workers were really easy to get along with and I got along very well with my boss. Most of the day involved working in CREO Parametric where I would design 3D models for particular components for our group.
good,Started out as a material handler then went steel hand burn. nice place to work but the had a large downsize which cost hundreds of people to lose their jobs.
good,"I was able to work with a bunch of dedicated workers who took pride in their work, the same as I did. The hardest part of the job was when we moved to other areas of the plant and left the co workers behind. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I did excellent work to provide quality built trucks."
good,"Very good company to work for"
good,Good place to work and gain exposure. Work as training ground for full time employment.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,Enjoyed my time as a test engineer.  My group and manager were very helpful and kind and supportive.  I learned a lot from this internship.
good,"I enjoyed the values that the company holds.  Learned about different renewable power system analysis software.  Kindly, the recruitment team allowed me to be placed on this team after giving my suggestion to move to this new group."
good,"On a typical day, I arrive 15-20 minutes early to open up all of the screens and sites that I use throughtout my work day.  I then check the list of new back orders that need immediate attention and try to get those fulfilled first. One of the more difficult aspects of my job is trying to juggle all of the responsibilites and metrics that are a part of my position.   However, one of the more enjoyable parts of my job are the interactions and comraderie betweeen myself and my fellow co-workers; whether they work in my department or not.  We strive to achieve one goal and that is satisfying our customers."
good,Great atmosphere!!  You don't have to worry about people or management watching over you.  You work independently!!! Insurance is great along with great 401k
good,"Caterpillar, Inc. has allowed me the opportunity to learn manufacturing by assembling some of the world largest earth moving machines."
good,"caterpillar can offer trait skills that can prepare you to be successfull elsewhere, such as CNC, welding, ect. but in the past years there's been a decline in work and benefits. it isn't what it used to be 10 years ago and beyond. so if you just want to make a paycheck every two weeks and no more, this is the place to work."
good,"In my atime at CAT there have been many changes in leadership. Every boss wants it their way but has no clue to do it."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,great and benefits but you never know when you'll be working management is horrible and only gets worse the higher up you go
good,"Was planning on working there until I retired. Management doesn't want some to even expect to retire from there. Biggest difference is day shift and night shift. If you can, get on night shift."
good,Awesome team work to accomplish goals;.. Maintain safety at all times.. Supervisor cared about employees and the quality of work being performed at all levels.
good,"I worked at caterpillar Wolverhampton for nearly 19 years, and learnt a lot about gear boxes as well as having the had the pleasure to work with a lot of good people . I very much enjoyed traveling and meeting like minded people from other cat facilities"
good,"My Caterpillar experience has been excellent.  I have had the good fortune to work both in engineering on a NPI (New Product Introduction) project and in a technical marketing role.  The front line managers I have worked for were all concerned about developing their people, as well as the business results."
good,good paying union job but there is no job security you get laid off about every three years but they supply evrything you need to do your job and the welding is realy easy most of the welding is in the flat positions
good,Excellent benefit package along excellent supervisors. Work environment is all about safety and looking for the employee.
good,"work will be challenging but interesting."
good,Make sure all paperwork is completed. Complete daily maintenance  on all machines.  I enjoy working with my co-wokers.  I enjoy being a part of a team that works together to complete the job.
good,I most enjoyed the teamwork. Management was helpful with overall business as far as keeping us informed or tending to issues .I  looked forward to going to work everyday.
good,It was alright. Micromanaged way too much. There was only on supervisor who had any work experience out of 3. My co-workers were friendly. The job itself was fast paced.
good,"I love my job at Caterpillar but I was looking to upgrade my position. I lean effectively of structures for Mining Trucks and other Heavy Mining Machineries."
good,Working here as Systems Integration Engineer. Very good place to work and people here are nice. Love the Taco every Tuesday noon at cafeteria.
good,"Caterpillar acquired the company I worked for previously.  The migration of old to new ways was not handled entirely smoothly, often resulting in conflict between the proven company performance capabilities and Cat's expectations for rapid return on investment.  Great people at the local level with a true heart for product excellence."
good,"This was a contract position therefore I was not in a position to review the company as a whole. Generally, it was a good place to work and I would consider taking other positions with them."
good,"Great pay and excellent benefits. Clean working conditions. Horribly competitive environment unless you like that. It creates a lot of backstabbing, favoritism, etc... Your basic ""good ole boys club"" rules. Management was a hit and miss, very few good ones. No room for advancement from blue collar to white collar even though they claim they do. In 5 years, 1 person was promoted, even though there were many jobs available in Bldg A. The shop is divided into 2. One side assembly and other side is machine shop. Try to get into machine shop side. Operations on that side is so much better. More laid back, more cohesive environment."
good,Overall I was very pleased with my time spent at CAT. I learned several skills that I will now carry with me for the rest of my life as a professional.
good,"great wages ,good benefits, would like to retire ,from working there after 20 years but too many work reduction due to the industry economies"
good,"Great Company to work at. Servicing marine engines, generators, and heavy machinery, there is a lot to learn on the field. There are a lot of field visits on yachts where service has to be done."
good,A global network company. chance to work cross functional and so much learning. very good management. Value each person. A diversity place where you enjoy and love working.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"While quite a stable company, Caterpillar is overly dependent upon the mining which limits growth potential. As a result losses in the global mining economy results in large changes in Caterpillar business."
good,"Promotion is based on your connection instead of merit or contribution."
good,"Pretty good place to work. My only real complaints are the commute and the lights in the office."
good,"I enjoy being employed at Caterpillar however I am ready to further my career and move forward since I have completed my Bachelor of Science Organizational Leadership from Millikin University in December, 2014.  I have learned and experienced many different things in my 11 years of being employed there."
good,"Had the opportunity to participate in a team environment that aided my development as a Manufacturing Engineer. Participated in meaningful projects with real meanings, deadlines, and risks."
good,Lots to learn with very good management leading you .Co workers are nice . Hardest is you are given complete ownership of the project
good,"If you like strict work rules and a hierarchy similar to the military, you'll like Caterpillar."
good,"I enjoy my coach and fellow associate they are great people!!! "
good,Maintain a large group of machines.  Work on machines that are several model years ahead of what the customer sees.
good,"Very Busy Atmosphere, Help Desk duties included but not limited to:  Customer Service, Ticket Entry, Troubleshooting, Problem Solving, Software Installation, Remote Assistance.  etc."
good,"I loved this job. The people were great, I was given responsibility, I loved the work,"
good,"Shame about the price of coal right now, as this was a company that people like myself always wanted to work for.  There was a time when you would wear your uniform proudly for this company.  People would ask you if you, knew of any jobs going?  Now it is a case of people asking, do you think you'll go in the next wave?"
good,Designing & Drafting of components of building construction products
good,"If you start your career at CAT as a union employee, you are almost guaranteed to never receive a company position.  Therefore you are stuck in a dead end job.  If you have aspirations of moving up and being promoted, this company is not for you!"
good,This was a great place to work. Very laid back and safety oriented.
good,"Scan Product, place in boxes with correct labels. Run the fork lift to move product around warehouse."
good,Regular engineering design work using the newest design tools and intensive R&D and engineering collaboration.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Days typically begin with a group meeting to review any changes / news followed by stretching exercises. Once you get to your assigned area you determine the work load for the day and perform your job. There are several layers of management for the production area including Team Leads, Section Leads, and Senior Management. The people that work there are friendly and ready to lend a hand when needed."
good,assembly line work. Coworkers very lazy. to much conflict between management and workers. To hard to advance in the company.
good,I would expedite and change schedules that were approved. I learned about expediting and inventory management. Majority of co-workers were team players. The hardest part of the job was getting answers from other departments to make decisions. I really enjoyed working in supply chain management and my team.
good,They taught me to drive a forktruck.  Gave me the opportunity to be the best that i could be at that time.
good,"its a good place to work at"
good,"Work is good but Job Security is waning."
good,Buena la compañía pero esta en transición por la compra de Caterpillar
good,"As an engineer, you are able to get a wide range of exposure to projects since the company is so global."
good,Great job satisfaction and co-worker comradely. a job where hard work pays out big rewards.
good,"Our days are structured with meetings and reports, but we have enough flexibility in our schedules to get our work done in a manner which we feel comfortable."
good,I would always go straight into work and work diligently until my breaks. I learned how to operate many machines as well as safety qualities.
good,"This job showed me how much I enjoy physical labor.  I learned about manufacturing development, production etc. I made a lot of money and got to work with some wonderful individuals."
good,Overall a somewhat ok place to work not much chance for moving up ...
good,I loved working at the Morton facility but LC is a completely different atmosphere.
good,very fast pace place to work with lots of room for improvment but they lay people off to often
good,Was not with them long enough to comment. During the acquisition of Bucyrus cat found positions for most of the ex Bucyrus employees.
good,Good place for students to do intern. Can learn new concepts and your suggestions are recognized.
good,"Great health and safety, with good learning opportunities."
good,"Perform daily equipment PM,s and deal with trouble calls. Each day brought on a different experience pertaining to the work load, as part of a maintenance team."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."

good,"Love working here too, The company was a nice work places,"
good,my shift was 11pm-7am start with a  safety and production build pumps and and test
good,"Um ótimo local de aprendizado com ótimos benefícios porém a constante alteração em cargos de gerencia e supervisão acarretavam mudanças de cultura e ambiente de trabalho muito bruscas alterando na harmonia do mesmo, as cobranças eram intensas devido ao lead time muito curto, com problemas por parte de compras e planejamento, devido a complexidade de operações e software antigos as falhas de comunicação eram constantes."
good,Mainframe skills for COBOL programming and SAP components EWM/ECC/CRM.
good,"A typical day at work included managing my engineering team out of India, working on new designs for our new highwall miner desgin, and giving continuous product support."
good,"- Trasition from Bucyrus International to Caterpillar Global Mining is challenging yet intriguing"
good,"I learned so much, in dealing with companies such as Syncrude.  It was both interesting and challenging.  My many years of experience came into play more than once in reconciling this account. My co-workers were also temps on contract and we learned together."
good,A typical day at work was doing preventive maintenance checks on equipment and repairing as needed.  It was a very interesting environment and somewhat challenging as most equipment does not have a down time.
good,"Looked forward to going to work every day. Enjoyed the co-workers as well as the factory environment. Learned a lot about how the tractors are built. Began working in the box line in one building where parts were put into boxes and assembled in another building, where I was later moved to. I enjoyed seeing the beginning steps to building a tractors and later seeing the end result of the finished tractors."
good,A very fast pace job growing environment just to many lay offs.
good,Ample amounts of training programs and classes available.
good,"I learnt and developped many skills during this assignment."

good,A typical day was storing parts to locations so that orderfillers could pick the parts to be shipped on a daily basis.
good,"We work as a team, in a very fast-pace, difficult task environment. Quality is our highest reputation, but safety always comes first. My team is made up of nine firm, quality driven members who take the extra time to ensure a 100% quality guaranteed product. We face difficult tasks such as figuring a safe rigging fixture to lift a unit; as well as diagnosing a series of issues in a unit in a timely and effective manner. I enjoy the environment of the shop floor, as well as the strong familiarity I have developed with my team. "

good,"Bons benefícios, oportunidade de crescimento, dinâmica."

good,I enjoy working at Caterpillar and the employees that Im able to work with. A typical day at work includes keeping track of inventory and operation of the forklift to ensure the proper destination of materials.

good,My first civilian job right out of the Navy. Didn't think I was going to find myself working with so many great individuals. The support staff was really great and very helpful in all aspects.

good,Fairly rewarding career and work life balance.
good,Good company for Engineers

good,Lomng rewarding days helping others improve. Co workers willing to help
good,"Long days at work to support agressive production schedule while redcuing costs. Communicate with all co-workers. Management too focused on bottom line and not on needs of employees. Co-workers OK to work with. Too many lonmg nights supporting prodcution schedule, lack of cooperation from corporate group."
good,"Employees are treated very well, the pay is good and they are good at asking about your job and what you would change about it. But was a temp job and they lay off a lot."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."

good,Learned a lot of different tasks and met a lot of interesting people.
good,Pouring iron into engine molds.
good,This is a company who believes employees should have a work life balance allowing time for family.
good,As a leader in the field of mining Industry Caterpillar has the quality prodcuts. I feel proud to be a part of this organization where I learnt wide variety of manufacturing concepts in a limited time.
good,"Primarily responsible for the complete sales order process, capable knowledge of accounting procedures and practices, including customer purchase orders, invoicing, accounts receivable and revenue recognition"
good,"Basically a good firm and the ownership was extremely intelligent and a personal and professionally fine person. The management staff didn't come up to the goals and objectives, but the product was sound also.  Much leeway was given and words of appreciation were flowing, but the pressures to meet the product goals made it hard sometimes."
good,Buen ambiente laboral y buenas prestaciones la gente es buena
good,Working with along the higher ups who was working in the office realized they do have the knowledge of jobs inside and out !!! Mostly everyone is there to get out high quality parts !
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,The company is great ecept for some minor details like advancement they did not give me the procedure for advancement and I am qualified have been a great manager for 30 years wud love to work for u again
good,"Oportunidad de mejora latente, demasiada burocracia"
good,I really and truly do miss my job at Caterpillar. I really and truly do hate that I made my mistake. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get my employment back.
good,"great benefits and plenty of opportunities for overtime"
good,I would go back. Good Pay.. There isn't anything difficult to do there. Following directions was something humans learned at a young age. If you can do that then you can work at Cat.
good,Fast paced very good training programs and overall good place to work. They are very strict on safety and safety precedues. Decent hourly pay for the area.
good,Working in a place where safety is first and is a good place to work people are nice to work with as well. Wish I would have came to work here a long time ago!
good,I loved my job and the job I did. The only thing I didn’t like is it took sinking to get converted. It’s was very important to me to get converted I needed the insurance for my son and job security.
good,This is a great place to work. With excellent hours and great flexibility. I learned many things there including many different ways and techniques to use tools.
good,It was a company set around production and that's all that mattered. The work was enjoyable but the management was terrible. It was a lot of misuse of power and ego trips.
good,Indian managers were always cunning and no on-sites and need to work on non challenging environment. Now Caterpillar is not a good pay master. Often you won't get variable pay. Three year once only you will get it.
good,Great place to work no room for advancement. Great benefits but it’s all about Favoritism. But no room for growth. Been working eight years and still the same thing.
good,Aufgrund des Tarifvertrages ein sehr attraktiver AG.
good,this was a union job with a focus on doing as little as possible.  management usually only showed up when there was an issue.  just a laborer and it is extremely difficult to move into management
good,I enjoyed my years at Caterpillar. It was always work to be done around the shop and taking on new task was always an option. I do believe if you was not friends with upper management they were always looking for you  to be doing wrong. If management and pay were better it would be a perfect job for many.
good,"CAT is a highly technological advanced Company. That believes in putting safety first before everything else. To me this is an outstanding attribute for a company that's advanced in machinery, equipment and technology as CAT."
good,Pays well but the schedule is rough. Plenty of vacation time and you can basically never miss a day. They only give ten minute breaks and change your schedule almost every week.
good,Tough to have a work life balance.  There’s not enough hours in the day to do all the work.  Management constantly promises more people will be hired but it never happens.  I’m guessing it’s like that at most companies.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Caterpillar was a fun place to work but the goals management set were set too high even for the veteran employees. If we explained what we were dealing with on the floor the management would say they listened but then nothing would come of the meetings. We were pushed to set a high bar for safety with high velocity with little wiggle room for error.  Employee morale was low due to fears there was no end in sight to all of the mandatory overtime the employees were subjected to. The company hasn't seen a slow down in a few years and isn't employing enough people to help with the demand.
good,"loved working for cat. They were very friendly. The only downside was pulling overtime, and having our schedules change and not being made aware of the change until you’ve came either too early or very late. Other than that it was a great company. Supervisors are always there to help and everyone around you as well. Also able to move up fast if you’re on time and do your job."
good,"Great place to work the pay is not set fairly towards logistics employees. I love my job it's challenging, fulfilling, and it makes me happy when I'm there doing it. I do my job well, I work well with others. I learned the job and then I added my own special touch to make everything flow smoothly, freely, easily, and safely. I tell the people I drive for that I have them spoiled and they realize this when I take a day off."
good,The road to progress beings a road and all of those roads are built with Caterpillar machines.  We make progress happen and build a sustainable world.
good,Great management structure. Good employee relations. Well organized corporate medical structure. Well established policies and procedures. Supportive/inclusive HR Dept.
good,"Prestaciones excelentes, horarios inflexibles, ambiente laboral con área de oportunidad."
good,Was able to work in different modules and got new challenges in work in the areas of technical as well as functional.Got a good opportunity to learn in technical and functional area also.
good,Decent place to work well paid. 0 benefits if you are supplemental Union employee. All you gets a paycheck. No sick days no vacation no insurance. First out the gate if there's layoffs
good,Factory based work. Assembly line putting together large wheeltrackers or you could work as an maerial handler transporting parts to different areas of the plant
good,"I was a temp, but I did like working there. Due to company restructuring my contract came to an end. They were very accommodating and kept me there until I was able to find a new job."
good,"people make any workplace, some will help ,some wont, mngmnt is dishonest ,tricky & a way to much of favoritism...no training, 3 hrs walking with ur lead, then ur on ur own...mngrs bring their problems from home to work....if ur not an butt kisser/ yes man , they will fire you or set you up to get you fired....caterpillar isn't colorful @ all, no minority spvsrs, just another so-so sorry company"
good,"Top down management approach, well paid, more facilities across the world, helpful cross functional team. Cons: organization changes keep happening and growth is not fast"
good,"Good company to work for.  Job stability.  Great team to work with.  "
good,"The Uniform Style is Nice, Along w/ the Work Hrs. 7-3."
good,"I enjoyed working for Caterpillar.  Everyday brought a new and exciting challenge that tested your ability to think on your feet, use your cognitive and analytical skills.  Working with my colleagues was a plus!  I would have preferred a permanent position but I knew that due to the global downturn during that time, that it would only be a contract position.  I feel blessed that my contract was extended as long as it did."
good,"Great compensation and benefits but no job security due to the constant reorganizations.  I was on of 10,000 employees laid off.  Conservative culture."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"A typical day is very fast paced and un-predictable. Management was always off target because of shortage of welders so it caused chaos on the line. They were closed minded as well even when told about certain problem areas. We always knew that when you saw the HR lady on the welding shop floor somebody was going out the door. If you weren't a part of the ""GOOD OLE BOYS"" club you were guaranteed a trip out the door. The most enjoyable part of the job wasn't even on the shop floor because that was payday. It was very hypnotic but poisonous as well because of the false atmosphere created on the floor. This company can make you feel as though your doing something right but your actually doing it wrong. Or at least that's what upper management told me when they walked me out the door."
good,All in all okay...Just didn't like they close my division. My work day was very full and the overall employee culture was okay. I wish they never closed my division I would have retired from the company.
good,I enjoyed working at Caterpillar my reason for leaving was we were mandated to work 70 hours a week since I started in March we worked up to 29 days with out a day off.
good,"Stage aziendale in ambiente ben strutturato."
good,"My work day was good for the most part I became a trainer I did not mind that because I can teach anyone that wants to learn how to be a good worker,I was an forklift operator once I trained a cherry picker operator then I continued my day on the stand-up lift my job then was to put product in the correct location."
good,I learned a lot at Cat about the various products and systems they use. Everyday was a new learning experience. Working with the engineers was a invaluable experience.
good,A good job for someone who likes to work in a fast pace work environment. Also a great place to learn working with new and state of the art equipment.
good,Great place to work.  I learned a lot and was constantly being challenged.  Management was very helpful.  Workplace culture was great.  Hardest part of the job was leaving the place.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with they actually care that you succeed in your job role because they work very well as a team.  Teamwork makes the dream work.
good,A good well balanced job slow paced not to stressful besides some last minute repairs(happens rarely). The management was far from what it should be. The people you work with tend to become like family as long as you do your job.
good,"If you want to advance, plan on being there for a long time.  Management does not really seem to care what kind of background you have; they just want product out.  They do not always care about safety as first introduced in their training.  A lot of BIG safety hazards go without a blink of an eye.  It takes a lot of nagging to get them to do something sometimes."
good,"•	Currently working as Configuration and Functional Specialist on PeopleSoft Conversion from 9.1 to 9.2 and responsible for migration of maintaining the Configuration and Custom tables"
good,"its an ok place to work, just come in do my job and go home . great people, i love my coworkers, the  but need to pay better. needs better managemenT."
good,Caterpillar is a great company however it is currently struggling with identity.  The struggle exists all the way from prime product levels to the component make-buy strategies.
good,"Good place to work.  Pay was excellent.  Adequate time off also.  Hardest part was lack of knowledge in some areas.  Not a lot of training, and when dealing with cross functional groups, it was difficult at times to put all of the pieces together."
good,"I liked working there, but when you tend to have more employees to work with, you also tend to have employees that want to be chiefs rather than Indians. I made a lot of friends and enjoyed our time to talk during our lunches.  I worked with a great team and enjoyed learning each station on the carousel.  You had parts that you had to sub up at the end of the day for the next shift to use."
good,It is a fasted paced environment.  Work is hot since you are melting rubber.  Can be dangerous if you do not follow proper safety protocols. For the most part though good hard working people.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"had to wear steeltoe boots "
good,"Working for a temporary agency for the most part you do as your told to get the job done.  Moved around, and placed were you are n needed for that day"
good,"In true Caterpillar fashion everyone gets laid off, then they wait a few months and hire all new people. I enjoyed my job duties along with my direct supervisor."
good,"Moderately paced environment. Good Engineers. Good Products."
good,"a good place to work. good bennifits, as long as you dont get hurt decent hours good pay and good potencial to move up inside the business like i said as long as you dont get hurt, because if you do its a mad dash to find a reason to fire you"
good,"Shift work, I have been on third shift six years will take about eight more years before I can apply for first shift. Your career is what you make it. Work attendance is number one factor in getting full time status. I was a supplemental for the entire first two years I worked at Morton Distribution."
good,"Productive and great facility to work at.  Good people, but the facility was cut by upper management.  Had a performing workforce that met 13% pay out many times so people at the floor level were doing the job.  The company had good equipment but could never make it do as it was designed."
good,"A typical work day is busy, medium to fast pace. Simple tasks given."
good,je suis monteur assembleur au niveau du mariage entre le chassie et la plateforme mobile en effet le métier est assez intense et difficile par rapport à différents câblages hydrauliques à faire dans des positions pas très bon pour le dos mais après un temps d'adaptation le métier se fait facilement sans trop d'effort .
good,Employees are instructed daily on safety talking points and certified monthly on standard working practices. There is annual training opportunities for employees to join medical and safety teams
good,"Excellent work culture"
good,"Depending on what division you are in and position you hold, you can have a great career there. There are numerous good people in all areas looking out for each other and unfortunately there are people onlyworrying about themselves...which is concerning."
good,Work with Engineers in product of engines. Storing rebuild or display of product. work an eight hour shift to a 10 hours daily. Make sure all computer files were updated for all to use. Get products in and out of department to right locations. Working with other as a group and timely manner to complete task at hand.
good,"Pretty good pay, Really big on safety. Would come in and operate Plastic Injection Molding Machines. We had to many chiefs and not enough Indians, to many bosses and people wanted things done differently. Hardest part of the job was working with band aided equipment and being understaffed and having like 5 different bosses tell you how to do things when they had no idea how the machines ran.  "
good,Worked in supply chain for 5 years job and pay excellent management a disgrace and back stabbing towards agency workers rely to much on agency workforce also not appreciated for the job you do team leaders not interested
good,"Workplace culture varies depending on location but was enjoyable most of the time. Pleasant chats with coworkers were acceptable and never dragged on interrupting work. "
good,I have enjoyed my time at caterpillar. The only downside has been that there is little to no room for advancement due to the downturn of the mining industry
good,You will learn many specialized skills that will continually challenge you and ask you to learn more than you know. You never know what is going to happen in this company
good,"Productive and fun at work place, learned customer technique and people management. Very crucial and strategic client to handle"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Caterpillar is a great organization.  With austerity measures, advancement has been harder. The company is flexible with regards work and life balance."
good,Working in a shop where you build engines for caterpillar equipment is one of the most rewarding and pride giving job a person could ever take.
good,Good to work with the organisation at the earlier stage of its expansion in the Investment castings. the major customers re from abroad countries and in India.
good,This was until the layoffs in 2009-2010 my favorite job ever. I was advancing quickly and loved what i did and it was a 5 minute drive for me. I went back after the layoffs and hated everything about it. The people had changed and the management was terrible. I hope since i left they have gotten their issues worked out because i really did love this place.
good,Good place to work with perfect mix between work and private life. Lot of carrier evolution possibility from a service to an other. The negative point is the important exposition to market fluctuation but it's almost common for all industry.
good,"consult with system engineers, management and fellow designers to create a product that meets customer requirements and design intent. Diverse design team."
good,everyone gets a scanner and prints out orders for parts to be ship to customers. You collect all the parts for that order and you hand it off to another team member for shipping. or if you shipping you collect the orders once they've been picked and box them up with a shipping tag to be shipped out to customer.
good,Job security is the only concern one has to look for during challenging times. The challenging period comes once in every 4 years. Apart from it this is by far the best place ive worked so far.
good,Not a bad place to work. Pay sucks but benefits are better than average. Hard to move up and jobs are not to challenging. Management is ok for the most part.
good,"It was a good place to develop my skills in embedded control system development, data analysis, and algorithm implementation. To a person, my co-workers were committed to doing the best jobs they could, though sometimes at odds with restricted budgets."
good,"Caterpillar is a great company to work for when they are making money.  The pay is good, the bonus is better, and the company promotes healthy work life balance.  However not every project is created equal and some projects are underfunded and over accelerated making it very difficult to succeed.  When times are hard, they manage the staff and projects to be as lean as possible to still turn profits for stakeholders."
good,Working and learning with other engineers company lacks sort of leadership and assignments for new incomers. Wish they had a all you can eat cafeteria line would make life so much easier
good,"a nice place to work at. after the first 30 days their many more things to learn, just show up for work. the nice think about working there is the chances at advancement."
good,The job has been very rewarding. Unfortunately the plant is due to close later this year. That is why I am looking for another job. Caterpillar is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. I have some great co-workers and my supervisor is very helpful.
good,"They expected a lot from all of their employees. Had to work there on my own time to be able to keep up. I learned a lot about people while working there. Was able to meet a lot of good people."
good,They treat their employees with respect in my department. Good family oriented environment. I've worked for several companies and so far this was the best.
good,"Au sein de notre équipe nous avons instauré un climat de travail très agreeable, base sur l'équipe, l'humain et la bonne humeur. Nous avons créer un coin ""communication"" ou nous prenons le café chaque jour et meme le petit déjeuner ensemble certains jours. Ces moments nous permettent d'aborder la journée avec sérénité et enthousiasme. "
good,"A empresa oferece um clima agradável e muitas oportunidades de ampliar o conhecimento sobre diversas áreas. Oferece salário e benefícios acima do mercado, porém oferece poucas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Excellent management and business."
good,"Managing a team of technicians manufacturing engines. Enjoable and enthusiastic place to work with good team work."
good,Good company however the relationship between union members and company members is severely lacking. This is due to old union ways
good,A very crucial plant to the overall success of Caterpillar Industries.
good,Great  team environment with fun people to work with! Safety was very important and made working in teams exciting !
good,"Hours were very nice, work 4 days, 12 hours a day, Learned how to work with Engineers and customers. Learned how to run the KIOSK."
good,"Assembler  "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cat (I started my career at age 61, never having worked in a manufacturing job)...met a lot of good people...."
good,"Safety conscience, with major emphasis on P.V.Q.C(People, Velocity, Quality, Cost) in that order.  The people made my time at Caterpillar productive and enjoyable."
good,"long hours, i learned about the culture, very good management,"
good,Most of us have worked together for so long that we are like family.  People are great.
good,"Good company to work with and the culture is good. The work-life balance is properly managed. And also, the management style is good."
good,"Good place to work with focus on engineering. Competitive salaries."
good,"clinic seeing all types of employees needing 1st aid , over the counter medicines, training information, wellness programs, setting up statistics monthly. Safety issues, ergonomic assessment - working interdisciplinary, stocking supplies. Engaged in record keeping, short and long term disability, worker's compensation and FMLA (family medical leave).Hardest part of job working with my management located in Illinois and translating into local issues which was not always the same"
good,"The work is fair as well as the pay, but the leadership leaves something to be desired. The supervision knows little to nothing about the product."
good,"Co-workers are very friendly and easy to work with. Flexible hours are a plus! Everyone seems to know their job thoroughly. Once you are up to speed with the requirements of the job, it is a very low stress environment."
good,As an assembler at Caterpillar the job stays the same day after day.  While it is a stable job with a very small chance of being terminated it is very mundane and does not give any chance of creativity.
good,"Limited advancement on the technical side. On the management side  you have to come from Cat in (Peoria, Ill) to get a management position or move there."
good,A typical day would be to get your job assignments done in a timely manner.  I learned a great deal mechanically in which i can apply to for a lifetime.  I enjoyed my supervisors and co workers very much.  The hardest part of my job was the lack of work to do at caterpillar. I enjoyed the challenges and thinking that sometimes would accompany the job.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Start the day by dressing in appropriate PPE, a brief from management, risk assess working area. Check all documentation for validity and tools (air/manual) for serviceability. Carry out work to standard work specifications.... 5S area on completion of work and sign and validate all documentation.."
good,"Its a decent place to work.  I receive work assignments around nine AM and order parts. Its a two hour drive to the sea port where I find the boat I'm working on that day.. A normal day is 12 to 18 hours, sometime longer. Management and coworkers are mostly good people.  Hardest part of the job are the hours involved.  Sometimes simple repairs can take a very long time due to the placement of the engine. Dealing with the heat in the engine room can be pretty bad too.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the travel opportunities. I have traveled extensively with this company."
good,A good company brand but did not care too much for their contract staff.
good,they are a very good company to work for but it is really hard to get onto the level 3 apprenticeship which isn't very good but other than that brilliant
good,Enjoyed the hours and nice paychecks. People were proactive and worked well together. Company always encouraged feedback from employees for improvements and suggestions. 
good,"Many wonderful people to work with, many opportunities to advance, and each day is never the same."
good,es un trabajo muy importante el que realizaba para asegurar la calidad del producto y la satisfacción del cliente que es lo mas importante
good,Productive and fun workplace with engineering design teams
good,"i came into work, did exactly what i was told to do, great boss and co workers, treated fairly, great place"
good,"Apreendi a lidar e gerenciar grupos de pessoas, trabalhar em equipe, ser dinamico e agir com urgencia"
good,• Complex PL/SQL procedures and functions and packages are developed to adhere to the specifications of the application.
good,"It was ok and help me learn other things that I have not done befor, but in a short time management was relaying on me."
good,I learned alot from the company and also learned alot about how Unions work. I enjoyed my time at Caterpillar. I thought they were pretty fair.
good,"Caterpillar has been a good employer for the past 2 years. I have learned a lot skills and traits that continually push me forward. I am now in charge of all the daily production reports, manpower planning, inventory control audits, and 1 on 1 coaching with employees."
good,Worked well with others and alone. Learned alot in the five years I worked there. Management was ok but there was a lot of comunication problems between worker and management.
good,"arriving 10 min, before shift, recieve dayly schedule,working with co-workers with schedule,overcome obstacles and adapt to situations that provide customer satisfaction"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"The job tasks were challenging yet repetitive. The overall job was enjoyable, however, as a contractor I was always treated as second class. Job ranked in my top 3 favorite jobs that I have had so far."
good,Great place to work. Lots of advancement. global opportunites abundant
good,A good place to get expirience/well organize/its fully computerize
good,good work job with great co workers and great benefits. Management was really good with working to make it a family atmosphere.
good,Telit is very open to new ideas and processes. A regular day usually involve 6 hours a day.  Although I enjoy the coaching of suppliers the many meetings can limit my productivity some days.
good,I like its a good company but sometimes you don't get proper training on some of the machines and fighting with day shift about getting proper training for the machines or if a machines brakes down and you try to find out why its down day shift will fix the problem but not give any details on how to fix the problem.
good,"Have task initiated, review task goal, gather background information, collaborate with necessary persons, pursue resolution, and get closure. Then go to next task."
good,"Disappointed the facility I work at is closing after 65 years.  Up to the closure I was satisfied with the work tasks, pay rate, and benefits the company provided me."
good,This is a great company to work for. They have great benefits and the work environment is good. The work is not hard and there is room for advancement within the company
good,great work environment and culture just low pay and not enough hours or overtime and complicated hiring process unlike other jobs great people work atmosphere and culture and health and family morals
good,"i worked logistics at CAT. First, they train you, then put you to work in the factory. Don't make any mistakes as they will keep a record on you. READ the handbook. Follow it closely!!  Half hour lunch and ten minute breaks. Four ten hour days and overtime is mandatory when offered ( 8 or 10 hrs. ) fridays."
good,Good job to work easy to move up and make better opportunities for yourself. You can make your way to where you want but company has developed a bad stigma from previous layoffs so it’s always in the back of your mind.
good,The bad is production dictates workload. When demand is up many hours will be worked taking away from family time. You will be forced to work according to the contract.Even after 23 yrs.I was getting forced every weekend.Compensation is good and thats why I would reccomend cat.
good,If I wouldn't have gotten sick I would still be there. I wish the pay would have been a little better while I was working there. I had no problems until I got sick and had to use my time to go back and forth to the doctor.
good,"Good company with a great name, only downfall is the pay is not the greatest for the forestry division. They say it is comparable to the area but it really isn't."
good,"Caterpillar is a great company to work for. Benefits are great, you’re guaranteed PTO and the pay is great! Attendance is big! You have to be on time and there each day or you won’t make it!"
good,I was a CNC machinist running several different types of machines while employed there.They had a good work environment and I actually enjoyed working there. The hardest part was keeping up with demand and the most enjoyable part was knowing I was part of the building process
good,The most difficult part of the job was waiting for the iron to be made so that I could pour it. The day would go quickly when iron was ready to be poured.
good,"I would have loved to stay at Cat. However, I had two broken ribs and was let go because of some absents. Even though I had the proper medical documentation."
good,"Use latest technology"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Caterpillar is a great place to work with great benefits and decent wages. I would recommend Caterpillar to anyone seeking a career. They offer advancement and development  opportunities not found at many employers.
good,Im in the machining and Fab side of production. When the orders are flowing it's busy and forced overtime. When it slows down layoffs happen. I've been through 2 of the last layoffs. The last one was in 2015 and i was off for 2 years.
good,"Good to work abroad but not good balance towards family"
good,"All the overtime you wanted and learned how to work fast & repetitive, very hot in the summer & cold in winter. You get little bonuses for going above and beyond your job description."
good,"El día típico en CAT era revisar con el jefe del área las herramientas pendientes por diseñar y establecer tiempos de entrega, después diseñar esas herramientas y revisar con el cliente final que era la línea de producción."
good,You come in supplemental  which is like temporary so you have to get converted to get a full time position. CAT is a good place to work it's all about what you make it.
good,A decent place to work. Not much on how we get our pay raises. Good benefits with decent pay for area. A steady job. Will provide uniforms if you want.
good,"Shift work"
good,Section manager and co-workers made it a great company to be a part of until the restructuring. The company lay off put so many people out of work just before the holidays not a good time for this area November 2015
good,"Caterpillar is a fast pace job if your on the mainline you have a time to get work done, sometimes parts aren’t available so your sitting around waiting for line to move"
good,"Ótima empresa, liderança capacitada e qualificada."
good,"I enjoyed my years at Caterpillar - as a consultant and as an employee.  However, the mindset that all advancement in the US has to go through Peoria is really poor philosophy - it impacts talent acquisition"
good,"I like the hours I worked there, liked the actual job itself, and and management. Benefits were excellant.  Worked closed to my home."
good,Great place to work during the good times.  The cyclical nature of the business however is taxing.  The high peaks and low valleys can make it tough to ever have a true work life balance.
good,Enjoyed working for the product support team and working  from home one day a week. I am adept at listening to clients’ needs and delivering the best-designed solution. My unique background makes me a strong leader for major transformation projects. I have devoted my career to developing proven strategies in order to meet or exceed client expectations.
good,"Good pay and benefits, decent work life balance, high-quality products, good internal systems. Low job security,  multi-layered organization, low chance for career growth."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Caterpillar was a good place to work right up to the time they wanted you gone without just cause,I had a severe medical issue and the company was not willing to abide by government laws. They used complete untruth about me to sever my employment. This was also proven in arbitration with the unemployment office. I'm still very bitter with Caterpillar. They owe me my life back."
good,"This was a job that I would recommend just because it is very easy money for the amount you would receive. They pay well over the minimum wage and most of the jobs are not hard on your body at all. Some of the hours are a bit difficult however. They have fantastic benefits as well as a 401k. They offer multiple insurance plans to pick from so you pick just the right one for you and your family. The management is decent, but they can be a bit hard on people, like most management in factories. This industry is VERY big on safety and will make sure that their employees and customers stay as safe as they can make it. One of the most complained about issue is the sick days policy. You are only allowed one sick day, then the rest you NEED a doctors note other wise there is a list of consequences that happen following the second day sick."
good,"positive workplace "
good,"Good benefits and good pay for the area. Just a business decision to shut the facility. Safety is first before anything, quality,  velocity and cost. They big in 5S and cps."
good,Lean and Cost Sensitive Company with good Work Life Balance.  Plenty of opportunities to learn.  Growth Difficult after Level 22 Salary Grade and at smaller satellite facilities.  Many chances to compete Nationally and Globally for Advancement with good relocation packages.
good,I have enjoyed working for this company for the most part. Great people that I will miss. My first position was wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed that time.
good,Seems to be a lack of over all communication company wide but I had a very good supervisor and group of people to work with so we performed well and efficiently.
good,"I consistently adhere to dealer and company standards for maintenance and repair work. Committed to safety and high performance and thrives in a fast-paced, challenging environment."
good,"I have no complaints when it comes to working in the warehouse. When i worked as security for the warehouse, there were a lot of issues. Overall a good place to work though."
good,I've worked at Caterpillar for almost 14 years and I have been apart of some great projects with some good people. I have been able to move around (not up) with this company and that has added to my skill set and value as a manufacturing associate. I will call this place home until I am fortunate enough to find a new opportunity with another great company.
good,"Ambiente de trabalho amigável, mas as chances de subir de cargo são mínimas por se tratar de uma empresa que prioriza a estabilidade dos funcionários"
good,"The task of day to day can be simple,Buy over all it is a good place to work.One of the problems i had was taking a paid day off without getting a point.You can't predict an emergency within 24 hours."
good,Work experience was good and had great teamwork experience at this job. Group leads will work with when needed the most to keep production on going. Easy to learn work procedures.
good,"Overall, it is a good place to work. Some things are limited due to unspoken rules in order to treat ""everyone"" fairly, but cause high performers to feel stifled."
good,"Caterpillar as a company provided much of what you'd expect a leader in industry to provide. Good benefits, industry level salary, ample vacation time."
good,"Weekend Option shift, continuous walking, Pulling, twisting and lifting, Hot and Smelly job. Multi tasking and attention to detail a necessity.  Over all the benefits outweighed the deficits"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Caterpillar was a wonderful job for the 4 years that I worked there. Under unfortunate circumstances the plant ended up shutting down. The hours were reasonable from 7:00am to 5:30pm, Mon- Thurs. we had Fridays off. A typical day at work was prepping, assembling, and wiring a AC/DC panel for a generator. I had a goal of 6 panels per day and I was able to meet that goal everyday."
good,Concidering the benefits we get working for caterpillar seguin engine plant its not bad yes there is a lot of work to do and the organization could be better but we have to many older people to be running at optimal speeds like should of retired kind of old but we get dealt the had we did and we make the best of it the team we have is great all friendly and nice to each other the only real issue is that we tend to work around 84 hours a week the pay is good but never have any family time
good,Management was good at my facility.  People were great to work with.  I enjoyed the work at your pace culture there as well as the work I was able to do with financials and outside the company contacts.  Stopped my desk job from being boring day to day.
good,All around not a bad place to work. The pay could be a little better and the office personal could be more involved with the people on the production floor. There could be better communication all around. Team leads pretty much run there areas.
good,"Productive and fun good pay and lots of over time has all three shift and a eduction fund for employees , has nurse on site, security on site and cameras for extra security"
good,Great company but very volatile job security. They are subject to oil prices (among many other things) and that results in many lay offs in recent years.
good,If it weren't for the fact that I was a temp and they didn't hire me on even though id been there for three years id still be there. it was a good job and a lot of fun people. The safety standards are  quite stringent but necessary
good,As a contract worker at caterpillar the job was not what I was told it would be. When on the job I enjoyed getting off. I was required to wear steel toe shoes and my foot swoll due to being diabetic and my medical provider made my appointment beyond my time to work and hold the job down. The work place itself was okay I did the job assigned and my day went by quickly. The supervisor was not in my face so I was allowed to do the job assigned and go home. I do not even remember the supervisors name. I learned to do a job and that was what I did while there my job assigned. If it was not stressed so much about contractor and real caterpillar employees the job would be .
good,"Interesting work with good compensation but management did not value position as it did not bring in money to the bottom line."
good,"Currently working on a Green Belt VST. When needed I work on the floor, driving a fork truck, pulling parts for the customers, driving a tugger to deliver parts to the customers."
good,"Full time working at caterpillar was rewarding & interesting for the period of time that I spent there, if I was asked by anyone, would you recommend Caterpillar, the answer was always ""yes"""
good,"This would be a great company to work for if this facility wasn't relocating. I never know what will happen on any given day because things can pop up any time into the shift. That's always the way in any industry. One good thing is there is an opportunity for people to be cross-trained in different areas in order to be more valuable to the company.  "
good,"This is a good place to work"
good,"I really enjoyed working at CAT. I hope to find another company that will give me the opportunities that was given to me."
good,loaded parts to start build of truck and welded. that is where i learned to wire weld.management was very friendlyand helpful. culture was great. hardest part of the job was makimg sure all the pieces fit together correctly. enjoyable was seeing the finish product out the door
good,"Caterpillar is and was a good place to work at but I'm ready for a change and somethings different. It's your usual warehouse job. Product coming in, unload truck, get it separated to the correct areas so they can be put away for the next customer. Management is lacking on our side of the building and nobody seems to see that but the people who work it everyday. I ride around in a reach truck all day or a forklift and help keep the material flowing to my other associates. Assist them if they run into any issues and look it up in the computer."
good,"Caterpillar is a great place to work.  The people who work there are tremendous employees.  While Caterpillar has gotten a bad wrap recently, from a business perspective, they are doing what needs to be done to remain solvent and sustaining."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Fast paced days all day long. Ten hour days mostly and Fridays off. Benefits and paid time off are great as well as challenged daily with different assignments.
good,"Entreprise offrant un cadre de travail sécurisant et formateur.Les outils de management sont nombreux et souvent renouvelés ne laissant peut être pas assez le temps d'en mesurer le bénéfice. Les moyens de productions sont  à la pointe technologiquement.L' entreprise offrait un confort de vie ( restauration, banque,magasin..) et prenait en charge son personnel sur la plan médical.Les salaires étaient plus que raisonnables et la politique de participation au bénéfice ont fait la satisfaction de nombreux salariés.e cadre de travail était motivant de part le fait que le personnel participait à la réalisation d'un produit finit de A à Z."
good,"Honestly, had they not shut down my facility, I'd be with CAT today. They're an overall good company to work for, offer some of the best pay/benefits around, and do what they can to foster their employees."
good,"very enlighten and diverse paid lunch very open and fun nice 401k has many plants to travel too. large eq, a different culture to work under great for a colleg grad"
good,"An enjoyable work place for all all ages,races, and education levels. Extremely eclectic group of individuals, working together towards a common goal."
good,"Great people and good work/life balance. Used to be stable but with flexing mining business, it has affected that significantly. "
good,Company's policy on treating full-time employee vs contract employee is below par. No transparency between full-time and contract employees. Job security is always at risk when you are a relatively new employee (less than 4-5 years).
good,"Good company with a solid heritage.  The contract logistics arm of Caterpillar was a successful venture, but wasn't a core business for Caterpillar and was eventually sold.  The division felt like a step child towards the end, but I still have fond memories of working for the company."
good,"experience tres riche, humainement, professionnellement"
good,"gostei muito de trabalha na pesa,"
good,"Worked here for 20+ years, learned everything I know while here."
good,"Collaborative: A typical day at work is at least 50% meetings: working meetings with the internal teams, teleconferences with Suppliers, or stakeholders updates."
good,"Overall it was an interesting learning experience.  "
good,Good pay and benefits I like the people there but not a very secure place to work promotions are hard to come by and you get moved around a lot and long term planning isn't there
good,I like it enjoyed the people I work with. Been there 10 yrs alot has changed. The company just announced that they are considering moving to Little Rock Arkansas.
good,"A good place to work, but they have been stuck in the downturn since 2009.  The last four years have been constant cuts and no indication when it will stop."
good,"Rewarding work with a lot of opportunities to learn new things. There are a lot of different personalities to interact with and you become very close with your coworkers, because you work very closely with them."
good,"Has it's problems with inefficiency similar to other large companies. However, they do a great job of preparing and weathering the storm. They are also trying to make changes to the structure, which I appreciate."
good,"A very consensus building environment, but decisions take a long time to approve due to the highly matrix organization with no one clearly accountable or responsible party until it reaches the CEO."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Great co-workers in a results driven environment. Management encourages innovation and thinking outside the box. A typical day depends on your role as it is in any other company. Good collaborative environment, however, with the company's size, and legacy of functionality, job roles tend to be siloed."
good,Very happy to come in everyday until they couldn't afford to pay us insurance due to Obama Care. Not secure in this company anymore.
good,"safety is always a first concern, always wanting to improve cost and look out for the employees to work safer and smarter company always looking to improve profits."
good,"job security is not a plus , you maybe laid off at any point,  but respect their employees. co workers are good people to work with personalities are a enjoyment when doing your job. Morale are good"
good,I worked security at Fermilab making sure all building in my work area were secured at the end of day shift. They had to be checked 2 more times before my shift ended.
good,"Oportunidade para  desenvolvimento profissional, bom nível de trabalho com profissionais comprometidos. Bom clima organizacional."
good,"I had a great career for 20 years, but Caterpillar is not the same company I hired into.  Like any large corporation, it has had its ups and downs.  Cat provided excellent opportunities for me and my family -- allowed us to move around and provided excellent pay and benefits.  However, the last 10 years have been a real challenge with low job security and significant political turmoil."
good,"Long days"
good,"State of the art facility"
good,"I would start out at my desk in the morning do some paperwork, and some data entry. And then some times I was out in the shop moving different materials. Either by hand or forklift. Enjoyed it very much."
good,"Great benefits. But after being there 3 years with no opportunity to move up. I would of been at a stand still so leaving was a good option for me"
good,"very good company to work ."
good,"Caterpillar is "
good,"I have enjoyed my employment with Caterpillar as a Logistics Planning Analyst.  I have worked with not only local suppliers / vendors, but International as well.  If was not for the fact the company is closing, I would not look for another employer."
good,"Enjoyed employment with Caterpillar, however the plant is closing and employment opportunities have been limited to just a few within the management positions."
good,"I felt my experience at Caterpillar was very rewarding. I had the ability to travel around the work assisting our dealers and corporate offices. I was part of a team that developed, tested, trained, and supported the Financial Software at Caterpillar. I was the lead for our Finance Team. As a result I was called on to provide expertise, and guidance to junior members on the team. Having said that I had the opportunity to learn something new everyday. It was unfortunate that due to economic conditions, Caterpillar had to reduce head count. I did take an early retirement package from Caterpillar but would like to continue to work. t this point I would like to stay in the Springfield area if possible."
good,Good work environment with great focus on safety and employee welfare.Work standards set out for easy reference. Co-workers were all of similar elk which made for a enjoyable place of employment. Diverse range of work in a manufacturing and assembly workshop.
good,Job here at caterpillar made me to learn lot of new skills. This job is perfect for me as a fresher. Learnt a lot of engine calibration and performance simulation.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Good company to work for. the only issues seen was they to mover up you had to be in the buddy system. Very good training program. Good people to work with.
good,Large international organization. Very busy schedules. Employees are overbooked in meetings. Low accountability. Low job security. Quality department is not well structured.
good,"a typical day at work was good, it started out with a team meeting in the morning and then we went to our respective areas to work.  i learned that teamwork and safety is an invaluable asset to any job, regardless of where it might be.  In my own personal opinion Management left quite a bit to be desired, they changed policies frequently and without notice (that seemed like every 2 weeks), there were times that it felt like there was no room for advancement opportunities; it honestly felt like supervisors as well as management didn't really pay any attention to how well employees did their jobs or how well/hard they worked.  The hardest part of the job itself was making sure every part got to their assigned areas in the right amount of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was my team; i loved working with them, we had excellent camaraderie, we all helped each other no matter what the task was."
good,"Show up on time, get job assignment for the day, go to work. Nice short and easy. Sometimes it's frustrating dealing with the management and all of their ever changing policies. Nothing is black and white. Clock out and go home. No need to take work home with you. Decent amount of overtime available."
good,"I have worked as a contractor for a year in Caterpillar. I noticed many things can be improved and not all the information are organized and readily available. Managers and co-workers were friendly and helpful. One of the parts I like is the morning meetings, which was fun."
good,Trabalho de montagem com ajuda de processos. Aprendizado em diversas áreas para melhor aperfeiçoamento do trabalho.
good,"Caterpillar, as everyone knows, is a world wide company.  It provides great pay and profits every year.  The unfortunate part of this company is their roller coaster lay-offs.  They seem to have a good relationship with their employees on the lower level.  As the management goes higher, however, the personal aspect goes lower.  As to be expected from a global provider.  I enjoyed my job there.  I take pride in my work."
good,"work was hard and fast, rarely aloud toilet breaks, your job was never safe always knew from the start you wasn't going to be able to be given a second year or a permanent job."
good,I enjoy learning new skill given to me by working at Caterpillar. Caterpillar helps you gain new opportunities in job transfers.
good,Empresa com histórico muito bom em fabricação e qualidade.
good,"Trop de responsable, et trop de pression."
good,I learned a lot whilst working at Caterpillar and became a better worker my self. I am a much safer worker and also work to a better quality standard because of the way ive learnt to work at Ctaerpillar.
good,I've learned so much at Caterpillar through many different positions.  I've also been very blessed to have my education paid for by Caterpillar.
good,"SE vio afectado por la crisis del 2008, de tener una amplia visión y deseos de mejorar se vio lenta a los golpes externos al ser cia americana se derrocho dinero y no pudo levantarse de la crisis la administración no es lo que uno esperaba pues siempre se veía cansada y decaida"

good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Work under light supervision, which minimizes your stress, get to operate what you take part in building, problems occur and they work fast and diligently to correct any issues, co workers try to work together to make each others work efficient."
good,Wonderful group of folks and some of the finest managers that I have ever worked for. A culture of quality above all. The hardest part was the constant overtime and time away from family but the best part was a supportive team.
good,I have learned a lot from my experience at Cat while working on Projects and creating processes. Creating better standard work and six sigma and 5s initiatives.
good,"Excelente equipe de trabalho, unida e ágil, infelizmente setor de baterias não existe mais"
good,The job was great as you always stayed busy and had great people to work around. The Supervisor cared about his employees and there goals. The hardest part of job would be keeping up as it was a very busy job almost every day but great organization skills helped here to make things run smoother.
good,"I began working at Caterpillar as an intern in the technical marketing side of the business.  I left primarily due to the need to focus more on my school work.  The pay was excellent for my status; however, I felt as though I had no real purpose with this company as I was mostly delegated to ""gopher"" tasks.  I understood that expecting more responsibilities as an intern was not realistic, but I felt that I was mismanaged and was sent to work on dead-end projects that were not an effective use of resources."
good,I ran the saw department and over saw workers in my area. Did seem like the management had to many leaders. I also was the only one the at the time to know how to run the storage system in safe mode. Received shipments via trucks twice a week. Knew how to run all machines in the work area.
good,"In this job you hit the floor running with a strong outlook at Safety."
good,Limited development potential immediate supervisors control your ability to move on for 3 to 5 years.
good,"Good benefits, but very physically demanding.Turnover was high as a result. Overall it was a great place to work, I would recommend it."
good,"It was a fun environment. I was my own boss. The hours were excellent. The management was very down to earth good people to work for. The hardest part of the job was some of the customers, they expected something free all the time."
good,"1.Busy, reactive work environment."
good,"Very clean facilities, friendly coworkers, management welcomes you right in. The worst part is not knowing how long the job is actually going to last."
good,"I was employed over the stocktake period of 4 weeks, but it was a great friendly place too work at"
good,Great place to work for but unstable there are always some type of layoffs. Great training programs and safety programs. Good and horrible supervisors.
good,"Revision de agenda, revision y firma de documentos, seguimiento a pendientes con mis directos, asistencia a juntas de administracion, atencion a requerimentos del corporativo. Preparacion de presupuesto anual y revision trimestral, Seguimiento a mtericos financieros y no financieros asi como su presentacion al staff gerencial."
good,At Caterpillar I was treated like a valued employee. I worked hard and got good results. I was able to cross train and learn how to multitask.
good,"Currently CTC is in the process of lots of change, resulting in changing postilions and culture.  I believe the facility is on the right path for success and a long term future.  Overall Caterpillar is an excellent company to work for."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"It an amazing company to work, learn and meet lot of people form different background"
good,Cat has been good to me but once they have you they will not spend any more on you.  It does not matter how much you contribute to the bottom line.  If you want to advance be careful.  Cat will string you along for years making ambiguous promises that they have no intention of ever keeping.  Management is only concerned about protecting their own positions and managing risk.  The rating system is there to give you an impression that it is fair.  In fact 85% of employees are rated as average and only given a cost of living pay raise. You will rise quickly the first 2 1/2 years then opportunities will dry up.  It is designed this way to lure you in.
good,"I have enjoyed my years at Caterpillar. I was fortunate to have found employment so soon after Kemet Electronics closed in Greenwood, S.C. We have good benefits and a comparable salary to all other businesses. We recieved a bonus every year I have been employed. I hate to see the facility close."
good,Work is fairly simple and the hours are great. you are able to learn multiple jobs
good,"Fun & fast paced with Co-workers pleasant to work with. I recieve on average, 30-50 calls a day. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with my team."
good,"i learned how to drive fork trucks, pour iron, mix alloys, run lead machine and all others, worked as a 6 sigma leader and was looked at for management"
good,"I am very appreciative of what Caterpillar has done for me."
good,"I truly enjoy working for Caterpillar. The people I work with and for are amazing and friendly. I am continually involved in the day to day decisions and special projects. "
good,"put parts on mining trucks in allotted time. some good people and some not as good. learning new jobs, the people you work with"
good,"Generally we are assigned to certain machines, but once and a while due to staffing and work load requirements we may be required to bounce around to several different machines, which depends on machine knowledge. I am able to set up and run all 11 CNC machines at my current employer, which makes me more versatile there. "
good,moved parts. moving the radiators was the hardest part of my job. most enjoyable was my co-workers
good,Job safety is less here due to recision. TLO and PLO are more with that we are not safe even with lot of work in hand
good,"A typical day consist of evaluating the work load witch is posted on a production board. Unpack the disassembled transmission cases and possession them for quick access. Inspect each case for broken bolts or defects, then load into a milling machine. Over size mill the servo area and insert a brass sleeve. The next boring tool would mill out the sleeve to size. The hardest part would be to have a continuous tolerance in the finished measurement using a bore gauge. I had found out that cleaning the inside of the spindle, cleaning the tool holder and wire brushing the part jig studs, would keep the finished bore within the specified tolerance of +or- .012mm. By doing this aided in the life of the cutting tools. The enjoyable part of the job was finding out that a little bit of preventive maintenance had helped to make the task go so much smother and make for a productive day. My coworkers were very helpful in making sure there was an adequate amount of material to proses. 45 cases a day would be a typical day of production. My supervisor was very tolerant with my learning process. As a new man on the machine shop team I did make mistakes. My production was low, but later, was able to under stand this new type of work. My supervisor was very grateful of my accomplishments as time past. Even my coworkers were less on edge with me."
good,a ratrace. i worked at a small shop. the politics and cliques were outrageous in mossville.
good,"worked swing shift, operated forklifts, pendent cranes, welded pan line. read weld symbols on blue prints. I learned that team work and safety was highly important in this work place. I had the up most respect for management and all that they stood for. I could go to them with any question and they would help me or tell me what was needed. My co-workers and I always got along and we helped each other out. the hardest part of the job was loosing it. the most enjoyable part was being there."
good,"A different day everyday! Great co-workers, great experience with one of the biggest brands in the world."
good,"we work hard every day building several different parts on several different machines. i have learned a great deal since my time at caterpillar, i have learned several quality issues. management there is very upbeat and and very clear. most of my co-workers are my friends and some are very hard workers others, not so much. there really isn't a hard part to this job, the most enjoyable part of this job is the challenges that i face everyday, the challenges always keep me on my toes."
good,"A empresa Caterpillar fornece um bom ambiente de trabalho para seus funcionários priorizando sempre segurança. Existe a diversidade de pessoas mas o respeito mutuo. A parte mais dificil do trabalho esta na gerencia, na cultura de algumas direções que defendem a idéia de achar o culpado antes de resolver o acontecido. A parte mais agradavel do trabalho é a organização da empresa e a satisfação de conseguir atender bem o cliente."
good,"Cat is a company where they set goals on a daily basis and its on you as an employee to meet those goals.Come in with a good attitude and mind set to get the work done. Work hard individually and as a team. In five years of working at Cat i learned a lot such as fork trucking, taylor dunn, motorized heavy duty lifter and how to operate cranes and assign work to workers. Working hard and dealing with management they give u a opportunity to advance in the company. Employees there were easy to get along with and work with. The hardest part of the job I'd say was learning all the traininng courses and that was fairly easy.Being able to work with others and management on big projects through out the facility to help the company improve in different areas. It really made employees feel like they were part of the company like u belonged."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Supervising shipments out going from CAT to end Business units along east and west Africa , with daily interference with global Forwarders , from supplying points to end users."
good,la verdad estaba muy agusto hay pero tiene muchas bajas de trabajo y eso era lo malo como habia mucho jale komo no habia nada 
good,Company has healthy work environment with many great opportunities.
good,"Como cualquiera monotono"
good,A typical day at works was always a day of unpredictable happenings.
good,This is a great company to work for. The pay is excellent. The only drawback is that management reacts quickly to any downturn in the economy by laying off employees.
good,Learned Agile practices
good,I had a great team that taught me a lot while we got the work done.
good,"As an Inspector, we rely mostly on checksheets provided for us to go off, and also Engineers's prints, and work instructions. We scan engines into a station in order to validate that parts were assembled and or processed, until it reaches the PDI department to have a final overlook before shipped to customer. I've learned all parts of an engine, how it works, and who caterpillar's largest customer is! However, overlooking a defect could cause in disciplinary action and or cost you bonus. Overall a great place to work and advance in, compensation can get to the point of amazing!"
good,societer agreable bonne ambiance pas trop de tension
good,liked working there untill work became slow seniorty gets the hours and others are laided off had 5 weeks layed off between nov and jan not including holidays and more forseen relocating back to G A
good,"Started as a supplemental employee, position was eliminated before opportunity for full time with benefits was offered. Easy work common sense was the only prerequisite."
good,Everyday was a bit different. I would help out with special projects or learn new zones when needed. I learned how to put together a cat tractor from frame wiring to driving it off the assembly line.
good,Pay is great and work is easy. My particular supervisor was a women and she did not want me to advance it seemed. She showed alot of discrimination towards me and is one of my major reasons for leaving. Another reason is due to the stress of the long hours and not much break time. Other than that great place to work.
good,"I've learned a lot at caterpillar, gone through the CNC machinist classes, learned lean manufacturing concepts also. Currently caught up in a labor dispute so looking for another career."
good,Learned a wide variety of supply chain functions throughout the product life cycle.
good,I worked 8 hours a day and I ran two machines next to each other.
good,Really liked this job and the people I worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with our supervisor. I learned a great deal about making sand cores used in iron pouring and learned how to be a lead person as far as troubleshooting machinery and dealing with making sure everyone had the equipment to preform their job safely and effecintly
good,"I feel Caterpillar is a good company, always growing, the company and the people. Competetive wages, bonuses, and overall decent working condition."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,I worked at CAT for 22years.during that time I was constantly bettering myself through CAT providing training and external training funded by CAT. Those benefits made me a better employee and a better citizen. I’m proud of the portion of my life spent with
good,"Empresa possuí uma boa organização de trabalho, pessoas receptivas, gestores, supervisores e gerentes atenciosos, cultura de trabalho, trabalho bem definido e separados por setor, preza pelas normas de segurança e saúde do funcionário, restaurante interno com boas refeições, muitos benefícios, transporte fretado e fornece todos os EPI's de segurança. Os dois únicos pontos negativos são as horas extras em excesso e o salario um pouco abaixo do que representa o tamanho da empresa."
good,"I worked in IT at CAT for 19 years.  In the beginning, it was good.  Learned a lot, was able to produce as needed.  However, as the management and economy changed, the screws tightened.  Benefits were cut, hours increased, more and more non-USA contractors were used which made system support more and more difficult.  If you can handle the stress, it could be great for your career.  My only warning is to watch your back.  The company no longer supports their employees.  Anyone wanting to climb the ladder will walk right over you and they don't care who they hurt to get to that Almighty Bottom Line.  American values have kinda gone out the window and been rolled over by their big equipment.  Good luck!"
good,Great company to work and advance. The work was exciting but extremely stressful. Time to gear down on stress and enjoy working a normal job with less travel less stress
good,aprendí demasiadas cosas los ingenieros te apoyan para mejor aprendizaje buen ambiente de trabajo la cultura se a ido reforzando día a día
good,Caterpillar is a good place work if you are a goal oriented person whom doesn’t mind going above the call of duty. There are hundreds of employees but opportunities exists. Hiring from within is a major priority.
good,A strong team culture is driven through out the company.  Encourages feedback on all levels to make the work zone as safe and inclusive as possible. A good culture.
good,"Caveat - this is based on only a 3 year experience in a non-engineering division at Caterpillar so, please don't generalize to the entire company. "
good,"Aprendi bastante en esta empresa,  tuve el apoyo de mis compañeros y lideres."
good,"Gud working in albahar and I would like to work in another Co. For my better prospects. "
good,Overall a great experience to work here. Few things i don't like here are: 1. Working areas needs a new look. Same old beige color cubicles reminds me hospitals. 2. Agency employees could be treated better (not just from management but colleagues as well) but this could depend on group by group.
good,Bueno en el aspecto de procesos de manufactura como el maquinado y ensamble.
good,Was alot of forced overtime.  Not a good union backing.  Blocked welders from bidding out of position. Good benefits.  Always a fear of layoff.  Maintained a good safety practice.
good,When I was welding I loved to do it.  When I was doing assembly it was good.  I also did logistics and did it because I needed the job.  I enjoyed being there.  I was hoping to retire from there.
good,A lot of disorganized over/micro managing. They pay way to many people to manage the people who do the real work around the plant. Not all of them are bad some of the people are really good at the work that needs to be done on a day to day basis.
good,"It all matter on how much butt you kiss to make it and advance. I am just to old to kiss up to anyone .just to advance. my education and training and over 30 years, work history.should measures up.for that."
good,Didn't appreciate how the on site temp supervisor lied on me and the way her attitude was towards me. The workplace was nice and the supervisors were easy going and the environment was nice.
good,"As someone who likes to focus on work and not really talk a whole lot, this place is pretty good to work at. Would be better if the build schedule flowed a little better."
good,Challenging work environment. Good pay and benefits we receive lots of beneficial training and have a safe working environment.  They are very family oriented and supportive.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Durante mi estancia he aprendido muchas cosas que me han servido de mucho en mi vida laboral, personal y educacional."
good,"I am in a unique position, in that I entered the company with dealer experience, through an hourly manufacturing role and was able to set goals for myself and achieve the things I wanted.  Do not expect that in today's global market that you will be able to simply show up and move up.  If you are smart, hard working, and understand how to work with a VERY diverse group of people success is not difficult to find in a large company that offers nearly any type of work you are interested in."
good,good paying job with decent benefits. union job. lot of up and downs depending on world economy. great overtime pay when business is going good. hot work
good,"I worked there for 9 years and had no plans of leaving. They have decent benefits. I worked at the Perkins facility in Griffin. On-site training, so no true experience is really needed. Just a typical assembly line environment."
good,">Only work, No employee engagements to boost morale"
good,Chance for advancement is very low unless you know someone.  The pay scale has taken a long time to catch up with the 30 year guys.  Never really know what is going to happen with your job.
good,Good place to work with a friendly work environment. Started off as a arc welder and was trained to be forklift driver and work shipping occasionally. I also was on the confined space team and worked as a safety rep for my team of welders. My Caterpillar experience taught me how to work and go home safely.
good,Fast pace assembly job don't ever keep enough people to get job done must be involved as supervisor with the build m o.jre than paid for never get really recognized for what u do on daily basis point system not fair to temp people take really long time to become permanent then must go on a 6 month probation time  in all somewhat of a ok place to work give about 3 stars
good,"I enjoyed working at Caterpilliar. I enjoyed the job I had, but the hours weren’t for me. I am a single mom and it was hard to work second shift and take care of my child. I also worked a lot of weekends so it was hard to plan anything, to have a life outside of Caterpilliar. Being on first shift would have been great but there wasn’t any opportunities as a SE to go to first shift."
good,cat was a pretty fun place to work. the only bad part about working there is about every 3 years you get laid off work. its always scary but a good place to work
good,"The company pays well. Enjoy working with the transportation part of the company.  The company is changing their policies to have higher learning degrees to fill their positions, rather than the older workers that have less than higher degrees"
good,It was a quite atmosphere and working conditions were pretty challenging as a start but getting involved with the team and coordination is quite a bit very difficult.
good,"A la pointe de l'innovation, les produits Caterpillar sont forces de propositions concernant le marché lies à la production d'énergie et machines de travaux type public, minier et levage."
good,"i dont see a reason for them to relocation to vegas.i know its s business decision which we were told the main reason for relocation,but they lost most experienced employees who has been working there anywhere from 5years to 20 years"
good,"Hot, humid indoor work.   I worked both independently and as a team.  Overtime was available when needed.  Attended daily safety meetings.  Rarely missed any work time."
good,Great place to work.  Manager was kinda a pushover and some people got away more than others.  If you overlook that it was okay.  Temps don't go full time.
good,Cat is a good company to work for thezy have a good magniment and good opportunity to move up good environment with friendly people. Good hours and good pay
good,"Working for cat is great if you don’t have a life. You work long hours and long weeks, but you get huge checks every Friday so that helps a lot. You won’t have time after work except for the most basic chores befores you have to get to sleep."
good,"Its not the company it once was,  but its still the best company i have ever worked for.   There's a crew things that i believe are not fair, but i won't mention all of them.   I think if they want you to have a degree to advance in management then the degree should pertain to that position.   I shouldn't be overlooked for someone who has a degree in physical education."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Working here was an experience I will cherish. Wish I had never accepted the Early Retirement Offer. This is a good place to work and there are opportunities to advance.
good,"At times things can get very busy and a bit hectic due to the upswing in business, but overall it can be a very fun place to work.  You get paid breaks and lunch, along with a paid vacation."
good,"I started there before Caterpillar acquired our company. Afterwards, the culture changed significantly but about equal parts for the better & for the worse."
good,"A empresa oferece um salario ótimo e muitos benefícios,porem o acesso e geração de novas vagas é muito difícil."
good,fast paced some days and slow on others depending on schedule of trucks coming in. a team oriented atmosphere. I like the 10 hr days as we only have to work 4 days to get 40 hrs.
good,"Job was to come into work at the start time and assemble parts for the Small Wheel Loaders that the Clayton Caterpillar facility constructs. Overall company management was great, individual managers varied."
good,travail diversifié et possibilité d’évoluer au sein de  l'entreprise.
good,Caterpillar was a great company for career advancement.  An employee can get a variety of experiences and job opportunities because of the multitude of positions at Caterpillar.
good,"Caterpillar is good company which is involved in several industries and area."
good,"You can learn a lot about the products and the people. Though the work environment is competitive and you're always dispensable, wheels need greasing."
good,"Caterpillar pays well and they have great benefits. It is a safe environment. You will work a lot of hours and breaks are short, overall a good career plenty of advancement opportunities. It is a very stressful job."
good,O tempo que fiquei foi bom aprendi bastante coisa na empresa tudo que sei até hoje foi por causa da empresa
good,"Good people, great supervisors. Should pay a little more. The work is fun and always changing. I think if they would raise the pay by 4 dollars an hour they would retain more experience and have a better team. They need to realize the talent that they have in the shop."
good,"Lots of management support, good work life balance, good team moral.  On the job training, communication regarding company.  Team moral is good.  Humour in the office whilst still hard working"
good,"The work itself is rewarding, allowing for decisions to be made without too much need for reassurance as well as many opportunities for growth and career learning. At the same time, their are points where the decision makers are doing so without a clear idea of what is going on behind the scenes. There are times where the company and specifically certain groups lack transparency and clarity in the direction to team is headed,"
good,"Attractive benefits and wages but challenging work life balance. "
good,Generally a good place to work but some issues with work/life balance and your experience will be different from division to division and your management chain
good,"Working at Caterpillar was very productive and fast pace.  Overall Caterpillar is a great place, and anyone would be lucky to work there. Caterpillar invests in the employees future with schooling."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Caterpillar is a good place to work. There are always opportunities to improve your skill set and advance to other positions. The office environment is as enjoyable as you make it.
good,"Was a nice company to work for, people easy to get along with."
good,CAT is a nice place to work. They are very strict on their safety policy. The benefits are outstanding. The turn around rate is high but they keep employees coming through the door.
good,"Because our part of the company was small, there was not much room for large advancements. No room to move around because there was no room to expand operations. We were a parts facility. We poured iron and the facility was extremely hot and dirty, therefore, pay and compensation was pretty good."
good,"Caterpillar was making upgrades to latest technology, so had opportunities to learn new technologies and devices.  We also worked with advances in technology."
good,seemed to me that if you were employed at caterpillar before 2006 then you are compensated fairly. with that being said there is not enough pay being offered to employees doing the same work as employees hired before 2006.
good,"Caterpillar is a great company to work in. Individuals have many opportunities to develop capability and skills. Work/life balance is manageable."
good,This company allowed me to gain knowledge during trainings and personal development. Unfortunately they are outsourcing work to more contract companies rather than hiring their own employees.
good,A empresa deveria dar mais atenção ao planejamento de carreira dos estagiários e valorizar as experiências profissionais e acadêmicas dos mesmo.
good,good safe place to work if you live close. The drive and hours are hard and long. tools provided and amazing benefits. growing and contently getting better and efficient.
good,The intern work was repetitive and purely focused on documenting processes. Unfortunately no design work was done. Pay was great though and there was definitely some good manufacturing to see.
good,"Highly motivated culture, innovative thoughts, perfect life balance."
good,"Good place to work. The benefits are outstanding, although the facility I work in never gets a weekend off and we've been on 7 days a week since I've started."
good,I really respected the fact we were non-union. I loved most of the people I worked with. I usually worked evenings bouncing between 8 to 12 hour shifts. It was nice when overtime was available to get extra cash.
good,The people are extremely friendly here and helpful. Sometimes the management loses focus on what really matters. Used to be more of a family style culture now its pretty much business.
good,I have been here for 11 years. It is a fast paced business that puts its employees and customers first. A diverse workgroup full of great opportunity.
good,"ok place to work, cyclical business causes lack of job security. all of the recent layoffs make it really hard to want to go back, but the pay, benefits, and people make it hard to stay away"
good,"A happy and well balanced environment."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Caterpillar is a great place to work. As a big entity opens up many opportunities to pursue within the group whether in technical engineering, marketing, sales and overseas exposure. The management team does recognize higher performing staff members and they aware them accordingly for their contributions."
good,"Great job, loved the friendly people. Wished that i was a permanent employee, but by me being a temp, they laid all of us off forcing me to leave and find another job."
good,"Caterpillar changes daily, so much so that most of my workgroup applied for a different position than the one they are in today. Many career moves are out of your control."
good,"Great place to work wish it would of been longer but the management and employees there were all really nice 401 k was company matched and they treated us good"
good,If you have a friend that works here in management you will go far. Other than that be prepared to work really hard to gain a promotion. Too many people talk a good game and rarely back it up.
good,"I loved my job, fast paced. was able to work in different capacities."
good,"Cat pays very well and has great benefits. However it's culture is a bit outdated and traditional. They are trying to become more ""with the times"" in terms of work/life balance, working from home, relaxed workplace, etc."
good,Great company the promotes work/life balance. Also very innovative when it comes to new ideas and work related practices. Management was not the best but promotional opportunities were there.
good,"Caterpillar is very good at providing training to employees, allowing them to grow and increase their ability to become a strong team.  This philosophy allows them to produce some of the very best managers."
good,"Good place to work.  Pay was great. People were friendly.  A lot of training classes.   Overall, this is a company I would recommend to others  who are seeking employment."
good,"My Job location was Bangalore branch. Joined Caterpillar in 2010, 6years experience  with Cat and worked with different teams and gained confidence and technical skills. A very good Company to work ."
good,Uploading model & drawing to server. And share work to all agency. And dispatch to checking. And approve the drawing. And not approve drawings to be corrected. And manage work process.
good,"Job is pretty much of routine."

good,Some of the mangment do not have people skills. It is nice when you can finsh the job with out beening chastised from the boss
good,Review daily line down report for various facilities to ensure that there are schedules due to arrive in time. Check daily exception reports to ensure the quantity of material matches the schedules due in.
good,This was a great place very self managing I enjoyed the freedom and the ability to take on much as I wanted too it's very dynamic you can really make this place your own and it's so much upward movement.
good,"Caterpillar is a good company to work for, especially for freshers. I would recommend getting 5-8 years of experience and explore other opportunities for broader exposure."
good,"A typical day at CAT 2nd shift started at 5:00 pm  until 3:30 Am. Everyone clock in then we meet with the team and stretch. I've learn about different types of tractors and how to assemble them. Management team are very supportive, and the co - workers are very friendly. What I really enjoyed was family and friend day"
good,"I loved working at Caterpillar. My co-workers were wonderful and easy to work with. I learned many things working here, like how to draw blood, doing EKG's, drug screens, and many other things. My most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with the other employees when we would do events. The hardest part of my job would be trying to get the many nurses in the United States to send me their reports on time."
good,"A great place to work, but recent executive decisions have changed the workplace, atmosphere, and have created instability and concerns for employees."
good,I enjoy working at Caterpillar Inc.  The people they are excellent to work with and enjoy working on the cutting edge of the diesel engine industry. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing the work I am doing is contributing to making the world a better place.
good,"Stayed very busy from start of the work day to end of the work day. Learned various manufacturing processes and what it takes to manufacture items. Management very demanding but did not stick to their own processes. Coworkers were some of the hardest and committed people I have worked with. Hardest part of this job was scrambling to meet deadlines due to working outside of established process. The fact the product we manufactured went to making a positive impact on the environment and when you went home at the end of the day, you felt like you accomplished something."
good,Great place to work if you are team inspired. Just wish there was more job security. The overall environment is fun. Very nice management and the team dynamic/ team support is top notch.
good,Great people to work with! Well organized and productive company. They treat you with respect and it is a very clean facility. They put safety first and have safety brief everyday.
good,"La cultura y el ambiente laboral lo hacen los mismos tecnicos, trabajando en equipo."
good,Had the opportunity to work with cutting edge technology and software tools. Worked on developing an optimization algorithm to reduce the work time of the manufacturing processes. Those three months gave me a productive insight into the industrial world.
good,"Bom para se trabalhar,convivência com amigos muito boa,aprendi a ter mais responsabilidade."
good,"When intact with process partner "

good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Good work life balance and good system approach in caterpillar and spefication are readily available in cat , Standardized process in through out cat but security is not so good"
good,"A typical day at work is a flexi time reporting, finishing the task of the day and returning home with a fulfilling heart that I have accomplished something for the day and that makes a good nights sleep to get fully charged for the next day. As for as learning is concerned acquired all my skills through my work. The management though transparent and honest in most part of the communications, has room for improvement in being even more better. Peers are always the best part in a team work and I had a good comradeship with them. The hardest part of the job is when business conditions put your job at stake. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you deliver the job that made your customers not just happy but made them ecstatic."
good,I appreciate what I was able to learn and do at Caterpillar. There were may great adventures and I am thankful that I was able to take care of my family well while working there

good,"supporting CPI structure global structure , INDIA , design , parts and system failures , resolution."
good,"various rolls of fabrication and weding to a high specification, hitting daily targets to meet customer needs on time."
good,"I like the work I do (consulting with clients on digital web projects), I like the team I work with, and I like my immediate supervisor. Career planing and growth opportunities are a big focus within my team which is great. "
good,É uma escola para aprendizado só tive somas positivas nesta empresa .
good,My time at Caterpillar has provided me with many valuable skills and opportunities to expand my knowledge and for personal growth.
good,"- Multiple careers paths "
good,"Caterpillar is a global leader in construction, mining, forestry, energy, and electric power equipment’s business. Caterpillar products include excavators, track- type tractors, trucks, wheel loaders, engines, backhoe loaders, motor graders, paving products and compact construction equipment. Caterpillar is global company which has presence worldwide either through its offices or through dealers. It is good company to work but benefits are less."
good,"Caterpillar was a good company with great benefits and gave me the opportunity to make new relationships with dealers, customers and other employees around the world. I had the chance to grow from a shipping clerk to a Customer Service Manager with lots of hard work and dedication."
good,"Large legal team with good team sprit, genuine nice boss and co-workers. I developed the project management skills, acute business sense and solid business relationship with business teams."
good,"My overall experience at Caterpillar has been positive. I have been fortunate to be surrounded by great team members, whom have aided in creating a safe and enjoyable working atmosphere. I have continued to increase my knowledge of fabrications and managing the production process."
good,"- its having flexible working time"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Caterpillar was a great place to work; good pay and plenty of opportunity to grow. There was large training department for employees that wanted to learn and move to better jobs.
good,"Eu a avalio positivamente de uma forma simples."
good,"Company is an icon in manufacturing world and has been around for over 100 years. It has however become too short sighted as economic pressures have grown. "
good,"Was great till I decide I wanted to move up, applied for positions never got a interview. Work wise same things everyday"
good,"Monitor Commvault , and Dec Vax backup jobs."
good,The pay and benefits were really good. It could be hard to balance work and other things you got to do but it's manageable. Could get some bad burns from welding also.
good,I was assigned a new job and could take what I learned from a 4 year training program to new levels.  I was able to use my new skills in helping get our product to our customers and very much appreciated for it.
good,"When I first started at Hastings, It was a great place to work, good people and good supportive management, but as the years went by the company change hands from Bucyrus to Hastings Deering and it became a very missed match company were they lost there way in management."
good,A company facing many headwinds in the marketplace.  Good at communicating to employees about challenges facing the business.
good,I have enjoyed my time with Caterpillar Inc. Now the time has come to move on after the announcement of my job being eliminated.
good,"Established company with good processes in place, lots of good talent to work with.  Multinational corporation with lots of opportunity for growth and development in different fields."
good,"Uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar, desde que entrei ela está sempre transformando e mudando, tanto de forma administrativa e cultural quanto física, sempre uma busca incessante por melhoria, o que muitas vezes muda o que já está bom, o interessante deste formato de pensamento e trabalho é que se acerta na maioria das vezes, mas gera gastos desnecessários, vejo que a empresa tem muito a melhorar, indico como referencia para se trabalhar na região"
good,"Great place to work, great benefits and team environment.  Extremely unstable though.  Too many layoffs and downturns."
good,"Overall the company was a good place to work, but the management there wasn't up to par. Very unorganized and poorly managed!"
good,"Fast pace environment, co-workers willing to help out, management was as fair as could possibly be, I learned a lot about quality, 5S, lean manufacturing"
good,I have found that no matter what department I have worked in all my peers have always been very willing to help me learn new skills.  They are also open to me teaching them new skills brought from previous experience.  Management is quick to dodge rumors rather than address them.  This is understanding having been in a supervisor role however it decreases the trust and faith employees have in those making the decisions.
good,"A company that values people and strives for excellence; though not perfect, is always looking for ways to improve its culture."
good,"Company is pretty wonderful to work for in regards to pay and benefits.  Work schedule is hectic and unpredictable, but this is common in manufacturing.  Obtained a great deal of on-the-job training, and gained a good bit of knowledge about the product(s) manufactured."
good,caterpillar is a good place to work. People are friendly and work is not hard.interesting place to work. and something new to learn each day
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Everyday had a specific goal of two sets of wheels to be built.  Management only came to area at the beginning of shift or if needed by workers.  My co-workers were great, we worked as a team and got things done right in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was learning to drive a fork truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was the laid back atmosphere."
good,"• Respond to daily ""break/fix"" incidents via phone/ticketing system"
good,"Otima empresa p/ se trabalhar foca muito na segurança e bem estar dos seus funcionarios, alem de ter um pacote de remuneração e beneficio muito bom , mas peca na imaturidade e falta de experiencia das pessoas q gerenciam a empresa."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,great pay for some jobs but when the mining industry goes down your job is at risk
good,"There was always a lot of flexibility and power given to employees that helped show that they were cared for. The management in some divisions were better equipped to provide feedback and assist on employee projects. Opportunities for advancement would be few and far between during the economic downturn which hurt the way employees felt about the company from a low level prospective. Even though this was happening the work force still came in and did great work and helped to pull out of the harder times."
good,"safety is a big concern,   Clean healthy work evironment.  Supervisors are approachable."
good,I love working with the people here. Everyone is so nice and the management team is very friendly as well.
good,would go back benefits were good advancement not likely great coworkers
good,"excelente empresa "
good,entreprise idéale pour apprendre à travailler de manière méthodique et organisée
good,"Esta empresa foi uma verdadeira escola, aprendi muito com os cursos de 6 sigmas, jit, kambam, NCI, na introdução de novos capitais, curso de melhoria rápida, leam, 5s, MRP. Sempre tive uma excelente convivência com meus colegas de trabalho, sempre que ao longo de minha carreira nesta empresa fui treinado por muito e treinei centenas de pessoas sendo que cheguei a ser conhecido como professor, pois era o único que dominava todas as etapas do processo logístico tanto no aspecto administrativo como operacional. A parte mais agradável era o contato com as pessoas."
good,"Nice place to work. Recently added more products, increasing the resistance to market fluctuation."
good,1982 thru 2000 no chance to be promoted. Was a too top heavy company.
good,"J'apprécie beaucoup les possibilités d'évolution, par le biais de formation, interne ou externe"
good,Great company to work for with many opportunities and locations world wide.
good,Management could of been better prepared for certain problems. Most parts I enjoyed working for the company.
good,The advancements opportunities where slim when I was working there.
good,"The typical day with this work starts with the Meetings and daily process improvement forum is kept for discussing about the process workflow, appreciations, Escalations , HR Terms and etc.. well a good place for a fresher to begin with,"
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,Overall a good company to work with. They are quite unique and discrete wherein everybody works in specific area to bring out future experts.
good,"8 hrs shifts"
good,Safety has always a #1. Every shift starts with a meeting. I learned alot about fabricating and working with various parts. I never had a problem getting along with management or co-workers.
good,Tive otimos oportunidades de crescimento e aprendizado. Eh uma empresa de ponta em tecnologia de equipamentos e investimento em treinamentos dos colaboradores.
good,worked well with others.been there over a year. i love my co workers and they love me. i process tags and do packing
good,"I am a very hands on and very mechanically minded engineer. That being said, when I hired in I had very little information pertaining to what I would actually be doing once I took the job other than telling me that I was going to be in the Leadership and Technical Development Program (which was a great program btw). That being said, I have worked for two and a half years in a field that is outside of my area of expertise. Though I have grown and developed myself in ways that I would not have imagined, I have never been pleased with the work that I do here and advancement into a field that I would enjoy working in has proven very difficult. Also, though they tout being a very forward thinking company, I have seen much that says otherwise. All in all, it is a great company with great pay if you are content on doing just what is told of you and don't try to push the envelope"
good,"very strict place to work, management not very helpful got good skills with under ground minning equipment"
good,The people that I worked with took me in like they knew me forever and were willing to help me with anything I had trouble with.  A typical day at work would be putting parts on a engine. I did that for the whole two years that I worked at Caterpillar. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was learning all the different parts and different engines that we added to.  I love putting things together so that was the most enjoyable part.
good,During my employment with caterpillar I learned to operate a fork truck to transport materials to/from an assembly line for production.  A typical day at work consisted of doing inventory of materials available and what was needed and bringing material inside to an assembly line for production.
good,A great place to work in. The employees get along well with one another. Flexible schedule.
good,A great place to work. It was family oriented and focused the schedule on the family. The benefits were good until they started closing down.
good,"I learned a lot working at caterpillar, the global mining market crashed and i was laid off after 2 years along with 1200 other people "
good,"Start day at 6:00 o'clock at caterpillar where we reman transmissions for GM, Ford, Crysler, Allison,and Eaton. I work Quality dept. calibrating tools and sediment testing. Aslo I've work in analysis and assembly of all the products with in the company.There are about 280 employees which work on 2 shifts on 4 different assembly lines, which I interact with all lines because of my job description. best part of job is interacting with all the different associates, including the customers. Most day end at 4:30, but when asked too work overtime too meet the goals for Quality and other depts. i'm always willing too help out."
good,Well balanced work load and interesting domain. But not a technology leader. Change is not readily accepted. Very long product development life cycle. Bad and lengthy legal policies regarding immigration processing. Lately no job security and general indifference among all levels of employees. General attitude to encourage acquiring highly specialized and specific skills than an all round system knowledge development. 
good,I have learned a lot since I have joined Caterpillar. My supervisor always encouraged me to keep improving myself. Excellent platform to improve my leadership and analytical skills. Freedom to come up with innovative solutions. 
good,Plan and manage said plans for prototype transmission development and pending Engineering changes of existing products in order to conform to customer requests and constraints.
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Overtime available, when orders are needed."
good,"I have become very comfortable using the SAP system. Moving parts includes challenges and a great deal of problem solving skills. As part of the company benefits, I have accumulated an adequate amount of time off."
good,Very friendly environment.
good,"Great company to work for unfortunately, I want to relocate to Memphis, Tn where there is not a Caterpillar position available."
good,Aprendi muitos com as pessoas e com os supervisores e gerentes.
good,"My day consists of ordering parts for team members as well as assist correct errors on various operations to build tractor trucks, I learned how to build a tractor from start to finish from looking off a composition and instruction manual. My co-workers for the most part were very friends and accepting of my help. The hardest part of the job for me was being a temporary employee without any seniority to move forward in the company. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the finish product and knowing I had a hand in making something that fully functional that started from nothing."
good,always busy but enjoyable always learning something new every day weather it be about welding or understinding the standard work or just moving to a new job in the workplace got along well with everyone i worked with great bunch of guys the hardest part of the job would of been the heat in the big shed the most enjoyable part would of been laying down great looking welds and feeling happy about it
good,Typical day is a 12 hour day on outages
good,Somewhat redundant work. Changes in the economy effect your job. Chance of lay off high. Chance of promotion low.
good,"I was an intern in Building NN for Caterpillar. This building was a warehouse. My supervisors were very nice and easy to get along with. I learned many things about logistics, and the way to get jobs done. I learned that communication plays a key role in order to be successful."
good,A typical day at work would be producing reports designed by myself to senior managers.
good,"oportunidades de avanzar un poco,se debe de tener mas conosimiento en soldadura"
good,My experience at our location provided me the opportunity to learn more about capital assets and planning in reference to parts movement. Overall I was limited to A/R which did not prove for room to advance my career. I was also managed by a supervisor who did not help advance my career either.
good,I worked at night so I got close to a few of my co- worker. I learned how to remove myself to help someone else on this job. Ecveryone coming into the job didn't have any experience. The hardest part of the job was smelling trhe paint and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"On a typical day at work i have to stock all the tables and make sure the correct parts are on the right table so the assemblers can produce the correct part. The management is alright but there is no real leadership at the team lead and superviser level. The co-workers are great and are easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is having to double back and do the same job more than once. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment, and people."
good,Overall good place to work. Great location. Good Benefits.
good,"Es recomendable trabajar ahi, mucho que aprender de las personas que los rodean"
good,"I have worked at Caterpillar for over 20 years. Overall, it has been a pretty good place to work. It is climate controlled and the job that I do is not physically demanding."
good,Enjoyed going to work  as it was a classy work environment on a daily basis learned everyday worked as a team respect each other can work with management as they listen and guide you in the right direction if training is required they will train you
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."
good,There were lots of different customers with different cultures in Iran but as a Caterpillar employee we had to behave formally and friendly with our customers. The first priority was understanding the customers' needs and demands and this made our customers happy working with us.
good,I don't really have alot to say about this company. It is a very large company and I'm sure the culture is different in each location. Sometimes these larger companies let employees get left out or out of the loop on the bigger picture.
good,"Overall Caterpillar is a good company. They have a wonderful  benefit plan. Your hours won't change much. Overtime is mostly available at times. Only,draw backs are the strict attendence policies. Their,not to fair in my opinion about that but,overall it's a good place to work"
good,"This workplace is structured and conservative. They recycle almost everything and there is a continuous improvement program to improve the processes.  Employees are trained well and safety is taken very seriously.      "
good,"Friendly work environment , good pay , decent benefits. Was able to rise from production welder to skilled Trades toolmaker thru Company run Apprentice program . Unfortunately these programs have since been suspended for the most part. They now hire most tradesmen off the street or use contractors . Promotion from the inside has become a rare occurance. . This may not be true at other facilities as both facilities ive worked at (Joliet , Aurora ) have since closed ."
good,"De calidad"
good,"I would come in for my daily shift, take care of everything that our supervisor expected out of us. I liked the morning shift that I was given. I would be able to get off early enough to still take care of my personal buisness and errands."
good,"Like the hours, learning something new everyday, clean and safe work environment.  Management was ok, benefits is great. The pay was was not all that goog"
good,The job requirements best define my capabilities as an experienced and skillful technician.  I believe I have the required expertise for the job. There is a lot to learn and training was extensive at the Caterpillar dealer. I learnt to do work in the shortest possible time leaving customers satisfied and highly recommending the quality of our work.
good,"The work and opportunities are great.  If you are looking to move around, there are lots of options.  You really could make a career at Caterpillar, and never get tired of what you are working on.  The only downside is, as with many big companies, they are always the most concerned about their stock holders.  This means when times get tough, they have more loyalty to the investors than their employees.  They will often go through cycles of hiring a lot of people when times are good, and letting them go when times are bad.  Not that unusual to any other large company... but just something to keep in mind."
good,"A good union shop. Had opportunities for advancement, good benefits and decent management. Experienced a resent plant closing due to product being sent overseas. Manufacturing in America will never be the same."
good,Great place to work! I would highly recommend Caterpillar to my family and friends.  It is a newer facility in Athens with room to grow and to advance your career.
good,"1. Work-life balance"
good,I really enjoyed working at this job because it was interesting to see the equipment the Caterpillar tractors that they make an auto parts that's in the facility. And the engineers were very friendly and so were co-workers and staff.
good,El equipo se reune al menos 1 vez cada 2 meses para integrar el equipo
good,Working at Caterpillar is not bad but with them cutting back overtime hours I'm not making enough to pay my bills. The benefits are great though and some of the people are pretty good as well. The pay is weekly and the permanent full time people make 14.65 an hour.
good,"Caterpillar is well known for lay-offs. Caterpillar USE to be one of the #1 companies to work for. They took away too many benefits and pay rates. Overall there are some good things about working at Caterpillar. Work hours are good 1st, 2nd, or 3rd shifts, paid time off. Coworkers are usually easy going as well as the supervisors unless you get a young kid fresh out of college who doesn’t know how to treat or talk to people."
good,"Good company to work for, with a great work/life Balance. Engineers working there have a lot of experience and are very helpful."

good,"Uma empresa ótima de trabalhar,sempre ajudando o colaborador nas realizações das tarefas. Preserva muito a segurança no trabalho."
good,Team was great to work with but we were in cubicles so sometimes it gets lonely. Work was alright and not fast-paced; may get boring. Promotion track isn't clear; may get stuck in a role.
good,Great place to work. If you are looking for advancement Caterpillar looks at their internal people first. Good leadership. Pretty transparent. All in all a great place to work.
good,Held a couple different roles within the company and always treated me the same.  Never once was I looked down on or up at.  All employee's got along well and could count on help at any time needed.
good,The job itself was good. Kept you busy most of the time. A strict health and safety system kept you safe. I enjoyed my time here. Has potential to be a better place too
good,Cat was a good place to work. Today not so much the down turn in mining equipment  is very low. I also learned so much about the equipment I was building.
good,"Here is the thing at cat ,"
good,The company is very driven to improve product offering the opportunity to conduct extended job shadow in other departments.  Caterpillar has a high level of design verification before release with minimal intent to move forward without this validation.
good,My complaint of Caterpillar is the lack of securing Jobs in the USA. I would like to see more jobs brought back to the USA instead of being moved overseas.
good,"Great workers,good supervisors,paid lunches"

good,"Unfortunately they are closing the facility I am working at otherwise my plan was to stay here for the next 30 years till I could retire at 65. Job security is the only risk working for this company otherwise there are plenty of opportunities to grow in the company. The health benefits are getting worse as well, otherwise pay compensation is great."
good,I've genuinely enjoyed my last 10 years with Caterpillar. I've transitioned from job to job at the right times and have avoided permanent layoffs over the years. Caterpillar has allowed me the opportunity to go back to school through the CTAP program and worked with my schedule to adequately balance my work and home life. My bosses have taken sincere interests in my career development and have pointed my in directions that have been applicable for where I desire to be down the road.
good,"As a place to work it was fine actually enjoyed it. As an intern I worked on meaning full projects. Saved the company a noticeable amount of money, and improved defect prone areas, but they still didnt want to hire me full time. Great compensation and flexible hours, ability to work during school year"

good,"A typical day at work will be focusing on strategic market growth in short term & long term for Product & Customer"
good,"Good company for someone willing to take risk and is outgoing. Good place to provide input to products. Management does not provide a lot of training in new areas, you have to be personally aggressive to learn what is needed."
good,"Very productive work place, friendly atmosphere, learn the new process and procedures day to day. enjoy and do the jobs on the days.We can discuss with the people about our problems and learn solutions from them."
good,una muy buena empreza en general solo que queda demasiado lejos de mi domicilio y esto hace que se consuma mucho del tiempo en trazlados hasta la empreza
good,"There are many positives and negatives for working in a manufacturing facility like Caterpillar. From a pay, benefits and bonus standpoint, you’ll make very good money for the San Antonio area. However, you’ll spend most of your time at the facility based off the demand for products the facility produces. The long hours required to work at this facility is not for everyone. If you’re not a disciplined person who can arrive on-time or work consistently at a high level of quality; you will not last. "

good,"Was a good place to work, but also depends on who your manager is, they have good benefits as well but only if you get hired on full time by them, at first you have to go through a temp service before they look at hiring you on."
good,Decent pay and benefits for a large scale company especially in manual labor assembly line.  With the facility closing this year and moving its operations else where inbound parts have been a issue with cut backs in overnight crew for ordering and restocking parts week to week is unknown for hours some weeks we have 40hrs+ others we may only work 30hrs due strictly to part shortage and can't run the line.

good,"The job I do is great. I love the fast paced work and all the overtime I want. The only thing that is bad, is the union. They hired a lot of people who think they should be entitled to stuff and are extremely lazy at the same time. Not to mention they can be pretty cut throat at times. Fortunately you only typically find that on first shift position. If cat would just rid themselves of our union, people would actually have to work."
good,Caterpillar was a good job. Enjoyed employees. Office staff was good but needed to order parts better. Sorry it left. Needed to get somekind of cooler air in the sweltering southern summers. Need to evaluate the upper management (office) every so often to make sure they are qualified or doing the caterpillar guidelines.

We have all learned a great deal and use the lessons learned across the corporation. I have come to care greatly about my co-workers, from the warehouse floor to management and to the corporate offices. I have enjoyed working with everyone from day to day co-workers to the clients and even government officials. The hardest part of the job was getting the culture changed from do what ever it takes to get the quantity of products to make sure we are following safe job procedures and ensure the quality of the product before you send it. The best part of my job has been when someone comes back to me and says things like, that was a great idea you had, since we implemented that, we have not had anymore safety issues, or when an investigation of an issue finds that it was not an employee that caused damage to something."

good,I begin my day buy picking about 200 tags by bundling my tags in before I pick and bundling them out when finish. I set up the big bulk items on pallets to be scanned out and tagged. The smaller parts are placed in big totes with all other parts going to that dealer. The totes are closed and banned for shipping. The totes are stacked carefully and loaded onto outgoing trailer. The big bulk items are loaded accordingly. I learned how to do a better job not depending on others but if I do it right there are no questions about my work. My   supervisor was a great person and boss he understood my work ethics and never question my opinion on the ideas I came to him with t better the work stations for our success.

I work with the robot operators, maintenance, weld engineering, production staff and quality to assist in maintaining quality and performance.

good,Caterpillar is a very safety conscious company with a safety start up meeting at the beginning of every shift.  Pre checklists are filled out everyday for the equipment you are using whether it be a fork lift or a machine you are operation.  I enjoyed the work I performed on a daily basis.  It was hard to get noticed by your direct supervisor because during my 4 years of working there I had at least 6 supervisors.  The best part of my job was meeting new people and creating friendships with people who have worked at Caterpillar for 30 plus years and learning from them about the company.  The hardest part of the job was being noticed by my supervisors on the hard work I put in every day and the poor job security because I have been laid off twice now.

With Caterpillar I have earned an associate's degree in 'Applied Science"" and a certification as a 6 Sigman ""Greenbelt"".  Being a Greenbelt gives me the opportunity to participate on on types of projects.  Fun stuff!  Logistics is ever changing which can be very challenging to the role of a supervisor.

good,Very good place to work if your looking for a stable job and clean working environment. Pay is good and employees interact with management very frequently.
good,I loved working there. Just with mining business going away this forced Cat to shut production down. It was one of the best jobs I had ever had. All I can say are good things about Caterpillar
good,"Great company to work for, until they close your facility.  Other than that it's been stellar. About as laid back as a manufacturing facility can get."

good,"I was an Intern at Cat so I learned tons of information about 3D modeling, texturing, and rigging. The guys I worked with were all nice and fun to hang out with even after work. The hardest part of the job is completing large projects on time, but that is the case with any job."
good,"During my internship, I was always busy and management did a great job of exposing me to different areas. However, the culture was negative and not hopeful."
good,Caterpillar was a good place to work for. At times when the work load increased and being short on man power it created a lot of stress. I think with all the layoffs going on there was a lot of stress through the business.
good,Well established and typical manufacturing company and they provide good atmosphere and create positive environment between staff and management. You wont regret working here.

Lately, the culture has struggled due to the economy.   Compensation and advancement has decreased but development is still encouraged and supported."
good,Worked as a intern and i had to follow the rules and work ethics strictly. Sometime difficult to follow but we need to compulsorily follow it as as this is what makes them world's No. 1 earth moving equipment manufacturer. Seen the employees there who put their everything for the company and yet maintain good work and family life balance. They inspired me a lot and taught that to become great it is not easy but if at all you want to achieve success in life then this is the way we should work. Caterpillar will give you that opportunity.

good,"I've been with Caterpillar for more than ten years now, and have enjoyed the culture and opportunities immensely. Solid performance is rewarded, and the people I've worked with have been great. Management is a mixed bag. My current manager is incredible; the best I've ever had. But work up a couple layers and it's all corporate insensitivity."

good,"Great work place culture."
good,"This was a good place to work,  The constant focus on safety made me rethink how I did things even at home.  So any company that seems to be changing how I function away form work is defiantly having a positive impact on their workforce."

good,"Caterpillar is a fortune 100 company founded in 1925.  I found second, third and even fourth generation employees.  Since this is a global company, I get to interact with employees from all over the world.  I enjoy working with hard workers who are smart.  Many colleagues work well as a team."
good,in my opinion caterpillar UK was a great place to work that challenged me everyday and gave me the abilty to progress through my roles within a teamleader and shop steward roll
good,"Best team, great customers and good managers. Lots of training and opportunity to grow. Caterpillar offers education to succeed. It's up to the employee to move forward in the company. Last year it wasn't a great year for the company, therefore a large group of employee had been issued lay off, and early retirement."
good,"The opportunities at Caterpillar can be endless and the benefits are fantastic. Caterpillar have plenty of options for career advancement as long as you are willing to relocate for them, sometimes to remote locations although that is not always the case."

Work hand and hand with section manager, go to meetings. Move skid parts around and load unload trucks etc. I learned schematics (hydraulic, water, lubrication) Able to assemble major components of a miner and assemble  the complete miner it's self. Management would ask your opinion, give you some free will yet remain in control. Good workers with a mix of talent that at crunch time was the best crew around. Keeping up morale when work was slow. Being able to laugh and joke with each individual no matter what section or title."
good,Empresa de nivel mundial. Se requiere de ingles intermedio por el contacto con personal estadounidense. el compañerismo es importante para trabajar en equipo. la presión en el trabajo es altamente comprometido.
good,Very Productive fast pace environment. What you take away from Caterpillar is the since of know how and pride to learn mechanics and how they work.
good,This is a great place to work. My typical day consist of engineering changes in VPPA and supporting the shop floor. Also meetings with upper management.
good,"It's a very good place to work. There is always room for advancement. They are flexible with your work schedule."
good,As with many of the larger corporations this one can occasionally be overburdened with unnecessary / duplicate information. Too much emphasis on the individual responsibilities of the other team members and not enough individual accountability. The people are exceptional at the local level and in general upper management is responsive to their needs.
good,"Caterpillar is a great place to work, they provide the necessary training in safety regulations and what is needed to perform your job.  I would also comment that these type of assembly jobs have a learning curve that to some can seem to overwhelming."
good,"Great products, great leadership, glad that I hired on.  Good opportunity to growth within the company through internal job transfers."
good,Its a great place to work. There is always some new things to learn which makes your work challenging and less boring. Job security is always a concern factor. I guess its in everywhere now.

good,"A typical day at work is trying to do the best at my job for the customer and knowing I performed my job without error makes me feel accomplished, everyone is friendly and the jobs are set very easy, the hardest part of my job is knowing I cannot advance like I want to."
good,"Caterpillar provided a decent income for the location of the plant, though job security was uncertain. In addition, they continuously involved their employees in ORM practices and safety improvements. Extremely friendly work environment with employees producing excellent quality products. Primary duties included the operation and minor maintenance of the cartridge pin assembly line. Certified inspector and hand-grinder. Long work days in a warm, dirty environment with occasional mandatory over-time to meet consumer/distributor demands. Though the workload may have been daunting at times, the ""we're a team"" and helpful hands always made it possible to meet deadlines."
good,A small process with few employees learning Mainframe and troubleshooting automated robotic machines and assigning the job to the specialist.
good,Good company to work for and most of the employees were decent people.  The company relies of sales of their machinery which is up and down these days.  Not a stable place to make a career because of the market.
good,Very good company to work for. They have great benefits. But the location maybe a problem if you looking for an active place.
good,"Opportunity for advancement. Hard work appreciated. Fair pay for a fair day's work. Overtime available, but not mandatory. Satisfying work experience."

good,"I loved my job there. I had no problems with staying there until retirement. I learned a lot while I was there once you learned to ""read"" everyone in the department. There just was a constant worry every other year if you had a job for the next year. And in the end I didn't"

good,"A busy workplace that has been in UK for over half a century building heavy digging machinery. An American-born rival to UK competitor JCB, offering a wide range of machinery to suit most types of construction work. A typical day would involve liasing with key support groups such as manufacturing engineering to look at process improvement, defect resolution and also reporting progress to shift manager. Working with a variety of co-workers from long-serving experienced optechs to training apprentices, helping all to perform their roles and extracting the best performance from everybody whilst maintaining team morale and positive attitude from all.

The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and also the satisfaction of when targets are not only achieved but well exceeded."

good,"Caterpillar Inc. est une multinationale américaine dans laquelle j'ai eu le privilège de pouvoir effectuer mon apprentissage. La formation proposée y est complète est très bien structurée. Son système de rotations des postes est salutaire et nous permet d'observer une entreprise depuis les nombreux départements quelle abrite. Cela  permet également de pouvoir trouver son affinité et d'être ainsi plus pro-actif. C'est une formation instructive qui donne l'avantage de pouvoir toucher à presque toutes les ficelles d'une multinationale. Le seul défaut de ce tournus est probablement le fait  que l'on à peine le temps de s'habituer à une atmosphère de travail au sein de notre équipe que l'on doive déjà en changer. Mais ce n'est qu'un petit inconvénient au milieu des nombreux avantages que nous propose cette société. De plus, étant une firme américaine, j'ai pu y parfaire mon anglais. La partie la plus dure serait difficile à formuler étant donné le changement constant de département lors de notre apprentissage. La plus barbante serait parfois l'inactivité dans certains départements ou les apprentis n'ont que peu de choses à faire. Les moments de flottements furent parfois fréquents suivant la section. Le plus intéressant fut assurément la formation variée dont j'ai pu disposer. J'ai grandement apprécié le balancement entre travail autonome et travail d'équipe."
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar."

The leadership and my co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was the uncertainty of being in manufacturing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the variety of the work, there was always something new to learn."
good,I was in a very flexible job at Caterpillar. I learned many jobs from assembly of subs on to prime products. I worked several different lines in the plant. The management for the most part was very nice and flexible if you did your job. The hardest part of my job was rebuilding product because of a engineering change without documents in place. The most enjoyable part of my job was the learning experience and meeting several great people.
good,It was a great place to work with the best brains and experienced people. Job security is not so high if you are contracting
good,"great team and good environment to work at.  the people know their stuff and want to keep improving.  this is a global company so there is a very international flavor to everything they do here.  you must be able to work with people from across the globe from many different cultures (and time zones).  not sure if i would even call this a ""downside"" - i think the staff is a bit stretched (they get a lot out of their people, specially since many of them have to travel internationally;  so the return the company gets from the team that's there is phenomenal.  and they continue to try and suqeeze more efficiencies from every process."
good,"Very good, traditional minded company.  Will continue to face up hill challenges trying to compete in global economy with North American cost base."
good,"L'avantage chez Caterpillar c'est les horaires variables. J'ai eu la possibilité pendant deux ans d'arriver à 7h30 et de repartir à 15h30, chose qu'on ne retrouve pas dans toutes les entreprises."

The most enjoyable part was team work."
good,A empresa não mede esforços para manter seus métodos planejados dentro dos padrões estabelecidos.
good,Great place to work! Lots of processes and lots of systems! I will refer this place to anyone. Management is fair.  I enjoy working here. Learnt alot within a short while.
good,Great place to work with for a new hire. Lots of opportunities for fresh hire and it gets limited as you progress in your career for IT professional.
good,"Great opportunities for on the job development, very vested in employee development and ongoing training/learning.  treated a bit like an outside if you haven't worked for the company for majority of your career. they are conservative.  I think this comes from the size of the company, how old it is, and the lack of diversity (not reflective of race/gender but instead of diversity of background/experience)."
good,"•	Assist in Developing annual business plans identifying key activities and priorities"
good,Great place to work in terms of stability. Upper management is strong in terms of business sense and direction the company is taking. Culture is very team work oriented. Advancement opportunity is very limited due to the very low promotion rate.
good,My time with them was great i had great flexible hours i had a good relationship with my boss and the other employees i honestly had no bad days working for them.
good,The only complaint I would have about the company is that they wasted the talent of some of their best and brightest by keeping them on the shop floor instead of giving them promotions just because they didn't have a college degree.  Then they would promote people with totally irrelevant degrees.  An example would be that  the man who trained the CNC workers at the plant had never actually run a CNC machine and had a degree in culinary arts.

É uma empresa que não tem os olhos voltados apenas para dentro dela, mas também para a sociedade. Outro destaque é a transparência, pois até nos momentos de crise, as informações eram compartilhadas com todos, sem exceção."
good,"Personalmente he de decir que se trata de una grandísima empresa a todos los niveles, donde aprender cada día algo nuevo y te forman desde cero aunque no sepas mucho de maquinaria.

good,At the start of the work day we always started off with a good stretch and team meeting talking about the tasks that needed to be done for the day. I learned a lot about Small Wheel Loaders and even how to operate one and work over head cranes. Management and co-workers always was concerned about safety and assuring that everyone went home the way you came in. The hardest part of the job was doing rework to machines once the machine was assembled. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with team members that treated you like family.

Finishing the product correctly and safely with no issues or incidents is a good day for me."
good,I have worked here for over 30 years and have enjoyed it very much. I have always had a good experience in the warehouse atmosphere. I have spent half of my career in the warehouse on the shipping docks unloading and loading the trucks. I work with a very diverse group of co-workers.

good,"This is a good stepping stone to gain knowledge. There is not much growth in this facility at this time. Everybody is a team. Since CAT took over there has been a lot of changes towards lean manufacturing, 5s, and steps to work your way to a black belt."

good,"There's never a typical day in the test department at Caterpillar. Everyday we face new challenges, but as a team we always come out on top."
good,"Before I worked for Caterpillar Work Tools, I did not believe there was a corporation that thought more of people than a dollar.  This corporation actually enforced their own code of conduct.  As opposed to the vast majority of companies that I have worked for.  Unfortunately I had to relocate, or that would be the career I retired from.  Upstanding commitment to clean and safe work environment.  Always seeking to be at the very edge of modern industrial manufacturing processes. Saying much more would probably be in violation of the corporate intelligence contract I signed at my departure.  However, this only prevents me from publically revealing Caterpillar's specific procedure.  This does not include subjects that Caterpillar does not own, such as algebra, or magnetic induction heating.  A fine line, that does require a bit of interpretation.  However this does not prevent me from say using Caterpillar's first responder training to save a coworker.  So feel free to ask, just do not expect a full divulgence of insider information to conduct industrial espionage.  These people treated me quite well.  I will not reward that with betrayal or breeching my separation contract.  For instance, Caterpillar participates with other companies to compare wage and benefits.  So if this is the information you are after, you can ask yourselves.  Your company just needs to show yours first, for them to show you theirs back.  Unlike companies like Landoll's Corporation, who want to see, but not to show."

good,CAT is a great place to work and the people are friendly. Benefits are some  of the best that there is within the work place. However management trends to be a little lost in that they do not get out of the box at times.

My typical day involved meeting with engineers and managers for updates to bills of materials and then follow up with ship dates from supplier's as well as tracking packages. Once my items were received, we would place them in kits matching bills of material to send onward for final builds. The difficulty I faced most often was getting an accurate ship date from suppliers. However, I really enjoyed the communication between co-workers as well as suppliers."

good,"Ideal vocation for any 'standard skilled welder', looking to improve their skills in a fast paced production line environment. Time always allowed for operators to get up to speed, all operations are trained out before working alone (not thrown into deep end). Co-workers are friendly and helpful. I personally learned very little as I have a wealth of experience but the job gave me the opportunity to 'get my hand in' on welding skills I had not used for a long time (14 years). The hardest part of the job (if any) was having to work unusual shift patterns. Most enjoyable part of the job was the excellent clean working conditions. Management were keen to encourage a safe working environment and showed a keen interest in any shopfloor requests/ideas/concerns. Team leaders were genuinely keen to help the team to achieve set targets."

good,"Caterpillar was a fantastic company for a professional level individual. I never imagined benefits so great! They were truly one of the ""big boys"" in manufacturing and demonstrated real Six Sigma through the Caterpillar Production System. They were professional in very way and it started with very structured meeting and expectation that ALL employees conduct themselves and co-workers with respect (no cussing either). We had some problem at our facility and a new site manager was brought in. The dude was very hard in his expectations (even put managers to manual labor and held to account in front of employees), but also fair, experienced and drove improvement (unfortunately too little too late with a down-turn in machinery environment, and structural alignment). Downside...laid-off twice for the first time in my entire career with the final due to plant closing."

At least at the morton warehouse and offices

good,"Loved the job, option for overtime and current management. Opportunities for advancement were there and very good about promoting within. Hated the highschool like drama and simple mindedness of some of the coworkers."
good,"Even with the reduction in force and job eliminations, Caterpillar is doing the best it possible can.  Cat works very hard to place emphasis on Safety and Quality.  In placing people at the top of the priority list, they always are concerned with work/life balance, while still getting the job done."
good,"Ik ben altijd een kwartier voor werktijd aanwezig,"
good,"Uma empresa que investe no desenvolvimento dos seus funcionários."
good,"Caterpillar provides a diverse work enviroment and opportunities for advancement based upon your performance. Some periods you have to put in extra hours to get the job done, but you are not held to a set number of work hours. I like that you get a management salary based on your tasks or assignments and you are allowed to manage your own time. My only complaint is the recent lack of job security. Other than that, I have had a very nice career at Caterpillar and some great travel and project opportunities."
good,"It is a rather conservative company with a vertical structure. Management is largely of the top-down variety. However, benefits are excellent and the work/life balance is acceptable in most positions. The annual short term incentive plan can be very nice on a good year."
good,"Caterpillar is an excellent place to work, work/life balance is 2nd to none. Caterpillar believes in growing their employees, whether from the shop or in the office. The only knock against them is that at times upper leadership doesn't understand or take the time to absorb all facts related to some aspects of the business, thus potentially causing undue stress and infighting. This is an excellent company to work for and they have taken care of me and my family extremely well."
good,"La empresa me enseño el oficio de la soldadura, agradecido estoy con ella,pues logro algo que yo nunca pensaba hacer el aplicar la soldadura fue en un principio algo muy dificil pues de venir de un trabajo donde practicamente era desgaste psicologico paso a ser desgastante por ser un trabajo rudo, caluroso y estresante al principio pero al paso del tiempo logre dominar y controlar la aplicacion de la soldadura.Por ello considero una Empresa que yo recomendaria pues  aparte de dar empleo brinda la oportunidad de aprender de un oficio agradable y rentable para la persona con ambicion de superarse."
good,"I give 4 stars across the board, You start as a supplemental and after a year your hired full time with benefits same reason as I didn't like working for caterpillar"
good,"Perm staff work long hours to close the deal but contract staff is not expected to do so. Contract staff can be terminated anytime, trade off for job security"
good,"My job specifically entitles driving and operating several different kinds of truck. Moving, packaging and part handling. I have learned how to be a team player on what an important role safety is in the work environment. My management team is very open and easy to talk to with any problems or concerns I have. I enjoy doing my job and find it rewarding but i am a single mother of three and the third shift work schedule is not working for me."
good,"Things I learned at Caterpillar are management skills, OSHA regulations, HAZmat, I liked working at Caterpillar, I got a lot of technical and mechanical training from here"

good,I really enjoyed the job I had and I am really sad to see it go away. Since it was a process I was involved with setting up it was not like a job as much as something I loved doing. Most personnel in charge of supervising us let us try out different ways to improve the dept. The hardest part was working with people that did only what they were asked nothing more even as they had seen other products moved away for more profit. Most co-workers on my team gradually got influenced by me and improved our teams numbers which then made our whole dept. look good. I don't blame the loss of my position on any one factor it is just the sign of the times.
good,"Excellent benefits with ability to advance, management listens to employees needs and concerns. Great job but have concerns as work is not always stable due to economy and industry commodities."

good,"I enjoyed all aspects of this position including my team and my actual duties, assembly is very time consuming and fulfilling at the same time which made for an enjoyable time on the job. Unfortunately I was there for a limited amount of time due to the layoff which came at a bad time."
good,Productive and fun environment with really good management.
good,"Pleasant work environment. High work performance. Inspected and packaged parts, S/R of parts and reading codes. Management was very competent and fair. Co-workers were easy to work with. Hardest part of job was work pace. Most enjoyable part of job was job completetion."
good,"Throughout my years of employment with Group ""O"" at Caterpillar, I began working as strictly an Auditor. I excepted more duties and took on additional tasks in my every day requirements. I enjoyed learning the entire process of a machine from start to finish. I asked many questions on the assembly line as a Floor Material Processing Analyst. I am always interested in having any extra knowledge regardless of my role in getting the job done."

good,I leearned to operate CNC machines

good,"Working here for 15 years now. Layoffs have unfortunately happened in the past, but that’s the nature of factory work. Uncommon for most employees who have been there for a substantial amount of time, like more than a year or two and you meet expectations of the job."

good,Empresa altamente reconocida en la comunidad por ser una de las que mejores prestaciones ofrece y que mayor oportunidad de desarrollo ofrece.
good,"I learned how to build underground coal-mining equipment here. My supervisor at the time was a wonderful man. Majority of others thought about the next guy in line and implemented it in their own work. I met a lot of wonderful others while working here, and it was a wonderful time in my experience."
good,I answered phones and help set up appointments.  It was a good place to work but time was very limited. The lay off was unexpected and it was very hard but it was a great place to work.
good,nice place to work in a team in caterpilar and annual potluck and team outing is also good just to relive stress for the employees and complete caterpillar is  a smoke free place if you are working in peoria ad or ac building
good,"I enjoyed my time with Caterpillar but ultimately was let go for reasons I had no control over.

I was in charge of taking the frames, tracks, sticks and booms to the assembly line and was fortunate enough to see the finished product each and every day."

good,Caterpillar is a large company is a great place for career advancement in multiple areas.  Most of the managers are great and some would benefit diversity training.

Management was very cool and laid back, fair, and also very organized. workplace culture was very strong. the hardest part of the job was staying up for log hours throughout the middle of the night. the most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a very positive and laid back environment with a great employee break which sold the greatest foods."

good,"After graduating from NIU in 2000, I accepted a manufacturing engineering position at Caterpillar Inc. in Aurora. Throughout my 16-year career, I was given plenty of opportunities to utilize my education and experience. When I joined the Aurora facility team, I quickly noticed several areas of desperate need. Fortunately, I was at the forefront of utilizing new virtual manufacturing technology and was able to introduce our product group to the utilization of that powerful technology. This virtual environment allowed us to audit and resolve design and manufacturing issues prior to executing any hard iron prototype builds. I led many of these ‘Design for Manufacturing’ initiatives during NPI product concept and development phases which prevented rework and resulted in significant cost avoidances."
good,Caterpillar is an excellent multi-national fortune company with tons of growth opportunities and career advancement. The company is shifting to a more digitally centric company which will lead to tons of future growth and an ideal company to work for moving forward.

They did give me two months notice of my last day though which was a pleasant surprise.
good,"I have a great day at work everyday. I really enjoyed working with people, and Caterpillar have strong policy that they don't put up with if your not a team player. I learned being to work on time is very important. Having weekly meetings and keeping up with everything that going on with the company in process. Management was great they handle every problem that come to them right then. The co-workers was great because Im a people person I get along with anyone. The hardest part is building the radiators and waiting on the parts to be brought to you keep up. The enjoyable part is meeting and networking working with different culture of people."

good,My bosses were super helpful and gave me challenging yet rewarding work. I wasn't strapped to my desk 24/7 and I was able to dictate my own schedule. I really enjoyed all of my coworkers and it was a nice atmosphere.

good,I have learned a lot of things I never though I would know over the years. As long as you follow the rules and do what you are supposed to then this place is not a bad place to be. The benefits are hard to find as well as hard to beat.There are fun ERG groups to join and many opportunity's to grow. If no jobs are available to grow in there is plenty classes over time to take to help give you insight and key areas to focus on to eventually grow.

good,"Usually I was the first one through the door to work each early morning.  I put my heart and effort into my job with Caterpillar, I enjoyed giving my ideas on making work better, and 9/ 10 times my idea was chosen. Advancement was achieved over my working years with Caterpillar and I thoroughly enjoyed working as team lead in both Paint and Differential Sub Assembly Departments, and in the Advanced Metallurgical Technician Division- where I analyzed macros and micros of specimen such as heat treat, weld quality and chemical composition. I feel that my experience and training with Caterpillar has led me to a collective, capable workmanship in this field, going forward in other companies."

good,"I come in a little before 7:30 am every day. Usually a good number of my coworkers are already in the office working away. It's typically quiet in the office but we like to sit together for lunch. I learned a great deal about the CAT culture and that's something everyone has to learn regardless of their position. My coworkers have always been helpful and a terrific resource, often making up for my lack of knowledge in certain areas of the factory. The most difficult part of the job is that at any moment there could be an injury in the factory. When this occurs our team has to go into a frenzy preparing standard work and scrutinizing the incident as they are the manufacturing engineers assigned to each area of the factory on the Assembly side. The best part of the job is the equal treatment I receive as a CAT employee and the freedom to be creative in my job role."

good,I worked with a team and each person was helpful with their knowledge. I enjoyed getting to know all of my co-workers and they did not treat me like the silly intern.
good,Work multiple machines daily along with cleaning tasks. Being able to follow standard work procedures. I learned how challenging work built up my character and working with people helps with communication skills. We did not work with outside customers that was all handled in management. Management was very laid back and had fun with the shift workers which made work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was running four machines when it usually has 3 people running them. The most enjoyable part was gaining relationships with my coworkers.

The people were very nice to work with."
good,"A typical day at work for me is being involved with a start-up meeting and getting to work. No one is over your shoulders 24/7, higher management trusts their employees.

All the managers have no clue of any technical work and boast about their technical ineptitude .Here being a manager means zero technical abilities and 100% leadership,which is nothing but your political skill."
good,"Caterpillar has good benefits and a competitive salary, but unfortunately it's not the same company it was 10 years ago. After the mass layoffs conducted in 2016, it does not feel like a very safe place to work, and culture has gone downhill. Upper management has done little to improve the culture and motivate employees/make them feel valued."

The co-workers are fun to work with. There is really no hard part of the job besides when your stuck and you have to find a way a way to fix it. The most enjoyable part is going home at nite with no injuries and getting a pay check.

If any missing information, a request was sent to dealer stating the missing information and timeline to return.   All claims should be processed within 1 week.   Warranties on parts varied so the quicker a claim was processed, the better for the dealer.  The hardest part was the time difference as this made it more difficult on the speed a claim was processed.   It was also hard to contact the dealer due to time difference and language.   the most enjoyable was learning all the intregral parts of the mining equipment  The coworkers were pleasant and always willing to assist and answer any questions.

good,"Not a lot of bad things to say, the business is up and down dependent on the time of year and which division you are in. When times are good there is big bonuses, tuition reembursment opens to more people and the amount of available OT sky rocket. When business slows the OT goes away. The ability to better yourself professionally and promotions are there if you want it and work for it."
good,"CAT in Seguin, Tx. has definitely been my favorite place of employment. I unfortunately worked at that facility for 4 + years under contract by Geometric Americas Inc. The reason why it was ""unfortunate"" is because being a contractor under CAT is very unstable. You never know when they are going to terminate your contact as they did mine due to budget cut backs. Would love the opportunity to be part of the CAT family again someday."

good,Working for Caterpillar was a good experience.  I was taught many skills in Excel and given tasks which required confidentiality.  I knew my job tasks and completed them without someone over managing.
good,I really do enjoy working for CAT. Safety is as top priority. Some things are taken to extreme as far as work floor. You have to fill out hourly boards in every work station. It's a great Idea for eliminating variances at the work station. However it discourages a lot of people from liking their jobs. Some supervisors work well with people and get positive results. Others use the boards to badger and show they are in charge and my way or the highway. Newer supervisors are less equipped to get positive results. All in all a great place to work to bad most of this place is leaving the United States.

good,"I planned on working for Caterpillar until I was old and gray but it seems that was not meant to be.  Recently we were told the facility will be closing in 18 months, spurring me to find new employment.  If this was not the case I would not be pursuing other opportunities.  A typical day at Cat involved inspecting fabricated tubes from various operations (bending, welding, brazing, and cutting) to be sent onto final powder coating.  Along the way I would assist in any problems of assembly and troubleshoot to solve the issues, measure the tubes and determine if the tube is in tolerance to build or scrap out and reform the order.  All this was done with sophisticated measuring devices such as a Laservision Vector and Romer. All this data was logged into numerous computer systems to track the findings.  All this was done with a really great group of people, with really great pay and benefits.  Kris"

good,"Ótima empresa."
good,"This was a Caterpillar facility that received bulk parts which were repacked into Caterpillar packaging and shipped back out.  I worked in several different areas and learned as much as I could.  Each area had its own pros and cons.  I had several good coaches and never had any problems talking with one about anything.  I had many Mexican and Latin coworkers that I loved talking to and learning about where they were from and their lives.  They were just as interested in mine.  The hardest part of the job for me was the physicality, in that some of the parts were very heavy.  And most repacked boxes weighed between 20 and 25 pounds.  That was a lot of weight to pick up and move on a daily basis.  A couple of coworkers would come and help me move the heavier boxes onto the storage pallets.  They thought it was too much weight for me.  I miss the people most of all."

This is an awesome place to work. Most management is very understanding, you just can't always get your way. Most senior management have been here for a long time because this is a place you would want to retire. Hardest part of the job is you need to come to work every day. If you expect a paycheck, that's the way it should be anyway."

good,"After 17+ years with Caterpillar I have learned a lot. Caterpillar is a type of company that is willing to give good people opportunities outside of their current skill set. The best part of the job was my co-workers. I retired at the end of the year (2015) and was asked what I would miss most. My answer without hesitation was the people I work with. Every year Cat hires several college graduates. I had no problems interacting with these young folks and I don’t think they had any with me. I have to say, I was very impressed with the college graduates they hired. They had good work ethic, was not afraid to take on a challenge and they were smart.  Also there were several people I was fortunate enough to work closely with for the entire 17 years. I always had a strong believe in upper management and their ability to steer the company in the right direction. I had no issues with my immediate mangers either, and believe me I had many. I think it is the culture at Caterpillar and their hiring practices that makes it such a great place to work."

good,"Having a role of a continuous improvement ME lends each day to different challenges.  There is often a set agenda for the work day of what needs to be accomplished, but is always flexible based on situations that come up.  Learning how to adapt to change on the fly is something that I have greatly improved upon during my time with CAT.  Another important trait to be aware of is prioritization, when you have multiple task being handled at the same time it is crucial to know the priority of each."
good,"Caterpillar was probably the best company I ever worked for, doing the job I loved to do.  Shifts were standard Monday to Friday with the option to work overtime on a Saturday, the working hours were slightly different than I was used to but soon got used to them. Shift hours were either 3pm-11pm or 7am-3pm depending on which rotation you were on, but still the option was there to permanently stick to one shift pattern if you choose rather than rotate every two weeks."

I was also the CPI lead manager and Warranty Claims Rep for claims under $30,000.00."
good,"Cat is a big company, so there are always new positions opening, new opportunities for people willing to try them.  The company is always changing, both to improve for customers and to adapt to the industry and business climates - this can be good and bad.  Change sometimes takes quite a while at CAT, painfully slow.  Also, they have a tendency to start cutting people immediately when the economy takes a downturn."
good,Great company to work for with lots of opportunities and trainings and diversified culture
good,"Customer focus is my number one priority.  I have both internal and external customers that rely on me daily to manage their work load.  I am very relaible and anyone that I work with would say that if they have asked me to complete a task, they do not need check to see if it is being completed."
good,Get up every morning ready for a new adventure and not knowing what is in store. Show up at work and get my work orders or jobs that need to be done. Review job and order parts if needed or gather info if needed to help in aid on fixing issue. Drive to equipment with my service truck and start my diagnostic procedures in trying to figure out what the issues are. Repair issue and complete work order so that it can be turned in and a finalized bill can be prepared for the customer. Travel to the next job location and so on.

Pay per month was more than enough for me to afford the apartment I rented in the area, and even though the health benefits were good, I never had to use them thanks to the safety focus of the company. Only issue is, if you're not fast enough to keep pace, you'll likely be let go after 90 days."

good,"Caterpillar, like all large global companies, have their flaws and difficulties. But, for me they provided my family with a comfortable life. I am lucky that I was able to keep my defined pension and continue to live comfortably after retirement. I will say that if you are not willing to relocate for advancement opportunities, you will not advance very far. I traveled frequently, which can be a burden on the family and many times had to sit in on international conference calls well after normal work hours. But, I believe I was well compensated for these inconveniences. Overall, a great place to work and I would recommend it."

The days at CAT varied form a high stress load to non at all, depending on the work needed to be done for the day and the race against time to receive parts from other distributors. Communication by radio with my line's fork lift driver as well as my supervisor was always helpful when keeping track of my material and knowing how long before it would arrive to my area. The biggest priorities were to always work safe and to do your best. Time management was also very important to, so that the product was always sent out on time. Quality played a very important role at CAT as well. Once done with the product we would summons an auditor over to inspect any imperfections.

good,"A typical day at CAT was sometimes pressuring, stressful, fast paced, productive. When I had started working there I wasn't too sure I was going to like, but once you learn what you to learn to do your job it is an awesome place to work at. I learned so many new and different things, and was able to move up in a short period of time. I literally grew to absolutely love my job and what I did. My supervisors that I had were all outstanding and were always on the floor helping when needed. Same goes for the team leads that actually take their job seriously. I think the hardest part of the job wasn't really something specifically, it just seemed like too many people were trying to be bosses, or in charge and telling people what to do. It was just like no one ever communicated anything with anyone, which makes a job harder depending. The most enjoyable part of my job was everything even down to the computer work receiving in so many different things through so many different programs, it was challenging and fun. All the people that I worked with 7 days a week 12 hrs a day made it so much more fun to go to work, and still be productive. There's not many jobs where you can actually say, you love getting up and going to work, just because you love and enjoy what you do. Well I'm one of those people. Being a quick learner and hands on wanting to move up makes you wanna work hard."
