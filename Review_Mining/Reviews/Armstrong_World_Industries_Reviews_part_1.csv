bad,Couldn't care about employees or management. Take every opportunity to find fault in everything people do to eliminate positions and keep salaries at a minimum.
bad,The place has no consideration for new employees and could care less if their employees that have been In the union for years train the new employees the wrong way then they go and fire a new employee because of three bad assessments due to other employee two days before joining in the union. I would never work for them again.
bad,you need to work under stress and very fast. i am not slow i am working now for 4 years in a company and i am apprreciated.to armsytong management is very bad
bad,The only thing I liked about working at Armstrong Flooring day shift. My hours of work started at 6am til 2:30 pm so that gave me plenty of time to take care of my business after work.
bad,"Daily mandatory meetings in the maintenance shop start the day with salary supervisors badmouthing all efforts made by maintenance personnel on work done in prior days.The double and triple standards lack of communication, favoratism, and personal vendettas are endless.politics and ego stroking have more value than job skill.honesty and iintegrity.ForForceoverti"
bad,"I'm serious, it's the worst.  They're closed now and good riddance.  They set high expectations for low pay and even lower training standards.  The employees are toxic and complain often."
bad,you never knew what post they would have u on . they would wake u up in the middle of the night and want u to be at a post 200 miles away and they would not pay for gas or milage theowner was one of the worst people i have eve worked for in my life and they would lie to u about ure money all the time
bad,"I have never worked for a company that would not buy parts to keep the plant running, or eon that provided so little information from corporate. Over worked on a daily basis"
bad,c o workers are  fun to work with and most are eager to work. comompany has taken away willingness to strive
bad,"Companies culture is to threaten you with your job immediately if you do not give them instant results. They have a high turnover with employees due to being so willing to fire employees, so if you don't get fired you try to leave before you do. They state they are quality focused but then tell you to relax your quality standards to improve their productivity. They treat hourly and salary associates equally bad and think nothing of forcing you into working seven days a week and 12+hour days. Employees focus on how to survive and blame someone else for deficiencies versus how to do a good job and make things better. Company claims to adhere to lean principles but are only concerned with how deep you can cut labor. Absolutely the worst place I have ever worked and I was happy to leave."
bad,"A bad place to work all the way around. No benefits at all, and very low pay for what they want you to do. The harder you work the less you are appreciated. Management is more worried about having their backsides kissed than anything else. The lead people do absolutely nothing. If you want to work your tail off with no support or any gratitude, this is the place for you"
bad,They lied about what my job duties would be. And you have to do a bunch of things that have nothing to do with your job such as help clean up the lab where they test items before selling them and going through the lab to make sure it is clean and things are in the correct place but they don't tell you this before you get in there. They have a lot of meetings that all employees must attend but have nothing to do with most employees' jobs. Management has no idea what they are doing.
bad,Horrible management team. Dont expect on having much of a family life. Overtime is out of control and not awarded properly. They constantly violate the union contract as if it doesn't exist.
bad,"Poor management, very stressful, low pay, long hours, constant breakdowns on major equipment that would result in being sent home early or cleaning up while waiting for maintenance. Only positive thing was the group of guys in the crew that made being there somewhat enjoyable."
bad,all they did is talk about change and never did it . talked about being safe and cleaning hazards but when there was a hazard it never got cleaned and did not want to fix what was causing the hazard water in the floor mixing with hydrolytic fluid not getting the tools you needed to do the job
bad,It was very hard and repetitive work. Quick paced and was rated every other hour. The management team was not communicative and failed to listen to employers.
bad,A typical group of investors looking for cheap labor cant make money there anymore.
bad,"Its a factory. I worked there 12 years and was just as expendable as I was on day 1. You will not be treated like anything other than a piece of equipment. On the bright side, the pay was good and job security is pretty decent."
bad,Not the best work environment. Traditional glass ceiling for women in technical roles. Company Politics culture of internal groups struggling for power.
bad,"If they didn't pay as good as they did, I don't if they could keep the place operation. The entire plant is overworked, and vastly unappreciated. The management only cares about making themselves look good to corporate and don't care about what that means to their employees. It has been over 7 years since I have felt I have had enough people, time, and proper equipment to complete the job I am asked to do."
bad,"After 20 years of administrative professional experience, I had my only “me too” moment at Armstrong. The culture is antiquated, serving a mostly male workforce, including the executive suite.  Very old-fashioned attitude towards women."
bad,"Great hourly pay, great salary pay. If your liked you advance. If your not liked start sending out your resume. Unfair with discipline. If your hourly the rules loosely apply. If salaried the rules are strictly enforced. To the point of a minor infraction could and will terminate your employment !"
bad,management does not manage employees which makes it difficult to get assigned jobs completed. The plant has had 5 injuries in a year because safety personnel and management believe in production first and safety second which is unacceptable.
bad,"AWI relocated me from out of state when I accepted a job at the Lancaster corporate campus, having spent well over $100k to move me to PA. I was excited, and I really enjoyed working there until 9 months later when they eliminated my position. I soon learned that this is how Armstrong World Industries (and its spinoff Armstrong Flooring) have operated for years. They staff up early in the year, then dump people at the end of the year to make their numbers look better to shareholders. When the numbers don't look as good as they'd like, they shed people instead of tightening up on travel, entertaining, bonuses, etc.  They always start by laying people off.  It's in the Armstrong DNA."
bad,"Better paying job for our area but the management really drags you down. Even if you do well at your job and do what they ask if you aren't a ""chosen one"" you need to watch your back. The benefits are decent. The pay is decent especially for the location. Break times are ridiculous and actually go against Federal Mandates. We work 10 hr days and it becomes very monotonous. Management wants to stress ""Safety"" but if you try to report issues it goes ignored, same way with the production equipment. You get paid vacation and a lot of sick time but again if you aren't  a favorite you get it held against you. HR Dept is poor, doesn't return calls doesn't help much at all"
bad,"Companies culture is to threaten you with your job immediately if you do not give them instant results. They have a high turnover with employees due to being so willing to fire employees, so if you don't get fired you try to leave before you do. They state they are quality focused but then tell you to relax your quality standards to improve their productivity.

Employees focus on how to survive and blame someone else for deficiencies versus how to do a good job and make things better. Company claims to adhere to lean principles but are only concerned with how deep you can cut labor. Absolutely the worst place I have ever worked and I was happy to leave."
bad,It is a job where you have to work at a fast pace. I have learned the qualities about making a good product for customers. The management is ok at times. My co-workers needs to focus more on team work. The hardest part of my job is when the table gets to full of wood.
bad,Job ended unespectingly without notice leaving 215 peopme without jobs . it was good while it lasted maybe the rest of Armstrong will be treated differently
bad,"They have there picks if you ever get on there ""hate list"" u can hang it up they make it hard on you. The supervisors can be heard in the break rooms during breaks talking about employees and spreading rumors or personal information about employees they don't like. It's just like high school all over again they need to show more of a supervisor role. Otherwise, it's great pay and great benefits. 401k makes you pay if u take out retirement after leaving. I worked here for two years. You only get a months training. If they see you can't figure out how to grade they fire you or ask to send you to another department. The lighting makes grading very difficult after gloss is applied to find defects quick enough."
bad,I honestly feel like if you not from warren or grew up with the manager its not a job for you. There they toke away the union so all da supervisor is family. So therefore they whole family work there n they would make it easy on they family but hard on you and talk to you with no respect.
bad,Left job due to discrimination and  the lack of management to deal with this matter. In all the work itself was rewarding and was located close by.
bad,this is a job with great benefits and good pay but due to poor management and no real job advancement and no job security makes it hard to see a future in the work.
bad,"You worked for every penny you got,hot and very fast pace we never got a good raise it felt like we were never appreciated we worked in extreme conditions. No sick days they have never met my family  turn over was high the work was hard management made it harder. They got rid of good people it was all about if you are not fast enough you had to go they took and took I'm glad it shut down I'll make it any where they taught me that.it's like they put us against each other leads and workers but the last day every body hugged and cried no more frustration"
bad,"The plant at Armstrong had communications issues. Supervisors and upper management did not knew very little about how boilers operared and the actions the boiler operator had to take to ensure safe and efficient operation. This in turn lead them to assign other tasks and duties, not associated with boiler operations, to the boiler operator."
bad,Only thing i have bad to say about Armstrong is job security threats. They hired a lot of people and just recently cut a lot of those jobs. Now the company has a whole bunch of spares and there’s really not a whole lot to do. They cut your hours a lot. I’m pretty sure there’s a lay off coming soon.
bad,Company has been bought and sold. As it seems to be gearing up there’s uncertainty sounds like it’s cutting out more shifts than advancing. Management doesn’t care about safety or quality just profit.
bad,Like my job ther pay is good.  But some supervisors didn't know how to run things and try to over work pple when it's 100 degrees in side plant.  They need airconditions..  They need hve plant more in order and production.
good,"Very hard, constant work, no room for advancement, very little compensation"
good,"A typical day at Armstrong Flooring depends on what shift you are working at the time, but is usually a full 8 hour day. First thing is to scan your credential card to gain access to the property and go to your set work area. The team is made up of 400 employees management included. Offered to the work force is a market place that has fresh fruit and deli. Also, the latest snacks which is all access through your employee card. ."
good,"After the housing bubble burst in 2008 and we began shutting down plants everything changed, from the culture to the financials.  I left with no staff, performing two Plant Controller and a Plant Manager role for the same salary as I was originally."
good,mixing  rubber  chemicals  learned manual handling shift work
good,"I jumped ship after the 3rd set of firings. They used to run 3 shifts in 3 parts of the plant (north, south, itw lines) they're down to 1 shift for south and itw, and 2 for north side. Management dosen't know what their doing most of the time, corporate knows even less. I give it less then a year before their belly up. Best part of working there was the pay, maybe some of the co-workers, that's it."
good,"Hired as temp to resolve 2 years of backlog discrepancies of rebates potentially due... had to research and determine if in fact rebate was due....successfully accomplished the task, as was hired full time until the new job was out sourced out of U.S."
good,A typical place to work in a manufacturing environment. Management made too many poor decisions creating a laid back atmosphere where employees sat around until shutting the doors forever.
good,Crews work well together as a team.  Lack of qualified support personnel.  Managers not up to par for running departments.  Little to no maintenance support.
good,successful in my supervisor role but did not like working in a union environment. Also a very limited work life balance by working 60-70 hrs a week. The culture was somewhat low due to structure was not very well defined.
good,"8 hour day. 2x 7 minute breaks + 20 minute break. All breaks paid."
good,Stressful work enviroment. fast paced at times. hard to find people who are willing to do that type of work nowadays. pay and benefits was fair. would not work there again
good,its loud and you wear ear plugs all the time till break it is fast pace in the winter it is cold in there and in summer it is very hot you cam make it enjoyable job if you want days it can be fun but you have your bad days to.
good,"Facilitating and co-ordinating product manufacture from the start of the process to completion, ensuring that all Manufacturing and Quality targets are met, whilst ensuring all plant documentation is audited and complying with the standards. Supervising Production Operators ensuring they are complying with Company Rules and procedures at all times. Leading daily Gemba walks and presenting performance statistics to the Plant Manager, Finance Manager and the Integrated Production Team. Monitoring KPIs on a daily basis. Attending daily production meetings to ensure output to plan and delivery forecasts. Monitoring and up-dating “Hour by Hour Boards” to monitor performance to target and schedule each individual machine. Ensuring Health and Safety, and Environmental Compliance in daily operations. Holding Team Briefs at the start of every shift. Playing an active role as a Mentor. Administering the Company Disciplinary and Grievance Procedure. Carrying out Back to Work Interviews."
good,"finish line is typically 8 hrs/m-f.  with 20 minute paid lunch breaks"
good,"The shift preference is not yours, the overtime is short notice. Management isn’t required to give you anything outside of what a mushroom would receive"
good,The Armstrong World Industries Pensacola plant is a rewarding place to work. You can rank up pretty quickly in the AWI system but the plant has little technical problem solving and lackluster management
good,Armstrong has a strong local presence in the community and therefore employs many local community members. It can be tough to make decisions due to the complex hierarchy.
good,Good place to work. Long hours and a hot working environment. Pay is high for the work that is required. Decision making is somewhat confusing and prone to sudden changes.
good,"If your manager is good, your work experience will be good. It's very fast paced and you definitely earn your pay there. If you can't handle the work load, you won't make it there."
good,"fast paced,cold in the winter very hot in summer.good people on the line learn to work with others.management never listened told lies made promises,they did not keep..stressful at times you just had to keep your head up and pray that things would get better.hardest part of job dealing with different people who did not want to work as a team.The most enjoyable part was having a good leader and teamplayers."
good,"Boring. Slow days, short breaks, and insanely boring work. Management is a complete joke. Pick favorites, and if you're not one of them, you're screwed."
good,knee jerk reactions are often cumbersome.  Slow to respond to the market.  Great products and quality just missing the mark as everything has added complexity.
good,"a typical day flew by, you bust your tail up until break take your break then right back to it. it was a pretty good job though. i would work there again"
good,This is a good place to work if you just want to earn a paycheck. If you want to advance this really isn't the place to work. This company is a union place of employment. So joining the union is required for employment.
good,"Working 12 - 14 hours a day a day 6 days a week with no work / life balance. Not receiving vacation when asked."
good,when going in never really was sure on where I was going to be moved to for that night very fast paced company very productive great pay great safety team
good,"Rushed, frustrating, workplace culture was every man for him or herself.  The hardest part of the job was finding someone to assist with the job responsibility.  Most of the experienced people were let go from the company."
good,A typical work day was fast passed and constant. Management did not interfere much as long as things were running smoothly. The workplace environment was a team based environment where everyone was considered equal. The hardest part of the job was then there were tear-offs and the flooring needed to be webbed.
good,Excellent work environment at the non union sites and corporate office. Much opportunity at the union facilities. There needs to be more accountability.
good,When I started we had three shifts I worked second shift but after 2 years they layed second shift off. Probably still be working there if hadn't been layed off.
good,"I liked my time at Armstrong, and didn't mind the aches and pain every now and again. The employees where nice and pretty nice to get along with. I liked the supervisors and the plant manager. They where very interactive."
good,"Armstrong was a great company to work for. I learned how to manage large territories and many employees while employed there. I did builder work, retail work, distribution management, and territory training and selling."
good,not to bad its very hot not much air even with fans.the pay is good for the area work very hard and short handed often. the lunch rooms are kept clean
good,"a typical work day is hot fast paced and hot."
good,Great job great pay long hours great benefits..great work environment...business got slow which forced the closing of the Finish Line other than that I would still be an Armstrong employee
good,"very fast paced and lots to learn but worth the knowledge of learning new jobs, the pay is very good with great benefits but can be alot of pressure doing multiple jobs."
good,The point system doesn't allow you to miss work even if you have a doctor's excuse or have to go to the emergency room if you are sick or hurt. The management was also very poor.
good,If the plant wasn't closing due to lack of sales it's was a good place to work. Everyone was like family here and we got along and worked as a team. Even the mangagmen team was a great group of people
good,It would've been a good job if it wasn't temporary i could've stayed and worked here for a couple years pay was good its just they shut down to soon on me
good,I did not appreciate the way I was treated at this company.  I was treated as though I were a number and not an employee.  The bosses were jerks and didn't offer much help when the need arose. This site wouldn't let me put 2 stars for overall job stars.
good,Armstrong declined because of the market but during my time with Armstrong I was able to learn and improve my skills tremendously. The opportunities that I was afforded were wonderful.
good,"10 hour days with some fridays off but not usually. It is union work so, all opportunities for advancement are by seniorty.  Get ready to start on 3rd shift if you work here."
good,Armstron was a very hot and dirty facility to work at. I really didnt enjoy it because it was also grave shift. I worked temp for several months doing the same job as the other leadse. I thought that was unfair. I had to go in big hot dryers and pull hot would out for hours when there was a jam in dryer
good,The people who work there are fantastic however from an organizational aspect the culture is very embedded.Its very difficult to implement new ideas and change processes because of the deep culture.
good,"Ok place to work just very hard on the body"
good,Great people to work with.  Stable employment.  Fair compensation.  Work-life balance is difficult to maintain.  Mid-level management needed to improve their management skills.
good,"Good place to work, undergoing difficulties. 3rd shift eliminated, my shift, had,  problems with answers given. Disagreements with supervisors.   Some used excuses, to eliminate personnel."
good,"Great bonuses, usually good opportunities for advancement. There are too many and too complicated layers of management without enough people to do the work."
good,"The amount of hard labor that is required is intensive. If you can make it through the run around of getting hired on through PENMAC, then the benefits alone are worth it for a family."
good,Worked hard at making improvements which would stick. Drove the Lean manufacturing concepts down to the floor level and listened to the employees ideas for making change.
good,"Packaged finished hardwood flooring, repatative work throughout the day. Worked 10 hours shifts, five days a week. Some mandatory over time as well."
good,"Good Company"
good,They hired college students to help out in the summer so their full time employees could take time off work.
good,working long hours but for good pay supervisors are understanding and work with employees well to accomplish common goals to insure a quality and efficient product
good,"Not much good or bad about the company. "
good,Fast paced manufacturing very demanding but wages are very competitive for the cost of living in the area. Very little room for advancement but employee benefits are good
good,I'm only looking for other job because on 10/6/17 production line is closing for good. I would retire at Armstrong .Armstrong is a good place to work no complaints.
good,"Very Strong work ethics for Self/Customers/Channels, Elaborative Product Range. Business friendly Policies for Channel Partner."
good,"Armstrong is a leader in the design and manufacture of floors and ceilings. I am a Project/Sales manager and Internal Technical Support CEE. Area of responsibility is total Central Europe, with more proactive approach in Central Europe South (Black Sea area), due to languages skills.A typical day at work start at 8:30 am till 5pm and is a tipically office work (phone, excel, e-mail, database) - routine work."
good,"Armstrong is a very family friendly company, and gives back to the community. Also offers a fair wage and good benefits, management is supportive and encourages advancement."
good,Good company too work for good pay and shift pattern gives you plenty of time off workforce are great very helpful good salary including pension and bonuses
good,Overall good company to work for.  Very collaborative and team environment.  Competitive pay and benefits.  Unfortunately strategy has been to shrink the company to a more regional player.
good,Collectively I was very happy being employed through Armstrong Flooring Industries. They have excellent benefit options available to their employees from day one. Weekly paychecks are always a plus. And given the location the pay is pretty good.
good,"Armstrong Flooring is very good to its employees.  It has shut down some locations, so its stability is in question.  Overall, it is a good place to work."
good,"Good place, competitive wages. Able to learn key positions and aquire experience in a unique process of producing a natural product. Descent people to work with and very big on safety orientated."
good,The plant I worked at shut down but the overall company was very good about focusing on quality and training.  They allowed me to get my six sigma green belt and also the ability to learn a lot while I was working there.
good,"Good pay, good benefits."
good,Good pay lots of overtime safty meating every morning. Good at fixing issues good and easy to talk to staff lots of room for advancement  willing to train for other jobs and get certifications
good,"Good place to work, employees and management very nice and helpful. The pay is very good. Well trained to do your job. rotate every 20 mins to eliminate fatigue."
good,the work is hard and fast paced but still at the end of the day you feel satisfied by the work youve done. There is some people in management who feel the ladies shouldnt be working there and they can make the day difficult but over all it is a good place to work.
good,"Stressful"
good,A great deal of travel involved with responsibility as an Engineering resource for existing equipment and for project work at five or more facilities. Corporate management was very hands on for projects at the various plants being onsite frequently. The job was very gratifying giving me the feeling that I was making a difference.
good,Armstrong is a company that cares about it's employees.  Armstrong has given me the opportunity to develop my career.  Armstrong strives to be the best company to work for by continuing to strive on work/home balance.
good,"A typical day starts by 5:30am and ends around 3:30pm. The day is usually busy with meetings and planning sessions to make sure we are being accurate and accountable to our peers, the plant, and the company. There is flexibility with the current management group if there is something going on and you need to flex your labor time to cover an issue at home you can without issues. I enjoy my position."
good,Enjoyed working with the people and was able to get to know many of the employees I assisted along the way.  I felt I was a mentor to many of the newer staff members.
good,"very fast paced environment, something new to learn everyday. Managers are very flexible and supportive but also very demanding and needy. Co-Workers are busy handling their own tasks but will help if you ask for it. Trying to keep all the changes straight that get made throughout the month.  I like entering and tracking projects."
good,"This place had good pay and benefits, I enjoyed working there til they closed their doors."
good,"Armstrong being the market leader in flooring and ceilings is very agressive in taking market share from the competition. The most recent effort in achieving this is to lower production costs, this being achieved by a lean manufacturing transformation. Armstrong offers competitive salaries and benefits."
good,"Great place to work, lots of jobs to pick from. was a fun work environment. Paid really well and had a great work schedule. would deffinatly recomend this job."
good,Positive work environment with a strong safety culture.  Rotating shifts were not desired working as much as two weeks straight.  Lots of opportunity to move up within the company.
good,Fast pace working environment involving a lot of hard work. Company has decent pay with benefits. Also provide dinners and pizza parties when company meets goals to show employees their gratitude.
good,"If you are looking for stability, Armstrong Flooring Inc. has this hands down.  With competitive salary and benefits, there is no reason why someone ready to settle should look no further."
good,Lots of over time mandatory and optional. Kind of tough to balance home life and work. Management sucks BIG TIME. Two tier pay scale in place. Which sucks. But you can make plenty money.
good,Quite busy with tracking budgets and making sure we are hitting targets.  I learned a lot about planning and how accuracy plays a huge role in the budget forecasting. Absolutely amazing managers at the plant. Co-workers we very helpful and supportive. Hardest part of the job was trying to get within +/-$1k each month on the budget. The environment and the position in itself was a great job.
good,I was appointed at an Executive level and promoted to Assistant Manager within a year. A fantastic organisation with lot of opportunities for the right candidate.
good,Great benefits and upper management was a pleasure to work for. Very rewarding job because we could daily and monthly check our performance. Made many great and life long friends there.
good,I was just there as part of a paid work experience. I was given a pile of papers everyday and told to organize them alpabeticly. Management seemed nice for the most part. Most of the co-workers just seemed to keep to themselfs and do there work untill lunch time came. The hardest part was keeping it all organized while people kept droping more papers on my desk.
good,"I enjoyed working here, some people were uptight but for the most part they were fun. The job was messy and fast paced but enjoyable."
good,When I worked there I felt a sense of accomplishment and belonging. Pay and benefits were more than fair. I didnt have any cons from working at armstrong other than I waa let go based on seniority not work ethic and productivity
good,Incredible management.  They really know how to treat their employees.  I enjoyed working there.  Very professional environment.  The moral was really great and you enjoyed coming into work.
good,The pay was competitive to other companies. Their benefits were good. Their work schedule allowed outside activities. Very good workplace. I would recommend to friends and family.
good,This is a great place to work. Ihas been a pleasure and the prople are awesome. The work is fsat paced and fun. The product is very well built and looks great.
good,Enjoyed the updated equipment they had on site. Traveled to different mills with lumber buyer. They offered great benefits and salary. Safe working environment
good,As the shot rang out the young lady in the shadowy door way knew she was too late to save her young lover. The next sharp crack of the rifle surprised her to her very core. When she look down she saw a red bloom appearing on her new white blouse and wondered what she spilled on it. the darkness as came swift as a cat running in the shadows.
good,Armstrong was a good job for me. I would have stayed there if not for the layoffs that occurred . I enjoyed the production work and the working environment.
good,"A team environment we were our own boss unless a problem would occur that the team couldn't handle then we would call for technical support."
good,"We got  to work and had our daily meeting, then we went to work and made our goal and we went home if we did our jobs right we got a reward at the end of the week"
good,Very fast paced work. Majority of the management was friendly. Stressful environment but the pay was good. Offered decent benefits for their employees. Employees are laid off pretty often.
good,Couldn't really ask for anything more in a workplace!  Safety is key focus of organization from the CEO all the way down to the shop floor.  The plants really do live the culture.  The job is rewarding and challenging.  Highly recommend Armstrong for future candidates looking for a place to work hard and expect to be rewarded for your efforts with personal acknowledgment and opportunities for professional growth.
good,"This facility is a wonderful place to work. Great benefits and great family oriented environment. This employer has been around in Jackson, Mississippi well over 60 years. I strongly encourage if given a chance for anyone to apply at this facility."
good,Armstrong world industries is one of the leading manufacturers of False Ceiling and Flooring. It has a great Productive and fun workplace with efficient Management Team. A great learning place and with lot of carrier options.
good,"Good company to work for with decent perks, however long working hours. I won't mind working for this company in future too."
good,"I worked @ Armstrong almost half of my life.  It's like every other job, good days and bad.  Requires someone who is  not a ""slacker""."
good,"There no typical at day at A.W.I. , we have a shedule for all maintenance and production work but we're aways ajusting for unforeseen issuses. It allways comes together because we have well traIned crews and a management team that gives us the tools we need to get the job done."
good,"The job is faced paced and difficult, great benefits, paid lunch break, only issue i have found is that when the mill breaks down they make us clock out. Other than that, great place to work."
good,"Armstrong Floorings pays very well based on what job title you have! They have plenty of benefits such as healthcare, dental care, insurance and paid time off for vacation! It’s just long hours and it gets very hot but when everyone does their job it goes by very steady."
good,"High qualified sales & operation team ,so working culture is very professional here,very good understanding between the team & management so it has been grown very fast in India more than expectation of the parent company"
good,I enjoyed working here everyone seemed to know what they we're doing at all times they are very strict on safety witch is a very good thing considering all of the machines they use as for the management most of the management team we're very easy to get along with and very helpful starting out on a new job but most of all the work is hard and very tireing but at the end of the week it is very worth it
good,Process invoices for payment - Hard work pays off - Management was there to manage - I never had a problem with them -workplace environment was good - cannot say any part was hard - being busy all day
good,"maintain inventory by identifying, labeling and placing materials and supplies in stock recorded location of inventory.prepared finished stock for shipment by identifying,pulling,packing,crating,loading,and securing product. documents product shipment by recording units shipped"
good,"I was quite new to reception work but i've been taught alot thanks to Armstrong. I'm now looking for work in the reception admin area, hopefully with my experience here i will get a job soon."
good,It was a great company to work for. Most days were busy inspecting ceiling tile and testing the boards to make sure they are good quality to send out. Pretty fast pace every day. For the most part we all worked as a team.
good,"I currently work as a production supervisor. I show up to work typically around 30 mins before the shift starts to check emails, ensure the equipment is turned on properly, go over the production plan with my leads, enter in the sku's we are running for the night. I then hold a safety meeting at the beginning of every shift. After our meeting I delegate where everyone needs to go for the night. During the production hours I run several yield checks as well as ensure everyone is working in a safely and efficient manner.
