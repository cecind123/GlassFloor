rating,review
bad,"Horrible, don't do it! I would rather put a needle in my eye than work for this management staff. Horrible treatment if you work in the office. They don't care if you are overworked."
bad,"Not given proper tools to complete job requirements, no communication, no inclusion for contractors. Teams are full of clicks, that purposely exclude contractors."
bad,If you want to work more than 40 hours a week without the correct compensation just to keep up with the minimum this is the job for you. Management doesn't care to be competitive in salary and expect you to work the overtime regardless of your home life.
bad,would not work here again with the management did not have any skill for interacting with people. many people quit in a few weeks and are expected to work many hours of overtime
bad,If you are not part of the 'in-group'; then you can forget about getting promoted or moving into another position. Management can get away treating their employees horrible with verbal abuse and threatening their jobs.
bad,"Poor management and upper leadership, over works employees and most of all they are NOT accommodating to disabled persons as the company portrays. If you stand up against something wrong, they will make you a target."
bad,That’s what they told us on day one. Afraid members wouldn’t like it. Stupid scripts that have to be read. Always worrying you’ll fail the call if you don’t say everything exactly as they want. Impatient rude members make our job stressful and unenjoyable. No vacation time for one year. NO THANKS
bad,"From the customer service I received as a member, I thought it'd be great to work for such a respectable company. I waited three long years to get my foot through the door even if it was through a contractor position. My workload kept me busy. The training contractors get was no help so I learned on-the-job as I went. The hardest part of the job was trusting my boss only to learn that there was no growth opportunity. I gave feedback on training, and that was completely disregarded. You're just a number to this company."
bad,"initially friendly but watch out. management has no set schedule to train external hires. DON'T EVER detail your experience & education. If you do, you will have those set to mentor stab you in the back. DON'T bring any personal property or they won't return it. Relocation bonus is taxed - human resources won't tell you the truth.  Practice in the training environment on how to use the system is lacking. STAY AWAY. Waste of your energy and time. forced to file a police report to get my property back."
bad,"From idiotic managers and yes man that are just all lap dogs licking the boots of VPs this place was once great with a superior mission, now it's a poorly worded joke and their CEO is the punchline."
bad,sAME AS ABOVE. Management is their problem. They take a military approach to everything. Just getting into work was a pain in the butt. You had to wait at a gate while some supposedly security guard took 5 minutes to let each car go thru.
bad,"At first it's a nice place but then things start changing,  thier policies and you don't get paid enough to deal with customers cussing at you,  you dont get usaa paid you get ttec pay, the TLs suck, schedule sucks. They don't care if your sick or dying the just wanna make sure ttec isnt paying  millions of dollars"
bad,Run the other way. My manager accused me in public of things I did not do. He bullied and humiliated me in public after weeks of praising my work. His boss was even worse. Most cowirkers would not collaborate or cooperate with me and company ergonomics rules were not followed; one manager didn't even know what ergonomics was. I am even a USAA member but I was abused .anridiculef
bad,"A company that requires ""Prospect"" new employees to sign an electronic arbitration/mediation agreement it is NOT only WRONG but it tells a LOT about USAA."
bad,It’s no different than any other call center. The members are great but that’s the only good thing. It’s not a place to be if you have a personality. Truely
bad,They lie about everything and practice unfair business practices. They use operant conditioning as a training mechanism and I would never recommend anyone working there.
bad,"Not worth the stress, overworked underpaid manager dont know anything micro manage cant take time off, treat you like children, will regret the position once you are hired"
bad,"The tries its best to cater to the workforce, however, their retention problem lies in their micromanagement of the micromanaged managers.  Everyone is micromanaged to the point that even bathroom breaks are timed and criticized.  You are constantly being video monitored and offices are completely littered with company propaganda much like military propaganda (no surprise there)."
bad,"Did not like this place and would not recommend to anyone"
bad,"As contractor you are suppose to be quite and work only  what is given to you ."
bad,"I worked in Colorado Springs, you are on the phones all the time, other than the benefits its not a good place to work.  They will say there is room to advance and there simply isnt."
bad,"This company preaches its all about the employees however, they at the drop of a hat, discipline and point out when errors are made. I found this company offensive as many of the female management employees were pushy, brash and abrasive and seemed to ""Have to prove something"".."
bad,"The management sucks. It's like being in prison. No Windows, no phones on the floor and no ""contraband""(anything of paper form)! You have to take the lable off any bottled drinks before entering the facility! The phone cords are extremly short and dated to make sure you don't move from your seat! Its hard to stand and stretch without the headset faking off your head.After working there for four years you only get 64 hours of benefit time for the year(32 if your part time)! We do not accumulate sick time or vacation time only the 32 (for part-time employees)or 64 (for full-time employees), so use your time wisely! The health insurance is extremely costly about $300 per month for the employee not including children or spouse. The callers are rude and management do not allow you to take time to regroup after calls. They continue to lie about raises because so many employees have left to pursue other companies! The building is filthy. People are constantly sick at work due to not being able to afford the day off or scared to get fired because of points. Scabies,the flu,bed bugs it's all there!"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Wouldn't give me two days off in a row even though there were people leaving left and right. Supervisors were micro managers, survey's were a joke, horrible culture."
bad,Stay away... horrible culture. Backbiting managers who dote on their pets. Kiss their rings or be fired. Incompetent  arrogant and non-compliant Leadership. Shame on you.
bad,"I have been here nearly 5 years and my director doesnt know who I am. USAA leverages the military persona to push the bottom dollar. They are not special, and the constant federal fines for compliance violations proves that."
bad,"The mission was never followed. Managers never helped out, always referred to senior processor to help They would give us attitude for asking for help"
bad,"I’ve been with USAA for over 2 years and I’m ready for a change. They have made changes over the past year to improve processes and the consumer experience, and in doing so, have created extremely stressful working environments. I look forward to clocking out every day and can’t wait to not have to come back. If you like having management nit-pick every move your make, this is the spot for you."
bad,"Do not apply here! Really, the HR staff are unethical, they don't care about the hourly employees just drones ready to take another call. Don't waste your time in this boiler rook the people are fake."
bad,"I was employed with USAA for over two years and in that time I struggled a lot with management. USAA claims to be a veteran company but in the end it is nothing more than a marketing tool. As a veteran myself I never received support from my management team in helping me with appointments I had at the VA or the fact that my disabilies I obtained while serving often times hindered my ability to meet my “quota” that was required of me in my position. I was discarded and made out to be a disgruntled employee and that was never the case. Even my manager being a veteran himself could not give me empathy or work with me so that I could continue my employment and also seek the help I needed. USAA failed to provide a veteran friendly environment which they so proudly claim to have. I gave my best effort day in and day out, was promoted quickly, received numerous accolades for my performance but because I did not hit a number on a spreadsheet I was thrown to the wind. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Veteran or not it is not the ideal situation for prospective employees."
bad,"Management talks about the mission, but all they care about are phone stats.  Make no mistake, this is a call center where you are tied to your phone.  Every minute off of the phone will be recorded and looked at.  I was even asked to work off the clock, which is illegal.  Management will even let you securities licenses lapse, and blame you for it.  DO NOT WORK HERE!!"
bad,"You really have to get involved  in everything, be extra friendly to management, and sale a whole lot of products to advance at usaa. They are very picky and bias. I worked for USAA for about a year and a half. I had resigned because I wanted to take on a new venture. My manager stated I was rehirable and I left on good terms. I was probably just thinking about the yearly bonus but things didn't go as planned so I reapplied to a few positions at usaa to try to return. I couldn't even get selected for an interview. Everytime I applied, a couple days later it would say No longer under consideration. I was curious so I contacted HR and asked them what's going on. They stated other candidates just are more qualified. I'm thinking that someone who is a former employee, has four years of call center experience, two years experience in insurance, still licensed, a Veteran, and a college graduate cannot get a interview and there's more people qualified than that and the position I applied for is still posted online so apparently they're still looking for people but they don't want to hire someone with those credentials? I guess. I just laughed it off and said you know maybe I don't belong there. Usaa is not my company and not for me. It'll take forever for you to get a schedule with two consecutive days off. They don't care about work life balance. They want usaa to be your life. The company only cares about getting sales. They're so sale driven and greedy. It's so busy and stressful and management claims they want to hear your voice but when you give a suggestion on something, they"
bad,"When I started at USAA they were an outstanding company. Good Benefits and adequate pay. Starting 4 years ago, with the retirement of the CEO, that all started to change. Today USAA has completely lost it's sole. Most of the people (including their top paid Loan Officers) are unhappy. They will promote from within however they do not promote on the basis of ability, but rather on how well you have built a network."
bad,"I worked here briefly, 6 months. I left because the work environment was not bearable for me. It's like a cult, not a normal work environment. If you are not in your 20's and from the military or part of a military family, you won't fit it. This was the most uncomfortable I have ever felt in a work environment. It actually made me physically ill. I wasn't able to get help from co trainees or co workers since I wasn't part of their group. My manager wasn't interested in me until I gave my notice and she was urged by her boss to try to get me to stay. I went to USAA thinking I would have the possibly of promotion and would be able to eventually work from home. Instead, it  was just a horrible, micro managed, call center where you have to work overtime on the weekends to do your own assigned claims because the rest of the time you are taking inbound calls with no time between to do your own files."
bad,All talk and no action. They do not truly care about the employees. Too strict and does not train employees to do their job.  They spend a lot of time training for overall knowledge and do not provide simply instructions needed to complete your job.  They do not review based on your true job performance. They only use metrics that more than likely are completely out of your control.
bad,"Director was focused only on himself. Called all his team members liars when, in fact, he was the one lying. "
bad,USAA has lost its way.  The new motto is save a buck.  Advancement is bleak and the culture that once was is gone. Upper management is purposefully blind to all that is occurring due to large egos and deaf ears to employee feedback.  Work life balance is no longer a viable concept and in order to get an industry comparable salary you have to go somewhere else.  the benefits are not worth the stress and toxic working environments that USAA finds itself in.
bad,"Management was spineless, when it came to talking to the employees about what they need to do to improve or advance. They make sure you don't speak up in meetings, otherwise, you're blackballed!"
bad,"Management was horrible. Pay was ok the cut throat stay on the phones was just not my thing. I knew it wasn't but when I applied they lied and said that there ""Call center wasn't like others"""
bad,USAA is great if you need health insurance you are willing to play the game of it not about the numbers but you need to sell more products.  Just come in and say yes and you will be fine until you can not take it anymore.
bad,"Management was more concerned with earning the trophy for site of the month than it's employees.  They did not care about hours, favoritism and bullying"
bad,Micromanagement with no chance for advancement. They told me for years that I was not getting promoted because I did not have a degree. I successfully completed my bachelors degree and still was denied promotions.
bad,If you are going to work for an insurance agency DO NOT get stuck in this phone trap that actually dislikes veterans!!! They pay you terroble pay and you are stuck on those aweful calls all day!!
bad,"Contractor buys a salad for $10.00, employee buys the same salad for $3.00, where is the fairness in that? USAA has  a policy or program that as long as their employees eat healthy they get the healthy food discount, as a contractor we also work for USAA however because we’re contractors we have to pay full price which I say is label discrimination. We do the same amount, type and work that the USAA employees do, out of All the things to deny contractors, why healthy eating? Contractors health is just as important as employees."
bad,USAA seems great at first but it really is just a glorified call-center. You are just a number. If you don't have military experience don't count on moving up fast.
bad,Would work there again in a different department. The company has organizational issues that need addressing however the coworkers are awesome and made lifelong friends.
bad,"If you go into customer service, be aware you are NOT just doing customer service. You will be REQUIRED to SELL a certain number of products or you will get written up! Not a dime in commission either! All that money to fill the exec’s pockets! Management tries to make it seem like you are doing it to “help the members,” but the real reason is just to get more accounts and money in the books for the company. Some representatives opened accounts without members knowing in order to pad their numbers. Higher numbers means more likely to get promoted, but doing it deceptively ...but USAA doesn’t care about the employees who are doing what is RIGHT! Those employees get stuck in a dead end job because their sales numbers aren’t high enough. I didn’t get hired for a SALES job...I don’t get paid for a sales job, but I’m required to sell. "
bad,"High stressed, not very good management . Company doesnt care about its employees. Hardest part , was dealing with no break/leniency. CO workers were cool, as well as some costumers."
bad,"The most horrible place i have ever worked for, I have never seen nor witnessed such dumbness and stupid people in my whole life such as USAA employees."
bad,"It is a very competitive environment."
bad,"Not enough training, low wage, constantly changing the protocol, without educating employees, constant evaluations and unrealistic expectations, with no additional training or incentive. I would recommend you think long and hard about working for this company. If I had to do it over again, I would work the few weeks of training they provide, get paid and in the process look for another job. They do not prepare you properly for surprise visits from the corporate office, they are not honest about what you will face and the lack of help you will receive once on the phone. It is a poorly structured system with a less than ideal compensation for the work that is expected."
bad,Due to the large scale of people that are at USAA on a daily basis and how well thought out it was put together in terms of making sure everyone had a great experience while there was awesome
bad,USAA Federal Savings bank is an insurance company that does not know how to do business as a mortgage company.  The workplace culture is a sweatshop.  USAA does not care about their employees.
bad,"young kids looking for a quick buck, when the company doesn't pay you what your worth or by policy suppose to. you are a minion doing a mindless repetitive task, that a automate machine can do. the training as 3 weeks, however you only do 4 days worth of work and watch movies or play on your cell phone rest of the time."
bad,"They were in no way a good employer, they had absolutely no sense of human decency and they treated all of their employees like garbage."
bad,I will never reffer anyone to them because they don 't have good pople skills  and they try to talk to talk to u any kind of way
bad,The company has lost the ability to retain experienced employees as managers are only looking out for themselves. Don't apply as the job just wont pay off.
bad,"USAA is a good place to start out to get good experience, not a great place to stay long term. Be prepare to suffer migraines, and many other illnesses."
bad,"This company is unorganized. I worked here for about 6 months and left because they changed the pay scale, when hired my hourly pay went from 9.00 hourly to .23 per phone call."
bad,"If you want to be a part of a culture that bows down to the alter of the almighty military b/s and kool aid serving corporate culture then this is the place for you.  You will be treated like less than a human being and more like a robot.  But, before I go on and on about how terrible this job is, let me give you some tips for those that are still there because they will get immediate help from this.  As you know, calls are coming through relentlessly and you are required to meet unrealistic goals on every call.  Try this for some relief.  On the days that are somewhat slower, like some Saturdays ect. balance switching your open time with AUX 3. you'll find that if you balance it properly. you will go hrs without taking a single call from the abrasive membership.  For example, I can stay open for about 1 min then switch to AUX 3 for 15 secs and then open again for 1-2 mins without taking a single phone call from the braindamage that feels entitlement ect...I'm not gonna get into it as much as I want to. just try it and feel some relief. I just really want to help those stuck with those obese or lazy managers in Colorado Springs. more tips to come :)"
bad,USAA is not a good place to work. Hostile work environment. Avoid this place!!!
bad,"Advice to contract (temporary underwriters): STAY AWAY !! If you think Wells Fargo, Chase & Bank of America was bad, this place tops the cake."
bad,Poor work environment.  Disorganized and chaotic management.  Unpleasant cubicles.  Cheap equipment. Only take this job if you have zero previous work experience or are desperate for a paycheck. Leave as soon as you get a better opportunity!
bad,"It’s call center work but the schedules are very regimented and you only get a 35 min lunch. "
bad,"We were perpetually understaffed which caused major frustrations for both adjusters and members who are filing claims. We would have 30+ minute hold times and members would complain that their adjusters were not calling them back. We were reprimanded if we advised the members the truth that we were busy and unable to make our outbound calls to assist the members who'd suffered losses. Adjusters were just as frustrated as the members because we wanted to be able to reach out to them and resolve their claims but were told and even threatened not to make any outbound calls when there were calls in queue."
bad,This company doesn’t practice what it preaches. In addition it is not about us active duty or veterans. Very selfish a cut throat organization. Personally I would advise most to not work at this company.
bad,Would recommend steering clear of this sinking ship. They are selling off investments and likely to follow with other parts of the business. Terrible communication and change management. Ridicule and belittle employees who ask any questions. Very difficult atmosphere for someone without military mentality.
bad,"Leaders with exceptional skills, don’t go to work here! Turnover rates for new Managers from external sources is 75%. High resistance to change and ideas."
bad,If I could give you a say a less than 1 * I would this company is mediocre to the last degree and they team up with other call centers that don't give a care.
bad,"Back to back calls. Easily get overwhelmed. Impossible goals to reach. Not great at work/life balance. Management is mostly tenured (from the 80s) males who love to express their power over others. Constantly moving to different locations and new managers due to space until you're fired. They offer great benefits which is needed because you will get physically sick from all their misleading emails and impossible goals as well as the endless stress. The most enjoyable part is when they give you lots of free stuff during appreciation week which is just before their annual gallup survey so they can maintain their ""best place to work"" awards."
bad,"Front line phone employees are coached every week and it is used against you when they done with you. Feedback is never anonymous and promotions are given to friends, not on merit. This place wants robots and is a boiler room environment. Go work anywhere else but here."
bad,"Contractors are treated like the red-headed step child at USAA. There is no appreciation, no benefits, and no respect. We are expected to do what the full time employees do not want to do and then have to correct their work. "
bad,"I've worked at several call centers. USAA has the absolute worst call center environment."
bad,"Do you like to work nonstop?"
bad,"What the fark is all I gotta say. Overtime expected / foisted upon.. one gigantic room with 400 computers and random idiots walking around you *all the time* blathering about their pokemon games and sucking their pacifiers... manager started staring into space mumbling ""policy policy policy"" when they misuderstood something about the computer"
bad,"This company likes to tout the core belief that they are honest and transparent. The reality is the upper management knows nothing about the complete lack of training, the inconsistencies in management knowledge from no experience in property to vast experience but absolutely no power to make decisions. Mid management has no idea how to manage personnel, and this combined with lack of coaching and the clique mentality, the employees that work there are held there by lack of choice of other careers. System issues with customers are blamed on adjusters and customers are not treated equally based on the policy they hold but in a preferential manner based on the amount of business and income they generate."
bad,"What I was offered in my interview and my actual salary were 2 different things, when bringing this up they simply said it was not in the budget. The work load was always to much they always seem to never have enough people on the phones. Managers were all rude and condescending, this is especially worse as they have been off of the phones for so long they are of no help to you. you are going to work over 40 hours a week but will more then likely not get any extra pay for it and if you do its half of your supposed hourly rate is. Managment also likes to take back your approved time off last minute and basically tell you ""come in or get fired"". I have never been at a position that treats their employees this inapropeitly."
bad,"Call Center environment."
bad,"Relocated from out of town to work for USAA. Bad decision!"
bad,"I worked as a claims adjuster in the Chesapeake, VA office."
bad,"I am a disabled war veteran, and I worked for Usaa for over 12 years."
bad,"Bad Leadership, treated like a second class citizen.  Poor technology!!   No direction, training, feedback, no appreciation for hard work.  Clicks, bad environment."
bad,"Completed over 7 years with excellent member satisfaction in mortgage division, was told 70 other people want your job by Executive Manager so if unhappy, to leave. Company is not open to suggestions to improve software and employee experience. High pressure with unrealistic workloads. Management is nearly all men and they openly discriminate, disparage and keep women from top leadership positions."
bad,Do not work under a 3rd party contracting company.  They look down upon contractors and you are out as the fall 'guy' when anything goes wrong or missing.  Terrible environment to work in and very rude management; not willing to hear out anyone other than their permanent employees.
bad,"Little advancement unless you have been there for a long time   Benefits are good but pay is low compared to industry standards management  is entitled, leadership has changed over 3 times in 6 years.   No true stability  in day to day functions or workload balance."
bad,"Don’t decide work here ... this company is about to experience SEVERE growing pains because they wasted money promoting incompetent, tenured, personnel into positions that they were never qualified to do.  This segment of people have SEVERELY mismanaged the business; anyone who is competent coming in will have to carry their weight in addition to doing their role.  They have over-hired, and are begun to cull ranks."
bad,When I was initially hired by this company I was extremely excited. However now approaching my 5 year anniversary I have never been so stressed or felt so micromanaged with any other company I've ever worked for USAA a is just like any other big business who is all about sales but don't get caught saying SALES... ICE OUTGROWN THIS ENVIRONMENT VLEARLY....leave it for the newbies who dont know any better
bad,"they only care about their name as a company. after all of the training they put you into, as soon as you land onto the floor you're in the woods. you're lucky if you actually have a great team with a manager who understands (which seems that is too hard to ask for). it seems that they don't trust their employees words or their integrity. clients come before employees. their backdoor policy is just another grounds to ""let you go"" but still they like to quote that they are all about their employees. sucks when you actually enjoy the job, but the management and their lack of trust verses what the clients says really says a lot about their culture. total lack of integrity. it has taken me months to get over the denial, and depression i have encountered in this unfair job punishment."
bad,"You can’t hire 60% contractors mostly from India and maintain an American culture.to many contractors. To many people from other countries dilute the American pride and military values the company was founded on.  "
bad,"There is a severe lack of communication between management and their team.  You will advance quickly depending on how well you network or how well your ""brand"" is there.  Advancement is not based on hard work, because of this, there are many unqualified people in positions they should have never been considered for."
bad,Manager's are horrific. The motto is to offer solutions that the member needs. Well if you don't see a product the member needs then your a horrible employee because you did SELL unnecessary products. You practically train yourself from the start then get in trouble when you ask questions once your on the floor.  Save yourself!!!
bad,Would not recommend employment at USAA.  Micromanagement at it's best.  Management changed procedures on a weekly basis.  Favoritism throughout departments.  Inequity in assigments
bad,Was laid off without notice or fair compensation after being laid off broken promises poor communication and work ethics no room for growth or advancement in this company
bad,underpaid and over worked... since I got to the company more and more work has been heaped upon the adjusters and no extra pay has been provided. They aren't concerned about ones work life balance nor if people choose leave.
bad,"After working at USAA for a couple years I left, while they try to make everything seem peachy, it is all smoke in mirrors. They only care about selling, they call it ""Sharing"". Phone calls are back to back and you get in trouble if you take yourself out of the queue for 5 seconds. The benefits are decent but they keep getting worse."
bad,Numbers numbers numbers is all usaa cares about! They set unrealistic expectations that no one will ever exceed.  They do not know what it means to serve and they do not care of military or military spouses all they care about is meeting numbers at the end of each day.
bad,"the bathrooms are very clean, a lot of meeting happen at least three times a week. the the health benefits are not great at all but the cost is low. you get 5 hours of PTO for every 40 hours you work"
bad,it was ok. i learned lots of things and met interesting people that i am still friends with til this day.  they have helped me build a great relationship with co workers.
bad,"Not Open for Discussion at this time. Under discussion with USAA Management."
bad,Horrible management with a  toxic environment. Poor benefits with no concern with employees wellbeing or health. Overpriced food with shoddy break room.
bad,"I was not happy with the culture at USAA, they promise a lot but do not follow through. Management was little help and never around when you needed them."
bad,"I accepted a position with USAA for a mortgage processor and after being offered the position, my recruiter was fired, mind you no one thought it was a good idea to tell me this and a day before my start date is when I received the new hire information. I go through the new hire orientation and everything seemed great. The main building is a beautiful facility, and the other divisions of USAA seem to really have it together with the exception of the Mortgage division. After weeks of training (not on anything you really need to help you when you get on the floor) The trainer takes you to the ""top secret"" facility which is nothing compared to the main building, they put the red headed stepchildren there, the place is dirty and its just a dark warehouse with several cubicles and not enough parking and dumps you there and leaves and she never contacts you ever again, even to say hi, its a mess! You get to the floor, everyone is going crazy with the amount of work they have, they have more mortgage loans they can handle and 75% of them have to be closed in 30 days or less and the managers are so overwhelmed that no one really has time to really sit with you and assist you with questions. I was so disappointed as the job was painted in a very different light and the mortgage division seems like it will implode one day!"
bad,"They are really good at branding themselves and making it sound like an opportunity, but their actions rarely match up with their words and you find that it is all just kool-aid, spin, manipulative game playing, and meaningless. You really can't trust your leadership or know what they really think and what they are saying and doing behind your back. Despite what the words on their wall say and what they are always preaching, Loyalty, Honesty, and Integrity are not valued, at least not when it is time for them to do those things. Look no further than the premise of this business. It's pretty ludicrous. It was started because military officers couldn't get auto insurance. Now, everyone will give the military insurance (and every other financial service) at just as competitive rates and services, if not more so more often than not. Yet they still act like it is some kind of privilege or special thing to be a member of USAA when, objectively, it just isn't. At the end of the day, your loyalty and military service with USAA get you nothing, absolutely nothing you can't get at any other corporation. They will work you into the ground and then will kick you to the curb like a piece of trash when you can't meet their constantly changing, unreasonable standards and expectations, or if they just don't like you come up with some pretext to spin it and justify it. Sooner or later, it will happen to you, just like it did to 80% of the new hire classes (2) I was a part of, and eventually to me as well."
bad,Great place for members. Not so great a place for employees. The company seems less focused on developing their current staff. They treat employees very unfairly and as a number. They show very little concern. You are a replaceable number and nothing more to them.
bad,I was not happy at USAA. They do not follow industry standards and have difficulty applying the mission to what they do. No one stays in a position long enough to become good at it.
bad,"USAA Real Estate Department is non-compliant, unethical and managers do what they want. They are supported by their leaders and allowed to lie about employees. Leaders made it known that due to the companies inability to meet their financial goals, that they needed to find a way to let employees go. So they do!! They let people go with no cause and then lie about the reasons to make it seem justified. Began with USAA when it used to be ethical, have integrity and when it was guided by morals. Now profits are all that matter. Not people! It's so sad to see how the company has changed.. for the worse!"
bad,"If you are looking for a job and have no other options I am sure this review will not sway your decision to go to this company. If you are an adjuster already working at an insurance company then please read on. The grass is not greener at USAA. You are not a real claim adjuster just basically a phone operator. There is no time to properly investigate and process your claims. If you take yourself out of available mode to investigate you will get a million messages to get out and to take the calls in queue. You are taught that the member is always right so if the member fights hard enough they will get whatever they want even if they are truly at fault for an accident. This place is run like the military, no one ever smiles or has fun it is seriously the bleakest place I have ever been in my entire life. I would get sick to my stomach having to go there every day. If you have a job adjusting and are just looking for change look elsewhere you will be very disappointed. The pay is way less then you will get elsewhere and you will do 10 times the work."
bad,I don't recommended working for Usaa unless you're ready to be really stressed out all the time.  The pay and benefits are good but management sucks and so do the schedules.
bad,"they do not take care of their employees, blaming them even if the manager has told them to do something, it always comes back to being the employee's fault. Document everything because they will come after you!!! Very poor management; assistance is not there if you have problems processing your work."
bad,They were not equipped to handle toe volume of loans they were receiving and had processors basically getting the brunt of all the customer issues that should have been vetted at application.
bad,Very stressful and you are made to believe you are stupid and cannot make decisions on your own. I would not recommend this company. I became suicidal while working there.
bad,First there is a high turnover rate in the customer service sales. The calls are horrible and the billing is horrible. Billing department does not take calls from members and your job is going to be taking angry calls about billing. So billing is going to be your main job. The training  was terrible and managers don't really care about the employees. The response is call the helpline. The calls are constant and don't get a second between calls. If you like constant calls and angry members this is the job for you. I don't recommend it.
bad,"Don't drink the Kool Aid. I bought into what this company claimed to be, only to find that it was misrepresented in every way, shape, and form. "
bad,"Unfavorable work conditions. Unrealistic job expectations. Extreme workloads, extreme stress; Many workers are out on FMLA and disability for extended periods of time due the anxiety that the job expectations bring. In most cases these people return to work heavily medicated, with altered personalities, in their last ditch attempts to handle the stress their jobs bring them. You will discover favoritism/nepotism. There is a lack of job security and in some departments constant threats of outsourcing. If you work there you are either well-taken care of (favoritism/nepotism) or you are just a number, expendable to the corporate giant and they will willingly sever ties with you at a moment's notice after you've contributed years of loyal service."
bad,"I loved my job, every day I came in with the best attitude because I loved what I did. Until our lead council and CEO sold the investment company. Employee moral was down; yet my area was not impacted and severely needed help. So those employees who weren’t offered positions with Victory Capital/Charles Schwab were coming to help my team. With verbal or written insubordination and being a top performer in training and customers care I was terminated."
bad,"Too much drama. Rude customers back to back and managers never wanted to take escalations. They would become very upset at you for having an escalation. Systems sucked. Billing sucked. Too many states with different rules, hard to find answers. You will lose your mind. Management picked on favoritism"
bad,"The benefits are great, 8%  401k match and days off. They do bring food often. That being said, what is sold to you over the phone, is not what a day in the life of USAA is. It's truly hard to get in but once you are, you wished you knew more.  Get ready for a typical call center environment, where it's never ending calls, management is constantly raising your goals and metrics and you're truly seen as nothing more than a phone answerer, the front line is extremely tough and the stress level is very high. The hours are long and the work is hard, because the training although 3 months are given, never is enough and what you are trained on, isn't truly what you do on a daily basis."
bad,"As a developer, i received a 9 inch screen laptop to code. Then asked if there was anything I needed to make my job easier. Easy enough to answer: two monitors, a mouse and a keyboard just like everyone else on the team. To which management said they couldn't do that and then they re-asked the same question. Its a circular question, if you can't help either don't ask or tell me what kind of things you can do."
bad,"Company is very focused on providing Veterans with excellent customer service and acknowledgement in all phases of service including mortgage, life insurance, auto insurance and focused on providing their employees with great benefits on all of these programs."
bad,"It's funny how USAA claims that they are not based on metrics when that's all they care about. What is the point of working in customer service to service policies, but at the same time have to sell, sell, sell? It's either one or the other. It's not fair to push both on a customer service rep. With so many new managers that came into play back in April/May, a lot of them weren't even ready for the position, are almost never available, are too busy when present or simply don't know more than the rest of the reps on the team. My manager was so quick to jump to conclusions, always assumed one as an employee was lying and was very shady. Some managers don't deserve the position and power while others who do go each day unrecognized. If you try to go above and beyond for the members, it's likely your manager can feel threatened and eventually want to get rid of you. I thought doing right by the members is what this company wanted, but apparently not. It seems as if those who are ignoring to do their job are the ones who last there. If you try to advance into a specialist, you're held to the same high standards as someone who's previously been there for 2+ years Doesn't matter if you come with enough experience and p&c licensed, they overlook that when it comes to promoting you to the next position."
bad,I have to be honest. I have been with the company for many years and I am extremely unhappy. The chance for advancement is good for the newer employee but tenured employees struggle to gain promotions or job changes. The culture is extremely competitive. I have to say that their customers are extremely unhappy as well. Especially the customers who have been there for 40-50 years. This company was started by military officers who could not get automobile insurance companies to insure them because they moved around to much. So they formed their own insurance company. It was such a basic need that has evolved to this giant corporation that only cares about growing their membership.
bad,This company retailated against me .The  manger called my friend names in the workplace.This company and the mangers suck..I will not refer anyone there.All the good management  they have fired
bad,"High stress, Low pay, managers do not support. I think USAA as a company is great. However, the mortgage department isn't. Work you like crazy and performance evals are not fair. Have to be part of the good ol boy club to get getter raises and promotions. I have proof."
bad,"One of the worst decisions I made in my life was to accept a full time position with this company (Property Insurance I.T department)."
bad,The new CEO only cares about profit and has lost sight of the emloyee/member well-being. Every call is dictated by referrals to departments that clients do not need and reps get reprimanded if we do not have enough transfers to investments. The job has lost all joy and I am actively seeking other employment.
bad,USAA is one of the most micro-managed companies I have ever worked for. The work enviorment is toxic and the work-life balance is awful.
bad,"USAA's mission to serve its members is the most noble, most genuine of any company I have known. The USAA employees will go to the end of the earth for the members.  USAA employees live the brand because they have a clear sense of purpose."
bad,"I relocated to take the job with USAA. I thought this place was the best place to work for before I soon realized they don't care about their employees. It's a call center environment, you're chained to your desk, you're forced to do mediocre work because there's not enough time to handle claims correctly. Basically, if you want to be a glorified secretary and you can transfer calls to sign people up for more products they don't need you'll do great here. You don't have to know a darn thing about insurance or adjusting a claim. The only training they give you is online modules during licensing. They farm all the jobs normal adjusters would do out to other companies. Enterprise rent a car manages your rental extensions and they aren't even licensed adjusters. Anytime a member disputes an adjusters liability decision and/or wants to escalate an issue, management will look at how long they've been a member and how many products they have in order to decide the outcome. Non-injury saves the company money so the injury adjusters can give it out like candy because half of them have no idea what they are doing but get promoted if they can get referrals. USAA completely let me down. I expected this company to be so much more. My manager was horrible the only reason why she was a manager was because she had worked at the company so long. Half the time she'd give my coworkers the wrong information on actions to take to settle a claim. Anyways, if you just need a job and don't care what it is then go work there."
bad,I'm not sure about anything else but if you decide to work in the call center for USAA regardless of department be prepared to be treated like dirt regardless of work ethic or knowledge. Working with this company was more degrading than any other job ive worked.
bad,"While USAA tries to look out for their employees, they know it's beneficial as the job entails 10 grueling hours of work on the phone with it's memebers, assisting with adjustments to their polices.  All the while their upper management is listening in on EVERY phone call you make and then one is expected to make a referral or sales pitch on every single phone call. Ridiculous!"
bad,"Pros – They pay decent because your stress level at this company will elevate drastically. If you are good at managing stress, then the pay and bene's are great."
bad,Depends on your manager!! If you work from home and move try to see if there is anyway around giving your direct manager your address. Even though it's against company policy she googled my home. If they notice your doing just as good as them or better you could be subject to Targeting.
bad,Be advised: nothing will make sense upon commencement of your new position. The building has 75 foot internal atria which are unavoidable. Hope you like heights and don't suffer from vertigo.
bad,"Not the company it use to be. Hard to advance, and have sold all their investment company leaving many with no choice but to go with the buying company which does not have the benefits that USAA provided."
bad,"Just a glorified call center where they have to pump you with little stupid perks to help you get through your boring, robotic, back to back call day. Constantly having to worry about if management is listening in on your calls for ""coaching"". I personally feel that i have 3 bosses. Ultra conservative company who don't really care about employees but more so for you to slave and tell members what they want to hear. They also have a Executive Resolutions Team, who are trained to handle escalation calls, but then before transferring to them, you have to try and deescalate them yourself?, adding to the stress and not getting paid for it. I am very regretful in taking this job and wish i hadn't. My anxiety and stress got so bad i had multiple panic attacks in office, and am still affected by this."
bad,"Worked here over 2.5 years.  Very nice, newly renovated campus.  Benefits are stellar, culture is decent (there is a group for EVERYTHING as they are trying to get onto Diversity and Inclusion radar).  Loved my coworkers, love USAA as a company and I'll be keeping my products, but would NOT recommend working in the claims department to my worst enemy.  Everything is very disorganized.  Before I left, people started to figure out that the new hires (with 0 experience) were making more than current, tenured employees.  After everyone became outraged, management came out and said everyone's pay is getting reviewed and has been for a while (they decided to start with the new people AND not tell anyone this was happening) and that this happens at every single company, we are lucky they are telling us; oh by the way, please don't jump ship.  This is a common theme, there were huge issues with IT.  After decisions were made, employees would find out later (already outraged with all of the issues) with no communication.  Otherwise the job and expectations of you are inconsistent.  It is an inbound call center.  You are expected to maintain 70% adherence by taking non stop inbound calls (you are the ""catch all"" so there are lots of transfers you take and make), complete THOROUGH investigations of claims (the fun part, really), make outbound calls on your new claims and pending list, and manage your desktop/diary.  In other words, you're doing two jobs at once (inbound customer service representative and Auto Adjuster).  It was more a glorified operator role than anything, which is such"
bad,This company is good for Full time Employers. They get good benefits for FTE. This company is not suitable for Contractors. They executes many new policies everytime that impacts only the contractors.
bad,"This organization has a great mission, however the implementation is terrible. Management consists of sheeple that in turn promote sheeple. Independent thought is frown upon, this a single dimensional role, no room for growth, ability to contribute from previous work or academic experience. Financial advice is mediocre at best, most advisers have no prior experience and simply regurgitate what they are told."
bad,"Trainers are wonderful. Then you go onto the floor and have a temp manager that's supposed to support and help you until you go to a permanent manager but she is horrible. If you, God for bid, need help and attempt to ask her she will literally roll her eyes at you and say ""What"" after she huffs and puffs like a 5 year old. I'm very disappointed a company like USAA would allow someone like this to be assigned to helping new employees. She is the worst manager I have ever had to deal with. I would never recommend working at USAA based on such a horrible experience with her."
bad,"I thought USAA was awesome when I started 6 years ago. I made the mistake of going over to claims. They have the most unrealistic requirements. You are expected to take calls all day and somehow work your rising diary, call back all of the members whose calls your missed while you were taking care of everyone else’s members, plus we have to answer any of the messages the members send through their portal within 4 hours. They want you to find some way to place blame on both parties which takes time to investigate,  time that we don’t have. The calls are back to back and we have to stay on the phone so the only way to truly do all of your work is to work overtime. There are so many more things I could mention but i don’t want to write a novel. I literally had a mental breakdown because of USAA. A full on mental breakdown, with psychiatric reviews, medication, and short term disability. "
bad,"While I fully support the goals and mission of USAA to service those who have served and their families it is hard to stay at a company where day in day out the executive leadership continues to prove how dishonest and fully lacking ethics. The company leaders preach ""being a Compliant Company"" except when it comes to making their performance to suffer. Then when they get caught they look for the front line manager and blame them for putting the company and its' members at risk."
bad,"Hard to believe so much continues to be done manually.  Legacy leaders (20+ years) continue to be resistant to change.  While they have hired good external leaders, the legacy leadership outranks them, and driving any significant improvement in systems, tools, technology or other forward looking business practices will take years or a decade. "
bad,"I was told not to speak to anyone. People were allowed to openly have bible study during work hours, but if you asked why consideration wasn't given to others you would be sent to HR and informed it wasn't a good job fit."
bad,"Lack of training material, un reasonable work production expected "
bad,"USAA preaches a lot about the member's experience but when it comes right down to it, at least regarding conventional mortgages, the members are not getting very good service."
bad,"When I first started working there they promised so much, and as the time progressed the were not living up to their expectations. complete false advertising. The supervisors are rude and not really there to help it seems. They often go smoke their ciggs rather than help their team.  and lets not talk about the people who work there! Oh god, its ridiculous. I've gotten bullied and pushed around by not only the employees but the manager staff as well. I had a woman tell me she was going to kill me the next time she saw me, I took it to HR and they did nothing about it. Not even fire the girl, a warning nothing. So needless to say this place has no structure . I do not recommend anyone working here unless its temporary"
bad,"Amazing company... Hate the phones "
bad,"This is a company that preaches loyalty but seems to have none. Unless you get on the good side of management, you will have no opportunity for growth or advancement."
bad,I thought that being a call center representative for USAA would have been less calls from angry members. Most of my calls were trying to comfort angry members about their bills.
bad,"Typical day at work consists of taking inbound calls for in your department. It is almost always back to back for the full shift which can be very draining. Additionally, expect to be working with systems that are constantly crashing or having errors. You will be frequently opening up a IT ticket for troubleshooting. It can be a very frustrating environment to work in. Sales and referral goals are very aggressive and you are expected to try and sell additional products to every caller, even the ones who called into the wrong department or who were mis-transferred. Promotions are structured  around sales are referral metrics while member surveys and satisfaction are not part of the metrics."
bad,"The Usability group at USAA is populated (mostly) with ex marketing people who've taken some 'courses' in usability and who think they 'know' how to 'do' usability. That in it self should be a dead give away, but on top of that is the snotty attitude that gets thrown your way if you are a contractor or a newby coming in for an interview. I do NOT do well with pretentious people and even less well with uneducated people who climb a corporation's internal ladder based of their 'suck up' factor."
bad,USAA is growing too fast and not staffing enough people. USAA is the worst company I have ever worked for. its constant bak to back alls all day that you answer on other peoples claims and not your own claims. You will still manage over 100 claims at any given time. Customers are never happy and your day is just endless phone calls of upset customers because you don't have time to handle your own claims.
bad,Training is a complete joke. It's self taught yet the online training programs only work part of the time. Your supposed to watch online training videos and they don't even work. Then you get on the phones and have no idea what your doing. Worst call center ever. Managers are a joke. You start training and hear how great and helpful managers are and then once you meet them it's totally the opposite.
bad,I feel like USAA was a great place to work as a contractor but it had some ups and severe downs like any other workplace except I had some first time shocks that I've never experienced anywhere else. There are tons and tons and tons of negatives I could go on about but I think my positive experiences outweigh all. I think the management side varies depending where you work within the company so I can't really say anything about that. The hardest part about the job is dealing with leadership that refuses to understand your role but demands something out of scope. I would say the most enjoyable part about USAA is the work environment
bad,"Poor management, difficult callers, and stressful work doesnt make the bonus and pay worth it in my mind. "
bad,USAA is a great place to work depending on who your manager is.  The benefits are very nice and the salaries are generous.  Be careful who you become friends with because you CANNOT TRUST ANYONE.  USAA does not support veteran employees as you might assume.
bad,I was so sad and loving all at the same  time . I would work there again if management changed . The callers was always nice well you hand some that werent but you could count them on one hand
bad,"This has to be the worst place I have EVER worked at. I am former military, and am a stickler for organization and the mortgage department is sooo unorganized. The managers have absolutely no idea how to help you, instead they grab a senior to do their dirty work because they don't know how to do it. All they are there to do is make sure your PTO can be approved and send emails...my five year old can do that. The workload is thrown at you and there is absolutely no regard for the members. Unfortunately, everything that goes wrong with a file is always the processors fault, even though the underwriter is keeping the file from being approved. At the last minute, a day before closing, you get the file back from the underwriter, asking for more stuff....and guess what, the processor has to take the heat and deliver this news to the member. Work is not balanced between processors, closers, and underwriters, of course the processor has a huge chunk of the load. RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN. DO NOT TAKE A JOB AS A MORTGAGE PROCESSOR!!!"
bad,"after a few weeks told I was doing a good job, doing extra. Next week I was told I was condescending and today was my last day. Do not joke with or at anyone.  Given no chance to talk to anyone."
bad,"working at USAA not the best place like most people think is "
bad,Depending on the department you work for determines your success. A great deal of prejudices and nepotism within the company. Really doesn’t follow the company’s mission. It’s really sad and disarming because the majority of their customers (military)are our men and women that serve our country no matter what race or gender.
bad,I have been with the company 3 yrs. Management is always chaging. They play favorites and don't consider you and will deduct ur pto if 3 min late from break just lots of different issues. Do not recommend this place!
bad,"The benefits with USAA are great.  However, working in the member contact area is very degrading.  The work load keeps growing but the pay remains the same.  Have become stressed out and depressed from working here and now have to see a counselor, which USAA pays for.  Definitely not for everyone."
bad,"USAA is all about the customer, which made it a very customer focused job, and regardless of product, same standards applied. However, because of this, conversations with customers were recorded, and management critiqued these conversations on a weekly basis."
bad,"I wont never want to work for that BANK, they treat employees like slaves they count how many minutes you spent in the bathroom and your supervisor write you up for that, You are not able to use the restroom in peace, Nightmare place to work, when I was there I felt humiliated and discriminated too."
bad,"Very stressful, unrealistic goals. Added stress by very completive environment for promotions.  ........................................................"
bad,Great company but the management team makes the job difficult to deal with...If you enjoy being micro-managed this would be an ideal job for you!
bad,"Great benefits, great place to learn transferable skills, great bonus opportunities"
bad,"USAA is only great for our customer service skills- as far as the processes go we are so inefficient and redundant as a company. We offer awful rates, there's so much micro-management it makes me sick, nothing is ever good enough for anyone, and everyone is fake."
bad,"Usaa is an amazing company with all of the benefits they offer but this simply couldn’t make up for the stressful call center environment. You are highly monitored, advancements are very competitive because everyone in the call center is trying to get out. The training environment does not prepare you for being out on the floor. I have never been so unhappy at a job. Again, amazing company that gives a lot of benefits, but you may have to sacrifice your sanity in the call center."
bad,"I loved working at USAA and the people I worked with including management were fantastic.  However, 4 years I tried moving to a different position and was not able to due to not having a degree."
bad,"The company is very mediocre to work for, very unrealistic goals along with a hostile workplace. "
bad,"is to much micromanagement "
bad,"Nothing to say..It wasn't what I thought it would be. The vibe and feel of the whole place wasn't what you'd expect really, Plus the fact the training took forever - was the part that sort of irrelevant."
bad,"When I was hired, over a decade ago, USAA was a great place to work.  The company went through a great phase of focusing on improving the employee experience and we lived the mission.  Today, USAA had strayed far from where they were.  The culture has descended into one with overworked, overstressed, underpaid employees struggling to keep up with their workloads, while executive leadership only focuses on profits."
bad,"Pros: can work remotely"
bad,You will not advance no matter your degree(s) or designation(s). This is a call center for HS graduates only. Go where you are valued. They value military tenure over education and professional experience.
bad,Typical work day speaking with multiple people and completing files. The best thing about working here is to help the members get into their home.
bad,Joined with much optimism about my future with company. They told me that I was being converted from Contract to FTE after a month or so. Then after 3 months it was a maybe. Then at 5 I was told I would need to relocate to another State in order to keep my job.
bad,I was discriminated against from day one with my flirt manager I would never refer anyone to this job. My immediate manager was the worst person I had ever met worst manager ever and I will never forget how horrible I was treated
bad,The direction the mortgage department is going is a sad realization I've slowly had to accept. It feels like we are so behind in the times with no positive outlook. Time to go.
bad,Do you want to be told you’ll be in one role then surprised on your first day by a new one? Do you want to have managers that blatantly lie? Do you want to be guilted into doing work that’s way above your pay grade? Are you a woman who wants to experience misogyny?
bad,"Managers were awful, communication was a joke and the volume of calls taken was too overwhelming compared to the low pay. They preach culture but it’s just a buzzword they say as their actions don’t reflect the values they preach"
bad,USAA hires managers with no experience in mortgages and therefore unable to mentor their teams for advancement.  Managers are rarely at their desks and unable to assist their teams with day to day questions or situations.
bad,I feel that anyone who works there long enough becomes jaded. Worked there for close to 8 years and was promoted once-half the time I worked there they had a hiring/promotion freeze.
bad,Operation manger and team mangers pure gossip from alb call center site. Also whenever Higher up management from San Antonio would come into town all that they allowed the employees to do must stop until they went back to San Antonio! Poorly ran!
bad,"I'm in the Chesapeake VA office.  There are no daycare options in a reasonable distance.  Work from home positions are only given to the most popular.  Your manager will only determine if our go anywhere or even stay with the company.  The big wigs show up and it's all smiles because the intimidation and mean girl high school mentality is heavy.  Good luck if you have small children and a single parent because if you need to handle home, you not have a job for long. The pay is decent but not meant for an actual single parent without help to survive off of.  That's just my opinion but try it and see 😊"
bad,"I was lied to by Kforce about the requirements to get hired on as a permanent employee.  The communication is poor. Kforce uses too many third parties to manage its HR, payroll, etc. They are all smiles to your face until you get a call at home at 8pm telling you not to return to the job site. Then they give you false reasons and try to force you into continued servitude to avoid paying unemployment."
bad,"Management team left a lot to be desired. The constant feeling was that management did not care about their employees. There were always constant battles regarding correct payment, rules and regulations and scheduling."
bad,"Demonstrated high performance standards, including attention to deadlines and quality work."
bad,"ok place to work, been there 10 yrs, no room for advancement. Can be stressful at times; however the bonuses can make it worth while"
bad,"Financial Advisor my left foot. You will sell Life Insurance and Annuities. And if you don't, you'll be written up."
bad,"USAA prefers to hire externally. Once you are in a position you tend to get pigeon holed. Don’t take a position here just to get your foot in the door, you will regret it. Executive management is out of touch and is destroying the company culture. They are hiring there friends from other banks destroying USAA and what it once stood for."
bad,"I was an AIII with USAA for four years and yesterday was my last day with the company.  Basically the job entails you staying ""open"" and taking random status calls on other employees claims for 70% of the day leaving you 30% to work your own claims.  The calls are back to back and never slowed down over the time I was employed.  USAA then made the decision to merge the total loss department with non-injury, with no pay increase and minimal training, which is why I left.  We already did not have enough time to do our jobs as it was and then they dumped a whole other department on us.  The pay is not competitive but I will say the benefits are not bad.  It's a shame as USAA does hire a lot of good employees but there is such a disconnect between upper level management and front facing member service representatives.  I was not even given the courtesy of an exit interview after 4 years of service.  This speaks volumes from management as they do not want to hear what we have to say which is why so many employees are leaving.  My advice to anyone considering USAA is to put in your two years to get the 401K match and then leave as upper level management has created a toxic environment and minimal to no room for advancement."
bad,"I recommend reading the reviews here with a few things in mind:"
bad,"Micromanaged with stressful days. Pay is good but if you have a bad manager, your life will be miserable. Some managers are so strict you are unable to go to the restroom if it is not your assigned break time or even take a 1 minute breather from the phones since it is constantly back to back calls. You quickly know who the favorites are by the ones who are constantly excused from taking calls by having them decorate the cubicles. If you are the favorite, they will be able to give you a manager job without having the required Bachelors degree. Many employees are on FMLA for stress and anxiety. They promote for employees to go back to school and many get their masters degree but realize the call center world is a dead end job. I knew many people who had been waiting 10+ years for a shot at something better within the company and some that ended up literally retiring off the phones. You quickly feel unappreciated and once you have your master's degree, you are automatically underpaid as the bottom level employee that answers customer service calls."
bad,Very political. All about making money and customer service has gone out the door. You can never do right and they will always find something you did wrong.
bad,Management not very friendly when you seek to move up because they have there friends in mind they want to put in those positions. USAA management is not friendly to people outside their network.
bad,"In order to keep a position in the Addison office you will have to pass the FINRA Series 7 in 60 days. Fast paced self taught studying environment. Stressful. A lot of hours reading and studying at home and the entire 8 hours during your training period. You will be required to take tests DAILY to ensure you are on the right path to passing the 6 hour exam. If you do not pass the exam and you have not been granted a chance to retake it, they will let you go when you get your test results. If you do pass, they will require you to take the Series 66 immediately after with 2 weeks of study time. You are judged heavily by your peers by your test scores and how many exams you've passed."
bad,"No basic amenities in the office, only 1 exit which poses a fire hazard, faulty systems, old and broken furniture and equipment; employees are treated like prisoners"
bad,They will pretend that the job is not about sales but it is all about sales. The only way to advance is to brown nose to everyone and pretend this is the best job in the world. Everyone smiles and pretends to be happy but whispers that they will be quitting soon because of stress. Extreme micro management and managers constantly coaching you with negativity. High turnover. Everyone is quitting this company so don't drink the koolaide. You will be miserable soon enough. Run before you end up on anxiety medications with this company. The stress levels are like nothing I've ever seen.
bad,"I did not like working here.  The management  lacked organization, follow through and respect.  I thought that I would like working there but in the end was miserable."
bad,Most of the full time employees don't work and all outsourced contract workers are held back by the business interests of vendors who exploit the situation to their maximum advantage.
bad,"The job was mostly time out for fun and too much customer friendly to the members rather than knowing your actual job. The environment is based on who you know and how you are related to move to the next level of your career. "
bad,"Unless you want to be stressed out and on anxiety medication, don't even bother. A call center is a call center is a call center. Period. And no matter what they say, everything is a sales position."
bad,"would not work there again.  they will steal your soul. first couple of years are ok.  will make you feel guilty if you don't make sales quota by telling you you are letting our military down... if military knew how they treated employees, would not by from them..."
bad,"It is difficult to see a work culture until you step into the actual culture. "
bad,"To be fair, when I first came to the company it was just beginning in the Richmond area and I did not expect everything to be working on full cylinders. They're a contracted Customer Service company and this contract was for USAA Bank in their insurance department. I come from an insurance background and have much knowledge on the subject and I expected others like me to be put in the higher positions of the company. However, those they chose to become management, supervisors and trainers were very lacking in their knowledge or did not come from an insurance background at all. Many times people--including management--would come to me to know how to proceed with certain aspects of a call. There should never be a time where a supervisor goes to a subordinate for direction on how to do their job. "
bad,"Many directors and managers protect their jobs by getting rid of promising employees. So many people get let go, it's dog eat dog to try and survive. Negative politics and back-stabbing are commonplace. Reorganizations happen all the time, for no apparent reason. I had fourteen managers less than 10 years. Chaotic changes happen on a regular basis. Beware positive reviews, the company makes management staff go online and write false reviews in an attempt to keep a positive image. Odds are, you will regret working here at some point."
bad,"I loved being a USAA member so much that I thought that working for them would be amazing! Unfortunately, they do not care about their employees as much, Nights weekends holidays... and for less than the average rate. Sorry USAA this is one area that you DO NOT EXCEL!"
bad,"The management only cares about how much money they can make. They used to believe in the three legged stool where you take care of all parts, the stool is sound. Now, they don't care about two of the legs on that stool. I've seen so many great people leave the company. Time to weed out the civilian management in favor of those who truly know what it means to serve."
bad,Typical day started about 7 AM. Came into work and review what had to be done. Learned nothing other than people were not friendly. Spent about 70% of my time going to and from meetings. Little time doing programing. Management was really bad here as he was never around. Co-workers were ok some of the time but most only cared about themselves. The hardest part of the job was getting any programing done. There was not anything enjoyable about the job.
bad,USAA used to be an excellent place to work and then it took a turn for the worst. Employees were no longer valued but more looked at as a dollar sign. Upper management makes the worst impulsive decisions ever.
bad,The company USAA is a good company. However the call center the has the contract with USAA needs alot of improvement. Such as correcting times for employees pay check is always a big issue
bad,Excited when I first started working here but soon became stressed with all they pile on you and how low they make you feel if you are not “PERFECT” right out of training.  Made decent friendships.  Had a few great role models in the SR and RS areas.  Had a couple Awesome Managers throughout my time there and then some real sticklers who didn’t care or had you thinking they did until it was too late.  (Watch Out for Those!!!).  Had Really Good Benefits but Not Worth the Horrible Stress and Disrespectful Upper Management.  Just watch out for the Backstabbers and Smilers hiding sharp teeth!!
bad,"USAA is notorious for eliminating a large number of employees who are there over 10 years.  They do whatever they can to cut costs, and older employees with families cost them more money."
bad,"Desired culture is not carried down from upper management to the front lines due to middle managers.  Too much constant sales pushing to customers. Only matters if you gave a degree, will not get promoted without it"
bad,Unless u are a suck up you won’t go anywhere. There is no open door policy. If you challenge or go over your managers head your out. Can’t talk to anyone because if you do you will be gone. Don’t trust anyone. Everyone is out for themselves and will stab you in the back to get ahead
bad,"Manage daily activities for a team of 8+ dealing with the analysis and corrective actions for all enterprise process/IT controls to ensure they adhere to laws/regs for a large banking/insurance entity."
bad,"Management at USAA need lessons in leadership."
bad,"USAA in general seems to be a good place to work but the department I was working at had some very odd members.  USAA protects the military employees and if you are not one of them, they won't take your suggestions.  They have something called their ""Culture"" where the new employee is supposed to adapt to the arrogance and ignorance to some of their members."
bad,Not enough work.  They treat contractors like red-headed step children.  Not a lot of communication with the Managers.  And the Managers are not really there consistently.
bad,"USAA preaches get your foot in the door, and get promoted to the position you want.  However, once you are on the phone the path off is almost impossible as you now have a customer service title on your resume they will keep you client facing.  Some people I work with have been on the phone for 20+ years and one had applied every year to different roles."
bad,"You can bring revenue to the company, but it's not appreciated.  Your hard work is not rewarded.  I've seen others slave away with silly games in order to get promoted, but those who suck up will find plenty of opportunities."
bad,"too political to work there, you only advanced if you were liked and had a political pull and you receive threatening email if your job performance was not what the manager expected eventhough the manager did not perform as he or she should  case load of work with unrealistic expectations"
bad,"terrible management and awful experience working there. the benefits are excellent but you are treated horribly as a manager- no matter what an employee says, you are wrong and will be treated like a criminal"
bad,"USAA will promote you,  provided you agree with everything management says, even if it is wrong.  The pay is below average.  The work environment is Negative, no career advancement, the managers are not great leaders and the work life balance is a joke. Stressful work environment with an abundance of negative energy.  Find a different employer to work for.  USAA does not care for the members nor the employees."
bad,"The company speaks about culture at every turn, and the company as a whole has a really good, nurturing culture. IT, however, lags the rest of the company. Whereas in other parts of the company, those who do good work and achieve meaningful results are seen as successful, within IT, those who are seen as successful are given opportunities to to good work, and their achievements are appreciated and rewarded. Those employees who are not already seen as winners are not rewarded for their achievements, and these achievements are often overshadowed by management criticism about vague, hard to fix things. ""You don't mesh with the team culture"" or ""you are seen by other managers as having an image problem"" are not helpful, and demonstrate that the IT organization does not live up to the culture and ethical goals of the company as a whole."
bad,Company comes first although the management declares a commitment to balance and family. Dependence on key individuals is not acceptable but necessary due to decisions by management for infrastructure. Profuse number of meetings for positions which are not customer service based occur. If assigned to a special project expectations require total commitment and long hours.
bad,"Disorganized & Poor/Incompetent Leadership, low pay, behind in technology and product/service offerings, culture in some areas of the company is very toxic. It's a culture of ""yes men"" and you'll need to be part of the good ole' boy network to succeed."
bad,not the same co. it used to be. new ceo is all about numbers not the members any longer. benefits are not as good. the pay is too low. they count on a yearly bnus that is not guaranteed and also changes every year.
bad,"USAA has great benefits but there is no freedom. Two 10-minute breaks and lunch is 30 minutes.  The rest of the time you are at your desk doing the same mundane thing day after day. If you're not on the phone after 3 minutes, you get told quickly. Everything is watched and listened to and, of course, it's on a matrix system for sales."
bad,"Great as far as pay and benefits were concerned.  However, very unrealistic expectations from leadership caused for a very stressful work environment.  This led to a culture of cheating and lying amongst employees  in order to meet expectations or be considered for promotions.  Very unhealthy work environment"
bad,"They are a great Property and Casualty Insurance Company.  The Financial Planning and Advice, including Wealth Management is rampant with nepotism and down right bad managers."
bad,"good culture, poor management, employees are not trained properly, there is a significant gap between employees and their supervisors. Not a great enviro at all."
bad,"As a Veterans spouse, I was disappointed in the treatment as a USAA employee between contractors and full time employees. I experienced inequality within the workplace."
bad,Great benefits but work life balance is off. Many times on the phone way past your end of day making it difficult to plan or make appointments for personal situations.
bad,benefits are good and great facility. They push lots of hard work but no time for life. Marriage of military and corporate.
bad,"It is extremely hard to advance within the company. They constantly hired people from outside the company rather than internally. It was a call center environment. It wasn't too bad, but I really wanted to advance my career and after some time with my previous experience, it was like knocking at a dead end. Also, there are unrealistic job expectations, extreme workloads and extreme stress. Many workers are out on FMLA and disability for extended periods of time due the anxiety that the job expectations bring. Lastly, women are always promoted over men in all departments."
bad,This company has never paid unemployment benefits and has never lost a case. (packages are given only when offices are closed)
bad,Provided outstanding customer service to all members. They have goals you have to reach every day for each claim file.
bad,"I would not recommend to anyone unless they have a insider that can get them in and be able to push out tenure"
bad,"Listen, if you are interested in auto claims RUN AND RUN FAST . Auto adjusters 3 have SO much work it ridiculous. You literally have to work OT to do your OWN claims . On your shift you’re doing EVERYONE else work but yours! No file ownership but yet we get assigned to claims. Members are upset because we never answer but USAA somehow thinks this works by making adjusters play a call center work. Claims cannot be worked accurately with your manger sending an i.m wondering what your doing ?? WELL I’M TRYING TO ADJUST CLAIMS !!! In reality your a call center rep taking verbal abuse from people even when you’re attempting to help . I am job hunting like crazy trying to leave this company!"
bad,Pays under market. Everyone I worked with had 2nd jobs. Would advise to look for other employment. Management was terrible and more likely to promote kiss ups than anyone else.
bad,"USAA is the perfect place to work if you don't intend to have a purpose in life. If you dont follow the script and agree with the feedback your managers give you, you will be considered ""un-coachable."" "
bad,"Look for a company that is operating with updated systems, processes and technology; where people are competent and leaders are accountable for results over politics."
bad,"Due to prior legal issues, USAA made sure that all contractors were treated differently than FTE. Could not participate in Thanksgiving lunches, birthday cake for employees celebration. They operate at the Tampa Location on the: Good Ole Boy"" system and they have an extremely unprofessional management team. One manager, in particular, would lose his cool on the floor. Their motto is Hils: Honesty, Integrity, Loyalty and Service, this was exhibited to the customers but not to contract employees."
bad,Meetings about meetings to plan the next meeting.  Very silo'd and managers do not want to take any responsibility for anything.  Measure everything and make sure you have someone to blame at all times
bad,"The company is a good one with great employees.  The company, during training, stresses taking care of the member and creating conditions for employees to succeed.  This is however not really the case.  The lower level management is primarily concerned with meeting adherence goals, selling other USAA products and moving on to the next claim.  No time is given to the adjuster to ensure the claim is handled satisfactorily in one call and no time is given for the adjuster to call a member or a claimant.  This results in very angry members and claimants who's claims sit, sometimes for weeks, before any action is taken on their claim.  This usually happens when the member or claimant gets tired of not hearing from USAA and calls in themselves, usually to wait on hold for extended periods of time."
bad,"USAA provides good workplace facilities and a marginal work environment. Responsibilities are narrowly defined so there is little opportunity to apply a diverse skill set. It is a great place for people who have little ambition to advance their professional knowledge or responsibilities. Internal promotions tend to align with seniority. The entire company is operated under Orwellian controls where every click on your desktop is monitored and reported to immediate management, In general, it is a highly structured, intensely monitored work environment that provides little opportunity for innovation or individual contribution."
bad,"Environment was very dramatic, other agents didn’t respect each other. Too strict. I was not happy with needed accommodations   It was very stressful and hard to get assistance from some supervisors"
bad,"USAA used to be all about the mission, but now it is just like any other company out there. USAA is now run by children. the managers pretend to care about their associates, but they are really only interested in getting to the next thing. Benefits aren't that great and pay is rapidly falling behind against other companies. Every year USAA has a survey that it is supposed to be anonymous, but it isn't the fine print says the information can be available to some people so you are obligated to answer that is all peachy. Everyone carries a knife and it is ready to put it in your back. USAA is like society only the 1% have great jobs, the rest no so much."
bad,Being a veteran I like how the company was all about the military community and their families. We insured their financial stability and assisted them through deployments and pcs moves
bad,"A typical day as an adjuster at USAA consists of logging into your computer and going ""auto in.""  As soon as you do so you will be in a call.  When that call ends you will hear a beep and you will be into the next call.  This is your day.  You'll have 35 minutes for lunch and a couple of short breaks during the day but otherwise you will be on calls.  It never, ever lets up.  "
bad,"Management was inconsistent and overboard. They micromanaged you to death; gave only negative feedback and looked for ""mistakes"" when phone calls were supposed to be randomly reviewed. Never gave positive feedback so you always thought you were doing your job wrong when in reality you were doing it right."
bad,Great place to work if you don't have any major responsibilities. The lay off rate is very high. Don't play your future with this job.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Their name begins with USA but 90% of work is done in India. Go figure that one. You think they help veterans but believe me, they over charge veterans."
bad,It was an  Audit position. We looked over reports and compared to receipts. They didn't want you to ask to questions. But I thought that is what you supposed to do .
bad,"Decent place to start off. Benefits are OK, if you're willing to stick it out for +5 years in order to be fully vested.  Cult-like conservative culture--assimilation is obligatory."
bad,"great environment . helpful people , cafeteria,  learned a lot "
bad,If your not at anytime in the military you are the black sheep of the company.  they have the best customer service of any company and the benefits are great but just never felt at home being a non veteran
bad,"High Demanding volume of work"
bad,"Its a great company to work for, but it is so micro-managed, it makes it very difficult.  You work 80 hours a week with a 40 hour a week pay scale.  As a new employee, it makes it hard to keep up with no OT, so you work on your own to make deadlines."
bad,It was an okay job. Did not like the hours due to I had a newborn at home and I was working late evening hours. The team leads were very informative.
bad,"Great benefits....  "
bad,"A typical day involves four to five scheduled appointments with service calls in between appointments and preparing for my next appointment.  Also doing data input for the development of financial plans before the day starts or after the say finishes. "
bad,#1 in customer service. Reps are really the backbone of the company.
bad,"Training is inadequate for the job required and ""trainers"" and management are clueless about what the job really involves. Many employees stay because of pay & benefits, but the stress level is very high & no one cares if a good job is done. The mission is to serve the members, but I didn't see that very often. USAA is more concerned with the bottom line, which is selling products."
bad,loved working for USAA. If you thrive in a high stress you will be at home.
bad,"I can’t stress enough how much i miss the paychecks and the yearly bonus (which is not guaranteed btw) the benefits are amazing. But this job sucks. Plain and simple. They care more about their numbers then their employees emotional or physical well being. You are forced to sit through weekly “coachings” which is just the managers time to tell you how terrible you are, even when you meet their ridiculous set goals, it’s still not good enough. It never is. I will absolutely never EVER go back."
bad,Great money Great benefits Horrible Management Lots of Favoritism and Brown Nosing Lots of Empty False Promises and an Extremely Poor Training.........
bad,"I worked at USAA for over 12 years and found myself, like many recently, without a job.  USAA has a reputation of never being laid off, which we have all seen in the news is not true.  I was in a leadership role and was always a top performer always meeting my metrics and always had high member satisfaction scores (my team reflected these scores).  When the decision was made it was about a popularity contest.  It's the ""good ole boy team"" and will always be, 100% sure of that.  I'm not bitter, I'm thankful for USAA making this decision for me or I would never have moved on.  It took me over 6 months to get over the stress I was under and cannot drive by USAA campus without feeling the anxiety all over again.  "
bad,"those who work keep having worked piled on top of them without reward while others who barely show up are not punished.  favoritism rules management, people who have more experience are often passed over for promotions while extra curricular buddies are given opportunites"
bad,"90% of USAA is call center work. The pay and benefits are good but working in a call center is the 7th level of Dante's Inferno.You won't escape the call center. The foot in the door motto is propaganda."
bad,"Their slogan is to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do......when it benefits USAA.  Customer Service is very stressful due to the micro managing, sales, sales, and more sales and some managers only caring about their own goals. The good managers get no recognition because they are doing the right thing and not kissing up to upper management. You get promoted because of your sales metrics or your a ""chosen one"" of upper management vs your knowledge of the job. I use to be very proud to work for USAA but there has been a change in recent years where I have lost respect .  I no longer suggest  to anyone to work there. Their benefits are wonderful but at the cost of being overly stressed and a very political atmosphere atleast in the Tampa office. In my opinion the company does not have the integrity it use to have and I feel their code of honesty, loyalty, service, and integrity has been lost to Corporate America values."
bad,"My first encounter with USAA was a marketing director who went into zombie state when I presented the data she desired, and then a business case which answered her issue and provided recommendations to remedy the issue. She was unable to accept the latter as she had no authority to move insightful recommendations forward."
bad,We were a third party contractor to USAA. 
bad,"Micromanaging is everywhere. In order to advance off the phones, you must kiss butt or know someone. Culture has changed. All about making money rather than caring for membership. Even membership complains about the change in culture."
bad,"Offers great amenities, benefits including 401k with 8%match, and beautiful campus. I recommend not going into mortgage department as it is high stress with lower pay- other departments seem less stressed"
bad,"Basically everyone stabs their coworkers in the back to advance their careers. There are thousands of VPs at this company and they're all looking to step over each other to get into the executive circle. I lived the Office Space nightmare of having 8 bosses hassling me when I made a mistake. Things may have changed in 10 years, but when I was there, it was impossible to know who or what to follow because every manager told you something different."
bad,"Would not kiss up to management . "
bad,"When originally hired, I was advised that my position was all about service and was not a sales position.  Once on the floor, emphasis switched to cross-selling products and solutions outside of my department.  You have to bid for your schedule, and the likelihood of getting the schedule you want, is based on your performance."
bad,This company is listed as the top employers to work for yet has a high turn over rate.  It is not what they say it is .  They do have good benefits. You only get the top benefits if you were in the military if you were not everyone else gets different benefits.  They only promote who they want even if you are the top performer with an education.  They lie to get what they want and only are willing to work with certain disabilities.  The job they say is to protect the members financially situation and all you do is sales. Not a job I would recommend for a career to anyone.
bad,"Feedback is requested from lower management and employees AFTER decisions have been made.  Very poor company culture for people who are driven and want to move up.  Preference is given to mediocrity, no employees with ideas or vision."
bad,Rewarding experience with this company. Managers very excited about career role. Making it easier to climb the corporate ladder.
bad,"Years ago USAA was the company to be insured with and to work for. The truth of the matter is when they opened membership up they didn't anticipate growth on this level. It has ultimately destroyed their standard and quality of service. Basically just a call center where you are chained to your phone, you can expect to receive non-stop inbound calls all day and no opportunity to ever work your own files unless you work overtime. Biggest member complaint ""I can never reach my adjuster."" "
bad,"As a MRSII management tells us to hold conversation with the members and find a need, but what they truly want is a robot who simply sells more and more USAA services even when the member can't afford or use the service."
bad,"The company is changing. It is not the company it was 10 years ago, much less 20 years ago. "
bad,The company could be good. My location on the other hand was full of drama and the manager was the cause of most of the office issues.
bad,The position is almost exclusively a life insurance sales position.  I was told to sell fixed-rate annuities yielding one percent to military members in their early twenties.
bad,Enjoyed working there the first four years I was there. Then I started to see that the leadership was not engaged with the workforce. No expectations were set and positions would be removed to create beginning salary positions in other departments.
bad,"I studied this company for my Senior Seminar in Management.  Looked great on paper but when I started working for USAA it was nothing like the company I read about.  The one thing that is true is the compensation is good but it is also good at other insurance companies.  There is a strong culture of competition instead of collaboration. This leads to lack of team work and back stabbing.  There are  EEO investigations open one that I am personally familiar with and it is not mine.  I got a bronze eagle award which took 40 hours of my off time to earn.  When I was let go for not selling enough extra products to people were trying to file a claim my manager took my eagle off my desk and said it was property of USAA.  I found out later they do this all the time and recycle the awards.  How cheap is that?  I did like most of the people I worked with but there is a very high turn over rate.  I have been in the Air Force for 24 years and USAA is nothing like working in the military.  We have integrity,trust and loyalty.  You can't fake that even though they try."
bad,"The phone adherence makes the job more stressful. The technology is outdated, adn it is very diffiuly to move up within the company. A plus is that we can dress casual"
bad,"Job consist of over micro management, no trust from upper management, and no work life balance. The organization, well ther is no organization and there is always a scramble with upper management to try and find organization however there is no talk to those who are on the actual floor to ask how to fix this."
bad,Great place to work if you can make it to upper management. Largely a call center environment. Corporate culture focused on emotional intelligence.
bad,Focus is on business as with most corporations.  USAA is loosing it's small bank feel and going more towards large corporation requirements.  Available mortgage products are few and they need a Texas Cash Out product.
bad,Stressful job.   Management wasn't the best.   Little opportunity to move up and they would not allow you to move departments due to hone they managed the mortgage division. Very high turnover
bad,"The company itself isnt bad.  The benefits package is good as well at the 401K match.  However, shecdueling time off can be difficult, many people have managers who are not helpful, and at the end of the day its an insurance call center job.  Calls are back to back, non stop all day, every day.  Starting out requires you to work on saturdays and you will have split days off.  Not having two days off together gets really old and tiring really quickly.  If you can handle the calls and dealing with people that are upset with their insurance for reasons beyond your controll it can be a good job, many people have been there for decades, otherwise its probably best to look somewhere else first."
bad,USAA grew far too fast without building a proper infrastructure. It’s almost impossible to do your job properly because you are too busy answering calls from departments and regions you don’t even handle.
bad,"The compensation package is great but the pressure is crazy.  If you like having your job as your entire life this is the place to be.  However you want some work-life balance, this is not a place where that is easily achievable.  We were always asked to work overtime, but having time to handle your own responsibilities took a backseat as the department took back to back inbound calls.  Manipulating the phone system to make the outbound calls that you need to do results in termination.  I understand that incoming calls need to be handled however a system where people work their own workload first would be more efficient instead of trying to handle your workload while taking back to back calls."
bad,"If you want to work somewhere, that you are not  allowed to have anything on floor, plus you have to have special cups on the floor. no purse, no phone, no activities. so even in between calls nothing to do. when you need help, you cant find anyone."
bad,Inbound 60 to 100 calls a day; no time for friendships on the job as always on phone calls; extreme expectations on going above on every call; micro-managed; no concern for health as sitting in a chair for 10 hours a day with only (2) breaks and 35 minute lunch contributes to many health issues; the only enjoyable part of the job was the first few weeks when we were in New Employee Training.
bad,I had to move so couldn’t work for them very long but it was very stressful. I would not work for them again. Great pay but very rude people. Great benefits.
bad,"I have no interest in reviewing this company, The leadership does what it wants and I dont think I am in a position to question them. USAA is a good company that has its own issues"
bad,"Not recommended for experienced, self-starters kind of people. Company is still trying to figure out how to scale design, lots of conflicting perspectives but not a clear vision that permeates throughout all the different teams."
bad,Eyes were constantly watching you at USAA. It was a snitch culture and everybody was doing whatever they could to gain favor with managers (even if it leads to hurting another employee)
bad,"USAA holds itself as having a great standard of honesty and care about their members. However, that does not carry over to its employees in the call canter. Employees are bullied and held to unreasonable standards of performance. No matter how hard you work, you are blind sided with criticism of your numbers which you may not have even known were an issue. They would rather diminish peoples talents and have them leave the company under less than friendly circumstances. I don't understand why big companies don't want to utilize the skilled employees they already have. Why is it better to work people until they are burnt out and then kick them out? It's sad. It used to be a place where I felt valued. Not so anymore."
bad,"The company (USAA) I started with is not the the same company now. We had a change of CEO's the new one use to be the CFO (Chief Financial Officer) so although we are very member focused on the outside on the inside it's all about numbers and building relationships to get those numbers. When I first started we built rapport because it's the right thing to do not as a part of the sale process. I've had 7 managers in my first year, I've had good managers and bad. I've been threatened with my job, I've been told I'm a poor performing employee when all the evidence shows that I'm actually exceeding expectations. I feel I've been discriminated against during my time here. Good company I'll continue to do business with but as an employee experience I personally could never recommend this employer to someone else from my point of view. I know others that love their job and plan on being with USAA as long as possible. I don't care for the call center environment, I like receiving recognition, the ability to be promoted and good pay which I'm not getting from USAA and don't see the light at the end of the tunnel."
bad,USAA is a very micromanaged culture.  Not a lot of room for advancement.  Very poor salary standard but they try to compensate with benefits which are okay.
bad,"Typical work day was unpredictable due to you never knew what to expect from production floor. "
bad,They have a handful of great managers and they are very into training their associates to ensure contact with their members go very smoothly and efficiently.
bad,"You are on the phones for eight hours a day. It is a call center job. If you get off the pones to go to the rest room, you get in trouble for not being on the phones. They tell you at the beginning that ""its all about the members, its not about the numbers."" That is a lie. They make you try to sell products to members even when it is not an appropriate time to do so. If your numbers fall below a certain guideline, you get in trouble. Since it is a call center, the job has a very high turnover rate."
bad,"Insurance is really sales driven, not member oriented like you are told. co workers are awesome. Lots of high demand stress job"
bad,"If you are a retired military person, then this is the place for you. If you are not (I am not), then you are left behind. In the last 10 years, USAA has gone to being on the top of the list of employers in the country to the run of the mill companies, the national rankings I'm sure will reflect this in the next 3 years when the shine has rubbed off. They have cut back on compensations, benefits, and promoting from within, the amount of 3rd party workers they employ are as much as the regular employees (that a secret). They have now unofficially started a forced retirement plan for those employees that are at or near retirement. So, millennials if you are looking for a career be sure to do your homework and don’t put your faith in a single stream of income from a job like USAA."
bad,"Be prepared for change. Everyone says its a great place to work. That would have been the case maybe 5 years ago, but be prepared to stay in your cubicle regularly."
bad,"Good compensation and bonuses."
bad,"The company USAA itself is great.  The Financial Advisor/Wealth Advisor role is just a glorified customer service role.  During recruiting you will be told that you will be speaking with people with significant assets to invest but in reality you  will be talking to people who are trying to build their credit, declined for a recent loan, or someone who wants to pay their credit card bill or P&C bill and dont really want to speak with you.  Majority of your day will be spent basically as a switch board operator but will have sales goals to reach pertaining to investments, life insurance and annuities.  Business model needs to be revamped where the financial advisor/ wealth advisor can really get to do financial planning and have those type of conversations instead of dealing with items that don't relate to the actual role."
bad,"Assisted members with insurance needs"
bad,This is a great company but they need to work on their manager hiring and training.
bad,-took incoming calls all day without the necessary time to get back end work completed due to adherence policies
bad,"Once you have become a manager you are set.  You are longer taking phone call after phone call.  You can sit back and relax.  No matter what the phone calls are you are made to ""open it up"" even if it has nothing to do with being a Financial Advisor.  You are judged on completely irrelevant goals such as: how many times you use a particular financial planning tool and number of products sold not based on profitability.  For example, I can sell 10 different annuities at 5k each which counts for 10 products or I can sell 1 annuity at 500k which only counts for 1 product.  Seems like they have their priorities backwards. Getting time off when you need is almost impossible unless you have been there for years."
bad,"Little job security, restrictive workplace culture. Management was uniformed and unhelpful"
bad,"Horrible management and very few advancement opportunities unless you are a suck up. Not worth the hassle or your sanity. You are always tied to a phone, micromanaged by people less experienced or educated as you are."
bad,Never met my manager the entire time while working at USAA. Was fired after single infraction which was not stated as offence in company handbook. Was called at home to be told I was being let go.
bad,"5 + meeting per day were too many to actually get assigned work done with team.  Every time a new upper level executive was hired they wanted to implement their own new ideas, which ended up with a lot of executives coming up with a lot of new ideas and all wanted to have meetings about them and implement immediately before having their own senior level discussions first.  Way too many competing priorities and lack of good, common sense mortgage knowledge and one direction."
bad,USAA is one company that has least quality and very messy environment to work. Lot of discrimination with Full time and contractors . Many FT folks sit as a retirement company not doing work or working hard unlike few other contractors who dumped with works. No equal work distribution and very mess infrastructure and Environment. Company is very bias with Full time employees only and don't treat contractors good although contractors work hard than FT's.
bad,"Work life balance is not happening.  Stretched to thin.  Burn out is quick. Pay and benefits are good, if you can survive the never ending drama.  Call center mentality, more of a sales job then a career.  It’s about selling more and more products then helping the members"
bad,"Fast pace, great customers. Micromanagement with some managers. Great training great benefits. Benefits alone is worth some of the stress. Great people to work with"
bad,The work is not very enjoyable but people stay for the decent pay and great benefits.  It is a call center without the opportunity to ever get off the phones.  Do not work here unless you are ready to spend the rest of your working days on the phone with very little chance of advancement.
bad,If you are an enlisted military veteran then you may want to look elsewhere for a company to work for.  They cater to the military but only former officers can start out at a junior level employee.  If you are a former enlisted veteran with 4 master degrees you will still have to start at entry level. Then they promote education but do not advance careers based on that education or job skills. It is not what you know but who you know.  Its all about branding at USAA.  Basically you have to constantly kiss up to the higher managers to be seen and then only the cheerleaders get advancement.  It is frustrating.  You are way underpaid and the benefits are average.  I have done employee benefits for over 20 years and can tell you the benefits are average at best.  The 401k is the best part of USAA as they do match up to 8%.  That is better than most companies but the health and dental benefits are less than what I have had at other companies.
bad,"USAA talks a good game about the culture they want. Member service is what is always preached. To that end, front line employees are expected to take back to back calls and not work their diaries. Time is continually taken away for working claims for the sake of meeting phone answering metrics because the front line employees are seriously understaffed and undertrained. This is contrary to customer service as it takes members calling in to get an adjuster the time they need to work claims, while on the phone, as phone adherence is a big push. USAA's metrics measuring adjuster success are opposite each other, and you cannot be successful at all. If you happen to be excelling over others, you get to have more work piled on you to make up for others failings.  Any time taken off the phone to work your files will have managers and directors sending messages and emails demanding you get back on the phone. The call for customer service only extends to those who you are on the phone with. Career advancement is near impossible as the only way to move up, is to MOVE..... to San Antonio, TX."
bad,"At first was great, then the workload became unmanageable and management seemed to exist just to make excuses. ""it will get better"" Lots of people on stress leave, fmla leave. bonuses are great, health insurance is not that great. lots of time off, but you will need it because you are worked to death. Incoming call center enviroment, where you are told that you have been away from your desk for too long, and questioned constantly about your breaks. (even if you just needed a cup of coffee because someone just cursed you out on the phone).  I was an exceeds employee who left."
bad,"USAA was, initially, a very employee oriented company.  "
bad,"Great benefits but low pay for the industry.  The mission to the members is positive but the treatment of the employees is not. Favoritism drives the promotion process and way too much emphasis placed on military service as opposed to actual, proven performance in the corporate setting.  External candidates are given higher priority for promotional positions and the internal opportunities are limited to the ""chosen"" few as mentioned above. The work load is double than what an adjuster in the industry has to deal with because the job entails being in an inbound queue for the entire shift while still trying to manage claims.  The perception given to the members is that they have a dedicated adjuster for their claim is a lie and it is nearly impossible to get in touch with an assigned adjuster because the focus is on the inbound call queue.  Metrics are measured by call center standards and not claim adjuster standards.  There is also an emphasis to get ""referrals"", meaning referring members for other products on every call. This ""selling"" is actually held in higher regard than the job the adjuster actually does on the claim file.Poor leadership for the most part as the management is not in touch with what the job entails.  They are just robots carrying out the ""mission"" set forth by upper management who has no clue on how the USAA name is being tarnished by poor claims handling."
bad,"The company is really true to its mission and continuously sets out to do the right thing for their customers, however, USAA is not set up for a conducive product development environment. "
bad,"I was pushed to resign by constant micromanagement and changing expectations. Very frustrating. I hope they get back on track, or someone that can lead takes over. Vastly different experience with member contact roles to non-member contact. Non-member contact is treated much better."
bad,Working in the Member Debt Solutions Department for USAA was one of the worst jobs I've had. I really expected so much more from this company. Sucked!
bad,"It's a job. If you have a choice, I wouldn't pick this one. Metrics mean more than members. The happy employees are not on the phone... keep that in mind."
bad,"Comp is adequate, although other companies with same positions tend to pay slightly better.  Competent leaders are few and far between. Promotion and salary increases are only seen in certain job positions.  USAA hires externally often instead of looking to develop talent within, hence good talent and leaders tend to go elsewhere for compensation and promotion opportunities."
bad,"The work life accommodations were not the best. Pay was great, advancements are given as a popularity contest. The only thing that kept me there was the pay . My partner has worked there five years as well and between our 9 years there we were only able to have our schedule changed once. Doesn't work well if you have dependents and special needs dependents."
bad,"Okay company to work for, but unfortunate that their only intent is to upsell during customer service calls for business retention. You would keep your clients by making insurance/products that people want. If you have to upsell your own brand that you are extremely confident in, then there's something wrong there."
bad,Manager threatened me daily with losing job.  Putting down employees in front of whole team. Treats contractors horribly.  No work life balance. Always worried about losing job.
bad,Not a bad place to work but no job growth opportunity. The real estate lending department is way behind other lenders. Systems constantly break and understaffed.
bad,Stressful work environment. Management works to stay off of bad reports so they will not be degraded in huddles and meetings by directors. This does not promote a good workplace culture.
bad,"Worst management I have ever experienced next to being in the military."
bad,"They have good benefits, the compensation is pretty good. The work life balance is good..  If you complain about discrimination or harassment you will be fired."
bad,The training is extensive but much needed. learned the ends and outs of the business and moved up to a specialist within one year but after that it became almost impossible to climb the corporate ladder.
bad,"USAA is an awesome organization.  The culture is insurmountable.  If you are technically sound in your discipline you will find it tough to work at USAA.  It's a company rooted in 93 years of military tradition altered for corporate america.  The money is fantastic. The people you work with will be fantastic.  You will undoubtedly work for a leader who should not be leading.  It will drive you nuts and you will think you are on an island alone if you are rationale, and have solid business acumen."
bad,"Anyone that works for usaa knows what this is... Don't do it...Don't drink the KOOL AID false hope and dreams. You will hear of a the people that have worked for this company for 20,30, 40 years but after how much stress at what cost is what they should tell you! Yes the benefits and other things they offer are wonderful, but like anything to good it comes with an alternative motives and you should wonder as to why? I was told in NEO (New Employee Orientation) that we were nothing more than Walmart greeters in the position my class was hired for. In order to move up they only promote not based off experience but based off what degree you earn while working with them. Hence why the people they have training and working there 20 + years have no real management experience because they have only worked most of the time primarily at USAA."
bad,"If I worked here much longer, I think I would have aged 15 years, started to hate life and go through a mid-life crisis all before age 24. "
bad,A typical day at work consisted of using critical thinking and multi tasking.  I learned a great deal on how to be in a corporate setting and what you will need to know in order to move ahead.  The hardest part of the job was striving for perfection.  The most enjoyable part was all of the wonderful co-workers.
bad,"great benifits, cafe and gym on site. relax and engerize zones to use on break or lunch. be ready to take alot of calls and drink the kool-aid. not much uppermovement for the pay and not willing to cross train."
bad,"Pros: Pay is decent. They help you to get all of your insurance licenses, and they pay for them. "
bad,"Staff level jobs- Disguised in great benefits and membrr-centric culture is a culture of leadership that will throw their employees under the bus. You say the wrong word once, it’s held against for you for your entire tenure at the company. You slowly become used to the pressure and stress, and when you quit you have PTSD and realize what was happening."
bad,"As a contractor, it sucks. You are a second class citizen. Also, ensure that if you are in a contract to hire role, that there is no hiring freeze in your department. They won't tell you there unless you actively look into it."
bad,"This career set me up for advancement and career development but I was working in mortgage, which is a failing department within USAA. Unfortunately, I was laid off. I was laid off due to being the newest in my advanced grade upon a promotion received. I achieved many great milestones working there but the achievements set me up for failure, as I was blindsided with an unexpected lay off after giving so much of myself to a company that only saw me as a number and never considered what it took for me to advance when they needed to lay off people. It was devastating."
bad,"The company benefits are great, the managers are decent, but the actual job is TERRIBLE! You are timed when you go to the bathroom, timed when you cough, timed when you sneeze, timed timed timed. They really just need to hire robots. You have so many things you aren't allowed to say and SO many things you HAVE to say on each call that it makes you feel like you are walking on land mines. Every call is recorded and you are coached, and it feels as if you can never really do enough or get a perfect call because of all the requirements for each call. I worked here for almost five years and I could not stand the job!"
bad,There’s no work life balance because most of the days are already taken by other adjusters. If you need a day off it will be unplanned pto. It’s back to back calls all day. The members harass you with multiple phone calls if you can’t get to them within 30 mins because your workload is heavy on a daily basis. The pay is great but it’s a highly stressful job.
bad,"Overall it's a good company to work for when you compare it with other companies.  That being said, even though when I started there they didn't consider themselves a call center, that is what they are. They used to pay better and have a lower attrition rate compared to similar companies and took pride in that, but that is not the case anymore. The focus shifted from quality customer service and quality work to being more focused on numbers, how many calls you took, schedule adherence, sales numbers, etc. If you like call centers and want to work in that type of environment, I would recommend it, but if that's not the type of job you want, stay away."
bad,"USAA has great perks as far as its Retirement match and yearly pay raise as well as the annual bonus. However, with that said, I would not personally recommend working there under it’s current leadership. I worked in claims, and though you work the role of a claims Adjuster, the pay can be as poor as having a 10k difference with other companies (a fact they try to keep hush hush on the floor). Workload is too high, you handle all regions (i.e compliance), resources to “help” are ineffective, and of course- the pay is an issue. I would recommend looking to establish competitors"
bad,"Lots of excitement about the company and the benefits, but no drive to deliver software quickly or efficiently. 20% bonus at end of year whether you were a top performer or bottom dweller...so most people were bottom dwellers. Unimpressed."
bad,"Very competitive, overworked and not worth your time."
bad,"Great pay and benefits. Put your head down and do the work as asked and middle management will recognize you. Innovation is encouraged (if you have time) but without the tools that are industry standard. I innovate on my own time with my own money and I hope to influence leadership to add it to the toolkit for Data & Analytics. Unless your executive leadership knows what success in the space looks like, high performing individuals will be frustrated--this is the most difficult part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is pay, benefits, and teammates."
bad,"Its a great place to work if you are lucky enough to get a manager that likes you."
bad,My manager was great. Upper management was the inconsistent ones. They'd say they'd want us to focus on one thing then once we began doing so they'd change it and act as if they had never told us to focus on the thing they previously asked.
bad,Good payrates; should be more employee satisfaction driven; stop requesting information that customer has already provided
bad,working as a contractor  at USA is tough.your not treated well and the company doesn't really care since you are only a contractor.
bad,San Antonio was to far from Memphis so I had to move to a new city Dallas. But oval I enjoyed working there.
bad,Great company that does great things for the military however I believe has a lot to learn about how to make employees feel appreciated. instead of feeling like you should bow down to them and be grateful that they're giving you the opportunity to work for them a little of that gratitude should go towards the employees.
bad,"The pay is excellent but the job is so stressful that most people have to go on fmla. Because of the call volume, the only way to touch your own work list is to put in overtime."
bad,"Heavy workload, turned into a customer service job. USAA has to big of a community of members and not enough employees to cover all the claims that occur. Therefor members are constantly let down and getting claims resolved in time never occurs. Constantly high call volumes, you are expected to only take incoming calls and have no time to answer your voicemail when members are calling by the dozens to ask for explanations as to why no one has contacted them."
bad,"The stability and pay is GREAT. The environment is very professional and polished. The work/life balance isn't all that great.  BACK TO BACK CALLS drains you mental energy. Servicing members isn't the main focus of this company. It is, ""how many transfers you made to generate new business."" Trust me....  Annual bonus and Christmas bonuses are wonderful. If you can tune the world out and be a licensed zombie for 8 hrs a day this is the perfect job for you. For creative minds, this job is NOT for you."
bad,"Their idea of wealth management leaves a lot to be desired. They went from real wealth management to product pushing. You may think you will be working with UHNW individuals, but you will work with anyone regardless of assets. Your incentive comp is capped, and is determined on how many products you can push versus new households and assets that you bring in. The planning software is atrocious, systems unreliable, and support negligible. Management's canned response to any question or concern is, ""It is what it is""."
bad,"call center with all the stress of a call center, the pay is only fair because of a large end of year bonus otherwise monthly pay is too low to not live just paycheck to paycheck"
bad,"Work at USAA was an unexpectedly negative experience. The sheer volume of calls was not set as an expectation, and the amount of conversation required with the customers was unachievable, especially with such a high call volume. I felt as though I was taking advantage of customers, as the ""relationship sales"" philosophy requires that you ask invasive questions only to the end of trying to pawn them off on another department to sell them something. Scheduling is set based on tenure. There is no way to take time off in the summer for any reason without reprimand, as those who have been with the company have already absorbed all of the allotted PTO from the months of May-October. There is no sick time. Expectations are unreasonable."
bad,"Call Center environment, may drive someone crazy. Outdated computer systems and technology which makes it hard for adjusters to do their jobs. However, everyone is friendly and can move up the company."
good,"The typical day at work consisted of 8 hours of data entry while making snap decisions.  While I learned a lot about 1099 regulations, I didn't learn enough to be able to perform the job requirements.  "
good,The IT Help Desk is experience but not ideal to stay. This position is a sub contracting job to a contractor hired by USAA. there is no benefits and the bonuses promised will not payout in a timely manner. The management changes schedules without warning and there is no proper training that takes place for applications.
good,"It had its ups and downs, career advancement is harder if you plan of getting off phones. Direct managers are quite great, but can be switched between team often."
good,"USAA as a whole is a great company. However the company has too much emphasis on branding yourself outside of your actual role. 401K was great, pay was average, on-site childcare was excellent. Management favored those who played the game instead of looking at actual work completed. I believe USAA cares about their employees and members, but I also believe that they are letting talent slip through their fingers. You are always ""on"". Also there is way too much emphasis on referrals. I understand USAA is always trying to grow membership and have members with additional products, but reps should not be accepted to do a referral on a call, only when the opportunity presents itself and when it's natural. Reviews are subjective and not consistent."
good,"Usaa is a horrible workplace. No space for advancement, and if verbal skits were not followed 100 percent exactly as written you were told you were doing it wrong. You were never able to connect with the customer."
good,No work/life balance. Can't advance unless you've been with company more than ten years.
good,made new friends learned more about the mortgage business.  long drive
good,"Employees are under paid and overworked, management is hit or miss. I have heard they are working on a lot to improve but still miss the mark. Also there is no diversity or inclusion in upper management , they need to increase salaries to a fair wage for the amount of work adjusters are required to do."
good,"On the path to taking its place with other larger banks.  Great culture in the majority of business units, with a lot of emphasis on the mission and its Members."
good,"USAA has grown and become a large bank. Now they are subject to federal laws & regulations. They are focused hard on becoming a compliant company. With that said, they are ""restructuring"" many things. You have to watch out and be extra careful...management is quick to hold the workers accountable and put on disciplinary action to save themselves. They boast to be ethical, however nepotism is extremely high. Hard work doesn't pay off if your up for a promotion and someone is friends with the right people. Things are going to get worse, moral is declining. Don't get me wrong, USAA is a great company....well it use to be. I don't know about now. Im just trying to keep my head afloat and a positive attitude."
good,"Company was great at first, then things started to change. Nothing is consistent. Great Overtime, can't get benefits until a year and was promised a raise that I have yet to receive"
good,"A typical work day for myself involves processing financial transactions as well as quality assurance and training.  My co workers have been great and what I learned from them and from this job is that potential does not have a limit.  The hardest part of my job is working long hours knowing that the someone with less  experience, time with the company, and education makes more than myself. The best part of my job is the flexibility to work and get the work done without needing to be in a specific time."
good,USAA is just a political place not a technical professional place
good,Work is micro managed to the seconds you use the bathroom. Management does not care about employees. They only care about hitting metrics. You will love this company if you are in any other department than claims.
good,The company isn’t what it used to be.  I was there almost 9 years  no advancement  opportunities.  And there is a lot of higher up management that has no idea who you are or even care
good,"I think if I had a different manager I would have been happy there. Mine threatened to fire me, was upset when I had to take time off  for my sick child, and even timed my bathroom break. Overall I felt bullied and like he was trying to get rid of me. I never had the opportunity to continue my training because he ""forgot"" to put me in the class then critisized me for my lack of sales and totally disregarded my NUMEROUS customer compliments. It's really disappointing because other than him I loved working for the company. I took a medical leave of absence through FMLA and was let go on leave because they said the paperwork wasn't filled out correctly."
good,Total Loss is overwhelmed with continuous claims and not enough people to work them. The management is overwhelmed as well and we are not allowed to call out and follow up on claims.
good,"There was too much favoritism. The were too strict and had too many objectives that wanted you to meet and be exact.  There was literally no room to grow with the company unless, you knew somebody with in the company to help you accelerate."
good,"A typical day at work is laid back but there is no job security things change everyday when you have new trainees coming on production floor is when mgmnt wants to enforce rules that should have been forced from day one. Meaning they will fire you for any little thing; no job security, sometimes things happen to where you have to receive a point in regards children etc Im a new mom and just returned from maternity leave with no pay; you not eligible for any benefits until a yr of employment; pay is fine could be more; the company holds the msr resonsible for dsats the customer leaves in reference to the company itself amongs numerous other things and supervisors will send you home if you receive a dsat at times and its nothing against you from the member but yet you miss hours meaning you missing money"
good,"Provide broad contract sourcing guidance, integrated solutions, and support to assigned customers. Advises on viable and efficient sourcing and procurement processes. Negotiate complex contracts and ensures optimal agreements with mitigated risk. Perform multiple team roles (team member, team co-leader) in the development and implementation of key contract initiatives."
good,"Calls are screened throughout the day. They know if you are ready to take a call or are away from your phone. Their primary focus is cross-selling, rather than helping customers. This is really the only way to get promoted."
good,"A typical day is spent taking calls with members to help with any of their financial needs. "
good,"I worked in the insurance department, maintaining policies. If it had just been that, it would have been fine, but the worst was the billing side of things as I was also responsible for taking payments over the phone and answering billing questions. Combine angry members and people monitoring your every word, and you can see why this was so stressful"
good,The company is going through a lot of changes.  The culture is not the same. The compensation is not worth the trouble. The management is hit or miss. Too much politics
good,"The training for member services representative was fantastic which helped forge comradery amongst us newbies. Unfortunately, once the training day we become cogs in a wheel with very little support or encouragement from the floor supervisors."
good,"we sold to schwab and i won't have a job in a year. the job itself is really really easy, but they don't allow you to do anything. everyone there is a contractor, which you will be, too, so they can underpay and cut on a moment's notice. you're gonna feel like a second class citizen, but at least your coworkers are cool"
good,"The job was introduced as a customer service job and it suddenly turned shortly after being hired into practically a sales job, very stressful and not to mention the workload, the call volume never stops it is back to back phone calls all day at any given time of the day at any given time of the year. NO rest. It’s too much for my health since I have mild anxiety and somewhat adhd. The benefits are ok but it doesn’t outweigh the stress."
good,"This used to be a great company to work for, then leadership changed on multi levels of the bank and mortgage. The culture started to change, they are firing LO’s and others for the most minor of infractions to save their necks and say they are being a compliment company. Basically USAA has had so many CFPB issues the little guy is taking the fall for bad leadership. Many managers and LO’s quitting to get away from the micro management"
good,"Left company unexpectedly, let go 3 days shy of yearly Bonus. Other than the under handed way I was let go. The company was good with good benefits, started to go downhill after I was assigned a new manager."
good,"Management was rude and did not take advice, even though I had several years of experience in positions above them.  When issues presented themselves, management had to go back to the drawing board and do exactly what had been advised the first time. The job paid well."
good,YFun place to work and meet new people. Great benefits. Three or four cafeterias send two or three gyms.  Yearly bonus . Paid time off And sickleave..
good,"the training was not to bad moderately fast, i was lucky and had a great trainer, when i got on the floor it was completely different, you had 2 15min and a 30 min lunch, the bathroom breaks counted ageist your normal breaks, and if you went over due to having to use the bathroom you were given a corrective, witch the handed out like candy"
good,"Basically you just go to work to do your job, make your funds, and go home. The lifestyle at my workplace is just stressful. There are numerous colleagues of mine as well as managers who are there just to pay bills. You do not get any raises and I have been there over a year. This is a paycheck to paycheck living situation and I do not even have high bills. We do more work than what we are getting paid for and the management does not care."
good,"Stressful work environment that does not accommodate or promote a work/life balance.  Management disregards employees stress levels from high volume calls.  One needs to acquire a RS position or special activities to get some time off of the phone.  USAA accommodates and bends to the will of all groups that cry or want to be Social Justice Warriors.  Saying the wrong thing will hurt someones feelings or ""Create a hostile work environment"".  Pay, Bonus and bonus's are great but sometimes it doesn't break even over the high stress."
good,"Really techy place to work and do well .The culture is good for people who are really approved of by management "
good,Certainly not a wow company. Wish they have a better system to promote talented internal employees within. Also the performance review only revolves around few factors rather than the whole 360 degree of an evaluation.
good,"Every team is different so experiences will always differ.  Managers make your work life miserable or great.  When I started my first manager was great and attempted to understand where I was coming from, my current manager is a passive aggressive liar who apparently only thinks people work when told what to do and how high.  Not a good motivator essentially.  "
good,Entire company as a whole is incredible. Mortgage Dept doe have very high turnover. The pay is mediocre but the benefits are fantastic.  Good people work at USAA but there is a lot of favoritism and not the right people in leadership positions. This is a good company to get your feet wet then venture out once you are skilled.
good,This is a good place to start your career. Management can make or break you. It is very hard to promote or move out of frontline phone positions.  The pay is not competitive
good,"Unless you are straight out of college, avoid any and all phone roles at USAA. You WILL be micromanaged to the max.  You will have to do ""voluntary overtime"" to stay afloat. They will tell you that the opportunities at this company are endless.... that's a lie.  Once you come in as Member Service Representative (phone rep) there is a slim chance you will ever come out of that role.  I have a masters degree, and a strong background in project management/business development. With that said, I have been here for 3 years. In those 3 years I have applied to over 50 project management positions within the enterprise and I have not had 1 interview.  Not one single interview.   I will be leaving soon."
good,"It truly is who you know, not what you know when it comes to being considered for promotions or advancement opportunities. You must learn how to play the game and be a yes person."
good,overall the company has the best benefits but the mortgage processor position is very high stress and demanding. The company insists on work life balance but gives you so many loans and work that its almost impossible to have work life balance.
good,"The company had great benefits and believes in what they do and serving the Armed Forces. Can not grow in the company unless the manager wants you to. There is a lot of favoritism and drama in the smaller offices. The CEO is a very kind man and wants the employees to come to him if there is any issues, but good luck with that. Management will get you out before you let the company know whats going on in the offices."
good,"Log into slow outdated computer, wait several minutes for it to be ready to use. USAA has tons of custom log on scripts and application that run automatically at startup and cannot be easily disabled. Log-in to software based phone, check email, load worklist with work item tasks. Review communications from customers through worklist items, work oldest and expire first. Color code denotes expired items that came in over night or on the weekend."
good,"It is a hard place to fit in culturally if you are not willing to take orders at face value. They are very customer focused and that was a huge attraction, yet that did not reflect in their treatment of employees."
good,I love USAA as my insurance company. But once I worked for them I felt different. People and facilities were good. Unrealistic goals for Auto Adjusters with the amount of calls you receive.
good,Management is always nervous about their position and do not care for their employees. Worst job I have ever had.
good,"Training is a nightmare.  You are nervous and excited to embark on a new career. After starting you quickly realize instead of getting settled in, you are constantly in a situation where you may lose your job. Every other day the trainer lets you know your job depends on passing whatever irrelevant test they have for the day. It is extremely stressful and if you dont get fired throughout training(we lost almost half our hiring class) you get welcomed on your new team by being micromanaged to death. Literally if u are taking too long in the bathroom, they will come look for you. Rediculous intrusive questions are required on every single call, expect no positive feedback, they manage with intimidation and by pointing out everything you do wrong not right. If u get hired start planning Vacation 2 years ahead of time, you have 15 minute scheduled time to make those decisions.  You cannot schedule vacation any other time.I. AM SERIOUS."
good,Company was good to work for many years-the treated people with respect & like family. I worked many long hours on Catastrophe duty & worked while being treated for a serious illness. When I had a problem there was no consideration given to me & my loyalty to the company and I was fired immediately.
good,"The pay (share bonus) and hours I worked were good. When I worked in accounting, that was the best time I had since I enjoy numbers and dealing with people. I got a chance to make a financial difference in peoples' lives...letting them know someone cares about the ""unexpected things life can throw your way"". When accounting moved to Arizona and I went to other lines of business, the job ceased to be as fun and as rewarding. Managers make a hugh difference in the enjoyment of your job even if you enjoy helping your customers!"
good,"We support active military, veterans and their families. We never forget that, we open most meetings with acknowledgement of that. The decisions made at an executive level are to do things quickly, rather than well thought out. For employees, some areas you are supported, valued and work life balance is taken seriously. Other areas it's not."
good,"USAA does have a lot of great benefits such as excellent health insurance, PTO, paid education, and even promotes healthy behaviors BUT Refrain from working in a call center there. You will never leave. The only way to leave the call center is if you earn a degree, network with strangers, and kiss a whole lot of behinds. You might meet the right person."
good,"Pay is good, food benefits, but terrified to call in when I get sick that I’m going to get fired. Depending on the manager there is favoritism. Obviously, not me."
good,"Great benefits which includes a great 401K plan, medical and dental. I would say some management, depending which part of IT you work in, is very disengaged. You have to write your own reviews."
good,"If you can handle the culture, the schedule, and the metrics then go for it. If you are hard-working, likable, and competitive then there is tremendous potential."
good,Started off good. But it's the blind leading the blind now. No one knows what compliance is. Everything is stressful. No one knows what to do. It's become a circus.
good,"USAA boasts ""We know what it means to serve"" but as someone who was active duty with an active duty spouse that deployed a lot and had a lot of remote year long tours no accommodations were made for trying to schedule days off to visit my husband after he had been away for a year with another back to back year tour."
good,I am currently looking due to the nature of not knowing if I will have a job tomorrow. There is lots of negative people there and lots of uncertainty about the future of the company
good,USAA has wonderful benefits and people that work there are phenomenal. I met some really great people. But unfortunately there are some unattainable expectations that are set and inconsistency in the workplace that makes it difficult.
good,"The goal is supposed to be facilitating the member's financial security with competitive products but the main goal is to sell and get as many products a possible. Offering insurance to 21-year-old military members at $240 a month for auto doesn't seem to be doing that. "
good,"I was very excited to secure a position with USAA but was soon disillusioned by the military atmosphere in the company. If I had wanted to join the military I would have in my younger years.  I had to learn the military alphabet which was not difficult but I did not see the point to this drill.  "
good,"Being an adjuster for USAA is a tough gig. Working BI, I found myself constantly working weekends and nights just to stay ahead of the heavy workload. The market is extremely competitive but in the end its all about who you know when it comes to advancement."
good,"I felt that this company was loosing sight of their mission to protect the financial security of their military members and families. Which also includes employees who were members of the company. Things were becoming very sales focused and there was a lot of pressure put on insurance specialists. I felt that the company was starting to focus way too much on sales, and numbers rather than the people we served and the employees."
good,Log into your computer and take calls about insurance billing and what ever the mbr has on there mind. Management is inconsistent with promotions and time off. The people who choose make this there career are zombies.
good,"Got too corporate, cared less about employees.  I am not interested in filling out this survey currently.  It is not an awful company to work for but they slowly involved into nit-picking and spending more time on negatives instead of positives."
good,Call center is micromanaged and loopholes keep top performers in their current positions instead of being promoted. Very clique oriented and you better hope your manager likes you.
good,"Company overall is great, however certain areas have some much needed work as far as management. There are too many Indian's trying to run the show. The training at USAA is great when you can get them to send you. Management is lazy and will not lift a finger to help when you are busy or have and issue with an account."
good,"High volume call center environment. Micromanaged to the minute. Decent benefits, i.e. dental, medical. Little room to grow."
good,Make new contacts. Return messages in a timely manner.  Have weekly meetings with management. Got along great with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the micro managed atmosphere. Best part of the day was going home.
good,"Promotions are generally based on the ""Good ol Boy"" system, and if you're good at flirting and kissing butt. Once you've been there a while and earning a good wage, they start looking for a way to get rid of you, and bring in someone who'll accept 30% less. One of the core values is ""loyalty"" but they don't show any to the employees. When you're there, count how many ""managers"" are walking the halls in khakis, and holding black daily planners tucked in their arms schmoozing about nothing; while the dedicated employees are taking calls...Utterly Hilarious."
good,The staff is overworked and the job is difficult. The most enjoyable part of the day are breaks and lunches. The people you work with are enjoyable and help you get through the madness of taking numerous phone calls.
good,"This was a very demanding position as I was one of only two staff appraisers in the entire state with my territory"
good,I worked for USAA in the claims department until suddenly it was outsourced. The upper-management were not helpful with employees transferring to other departments at this time. The entire culture at USAA is backwards and unprofessional to say the least. I suggest trying another company that pays better and offers more advancement opportunities.
good,Good company if not taking phone calls. Management shows to much favoritism to females for promotions. Absolutely no advancement.
good,"The management was so micromanaged, it literally seemed like I, myself, was in the military. This is a financial services company that serves the Military and their families and it is run as such. You are just another number in the grand scheme of things and there are 1,000 other people who would replace you gladly. Most people get in with the company and then stay for the benefits, pension (used to have), stability etc. I could not take the same thing over and over AND over every day. I'm not a robot and couldn't be taught to be that. And that's why I had to leave. I do know some people who love this place though."
good,"I worked for USAA for about 16 years before I was forced to leave due to the stress. When I first started working there, everyone in the insurance industry wanted in. But things changed with a new CEO and it was every man for himself. Promotions were given to certain people, those that would ""kiss up"". Management became obsessed with phone stats, can't be away from your desk too long and you were given overtime but heaven forbid should you use it. The benefits were great, but they don't like it when you are there too long and would qualify for the health insurance at retirement time. You would always know when someone was there ""too long""."
good,"USAA is a great place to earn licenses, designations (sometimes useless ones for that matter), get funds for education but it's definitely not a place to build a career, specially for those in the investments field."
good,"ITIL is a driving force in the department I worked in. Managers were generally easy going. Surprisingly, in the Helpdesk area the dress code permitted casual attire. It was common to see people wearing jeans, and tee shirts."
good,"Despite education and experience, getting promoted hinges almost entirely on who you know. They are extremely focused on how well you ""network"" rather than what your resume looks like."
good,"USAA is a great company to have your insurance but not to work for.  If your stats fall to a certain point then you are counseled by your manager.  Your stats are reviewed by your manager every week.  Your calls are monitored by your manager, director, and QC and every time you do not offer a sale then they respond."
good,"The culture has dramatically shifted from what it use to be. Tons of risk type roles are available due to the current risk environment. "
good,IF you enjoy being micromanaged and computer-locked ro  desk and on the phones during every minute of the day and you don't have a desire to advance and promote at USAA....then they are a great place to work.
good,"This place has become very very stressful, the manager and director for the majority are horrible. There’s no work and family balance and the constant change is ridiculous. Fancy buildings that no one can enjoy."
good,"... But rarely your best friend. If you don't drink the kool-aid, you won't get ahead. One thing that is for sure is that metrics and growth for the bottom line drive the company's mission now. Sales > Service. Our profits go up and bonuses go down."
good,"I believe if you worked on the main campus I could  have rated the company higher. But working at a new location with people from different sites trying to explain your position is the downfall. "
good,Working for this company you have to be able to adopt to change. When it comes to work life balance there really isn't one.  The USAA culture and the leadership are just not the same anymore.
good,Workload seems extremely uneven.  Many people have hours of downtime.  However they all act as if they are overworked.  The long term employees don't seem to grasp what's normal in today's workplace or job market.  They are very entitled and whiney.  The company does try to take care of its employees. However many bad eggs have been allowed to stay for years.  Need a complete overhaul.
good,They are getting too big too fast and can not handle the growth. Unable to keep up with the times. Systems are out dated. NO training at all. They were better 4 years ago. Quickly changing into a company that does not provide job security. They use to be for the employees and for the members. Now it is all about bottom line.
good,"The workload in claims is far more than should be required for any one person, but this seems to be the case for a lot of companies after 2008. Middle management doesn't seem to get the point sometimes."
good,"When I first started with them, they prided themselves on ""not being just another call center""."
good,"High call volume"
good,"poor work-life balance, networking a must but not promoted if employee is in a direct-member contact position. Nothing else, need to fill the 150 minimum"
good,"The management is terrible. Lots of favoritism by managers. Minority women are favored in my office and the culture in the office is gossipy. Work from home is an option but you have to work the late shift and cannot change your shift. So even though it is a privilege to work independently at home you are punished by the worst hours in the company. Its all about your numbers and not about working claims as an adjuster. There is no file ownership so you spend the day working other files while yours pile up. In order to actually read your file to work a claim you need to plan to work outside of working hours to keep your metrics in compliance. Managers do not like to answer questions. You have to ask your teammates and get numerous responses; never knowing whats right. If you are a female minority friend of a manager or director, you have a chance to advance. Pay is ok but a lot of stress comes with the job and plan to work overtime to keep up numbers."
good,Okay place to work. Flexibility for scheduling was truly inconsistent and did not help. As a military based company I thought they would understand my life as a military spouse and work with me when things came up like deployment but unfortunately was still held accountable when sick days ran out but needed to be off.
good,Review appraisal reports for accuracy and quality. Ensuring appraisal reports meet all government and USAA guidelines and standards. Assisting peers and management with high complexed reviews.
good,"The first couple of years were great working here. I worked in the consumer lending area for most of my tenure. I started with USAA in the mortgage originations, but consumer lending needed help during summer surge. Their training for the new positions is better than most companies offer it is in a classroom for a few weeks, followed up with sitting with other MSR's. The benefits were good out side of standard medical, they  have a free onsite gym, Starbucks, child care- though not discounted and closes at 6:30pm,when many positions schedules were much later that.  They also have a large cafeteria and a mini mart so you don't have to leave the campus since you get a 35 minute lunches and two 20 minute breaks per day.  The benefit that mattered to me was the tuition benefits they paid 100% of my schooling and I graduated without any student loan debts, they paid it all.  Maternity leave is now 18 weeks paid time off. They do company family days as well. There are high call volumes with little break in between calls. It is hard to get promoted to a leadership level even with degree, it is more about who you know versus your work ethic or experience. I recently left for this reason, as my degree field is only offered at corporate office.  I would say in the last 2 years the culture has changed, they are going through pains of being a compliant company so there are a lot of changes happening and will be for the next few years now that they are a larger company.  The starting pay is low Year 1 I started at 32k, and year 5 I was at 45k that was after 3 promotions. They do offer 30%"
good,"They don’t know good potential when they have it. USAA preaches it’s for the military so much... and as long as you are or were An offier,  that’s true. They don’t care about front line supervisor experience and tend to promote people that aren’t ready or don’t know what they’re doing. It’s a cool company , but they know how to make one’s experience undervalued. They have so many amazing trained front line supervisors that they have taking phone calls or something else menial. It’s a shame and a waste."
good,"Pros: Org mission and purpose, benefits, facilities, coworkers"
good,"USAA is such a giant that honestly whether you're a contractor or a employee, what's going to make or break your employment experience there is management and where you work. "
good,The mortgage dept made a complete change to the bonus structure separate from the rest of the company.  There is very little chance of meeting the same bonus that the rest of the company will receive.
good,"Over 10 years within the industry and working many different areas of claims  - it becomes more than a job. The people you start a claim with until it is complete rely on you heavily. Time is of the essence. There were experiences I did not see coming , especially processing medical claims and medical fraud that showed a different kind of light to the insurance industry which served as motivation for me everyday to do my best to protect the insured's , the company -- it was not something I expected. It is much more than processing claims. It is experiencing helping others literally get by day to day when their lives are flipped upside down and realizing how much they depend on you to get the job done. It is not a job for everyone but it is a job if you do it well the reward pushes a person to do more, learn more and seek out opportunities they may have never considered for themselves when they started their professional career."
good,USAA is a company that has a really loyal membership - Home Office has great culture but the smaller satellite site do not have the same feel. It is not the same company it used to be.
good,"As a total loss adjuster your role is to settle and pay out on the member's/claimant's total loss claim. You will be answering incoming calls and making outbound calls 100% of the time. There is a heavy workload that comes with this role that management expects you to get done in a timely manner. Along with dealing with the heavy call volume, you may find yourself having to correct a lot of mistakes/errors that were done on the claim and at the same time apologizing to the member or claimant about why the claim was not paid or why the correct paperwork was not sent out. Multitasking is key. This role is very fast-paced and challenging but can be rewarding knowing that at the end of the day you were able to take care of and resolve the issue."
good,"When going in for an interview, USAA is described to be a fun place to work with career advancement opportunities and a collaborative environment. In reality, the company has a very jaded group of front line employees who have been doing the same menial tasks for years, have been expected to work nights and holidays, and who make less money that what competitors pay insurance agents or adjusters. Upper management is completely out of touch and only cares about numbers rather than the fact that employees are speaking out on the company forum about how depressed and overworked they are."
good,"I left USAA with an ""exemplary"" status. However, I did not meet my manager until my last day of service. I was a contractor and USAA's culture made sure I knew that I was a contractor. I had horrible times communicating with third-party vendors that were crucial to project success as my communication methods were on heavy lock-down. Contractors are not allowed to participate in certain events which did not compel my interest to investigate USAA as a long-term employer. I enjoyed the UX program overall and the project teams I was assigned; whom I worked with every day. I was not impressed with my direct management."
good,"Training at USAA is great... they will teach you all you ever need to know.  GREAT first job, however they expect the world from you, and run you wild trying to get it until you burn out."
good,"Our day-to-day tasks are not difficult in the least. However, the lack of communication from managers coupled with the high concentration on employee performance metrics make what should be a low-stress environment incredible stressful at times. I feel like they give ultimatums but do not follow through. Overall, I would love an opportunity for management prospects, but they are not interested in building talent from within."
good,"Benefits are top notch, pay is way below average. Starting wage is 36k, then after two years and being licensed for P&C in all 50 states, you get bumped up to 40k. No commission, pay is all hourly with little to no overtime available."
good,"Good pay and benefits, the training is great and people are friendly. It does get very taxing and is super stressful. Sometimes feels like your Being micromanaged."
good,"The facilities and creature comforts are outstanding; the company culture is really wonderful if you can buy in.  The workload is an issue, and much of the employee scorecard is driven by survey results."
good,"Long days and extreme pressure to follow guidelines, best time is quitting time which was like bed time. Always more worried about the members and how to deliver the Core Values verses the core business hours(8-5).  CORE Values are followed in TX and there is zero exceptions or discussions for actual front line employees who are the real face of the membership and who really deliver the core values.  The whole empowering the employee is a nice thought but when mistakes are made and errors are completed that cause delays in the whole process. DONT FIX NOTHING IF YOUR NOT SUPPOST TO!  DONT BE INVOLVED IF NOT YOUR ISSUE! THAT'S WHAT USAA AS A WHOLE IS SUPPOSED TO DO. Well when its broke and you see its broke, even if you should not of seen it, wouldn't fixing it be the right thing?"
good,a typical day at work involves working on a team with not enough hours in the day to complete your assigned tasks. the hardest part of my job is dealing with the lack of teamwork and cooperation within the departments.
good,"Bringing New members on board while educating them regarding all of USAA products and services."
good,"It started out as a great job and I expected a long career there."
good,"The people at USAA are very intelligent, motivated and successful. "
good,"USAA prides itself on its military background and current support; however, they are falling behind competitors in digital innovation.  There are so many internal guidelines and securities that it makes it next to impossible to get the tools needed, especially in the optimization and analytical landscape.  Management appears to be very comfortable in their positions, passive aggressive in their interactions, focused on title, and unwilling to work collaboratively to bridge gaps."
good,Great company for Military Members.  Typical work day is spent working on servicing the Military Members of USAA external and as a Manager taking care of daily administrative responsibilities of service representatives.  Growth potential at USAA varies depending on the market location.  Mentor opportunities and leadership development for an organization this size is lacking.  The service representatives of the organization are committed to taking care of the Military Membership and this can be seen in the high ratings given the company by outside customer service reviews by organizations such as J.D. Powers and Associates.
good,I enjoyed working with the people I met as USAA. But I'm a people person and found I wanted the face to face member contact that I wasn't getting there.
good,Good Benefits but compensation is lower than average due to annual bonus. The company is great for people who are content with being on the service with no real ambition to promote. Texas is better suited for people with leadership goals.
good,The workplace culture started to shift for the worst when the new Director of Banking came from another company  and USAA wasn't a fun place to work anymore
good,Not what is portrayed on the commercials.  States that they have a veterans hiring initiative but just another entry level job that anyone can get with a high school diploma
good,I absolutely loved being a part of fulfilling the mission and felt valuable for the first 8-9 years.  Executive leadership has lost the concept of our employees being our number 1 asset and allowing for a decent work /life balance.  It became all about the monthly numbers and profit and how missed targets were a negative reflection on them and how it impacted their personal career goals.
good,USAA is a company with an outstanding mission; however has started to lose its way over the past several years.  They appear to have forgotten what made them great and that's their people and their dedication to the member.
good,"At first it all sounds and feels great until you get to work. Stressful environment, especially if you aren't in a well fit unit. Older employees do not adapt to changes and policy update so it makes everything inconsistent, causing problems with customers. Managers will not back you up unless its your own claims. Lunches felt like 15min, not enough time to unwind before going back to back-to-back calls. Tried to network with other department of interest because they make you believe that you can move up and in many ways but you never get answered. I do believe the work culture has changed from what people have talked about who have been there 5+ years."
good,Big layoff in mortgage just a few months back and now an unmanageable workload. Zero help and zero support the work just piles up and it is the members that suffer with poor service and missed closing dates.
good,"USAA has experienced significant growth during the time I have been with the company.  Unfortunately, during that growth, leadership has lost sight of the core mission to care for members.  Part of that growth is a shift away from promoting internally.  Instead, those coming to USAA from outside the company are looked at as much more valuable than those who have been in place for any length of time.  It's still a good company.  But if you work there, don't plan on many opportunities for career advancement once you are inside the company."
good,"Don’t work for the third party contracted companies, they only provide the bare minimum for employees. Go through USAA. Better opportunities, better treatment. Take what you need and go to another company or apply through the door."
good,"back to back calls, don't expect any less.  you are very much micromanaged.  No real advancement opportunities. You do get a lot of time off.  benefits about the same as anywhere else."
good,Typical day is very high paced and many expectations required to meet above and beyond normal job requirements. Additional tasks added to reps without increase in pay for more work done. Multitasking is key in order to survive. Desk management is priority. Some management is great and others not so much and power goes to their head not realizing that these are people working hard to meet goals. If you make this company your life then it will become your life. Have to find balance between work and family. The people I worked with and friends I made was enjoyable.
good,The great lie about USAA is that what you did on the outside matters (unless it was in the military). the idea that you just need to get in the door is inaccurate. there is VERY little room for advancement and the most important quality is your place in the line; your actual skill or ability to do the job matters little.
good,USAA is a very difficult company to work for due to the level of stress associated with my position.  This turned out to be a sales position while servicing the clients.
good,"There is an extreme lack of communication from the upper management to the front lines.  The benefits are great but the for being a claims adjuster, you are very underpaid compared to other insurance carriers.  As well, the workload is overload and their is no work and family balance as they say."
good,"Nice building, good cafeteria, clean well kept building. Garage is nice for change of weather. Has stand up stations for great ergo comfort. Would be nice to have wireless headsets to move around more."
good,Worked hard and went above and beyond for two years. Applied for over 50 opportunities to advance and didn't receive one interview. Enjoyed the people I worked with but just wasn't challenged enough.
good,I worked at USAA as a Contract Underwriter for just under a year.  I felt that there was a great deal of discrimination between Contract and Full time employees.  The Underwriting department was busy but they only had Contractors on overflow so we were not given enough work.
good,"USAA was great in the beginning but gave promotions to many people who did not deserve it or were not qualified. It seemed like the managers only promoted people they liked."
good,"Managers need more help in instructing employees on best practices and most employees aren’t there to help, only to get ahead no matter the consequence of their peers."
good,"From a business perspective USAA has everything figured out in ways one would never imagine possible. That said, after one gets out of the insulation of a training environment and actually gets into their real-world experience, I had a difficult time offering rental insurance to a brand new enlisted member of the military, that in my opinion, wouldn't do said member justice. It all came down to how much insurance products you could cram down every callers throat. Those who enjoyed that type of boiler-room environment, were successful. If one does not have an advanced degree, kiss the idea of ever getting off the phones goodbye."
good,"in billing department its same routine, just helping members to make a payment or a special payment arrangement set up and app (automatic payment plan)"
good,"Working for USAA for the past 2.5 years has brought great benefits such as an adequate PCA medical plan, an awesome 8% 401k company match, paternity leave of 12 weeks paid, an onsite gym, differential pay for moving out of state, and more. However, as a claims adjuster, our multitasking skills are expected to be on steroids. You are expected to keep an open phone adherence of 70%, which seems fair - until your task list reaches 100 and you've got 18 voicemails you can't get to because ""you need to work from an open state"" meaning you've got to keep your phone line open and reduce making any outbound calls - which prompts more status calls and incoming calls because members are not ""hearing from the adjuster.""  I absolutely LOVE the mission and the benefits. We have some valuable resources to do our jobs well. However, there is much room to grow when it comes to analyzing the expectations vs the reality of this job and its functions. Happy and empowered employees equal positive member experience."
good,"My time at USAA was very mixed. They roll out the red carpet and get you in and once you are in it stops . Managers no longer “truly” coach you. If you are doing par to above or work it seems backwards but you don’t get recognized. It is very confusing to see Management for teams know less than the team they are coaching. The higher up you are the less you do and it is more like a Frathouse or Sorority. The managers have clicks , some know the mission and live by it and that is nice but too much of them do not and it’s hard to move up or go along when your mentor/manager is a greasy car salesman mentality."
good,N/A i do not wish to share my experience working for the company. It was a third party company called Teleperformance. I'm certain working for USAA directly is a completely different experience.
good,"USAA is a great employer; however, the work that I did for them was awful. Like many other call-center jobs, the managers watch over you like a hawk and track every minute of your day."
good,"It's a call center, it's typical, meet metrics and adherence. It's not for everyone, but those who can handle it, awesome! As for advancements, it's not only about exceeding goals, it's about who you know."
good,this is a call center atmosphere and usaa has hired 3rd party representatives to handle members from Puerto Rico and over seas. I want to speak with people who care about the member and the military
good,"Most positions are for the in-bound call center and it's very busy every minute you are there. Their systems and processes are not very efficient and they contract out alot of work which minimizes productivity, cohesion, and opportunities."
good,"Salary: Excellent "
good,"Excellent place to work if your lucky enough to get on the ""it"" list. Otherwise,  expect to sit in the same stagnant position for the balance of your career."
good,"The benefits, PTO, and annual bonus in February are what keep so many tenured people here.  The pay is laughable for the expectations that are placed upon representatives that have member contact.  Advancement is virtually nonexistent once you reach a certain point in your career with this company. Expectations are set VERY clearly that in order to get into a management position, a Bachelors degree is required, and yet many promotions have been given and continue to be given to those without these credentials. The technology provided to representatives who speak to members all day everyday is extremely out of date, and frequently out of commission without any communication or work-arounds. This job has taught me many valuable lessons in customer service and de-escalating high-tension situations. I have developed a thicker skin because of the nasty behaviors I have encountered over the last few years - if you are someone with feelings, this job is not for you."
good,"training was up in the air, no direction and up in the air.  I was offered part time with benefits turned out afterwards just a stipend of $100 per pay period instead of medical insurance. Phone calls are not as trained for."
good,"I am happy to have gotten job experience at USAA. I needed it for my resume. The pay was needed for my family. However, the pay was very low. The company needs to have DMT raise pay for the employees because minimum wage counts for nothing today."
good,"Great ideals, but watch out if you get on 'watch list'. Lots of Paid Time Off, but be careful how you use it. If a pattern is shown, management looks down on that, even if your requested time off is approved. Lots of hidden hypocrisies. If you don't follow exactly how they dictate, you're out! "
good,"Deliver excellent customer service "
good,"Overworked, under appreciated. Management is clueless. Co workers are WONDERFUL and very helpful. Training is on going which is good but this department is not ready for the industry."
good,"good place to work but very micro-managed. loved my co-workers but the hardest part of the job was trying to advance. the company kept changing the requirements, making it hard"
good,"While a great company with a noble mission, there are many pockets within USAA where the management/leadership team is weak.   Unfortunately if you inherit one of these leaders or are reorganized it is very hard to get out from their leadership.   The corporate politics are severe;more than you will ever hear anyone talk about.  If you are looking to develop and grow this is not the place."
good,"My typical day consisted of investigating automobile accidents and determining fault."
good,"The company in whole is a great company with the products they offer to their members, but the focus stops with the members. The stuff is overworked in the Auto claims department, and when I say overworked the expectations are unrealistic regardless of pay. Your performance is measured using metrics that are totally out of your control. As an auto adjuster if you do not refer ""sell"" products your evaluation is basically thrown out the door. This is not an adjuster position it is a call center job as you will never speak to your assigned adjuster as a member calling in. This means that the employees doing the right thing do the bulk of the work. The benefits are good but the pay is average if you factor in the bonus that is held over your head year round."
good,"I was employed in the lingerie department and I was trained as a professional bra fitter so if you need a new bra and want to know how to get the right fit, I'm your girl! I enjoyed working in the lingerie department, I was trained in bra fitting so my day was spent in the dressing rooms working very closely with customers making sure their bras fit correctly and that they felt good wearing it.  You would be surprised by how wearing the correct size and style bra makes you look and feel. In between customers I would restock merchandise, clean the dressing rooms, assist with purchases and make sure everything in the department was neatly displayed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with customers and updating the displays when new merchandise came out."
good,"A typical day includes answering calls, creating first notice reports, and communicating with members about coverage's.   The situations that are called in vary greatly and determining coverage is difficult.  As such you learn new things about coverage everyday and with every situation.  The hardest part of the job is handling members that are unwilling to accept the idea that insurance does not cover all things and is not a warranty.  On the other side, the best part of the job is being able to find coverage for a member and provide the peace of mind that comes with the policy."
good,Learned more things regarding investments which really interested me
good,"Very pushy with sales..made members frustrated. Very hard to get any days off when requested, they record everything you do ex: times you would you the restroom and for how long."
good,"Good job, good training but no opportunity for advancement."
good,"High paced call center environment handling over 100+ calls per day processing consumer loans and complex title issues and questions. Member satisfaction is one of the number 1 successes of the company. Empathy must be implemented with the caliber of members that are handled. In a call center environment it is difficult to have a relationship with management because of the lack of time available to build and get to know one another. My co-workers are great however this is another area where it is difficult to maintain a work relationship because of the lack of time being able to be off the phones and communicate with one another. The hardest part is not being able to communicate on a daily basis and build healthy work relationships.  I enjoy working as a team and we are more individualized which makes it difficult to assist and motivate one another. With the low turnover rate, promotion is highly competitive with individuals with the most tenure receiving oportunities first wtithout taking in perspective of previous employment and education.  What I enjoy most is being able to research and assist our member with complex service issues. My goal is to make my call the last call that needs to be made as it pertains to any error or complaint a member may have."
good,Very stressful work environment and pay is well below industry standard. Company is growing to fast for its own good. I enjoyed being a Member but not an employee.
good,Overall good company but position was not for me. Very choatic at times. Too much overload of work.
good,Usaa is a great company with great benefits. Typical day at works includes taking inbound calls for the majority of the shift. The hardest part of the job is having to multi task.
good,was only summer intern for two months. learned routine of how projects were to be completed.
good,"Be prepared for a lot of change and inconsistency. During the interview process, you will be told of great advancement and job opportunity, but as soon as you start, thins will be different. The culture of the company has totally changed, where things use to be about the members but are now more so about the bottom line, this is fine if implemented correctly. Be prepared to focus on sales and not get paid any commissions for these sales..."
good,"Advancement is very difficult at USAA, especially in smaller office like Colorado Springs. Benefits convince a lot of folks to stay most likely, as the day to day job is mundane and repetitive. Metrics are constantly moving, so you may be close to getting a goal and then it increases again overnight. Management will “coach” you, but use the same coaching sheet for everyone ... so even if your succeeding in your work you still get the blanket “we can do better” talk."
good,so many people were on leave from stress.  they definitely make you work for your money that's for sure. the benefits are decent but the pressure is on. stay out of the mortgage department if you can
good,Great benefits like insurance and gym perks. Great 401k matching. Facilities are nice and cafe's on site are convenient. Easy access to interstate and crosstown.
good,"If you are looking for consistency and stability this will be unnerving for you. You switch desks, switch teams, switch managers...with no rhyme or reason, this happens almost twice a year, if not more. Some managers and leads are helpful and supportive, others are hands off and will watch you sink. In the mortgage dept they dissolve depts meant to assist, and pile it on the processor's plate. As a processor, you are given more and more responsibilities of tasks adding to your current job responsibilities, and yet you are still expected not to make any mistakes, oh and you need to do it in 20 days rather than 30 days, then they change your responsibilities again, by adding even more, and your pipeline is over 40 loans, all of which you have to call everybody with status updates at least every 3-4 days (members, realtors, title, etc) all in addition to the actual processing job and phone calls and internal IMs with everyone wanting you to stop what you are working on and help them with a different loan. Wait until they say ""no overtime"" and then they get on you because you didn't get EVERYTHING done.  Before, we were included in the annual bonus, but to save money, now they give you monthly bonuses based on marginal and borderline unrealistic criteria.  Almost EVERYTHING centers around customer surveys (which whether accurate or not is solely the member's perception), this will determine everything regarding your career, pay, bonuses, etc."
good,"I used to recommend working here to anyone, but now, I would say to diversify your prospects and negotiate hard. That said, benefits and pay are decent. You'll be taken care of in all the big things you need as a corporate employee."
good,"The USAA mission is honorable and the benefits are great. However, working in the front lines (e.g. customer service/call center roles) is awful. There is no work life balance, it is extremely difficult to advance or move between departments. There are many different ways through which USAA will invest in your development, but you will still have a difficult time advancing in your career. Everything is political, you have to know the right people to get ahead. If you speak up about things that are wrong, then you will be ostracized by leadership. Leadership downplays the real issues and tries to make you feel better by giving you snacks."
good,USAA is undergoing a bit of a structural shift in order to stay competitive and job security is suffering but I would have to say that the people that you meet there are great.
good,"USAA likes to think of themselves as an early adopter of technology and a thought leader however nothing could be further from the truth.  They are mired in bureaucracy; industry laggards clinging to the decade old glory of mobile check deposit.  "
good,Higher ups expect more and more multitasking to be performed daily to the point that completing jobs effectively is not attainable. Pay is lower than most insurance companies but benefits are great.
good,"This job was a mindless soul sucking situation.  The pay was excellent for a call center and the benefits were great.  There were many amenities onsite that the people on the phones never have time to partake in.  Company culture is great, the lower and middle management leave much to be desired,"
good,"They fully indoctrinate you in the company culture from day 1. They stand behind the mission statement fully. "
good,I don't have anything positive to say so I won't say anything.  My last manager was extremely poor and was a micromanager.  I had this job too long ago to remember everything
good,"USAA spends a lot of time and money teaching and promoting Agile. However, they add some many processes and controls on their implementation of Agile, that progress is very slow. This creates an situation where it is impossible for and individual to stand out, because no one can get much done. "
good,"USAA has a great training program to get you licensed in 25+ states but the management support really lacks and the change in culture is very apparent. The benefits are also great, however time off is hard to schedule based on being in a call center environment with many employees being with the company for over 10 years."
good,"Working at USAA carries great benefits and perks, but they pay their financial advisors quite a bit less than the average salary that competitors pay for employees that do less work.   You are expected to be able to do all of the following on EVERY call if it calls for it : recommendation of USAA investment products, debt management, credit repair, college planning, retirement planning, estate planning, military retirement and pension programs, health insurance, life insurance, and even basic tax advice.  You are expected to sell life insurance to everyone, and management maintains that it is appropriate for everyone in every situation.  You are also expected to recommend USAA mutual funds only, despite the fact that their funds are overpriced and do not perform was well as competitor products.  They tell you during training that the average advisor is promoted within 6 months to a year, but despite exceeding sales targets on a regular basis, no promotions."
good,"Great Mission but too strict and micromanaging on employees, does not give positive reinforcement of a job well done. Focus on the negative and make you feel like a poor employee."
good,"you get told of all the great things the company offers and they do offer them but it comes with strings because they offer very little flexibility regarding work life balance, some of their procedures are outdated and need to be revisited for employee benefit"
good,Everyone working here appears to want to be here.  Great deal of pride.  Pay is fair and could be higher.  Opportunity to advance seem good.  I've worked here for a short period of time but overall feel there's good morale.  Meetings are efficient but there's too many.  One area for improvement would be more face to face collaboration.  There are many conference calls and I'm not confident that many know each other personally.  Management is very approachable.
good,"I love the company as a hole, but as an auto adjuster your job is threatened everyday for compliance issues and it's a call center position. All claims are handled in a group environment while you are required to handle your own claims averaging around 120."
good,USAA is a good company for some. The managers hold weekly reviews with the employees and review their sales. They are very sales oriented so if you are a salesperson it will be good.
good,I enjoy working at USAA. I am currently relocating and unfortunately my job doesn't offer work from home opportunities. I love the mission and who we support.
good,The possibilities are great but if you get stuck with a bad manager they  pretty much don't exist and that was my experience. Wishing I could have had a better experience
good,"As a subcontractor for USAA, I worked the first shift and received a very high volume of calls regarding billing, banking, policy cancellation and counseling to resolve issues regarding the aforementioned. Management was constantly had budgetary problems, which led to the dissolution of many jobs, which was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was, to me, the highly competitive environment that led to pay raises and bonuses."
good,"Great 401K , healthcare for individual affordable but for family expensive.  Insurance policy service rep has to be promoted 5 times to obtain a position that doesn’t take back to back calls. Very competitive for advancement and no openings .  manager candidate school had over 900 applications and less than 30 were accepted. I am a 15+ year employee and it has been very hard for me to advance. I have experience managing teams and as an RS I do many manger duties. the company continually relies on substantial contractor work to offset the call volume load to stay afloat but that contributes to many errors such as incorrect information, misunderstanding of coverages etc.  Claims is drowning. Company doesn’t communicate it’s goal clearly Except as dictated protocol. Much of usaa’s Recent expansion and business model was learned through our local news ! Constant IT issues including mobile app and employee app."
good,It's ok if you want to work in a call center environment. They will say it's about taking care of the members but then not give you the time/tools to do so and bring up phone stats.
good,"A typical day would include fielding inbound calls from members to review, update and write new auto and property policies. One cannot help but learn almost everything about insurance."
good,"A great place to work if you are not a contractor. However, has good work hours 8-5 but not flexible. Friendly people. Convenient cafeteria in building."
good,"The work and workload itself can be very challenging to manage, however it can be very rewarding as well given nature of the work and the membership base."
good,"I absolutely loved working for USAA.. the only down fall was when we received unexpected PCS orders  USAA did NOT honor their creed about taking care of military spouses.  I had to resign my position after fighting for my job for almost 2 months.  HUGE LET DOWN as a active duty spouse!!! other than that, great company to work for."
good,Core values are good and training for position is good. Everything is metric based. They micro manage and the if the managers don't like you personally then they find all kinds of faults to terminate you.
good,Great environment and benefits. Obtained my insurance license and continue to learn more everyday. The culture is lively and supportive.
good,"Amazing members, but lots of internal politics and positioning for promotions.  ""Old boy"" mentality, that makes it difficult for people of color to fairly advance.."
good,"USAA is a great place to work with a great corporate culture, as long as you do not work in claims or on customer contact. Most of these jobs are very low paying for the amount of work that you are required to do. USAA pays its claims employees an average of $15,000 less than compared to other insurance companies. Much of USAA's appeal is that you will be able to join through claims and be able to grow and expand in other areas of the enterprise, however this is opportunity is far and few in between. Once an employee, internal job postings are all you are able to apply for while there are many external opportunities that are not available to the active employee. If you plan on seeking employment, make sure it is not in claims, otherwise, it is a great place to work."
good,"Management tended to lie and be deceitful, Co-workers were awesome, Day is very routine. Providing for members was rewardful and fulfilling. Hardest part was having to give members a denial for there applications."
good,"I do not believe USAA cares about technical people. They are a dime a dozen when you factor in out sourcing. It is more about brown nosing. Your manager is you judge, jury and executor. I sure hope you end up with a good manager, I did not.  I was a Sr mainframe Developer.  If you are young and know Java, it might be a good place to start. If you are a experienced programmer you are taking a big gamble, but the pay is good, benefits are good. I was in P&C Claims a real disapointment in my option, but what really matters, who is your manager."
good,"Coming from outside sales, the rigidity of this company felt like being in jail.  Constant criticism on working, no ability to have any individuality, not easy to get promoted, tight work schedule, unfriendly staff.  Most people stay for the pay and benefits but my sanity was more important"
good,No development provided.  Constant change in HR leadership for last eight years.  It's who you know and can you dazzle everyone.  No sound business practices are used.
good,"Good company, some concerns related to how jobs are filled and people are promoted. Very meeting intensive culture, management and employees not always competent for role.  Great benefits, increases, bonuses."
good,Challenging work environment. Typical call center environment even though they claim not to be. Pay is a tad low for the amount of calls and work that is being done on a daily basis.
good,Tremendous pressure on IT employees to stick to timelines. Changes are not welcomes and processes don't adhere well to changes.
good,"The job started out wonderfully but changed for the worst with each CEO."
good,You spend your whole day taking back to back calls with little to no breaks in between. Within 5 years I have had going on 9 different schedule changes that you must bid for and hope you get a decent shift. Management is hit or miss depending on the one you get. I've had 7 different manager changes over the course of 5 years. Job is stressful and dull with hardly any opportunities for advancement. Hardest part of the job is being stuck glued to the phone for 8-10 hours per day. Most enjoyable part of the job is that you get paid.
good,Very high volume expected. Rewarding to help military families. Management is lousy - they promote military 1st whether they are the most qualified or not. You won't move up in the company unless you have been in the military or are from a military family. They really screen their employees so you work with nice folks - but the expectations are high even though the compensation is only average at best. Most managers are not family friendly.
good,"My coworkers and their patience and willingness to help when needed; made the job less stressful.  A typical day at work encompassed the use of a desktop computer with a telephone headset for incoming calls; complying to business goals, such as, state compliance statutes and state regulatory requirements, all while being monitored/evaluated by performance metrics in comparison to my peers.  The hardest part of the job on any typical day at work was the extreme amount of multi-tasking while speaking to the member on the telephone, such as; listening to the members claim loss details, typing in all the required internal steps to complete all the data entry involved in entering/updating their claim details, asking the appropriate questions to investigate and determine coverage and/or liability, maintaining control of the call, explaining the claims process to the member to move the claim to closure, all in a timely manner.  Overall, being a claims adjuster is stressful, but is also rewarding when their policy contract allowed for coverage and I was able to assist and offer solutions to make them feel secure and comfortable with our claims process."
good,Education at USAA is valued. The company spends a lot of money training employees.
good,"I have worked at USAA for 8 years, all on the phone.  The culture and expectations are ever changing."
good,Great values for members yet pay doesn't reflect daily work requirements.
good,USAA offers a great benefits package. The management is disorganized and sends mixed messages. The preach the mission which is honorable but they do not demonstrate adherence to the very core values they say they honor. Employees are expected to walk the walk but management is often absent and do not lead by example.
good,"The bonus offered in February is the monies you would earn all year with another company, then you are not even guaranteed the bonus."
good,"USAA employee's and mainly management staff are fake they put on a happy face acting as if they love their job but most employee's do not. USAA use to be a great place to work, but has turned into every other call center,(it use to be about the customer now it is all about sales of the products only) a typical work day is sign in and start working, your manager would say you are doing a good job then turn around and write you up for not doing a good enough job, most managers do things differently, so (the right hand don't know what the left hand is doing) and what is great to one manager isn't enough for another, it is all a popularity contest, if you are well liked by management to get to keep your job but if you even think about argumenting against a managers decision you will then been in trouble , not to say anything, my co-workers were great loved them, hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what your manager wanted from you especially when USAA move manager and employee around about every 6 months,the most enjoyable part of the job helping the customers"
good,Extreme call enter environment. You don't get commission but if you don't keeps your sales up you get fired. Hmmmm?
good,"I was a contracted employee through a third party agency i do not nor have i ever been employed directly by USAA indemnity company."
good,You only work as a contractor and very rare to be a permanent employee. I knew someone who was a contractor there for 10 years and was never given a chance to be a permanent employee.
good,"Get My Quotes "
good,Good company with great benefits!  There are amazing people that work at this great company and the mission is second to none! Caring for our military and their families is something that we can all get behind.
good,A very transparent company that follows Agile/Scrum to the tee and very impressive learning experience. Contractors were grouped with Full Time employees which was encouraging to see the silos being broken with the Disciplined Execution journey.
good,Nice Company that works with the military community and their families to provide solutions for their insurance needs. Also has other divisions to help with banking and retirement.
good,"Fast paced, up to date technical environment and various opportunities. Employees are respected and appreciated. Good working environment. Clean, safe facilities and secure campus."
good,"USAA is a great company. I was a member prior to becoming employed there. I'm still a member after ending my employment there. However, the mortgage division of the company does not match the rest of the company in terms of culture. The executive leadership of the mortgage division changed multiple times while employed there, which indicated instability. The new executive leadership is more customer and numbers-focused, leaving a plethora of employees not feeling valued and not feeling heard when they voice concerns. The mortgage division highly encourages overtime and looks down upon employees that do not work overtime. The workload is unbearable and the managers are so busy doing administrative work that they're rarely available for assistance."
good,It is a good place to work if you have the right management in place.  There are spaces within USAA that without a mentor there is no way to feel you are being utilized at your full potential.
good,"It is really hard to move up here at USAA unless you continuously network. I was a top performer, but that was not enough. In order to be successful you must work suck up to the right people."
good,"Manager's missing in action. Appeared to no know the direction of the company.  Brought me in on C2H and gave me good evaluation, yet when it came time to convert, they were unsure."
good,I’m search for a company that will allow me to develop my leadership and team member skills. Working for USAA enabled me to grow as a sales and customer service representative
good,The company has great benefits but it truly depends on who your manager is if you will succeed or not. Its truly about who you know in order to get promoted or succeed in the company.
good,"The company has really started to go downhill. The only reason I have stayed there so long is due to the great health care benefits and 401k. They promote work life balance but I'm currently having to work 12hr days to try and manage the work load and even with working 12hr days, I'm still falling behind on my work. The USAA that everyone use to know, is long gone."
good,They were ok to work for very strict micro managed. Too many meetings. Liked the members. Liked their bonus structure . Nice place to work.  Very strict
good,"USAA in the beginning sells you their benefits, advancement, and work life opportunities within the company. What they don't tell you is the advancement is slim to none. They are just like any employer-all about who you know/popularity rather than actual job skill. You will get far answering the phone than you will actually working your claim files properly. The Chesapeake office opportunities really lack because of the lack of investment USAA puts into that office and expand. Which makes for very little opportunities to advance your claim career because of competition. The health insurance is subpar with a high deductible and they think 700 is enough to cover your expenses when the health benefits don't kick in until you meet the $1300 deductible. Half the work is completed by contractors who are not trained properly making double the work for the adjuster. Call volumes are ridiculous and honestly the members are rude with little repercussions.  Not a very healthy work environment. I would say the educations benefits are nice, but the contractor they hire to manage the program are horrible. Honestly, if you're trying to build your insurance career, USAA is a great place to start, but don't plan on advancing anytime soon."
good,"High call volume environment, great employee benefits and amenities, numbers evaluated weekly with unit manager, helps when you have a strong and motivating manager"
good,The pay and the benefits are good. Onsite gym and cafeteria. No work life balance. Very hard to get requested days off at first. Work every Saturday in my department.
good,"It's very personal."
good,"USAA is the only call center style job I have ever had, but from what I am told no one treats you better than USAA. Working in such a large company makes it very difficult to stand out for even quality employees like myself. My metrics were never high enough to warrant getting off the phones even to a more qualified position. I was very good at what I did, but couldn't seem to break out of a ground level position. Whether it was that I didn't know the ""right people"" or couldn't master the numbers game was never disclosed. If anyone enjoys working in a call center USAA is the place to be no doubt. Benefits were amazing, and the atmosphere was very comfortable."
good,I love USAA but the mortgage department is going downhill. They stripped loan officers from being able to promote internally with no adjustments to salaries. The morale is low and people are leaving the department left and right. I advise anyone looking to be hired on to really explore and get as much information as possible about the department you are going to. Love the company but the mortgage department is in shambles.
good,"4 months of training didn't prepare me for what the actual position entailed. You're left to believe your member is everything, but don't act as such at times. It's unfortunate, and turnover is extremely high because of the ability to correct issues."
good,no advancement or work life balance.  you are expected to be perfect and make no errors. Those that are willing to brainlessly go through the day and robotically do as they say will go far.
good,busy work environment where you must hit metrics every day and every call you take is monitored. It is a sales driven job with a heavy call volume. The benefits and bonuses were great.
good,"This company has excellent benefits and will help you to obtain your degree. This is important because without it, you ha e limited options for advancement."
good,My job was eliminated due to low real estate volume. I was in a rotational position about to be hired into during the next promotions due to manager provided outstanding results of my rotation.
good,"Job was stressful enough with the calls from members in 28 states and each state having different rules for auto, homeowner insurance. Every call is recorded and critiqued. great benefits but the workload was heavy and few rewards. Even an ""attaboy or attagirl would have been appreciated instead of an interrogation if there was a deviation from the ""narrow path""."
good,enter the company in any position you can get and work towards the position you want. Enter claims if you have to but promote as soon as possible. Claims is a very stressful environment. Company benefits are great however.
good,USAA has a welcoming and helpful community. Everyone in the building is dedicated to doing a great job providing financial services to the military community and their families.
good,Nice culture. Building is nice and offers a lot while on break. If you go into the claims department you are stuck there. The claims department does not operate like the rest of the organization.
good,"Work Culture is good, and the people youfind working by your side are excellent individuals. However process and management are lacking. Many inefficiencies existed in the way that issue tickets were generated and handled, with no ability to officially provide comment or find a clear path to resolution."
good,With an ever changing goal post it is impossible to follow guidelines. Management states that they will work it out and provide clear cut instructions but hold you accountable regardless how or if instruction was provided.
good,The company is going through transitions. The mission of the company is not held to the standards of when I started working for them. There have been surprise layoffs and management is not very effective at the moment.
good,"provides training, excellent benefits, good location, room for advancement recognizes talent, holds regular meetings and includes employee feedback, overtime as needed good people to work with"
good,Depending on the department you're working in will determine if you have a fortunate future with USAA. Big company name but little loyalty to employees.
good,Good company to work for and team environment.   Pay could be a lot better and more training for some management but not all.  USAA is a good company but like all companies can improve in some areas
good,fun work environment. awesome co workers. free gym and has outdoor activities you can participate in. Management could be better. You can get places if you know someone there.
good,"I might have had a better experience if I didn't live so far away. I had to travel 106 miles round-trip to get to work every day because they built their campus in far northern Phoenix, almost in Anthem."
good,"The company offered great benefits, but regardless of your experience you had to work at a very low level until for could actually have in depth conversations."
good,Stay away from claims or anything on the phone. There is no development. Too political to get out.... salary could also be better as well. To each it’s own but if things don’t change soon...ehh
good,"Worked consumer lending and moved up quickly but once at last position to move past had to have a Bachelor's degree in anything. Yet a Bachelor's does not make you knowledgeable or a leader, yet USAA seems to think so. A lot of the management and division supervisor were from INS knowing nothing about consumer lending yet we were to follow then and they honestly could not lead by example because they didn't know the job. To I this a large short fall of USAA, plus Sales is not part of a strong membership foundation and pushing products on members when they call is such a BIG NO NO and members have said it. So how can USAA claim to do what's right for a members Finacial well being and be a provider of choice if you are pushing your employees to push products? FL atmosphere is way more stressful then any other sites."
good,it was an okay job very micromanaged. a typical day in the wire transfer department was from 7:30 to 4 everyday Monday though Friday. Very repetitive job.
good,"I think they need to training their managers to have been people skills training."
good,The mission of USAA to provide world class service to the military and their family is exactly what they advertise. The management team was a bit stiffing and one felt like one had to walk on egg shells.
good,Military style environment. You were on the phone all day call after call I was great at my job but this type of call center mentality is definitely not for me
good,"Allowed interaction with current and former military personnel who served the country, company strives to be a premier customer service provider for all customers"
good,It has it's benefits the annual bonus was a plus and was nice to get every year. but they always looked to count that as salary when negoitating salary.
good,"Contractors could not take part in any extra's in the building, so I would not know how nice the rooms were. It appeared that the extra rooms were very nice for the employees."
good,Working with user was long . Working third party there was no room for growth. Management did no help you advance.You were just a worker  .There was not an enjoyable moment.
good,"You are one phones for the eight hours you are working, minus two 20min breaks and a 35 minute lunch break.  Managers like to micromanage and you are required to maintain certain sales numbers per day and have on technical or compliance issues.  You are also based on the number of satisfaction survey that you receive"
good,I think that the company is an awesome company but they don’t always live by their own core values in the call center. Unwilling to do what it takes to make you succeed.
good,"This is an okay job. A lot of sales required and they want you off and on the phone quickly. There is definitely opportunity for advancement, but not right away"
good,Various hours with good amount of down time between clients.  Great opportunity for experience with employees. I worked in the fitness center. great marketing opportunity
good,"Working at USAA as a contractor is a pretty negative experience. The employees have a disrespect for contractors and even treat them pretty poorly. "
good,Great place for a full time employee but can be bad for contractors. Not treated fair as a contractor and always left behind when the full timers have a party or lunch etc even when doing the same job.
good,Nothing different from any other call center job other than security. They have cameras everywhere watching everything that you do. Can't go anyplace in building and not be watched by cocky security
good,"USAA is a great place of employment, I do feel that working for a third party is a bit tough because we are under paid. The job itself is great, it's just that the environment and the pay does not fit for the requirement that we have to do."
good,I want to help my members who call in and give them true caring service. As of lately Our managers have been pushing sales which quickly and easily ruins the business.
good,"It's fine. An extrovert's dream, an introvert's nightmare. Be prepared to sell, sell, sell, even if it is inappropriate and your job is to talk to people after they've had a car accident. Don't get me wrong, sometimes there is a legitimate opening but more times than not, it's inappropriate and gross. But you will be docked on your performance if you don't try to sell something every call. Mobility is for areas that bring in money (i.e. Financial Services). It is far more difficult to not plateau in an area like claims."
good,The overall company is ok.  The originations department in mortgage lacks diversity.  They don't appreciate women of color and they are not open to feedback.
good,"only thing I didn;t like about USAA was we had 30 min lunch and the cafeteria was about 15 min walking, the parking garage was pretty far as well but cool"
good,It is a very old culture with very old processes they treat employees ok however the technology is so outdated they need to get up with the times there is no collaboration between departments everyone is just buying time and ready to retire
good,I enjoyed with my team. I would prepared the loan closing package and my manager would lather approved it. Very relaxed environment in the company. Okay place to work.
good,Great people and culture.  The people are what make the company. Core values remind me very much of the military.  Sometimes development is hard to receive.
good,"Unless you like to be overworked and underpaid this job is for you! "
good,"USAA has an excellent mission and they are dedicated to their members. I hated the call center environment and could not get use to the micro management. There are a lot of perks, but it wasn't worth it for me."
good,"Good Company core values outstanding.  Enjoyed working there as a contract processor.  Good hours, working conditions were a bit rough in a very secure paperless environment."
good,"USAA is an ok place to work; it is my opinion that the set up at this company is one that keeps employees in a mediocre state and since I am looking to grow leaps and bounds, I plan to spread my wings."
good,My third party location had very friendly and helpful coaches but the overtime and shifts were a hassle. They are also very strict on 15 min and lunch breaks.
good,"Contract position upon getting back into the software development workforce, so wasn't expecting too too much. The employees are fantastic, the culture is great and relaxed, but with any large company, the management could be much better."
good,"USAA is a great company to work for. The learning curve / learning tools are endless, anything you want to do, and vision you have or goals, USAA will help you reach them. If anyone gets the opportunity to work for USAA I would not turn it down. Good Luck !!"
good,"USAA is a great company, however the specific department I work in has kept me from being able to move up within the company.  I have been with them for 3 years and I haven't had the opportunity to move up."
good,I was let go because of the files went digital and they eliminated the position and there were no other options at the time I wanted to pursue.  Most of the time it was enjoyable.
good,"Management does not care about their most valuable asset, their employees.  USAA talks the talk but does not walk the walk.  The benefits and bonuses are good however well deserved considering the amount of work and expectations."
good,There is too much consistent change to provide a stable environment for the people attempting to support the user base.  It is ok to want to change things that are not happening well but it only impedes those providing the services because they are constantly pulling resources to something new and different without even truly establishing a process for the change management.
good,"I was employed here as a temporary employee, during my employment my point of contact was no longer with the company and I didn't feel supported.  Wasn't given consistent feedback."
good,Management lived there mission statement day in and day out. They believed in taking care of each employee so they could focus their full attention on taking care of members. The members are hands down the best part of the job... The benefits rock... FREE Gym... Education Assistance... Onsite summer childcare sponsored by the YMCA...
good,"Fast pace atmosphere"
good,Only work here if you want to do a mindless job collect a mediocre paycheck amd go home. Career advancement even one level takes years here. USAA likes their employees over educated and underpaid and since it's just a giant call center the jobs off the phones are few and far between and you will waste half your career just trying to become a team supervisor.
good,"Long standing mission with proven success. However there are still many people that have been there over 25 years, more than 10% of the workforce. Not always open to new thinking and change takes a long time."
good,Great Place to work ideal location for me because its project based you don't have job security. I learned a lot and the management staff was friendly and flexible with work life balence.
good,"I liked working the management, work culture and day to day responsibilities. I would encourage anybody to apply for this company. The most enjoyable part of the job was hanging and taking to my team. I learned so much from them. Highly encourage potential job seekers to go check out the USAA  campus."
good,"Good place to work. Freindly people, management works with you on pretty much everything. Great benefits and pay, recommend"
good,"The benefits and compensation are pretty reasonable but I don't really feel like a claims adjuster as my job title suggests. I spend most of the day answering a phone and either redirecting calls or doing data entry (first notice of loss). It seems incredibly inefficient to have adjusters doing the job of call center employee. There's a reason that other well known insurance carriers don't have adjusters taking calls all day. It seems that when all this growth came they forgot to make necessary changes. Growth is a good thing, but not when you are reactive rather than proactive, which seems to be how they are. When I was first an adjuster, we had time to work our tasks. But that's been traded for non-stop phone calls. They should at least fix the phone system and menus to better route the calls. Additionally, since they are eliminating the initial response unit (iru), there really needs to be a dedicated team that handles inquiries over the phone and that should not be an adjuster. The worst part is that it's hard to advance unless you know the right people. I have applied for many positions in which I was overlooked for. I suppose that actual work experience doesn't get you anything, seeing how I was passed over for a position I already held because i supposedly couldn't answer interview questions well enough. Nevermind the fact that I did the job for 18 months and proved i was plenty capable of it. I think I will be looking for greener pastures elsewhere."
good,I am not unhappy at USAA. I am interested in pursuing a Chief Compliance Officer position at another institution. I feel I have more to offer. I am also not being fairly compensated.
good,USAA offers cutting edge technology to facilitate the process of daily auto claims. One of the leaders in the auto insurance industry have experienced amazing growth which ensures job security. Benefits are second to none along with a free gym on site to assist employees to maintain good health.
good,"good management in motivating employees by fine decision making "
good,"The campus is very nice and are currently going through renovation to make it better for employees. Call center environment can be very tough. Extremely structured environment right down to the minute when you can take breaks and lunch. Facilitating the financial security of our military and their families. Consumer lending department, starting to offer more classes to acquire new skills in your field. Trying to improve work life balance."
good,"Work can be very stressful with an overwhelming number of priorities.  Most units are not adequately staffed.  Those that work hard and do a good job will have more work dumped on them, while those that don't pull their weight will be promoted."
good,CEO just recently changed hands and the company is going to a very sales approach with its business. A typical day is sitting down and taking call after call. The company provides a 35 minute lunch and 2 20 minute breaks. These breaks are scheduled for certain parts of the day which you are expected to take however will not be adjusted if you are on a call longer than you should be. Advancement is based strictly on sales ability and having a high level degree. Your schedule at first will be good but then is based on sales ability followed by tenure. Don't expect 2 days in a row off to start for about the first year or so.
good,you will have 15 to 20 in your pipeline to close out. you have to stay up to date with emails and phone calls. you have to work overtime if you haven't finished your work. no real training when it comes to understanding what the underwriters want as they all work differently.
good,"I had the opportunity to work in many different areas of the company.  I can say that the company has unfortunately changed over the last several years and not for the better.  It has become a large, bureaucratic organization with way too many managers and not enough people to actually do the work.  Some areas of the company, because of great leaders and managers, were excellent places to work, while others, because of inept managers who were bent on self promotion, were absolute nightmares.  It all depends upon the character of the individuals who are running a particular area, and if  you're lucky,  you will love it.  If not, you can try to move out to another area.  The pay is okay, but the company is big on its annual performance and holiday bonuses.  However, if those bonuses weren't included with the base pay, the company would not be competitive with other companies, so it really isn't a ""bonus.""  It's more like a salary deferral program.  The raises are absolutely abysmal.  I would rate USAA very low on that perspective, especially since they are so financially healthy and make a lot of noise about treating employees so well.  Raises don't even keep up with the rate of inflation.  It was overall an okay place to work, but I think that there are lots of others who are just as good and have much better advancement opportunities."
good,"Call center environment with unrealistic expectations on claims handling time.  Less than compassionate treatment from most managers.  But, the benefits are stellar and their time off policy is quite good."
good,"Once you work your way through the ranks, it's a great place to work.    You have to be willing to put in your time on the phones."
good,"Was a good job however, I found it hard to be bound to a cubicle for 10 hours a day.  Your breaks and lunches are monitored every minute of the day which was a bit annoying.  And sales were based on transferred calls not actual hard sales.  This created an environment of skewed numbers as associates would just transfer calls without consent."
good,The pay and benefits are good but they expect you to have ridiculous standards when you are on the phones.  It is very political and managers aren't trained in the area that they manage.  Very micro-managed.
good,"Work u do at USAA has a technical scope as long as u work in a development project, but when it comes to maintenance and production support, life becomes miserable though you end up doing technically nothing. Managers are NOT employee friendly. your career aspirations won't be considered at all."
good,"A typical day involves being active and engaged in a high-volume call center. The most interesting aspect of what I learned centered around the specifics of the various insurance contracts we wrote. Management and co-workers work toward satisfying the membership of USAA. The hardest part about the job, which is really why I'm looking for something different, is the commute. Most enjoyable part is working on a team with a common and positive goal."
good,Typical work day constantly training staff and processors. Management is constantly trying seeking to push you to do more. Co-Workers are friendly.
good,"I have worked here for almost 2 years. I stated before I was hired that I was not interested in a sales position or upselling. I was told it was not however after moving half way across the country for the job first week I hear drink the kook aid and get told there is definitely sales though they call it deepening the relationship.  This work consists of leading a conversation to have the member tell a rep about events in their life so they can refer other products.  If the member does not let you transfer the call for the new product the rep takes a hit. They also have to meet a sales metric called business results.  Weekly coaching is literally how you can sell better.  It is a micromanaged existence and not easy to get out of as getting time off is impossible. You must look at a calendar 14 months out see if days are available and attempt to get what you will need off. No one really cares about you advancing either unless your sales metric is perfect. Also schedule bidding is mandatory annually. It is difficult to handle having to shift schedules and not knowing for a month what you will have to do to change your life, ie your shift may include a working Saturday which can interfere with daycare. single parents beware."
good,a typical day for me on the job is pretty much 100% of my time on my computers. I learned all types of Microsoft application along with other data bases. My co-workers along with management are well of great independent workers. As far as hardest part of my job there isn't one.
good,"Keep a few things in mind when reading this review: this was my first job after 6 years in the military, I am extremely motivated by my own personal performance, I am an Auto Adjuster so my comments only apply to my role as it is all I can speak to."
good,"USAA if a fantastic company as a whole. They take very good care of their employees. Great training, and continued education programs. You either make it or you don't. You're either tough enough to take the stress and pressure, or you're not. People who were in training from my group are either thriving or they have quit with serious health issues."
good,Goo work life balance and able to utilize my skills in dealing with the issues. Able to learn new technologies and tools. Team members are very interactive in discussing the issues
good,This was a challenging but pleasant assignment. Assisting with building a new worship center from the ground up was rewarding both professionally and personally
good,Was a very busy office.  Handled multiple files from underwriters to get files to closing
good,As Senior processor you stay very busy with pipeline management assisting processors with the files.  The changes they are making to the mortgage department make it feel more like a call center which is challenging in the mortgage industry.  The satisfying part of the job is getting loans closed and helping members refinance or purchase their home.
good,Call center environment with great benefits. Not much flexibility with scheduling time off.
good,I learned a lot working with USAA definitely a lot of opportunity to grow and help those that protect our freedom
good,"It starts with checking voicemails from inquiries of claimants/members, checking and reviewing e-mails, and then start working on claims. Assisting member on state regulations and assisting with our SIU department as well as our salvage department almost daily to help move claims forward in the finalizing process."
good,Call center work.  Very regimented and demanding.  Highly managed without a lot of opportunity to promote.
good,i worked here for almost a year and sincerely the treatment i received from my co workers was awesome but when it came to my managers -.-. It was not so great. The expectations can be reasonable but your manager will most likely never be around to answer any questions. Insurance is not easy because you can never really give a yes or no answer. My trainer was not very helpful he had an attitude about everything and would talk really ugly to me. Also I asked many times if there was any thing i could do to switch to part time and my manager always said no however my neighbor who was with a completely diff manager was given the opportunity to work part time for last few months of employment needless to say we had the same exact seniority and our stats were the same. It's sad to say but treatment is not fair at all. I loved the environment but I needed my education more.
good,"At first I loved USAA. I loved what the company was all about, and they are truly all about the members. I worked there from August 2013 until February 2014. It got really old being on the phones all the time, the job was incredibly repetitious and I could not get motivated to go to work after awhile. My wife started working in December and in February she was fired because she failed her call certification by 1 percentage point. They would not round the number up, even though her instructor rounded up two other worker's calls up to make sure they passed. They told her that she could fight it and she could get her job back, but she did not. I ended up quitting the next day due to how it was all handled and how I then saw the company. "
good,USAA is a good company to work for however management needs alot of improving. The entire organization believes in mirco-managing which is what lead to my decision to leave the company.
good,I was able to use my CSR skills and add the new knowledge of Property and Casualty insurance.
good,"USAA is a diversified financial services group of companies] which includes a Texas Department of Insurance regulated unincorporated, reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and a Fortune 500 financial services company offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military."
good,"team work, team player, willing to assist and learn new things"
good,learned about insurance and working in a fast paced environment. 
good,good.very good artifacts. Very strong IT infrastructure. Very secured environment
good,This is a great company to work for with amazing benefits. The hardest part about the job is being on the phone all day and actually getting an opportunity to move around to different positions throughout the company.
good,"Updated agents schedules, and worked for the call center."
good,"Call center support, and updated agents schedules accordingly."
good,Little room for error. Very strict company to work for. Some of the management and executives are very hard to work for.
good,"Very flexible company, great peer workers and reasonal tasks."
good,USAA is a great place to work for but didnt enjoy sitting at a desk all day taking phone calls.
good,Okay place to work but must be ready to stay on the phone all day and not move.
good,"This company definitely serves its members (military); however, depending on where you work and the management you work for can determine whether you have a successful and developing career or one that you grow to dislike and only stay at for the benefits"
good,"Delivered difficult messages with empathy and professionalism while striving to maintain the financial security of USAA and our members. •	Deepened member relationships via phone conversations that focus on knowing, understanding, and providing appropriate solutions to membership."
good,"Tons of change in claims and they don't seem to keep the employee in mind. The mission, members, and direct managers are great but the workload is not manageable at 40 hrs. OT is the only way and after months, everyone is burned out. It's sad. Even with holiday and annual bonus we're paid less than the industry standard."
good,Usaa is a good company but if you are a go getter and want to be eventually fairly compensated forget it. If your motivated by money and raises do not apply.
good,"Like the US military in so many ways, the mission is good but the work is more than 100% of what good people can do."
good,"I was told my first year that there's no  moving to another department once you're hired. I didn't believe it, but it's true. There's no opportunity to try out a job in another department, such as claims. I have no desire to advance in my current position because it would mean a lot more work and stress for very little money."
good,USAA has some great opportunities to build and grow in your personal career. It has great benefits and allows for a good work life balance............
good,"Pros:"
good,"Legitimately good intentions and real attempts to always do the right thing, to strongly live up to the great brand reputation, to be true to the company's strict mission and its members. But its all becoming a sadly hollow effort fast as risk & compliance initiatives have required rapid and extensive hiring in of leaders and senior or mid-managers from other large banks and financial institutions. Many of these new joiners are essentially rejects or force-outs from their prior employers and/or are completely not fitted, or fittable, to the USAA ""way"". They all know each other in some kind of big bank compliance musical chairs network too. Many have also managed to somehow negotiate titles and seniority levels at USAAA way above what they held prior at other employers. USAA's recruiting function seems too sheltered, inexperienced to accurately benchmark titles and seniority, skills levels. And the existing USAA management lifers and many legacy staff in risk & compliance are sweet, earnest and frankly completely under-skilled, over-titled, under-exposed to a concerning degree. They are overwhelmed and the new managers from outside are steamrollng them. The workloads are incredible right now and the stress levels, in fighting are higher than I've ever experienced anywhere in prior, difficult roles. I hope USAA can settle the waves."
good,"Whether you’re trying to impress a date or your professor or your friends, these 50 cool Latin words will definitely give you the edge you need in your next conversation, term paper, or text, making you sound a lot smarter than you probably are."
good,"Working at USAA for frontline employees is 90% on the phones helping to serve the members who make up USAA.  There are weekly meetings and mostly online trainings the help with yearly compliance.  Not much training to improve your skills that are schedule during the work day but USAA does have several different options to improve your professional skills like Skillsoft trainings, Management training courses and Ed Assist for continuing education that can be utilized on an employees free time."
good,"Eh, this job has truly made and broken me for better and worse. The stress is definitely there and I struggle on the daily. It's an office-like call center."
good,This job is good but flexibility is not there. They also give youvacation days but you can not use them when you want. You have to schedule vacation time around others with seniority.
good,"Not very flexible with schedules, they have good benefits and ok pay, have a very long training course. State they are behavior focused but have a strong tendency to focus on numbers also."
good,"Promotions based on favoritism instead of experience and knowledge of doing the job.  Management lives in a glass bubble and only interested in promoting themselves, not the customers or employee input to make the company better."
good,"I am speaking specifically to the Claims environment as I am only familiar with this department. If you are applying at a management level your experience may be different. If you are entry level, fresh out of college I would recommend an entry level roll with USAA to get started in your career, though only temporarily. It is difficult to advance, communication is limited, and the environment is fast paced and stressful. Workload is high, overtime is necessary, and salary pay is low for industry standards.The benefits are good, and there is decent PTO, and assistance with continued education but overall it does not adequately make up for the low pay, high stress, necessary overtime, and issues of work/life balance. I would not recommend this particular department as a long term career path."
good,"People who work on the phones hate life, people who don't will die for USAA.  They say the phones are a good ""foot in the door"" position  but if you're too good on the phones they don't let you off, if you're bad then they get rid of you.  You gotta find the middle ground."
good,"Really liked the company overall and others have had great experiences. But I can only speak to my own experience. I joined for a summer internship and reported to a poor manager, sadly. Frequently cancelled our meetings, marginalized my work - was a terrible experience. Would hope that others don’t go through my experience."
good,"Felt like the job was a better fit for a tape recorder or robot. If you did not follow their phone script and outline on every call you were out of compliance. Company cared more about selling insurance product for investors, i.e. Annuities and Life Insurance, than finding the right product for the member."
good,Literally physically impossible to get the work done during the day. They kept trying to find work arounds to get us to be more productive when what we really needed was more employees. USAA pay was OK but they used a bonus system they gave out in Feb and made sure to do most of their firing in January. Not nearly as customer centric as the ads would have you believe.
good,It used to be a unique company that was there for the military member and their families. It has changed and is becoming an insurance company like all the rest. It all about the numbers and not taking time with the customer.
good,"Working for USAA has it's benefits, such as health care and 8% 401k match, however it is a very stressful job, like any other call center. Calls are back to back and half the members you speak to are difficult. I didn't like working there and wouldn't recommend it, but you get paid decently and the work environment is pretty neat. There are ping pong tables and massage rooms on certain floors. There's a nice gym and Cafeteria. Óverall, it's a tough job, mentally."
good,Its very difficult to change to another area of the company unless you want to move to management level.  Management level requires more stress than a non management level job.  Whats kept me there is the comfort of bonus'/benefits.
good,Very corporate and sometimes a little dull. The people were nice but it just wasn't a good fit for me. I feel as though my strengths weren't utilized and I wasn't put on many projects.
good,"typical cll center, lots of calls most people are ok to talk to few angry over all its not bad it can become very repetitive same call over and over again"
good,"USAA has amazing benefits and the pay is not bad but the lack of management skills is astounding, it is the sole reason i am choosing to look into other employeement"
good,great work environment to work at. You learn new things everyday management at USAA they how willingness to assist when needed always so helpful. the workplace culture is very diverse so you meet a lot 0of people that are very excited and uplifting in work. I would say the hardest part about the job is moving a up the system of how the move folks up is very hard I would say long wait time to see if you are eligible for the next up position takes a while. the most I enjoy here is the people meeting new folks everyday.
good,"Good Platform to show skills"
good,"Work-life balance is not a thing. Lots of valuable skills were learned in this job, but it will break you down. The managers are pretty great but the leadership above them is so-so. Your voice isn't truly heard."
good,"Before applying, really think about it if you can sit for hours answering back to back calls for hours. Calls include LOTS of billing as well as Insurance-related calls. "
good,I like working for USAA. A good place to work with great benefits. A friendly place to work. The hours are somewhat flexible but overall a good place to work.
good,"It is a great company to work for. Provides great benefits, bonuses and pay. Very high call volume and can be stressful most of the time."
good,"Have enjoyed my experience as a USAA employee, learned ALOT! Came in as an intern within the insurance department.  Worked a 10 week program, plenty of mentoring experiences."
good,"Very committed to provided to the best experiences for its members. Tries to offer appropriate products that are customer specific, not just random sales. Provided excellent employee training and benefits."
good,"The companies strategy, upper management and overall vision of the company is excellent. The uneducated, over paid, inadequately trained management in Colorado Springs is a absolute joke and embarrassment to the company. My Manager put in one of my reviews that I had great hair. The employees are uptight and many are pretentious, which cause a hostile work environment."
good,"Its not like the old USAA, its changing. The benefits are good so that's why a lot of people stay. They are willing to work with you if the like you."
good,"Pretty good place to work. Maybe the work/life could be a tad bit better, but they do a good job making the site feel like home. I do feel they would like to see their employees advance, but opportunities may be limited to type of business. (not many directions an insurance company can explore)"
good,No comment. I will keep it professional. No need to explain something that  might steer someone away from working at USAA. Word of advice...be cognizant of your surroundings.
good,"USAA is a great company to work for. Great benefits, work life balance but I feel like the culture is not for everyone. If you enjoy being in the phone and talking to members for 1hr+ and getting to know them then this is the job for you."
good,The experience was good just wish there was room for permanent position just a temp contract job. Management was knowledgeable on certain info just always hard to find one if needed help
good,"Log in, take inbound and outbound calls for preapprovals, Refinance and purchase applications.  Help with questions and concerns.  Follow up with leads."
good,Good employment opportunity. Really good if you can get in early and grow and develop in the company. Great benefits. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to start a career.
good,"The best thing about USAA is the compensation.  It is quite high.  Once you make it in, they treat you very well.  In particular, the retirement plan is great.  Con:  there tends to be too much corporate cheerleading, and the groupthink can be stifling.  Also, the internal bureaucracy is mind-numbing."
good,"Very busy call center, where do you have time betweens calls. "
good,"Fantastic benefits when I worked there, the management was terrible.  Super high turnover.  I was in a class of 20, when I left after a year I was one of 2 left."
good,"As a Member Service Representative the primary responsibility is directed at inbound call resolution. I had no experience in the insurance world when I was hired, although I had over 10 years of call center customer service.  "
good,Not bad place to work.  Slow advancement.  Which department you work in can be a hindrance to advancement.  Some managers only care about their own career.
good,"USAA fosters a ""good ol' boy"", military minded cutthroat environment. Old military culture leaves room for the ""I've earned my stripes"" it's time to be promoted. A lot of pseudo managers that look or play the part without much substance. There is no strategic direction put into action. Everyday is a ratrace to give management a product or the world will end."
good,"USAA is a great company overall. Financial Planning & Advice is not. Company focuses on directing members to Financial Planning & Advice regardless of why they call in (i.e., I need to pay my auto insurance or homeowner’s insurance, etc). Members are often cold transferred and are asking why they were transferred. Leadership’s response, “Consider all the  calls leads”. It is hard to turn a bad transfer into a financial business relationship when you start off by apologizing. No marketing/advertising is done to create awareness that USAA offers financial services. It feels like leadership is okay with “marketing by misdirected calls”. This is a great place to start (first job out of college) but NOT for experienced advisors. Metrics have increased to unrealistic/achievable numbers based on the quality of calls taken."
good,"We would deal with multiple people one one claim and the procedures where always changing. The job security is great along with the benefits, just do your job."
good,USAA is a good company to work for if you are not a call center employee. The work/life balance is good and they have a strong mission statement that people really follow. Typical day includes a lot of meetings that tend to be over utilized. There is a culture of collaboration which is good but sometimes it takes more time to find all the people that needed in a meeting than it takes to make a decision. I have been in meetings where I invited two people and the meeting was forwarded so many times it ballooned to over 10 people and nothing was accomplished. If you take a job just to get in the door you will struggle moving up quickly because it is very hierarchical. Leadership is great and very open with the direction that the company needs to go. I appreciate the willingness of leaders to mentor and help with internal career development.
good,"USAA inspires a lot of people to do their best work and there are a lot of good, long time employees and managers still working there after more than 20 years."
good,"Great company, low opportunities for advancement. The benefits and schedule flexibility is nice, but if working in the claims department, you are generally stuck there for years."
good,"Great benefits that make it hard to leave.  Unfortunately, the executive team is very political and is more interested in advancing their careers than they are in making the working environment better for their employees.  Tired of not being able to make my own decisions.  Poor manager, tough to take him seriously when he knows so little about the field he is working in.  Really disappointing that they do not give their employees any decision-making authority."
good,"It's a fast-paced call center that supports the military environment. Therefore, don't expect a lot of breaks or time to ""catch up"" - it's an environment that requires you to be strong and do your job. Within that parameter, you'll do great."
good,"Responsible for 16 to 25 multiline sales, service and claims agents. Coached and developed agents in sales techniques, building rapport with purpose. Hired and developed agents."
good,"I enjoyed my short time there. great work culture, but very high turnover. Many of my colleagues were gone in the first 1 or 2 years. On-site cafeteria with several options, but paying with your ID could leave you shocked on payday."
good,"For a prior military member the culture was a good one for me, however, there is not a lot of room for promotion if you're not in the ""club"". Promotion is not based on skill"
good,Pay is reasonable but not enough. They don't take doctor excuses for time miss if your sick. Good starter job for people that wants to get into customer service but not a long term job
good,"USAA is a great company to begin a career, that offer amazing benefits and incentives.  Their problem is with the red tape for promotions.  Recently I was approached for advancement in my department but HR blocked it because I had not been in position for a year.  This has happened before and when my year passes I am settled into a new position but not as good as the one that I was not allowed to take.  I received my bachelors and Masters degree through USAA and they make no effort to keep you after investing in your education."
good,They follow typical client serving model with offshore and onsite teams. So its great place to learn management and team coordination skills. Have offices around the world with client onsite serving teams.
good,"Large organization run a lot like a government entity. It can be very frustrating. However, the great pay and benefits does make up for it a little, and makes it hard to leave."
good,Profitable company that is a little slow to innovate and move forward but they have a large presence in both San Antonio and Phoenix.  They have a very competitive benefits package when compared to the rest of the industry but the pay is a little less than the industry.
good,"It is a great place to work with the utmost concern for taking care of our Military Members' Financial Security.  They strive to provide the work life balance by providing flexible work schedules including giving the opportunity for people to be able to work from home."
good,not very friendly staff and not always helpful. New employees that are not FTE but just temp workers are treated very differently.
good,I love working for those people that have gone above to protect us. This has provided me with a wonderful outlook on life and true service.
good,"Typical day consisted of morning meetings to discuss daily and monthly goals."
good,I enjoyed working for this company but after handling claims for so long I needed something different to do. Working for the company was great I did enjoy what I was doing.
good,"Great Company but it is still a call center at the end of the day, company takes care of you and wants a lot in return. Typical day is call center, 8 to 10 hours a day on the phones, very structured."
good,"Enjoyed my time at USAA only found it hard to advance. Although there is many openings within the company, they base advancement on tenure and not on performance."
good,"Company requires you to upsell their other products. If you're not willing to do it they will write you up. they record your phone calls and then monitor them a couple times a month.   Made my job so miserable thinking about when the next shoe would drop that I just didn't enjoy it after the first two years.  Quit and went to another company. The employees that suck up to management the most will get the most favorable raises and advancement.  Those that produce, stay on the phone longer etc...  they just get the basics."
good,"The benefits are great and so is the pay for the most part.  Everyone looks forward to the yearly bonus more than anything.  At that time, tons of employees who know that this company is not the only option, will quit.  "
good,You are in a call center taking customer requests. You are also required to cross sell products on ever call. The pay and benefits are wonderful.
good,"- Typical day was analyzing contracts and checking eligibility for sub contractors."
good,"I worked for USAA for a couple years.  It is extremely hard to advance within the company.  They constantly hired people from outside the company rather than internally.  It was a call center environment.  It wasn't too bad, but I really wanted to advance my career and after some time with my previous experience, it was like knocking at a dead end."
good,"I learned form USAA , how to really have a conversation with someone and listen to their needs."
good,"I enjoyed being a member of USAA, but working there was difficult."
good,"Since I have already listed what I do at USAA, I wanted to include what brings me peace and joy away from my job."
good,Very focused on providing financial products to the military.
good,Taking 30 to 40 calls a day answering questions and resolving a range of situations. Immediate management is very good to work with however there is huge disconnect with middle to upper management. Co-workers make your job easier and accept you like a family.
good,"If you are not looking for a workplace with a strong culture, don't consider USAA. USAA has a very defined culture and goal, and if you are very good at following guidelines you'll do well."
good,"Lack of communication and lack of consistency with policy and procedure.  The culture has become too much of a sales focused environment and the mission to serve the members seems to be less of a priority than it should be.  The culture at USAA changed for the worse while I was there, which was disappointing, as the company offers great benefits and compensation.  Starting pay is lower than most call centers, but you move up in pay quickly"
good,"I love the company itself.  But it is like russian roulette with management.  You never know what you are going to get.  One can love you and share the same work ethic and the next could be completely opposite.  Its seemed to change over the years to all about numbers.  Loss of service. "
good,The place is huge and contains a lot of items on the business that help to make long hours working comfortable for all employees. The benefits and pay are decent.
good,Hard to get things done. Management will agree to one thing then do another get it all in emails. Never take someones verbal word. Teams collaborate pretty well everyone seems to buy into the philosophy. Don't be a contractor.
good,"Its all fun and games until you get on the phones. A typical day is just that: typical. You are a glorified customer service representative who happens to be licensed. Its back to back calls, sifting through online ops manuals for the answer on what is acceptable USAA procedure, state and federal compliance, and maintaining call flow and sales metrics which they call ""solutions"" (Wells Fargo anyone?). You never get to build rapport with members and it almost doesn't matter because they think you're just some CSR; not an actual agent. Don't get me wrong, the campus is beautiful and there are so many benefits to working there but at the end of the day it's not enough to make someone stay. Its very difficult to advance and favoritism is rampant. So many employees not only have 1 degree but multiple and even masters degrees;they still don't advance. Honestly, the job isn't difficult; but the antiquated billing system ( yeah you also handle billing), outdated training materials, and lack of involvement from management is enough for me to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"I have been there three months and they have changed policies multiple times already. While it is a great company, I don't agree with some of their policies."
good,We were so busy I hardly got to know the people that sat around me. The breaks were timed and too short to get to enjoy it. Worked long hours but didn't feel like you knew the people you worked with since it was always go go go.
good,"I worked for the company for many years and enjoyed amazing managers and life long friendships. The membership was also great. The pay was decent. The campus was spectacular! I think too much emphasis is placed on the performance bonus rather than the salary overall. I ended up leaving because I couldn't get promoted off of the phones. Unfortunately, the culture doesn't provide many opportunities for advancement for non-phone work. While there are exceptional educational resources given to better yourself (if you know what you want to do), once you find a non-phone position, there are so many people applying for them. It will come down to who you know. There aren't that many networking opportunities either. If I had the opportunity to repeat my situation, I would take career/personality tests earlier in my career, like strengthsfinder(Rath) or DISC to determine or narrow down your likes and possible careers.Maybe if you can afford a life coach, start there. Then take full advantage of their education benefits. I had a co-worker who's working on his doctorate."
good,Excellent benefits. Management talks about team work but often wants the individual to only look out for self. Culture is very customer oriented. Most enjoyable thing is helping people.
good,"Very Nice work environment. No dress Code at USAA, you are free to wear any type of clothes.the management of this work were also friendly. The team in USAA are very small which helps everybody to coordinate."
good,"Fun place to work, but ""advisor"" means sales.  I was a licensed insurance agent but expected to cross sell all other products USAA offers.  If a customer called to add a car to a policy, we needed to offer loans and car buying service."
good,do your job or get fired usaa only cares about making money now that the new ceo took over the only way to move up is to kiss major butt there are managers who walk around all day and i have no idea what there doing
good,"This company is trying to find its place in a changing regulatory environment while maintaining and online financial services platform. "
good,"If your used to a relaxed work environment, this career is not for you. I was not used to working in a call center and didn't like it. I quit because once your an auto adjuster you can only move up in other call center positions."
good,USAA great company to work for. High level busy job however the company always did things for the employees feeding and providing for families that was affected in the storms. Typical day at work involved research and reviewing the accuracy of documentation for home approvals.
good,"Strong and growing company with noble and proud mission. Unfortunately, the customer contact workforce is generally undervalued in pay and professional treatment considering the certification and job requirements."
good,"Great company, great benefits. Employees and management are wonderful to work with. A lot of opportunity for advancement, but only in the insurance claims department. Not a lot of opportunities for employees to branch out of the call-center portion of the company. Unfortunately, to get to your desired career field, you might have to look elsewhere."
good,"Very busy day in my department, management provided employees with constant training classes to improve job performance within your department.  Friendly staff, nice work place."
good,"My typical day began  by logging in before work to clean up and respond to emails. I learned a lot about Agile project teams while in my last position. Management was extremely busy constantly in meetings during the day. The hardest part of my job was trying to squeeze in time with my Executives to go over calendars, schedules, etc. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the teams I supported and  helping them on a daily basis."
good,"Great place to work to start out.  The biggest obstacle is the Colorado Springs office has no opportunities outside of the call center.  Best to be in San Antonio, unless you want to spend your life on the phones."
good,"USAA is a great company to be a member of, but as an employee things are different.  Managers are promoted due to their ability to succeed in sales, but not based on their leadership ability.  Most managers are soldiers ordered to micro manage and do not know how to develop or care for employees.  USAA Phx needs a major re-haul in front-line managers and first level directors.  Unfortunately, favoritism and the good ol' boys club has taken over."
good,Went from investment expert to expert in nothing.....great company just not much of an investment focus. You do everything but what you were hired to do. Not much room for career growth
good,"My happiness was not worth $40,000 a year.  This job drained me mentally and tested my patience regularly. After 2 short years, I could no longer deal.  Some people have lasted many years but it is very cut throat to get to the top.  Lots of backstabbing and regardless of how much time you have given them they will forget you in a heartbeat.  "
good,"Worked on computers daily, assisted insureds properly, advised on insurance needs. USAA is great at helping you build experience and helping you learn from where you are at."
good,"I managed numerous processes over the last 8 years of leadership at  USAA"
good,"This company has a lot to offer its employees, however, there is no free lunch.  Their process is to ask ""high capital questions"" as they call if which is a fancy way of probing into the member's personal circumstances.  If a member is calling to add or delete a car they really don't want to talk about their finances or their kids college. The whole thing here to have all the ""eggs in one basket"" so to speak. They want you to ask very invasive questions that I was not comfortable with. This led to me hating the training which resulted in my separation from this company.  I left a position to work for USAA because I have a huge respect for the military community.  I still have that same respect for the military but was really disappointed with this company."
good,"As call centers go, I suppose this one wasn't all that bad. Management was competent and helpful, and there's an environment of teamwork and everybody helps everybody out, and the PTO policy was very nice. However, it is an extremely fast-paced and stressful position, and clock ins and outs were to be taken down to the minute (which at a call center is pretty hard). You definitely have to be on the phone 99.9% of your shift, on top of filing your own paperwork. Worth it if you need good benefits, and if you don't mind a very involved and stressful call center position."
good,"Great benefits, but constant changes lead to instability.  Company has an awesome mission and is exclusive to military members and their families.  Great tuition assistance program"
good,An insurance and banking company with great benefits. It is a private corporation that caters and markets to a specific audience. They operate like most large corporations in the same industries.
good,"I had to quit, every day I went to work it stole a little of my soul.  If you don't mind being tethered to a computer with a headset for hours at a time it might be for you."
good,"The job was great. Very good benefits and perks. A lot of free food provided for holidays and military holidays, brand new gym for free, child care on site. Nice members but always busy."
good,"Good Company to work. Compensation is less, They are hiring seniors as middle level developers that is not the right choice for people who wants to grow in their carrier growth. Benefits are good for full time employees."
good,"Pay was somewhat competive but not as much as other companies.  The benefits I would have to rate as 5 out of 5.  Management is completly incompetient at all levels.  Advancement has zero to do with what you know, but rather, who you know."
good,"I enjoyed USAA and would have never left if I could have moved to a different department. The pay is very low throughout the year compared to the amount of work and responsibilities and industry rate. Benefits are amazing, but they use that to justify the low pay, stress and workload. If the pay was higher, it would be justified, but people have to be able to afford to live and pay bills and save, etc. Great for a high school graduate, or management to upper management. As I was told just after I finished training ""If you're talking on the phones, your not making money"" and they hired too many people at my position, so the OT wasn't there. Great company to grow with if you can do the call center environment and are able to start off with lower pay and work your way up."
good,"Key advisor within the vendor management team for the USAA enterprise. Engages third party suppliers for market trends, tools, and new solutions for USAA. Facilitates vendor presentations for internal senior executives and identifies innovative solutions. Serves as a point of contact for contract negotiations and third party supplier escalations."
good,"As a mortgage processor worked with individuals and families that had applied for mortgages for new homes."
good,If you like working inbound phone calls take a look here. The work space is amazing nice large desks double over sized monitors and not too crowded. Even with company growth advancement and cross department movement (getting off the phones) seems slow except in San Antonio the company HQ. Contact centers are micro managed but call handle time not normally an issue. Best part every once in a while because of the membership base you will talk to some one that has some really amazing stories.
good,"excellent benefit package, daycare on site for working parents"
good,"Fast paced, I have not worked there in quite a while. I hear that it's not like it used to be. Not as nice or easy going."
good,"Great benefits, stressful environment, not enough pay for the work required. The members we served were wonderful and I loved my job for a very long time."
good,At the job one is mainly on the phone advising members about their financial issues and concerns. It is also required by the employer to offer other products within the organization to the member with the sole purpose of handling all financial aspects of members and their families. Its was always nice to see the savings provided to the member when you are able get them to advise them in different aspects of their financial tree.. or even lead them in the right direction
good,"Very dedicated company that strongly believes in serving themilitarycommunity. Puts a lot into training, excellent company but if you've never worked in a call center this is a huge adjustment."
good,If you work hard you are rewarded...Mgmnt is ok...Good work ethics...Ok to work for...Great benefits
good,"Tbe job had great pay and amazing benefits. There are 2 bonuses a year. There is always employee appreciation gatherings."
good,"This is a sales job. You are helping customers, but at the end of the day, it is all about your numbers. "
good,"I learned a lot. I grew as an employee. I loved the department I worked in, however It is very difficult to move out of the department and advance and compared to the salaries of other professionals in my field make a much higher salary."
good,"USAA  is an amazing company and cares about its members. It is a call center so it is very high stress and costumer service IS sales. If you don't mind a call center, it's a great place to work."
good,Great for someone that is looking to advance in their financial services career. Recommend this company to anyone that is looking for a stable work environment and opportunity to grow and build their resume.
good,"Working for USAA for a year was Great.! Loved the over time and I also love the enviourment working there. "
good,"Great company, great benefits,  company culture is amazing, fast paced, busy call center.  Opportunity to advance but very selective in who they promote.  Networking is important to upper management when promoting."
good,This company is very generous to their employees and makes sure to always be there for them and they have excellent facilities for them too
good,"Company is great with values, benefits and compensation.  Typical call center job.  Customers are military and can be a little hot headed.  Overall it is a good place to work."
good,I recently ended my employment with USAA after several years of service in the claims department.
good,If you dont mind staying attached to a desk all day answering phones. then you will not have a problem with this company. They are pretty loyal and the pay is good.
good,"I took back to back phone calls, it was a call center environment serving military members and families. I learned a lot about insurance and legalities behind it, the last management experience I had was not the best. The culture catered to the military and it got a little  stressful with the high call volume. I did enjoy the benefits."
good,"USAA is definitely a place that is more focused on tenure vs performance. It is very hard to advance because the company is very saturated and not enough growth opportunity. The benefits are great and so is work life balance. It's not a company that you will efficiently keep up with the crazy cost of living rise that's been occurring in San Antonio. It's the perfect place if income is not a selling point because you will make enough to get by, but it's not a place that you're gonna live comfortable any time soon unless you're single. The bonus is a good perk, however, if you really looked at your salary. You're living off less and getting a lump sum at the end of the year. I've always felt that the bonus should be optional rather than making less than 40k then getting a lump sum at the end of the year that is very highly taxed."
good,Management is not very knowledgeable and are hired based on a good presentation rather than skill set. USAA is a little behind as far as a mortgage company goes.
good,This is a good company to work for if you are willing to work in a high-stress environment. This is a call center and you are expected to meet certain quotas and sell even though they do not disclose that in your job description. Expectations are very high for employees.
good,great company - high expectations to perform at top results- micro managed- very political- poor work life balance- great training - great benefits
good,"USAA really took care of their employees but the call center environment was not for me. The work itself was great and rewarding, but the call center is just not for me."
good,"The company is great, as well as the culture. Almost everyone is very warm and welcoming. Whenever there is an issue there is always some willing to help out."
good,"I love the culture of USAA, the only reason I gave the job itself a lower rating is because of the high volume of calls. "
good,"From the perspective of an employer this company is fantastic.  Co- Workers are competent and licensed representatives. There is high morale and people are generally happy to be there.  However, it does require that an employee be a type of person who is accustomed to or at least comfortable with being in a call center environment.  This is a difficult adjustment for me as I am most comfortable with file ownership and a sense of individual responsibility as opposed to minute contribution to mass effort created in such an enormous phone bank.  I do want to comment that my numbers as they are measured by the established metrics within this environment are much higher than my peer average and I am succeeding in the occupation greatly.  I do take pride of ownership in all I do so I strive to be the best I can be.  "
good,I worked for USAA for 15 years.  They support the military but are not a government/military/civ contract company.  They are passionate about the military and very understanding of work adjustments because of deployments/PCS.  It is a sales job no matter what department you work in unless it's IT.
good,Has a lot of growth to do in developmental areas of each department. Need more flexibility with schedules and working parents. Should allow more work from home positions.
good,"Really busy, fast paced, lots of compliance working for a bank but the days go by fast.  I don't know what more I can say, if you want a good paying job go there"
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"promotions only come around once in a while. The pay is mediocre.  Management is micro-managed from upper managed.  Really depends on the team, line of business and your manager.  the gym was nice."
good,It is a wonderful company with great values and  benefits it is a pleasure to serve the military community and their families there is a lot of room for growth
good,"USAA in general is a great place to work.  The EMM area was a disaster with extremely poor management and vision for the future.  A lot of perks for employees, benefits were excellent.  Claimed to give work/life balance but it was not true depending on a managers whim."
good,"I was a temp. employee, I didn't have any benefits or paid time off.  The staff was very friendly.  I was assigned to USAA and it's important to know that as a temp as USAA you are treated as so."
good,"OK benefits, unrealistic metrics, andvancement within company very difficult, disconnect between management and agents, inconsistent training in regards to current procedures and updates"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of me receiving a pipeline of Title Commitments, I had to work them by reviewing them making sure they were all accurate as far as names addresses and types of loans, I either approved them or conditioned the processor for other items needed by the borrower at the time in order to approve and close the loan."
good,i loved it i wish i couldve stayed with the company but they couldnt pay us all
good,The benefits offered at USAA are  excellent however it’s a call center which is stressful and staff are micromanaged. Advancement and consistency are lacking.
good,Manager was a statistician in charge of an IT service desk.  His priority was increasing the volume of calls not ensuring the customers issues were handled at first level.
good,"Good company, good members. Training is very much a strong point of the company.  Multiple opportunities to volunteer for important team roles. Very active in the community."
good,Great people to work with and they do care about the customers/members.  The pay and benefits were great but the work was very stressful with all of the added requirements from management which makes it extremely stressful.
good,"The company has a wonderful mission and the people are nice. My job as an insurance agent in a call center, is less than ideal. I am a creative type and being tethered to a phone is stifling to my skills, despite being great at my job."
good,Great platform to learn new things. There are lot of opportunities and people are motivated to aspire their work and overall it helps to maintain perfect work-life balance.
good,Great company but pay is low and in order to retain top talent they need to increase pay. Their underwriting standards are not comparable to competitive companies. AVP are open minded to staff opinions. Needed more remote opportunities. Benefits are good. Management micromanage not a positive factor for individuals that are self starters
good,USAA was an amazing place to work; the mission of going above and beyond for our military community was what motivated me to feel like going to work to help in any way I could to support our military and all members of USAA.
good,"Typical call center environment."
good,"Due to recent Be a Compliant Company shift, they have become petty and increasingly stringent on all job roles. It is a great company to work for, and I would recommend anyone to work there. If you work on the phones be prepared for extreme scrutiny of all aspects of your job role."
good,"I started with excitement, but over the years the micromanagement and lack of  advancement prevents folks that hasn't gained favor from being promoted."
good,Started off as a great work environment but changed with the management. Did not get any support in the later years and was setting unreasonable expectations.
good,This was a great environment to learn many different aspects of IT from level one to level three. I was able to work with a variety of systems including hands on technical work and remote troubleshooting.
good,"USAA has wonderful benefits and great people, the culture is customer service first, and my part was the invisible behind the scenes troubleshooting and fixing software or hardware issues. I worked with some of the smartest and most collaborative individuals in the business,"
good,USAA is a great company to work for if you don't work in one of their call centers. If your a mute yes man/maam who likes being micromanaged by power hungry management who does not care what your professional and personal concerns are then this is the place for you!
good,Poor management everyone was new so noone really knew what to the blind leading the blind hard work didnt matter association did......................
good,Every department has to sell products.  It can be difficult to ask someone about life insurance or a teen bank account when they are calling to report a auto accident.
good,"typical day, i come in and take calls and perform basic IT troublshooting for USAA and contracted employees"
good,"Politics, politics, politics. If you don't know how to schmooze, don't take a job here. Managers are given far too much power and authority to micromanage and dictate the climate for Teams."
good,"Extremely stressful, high pressure atmosphere"
good,"Great benefits. Heavy non stop back to back calls which made the day go by fast. Discounted healthy meals, plenary of perks, and lots of fun people to work with."
good,"The process of getting things done is very slow."
good,If you work for USAA make sure you are at the home office...you have a better chance of both training and opportunity for advancement.  Benefits are amazing!
good,"Very casual workplace.  Very secure work environment.  Weekly games, drawings and cookouts for employees.  Very customer focused, always aim to make the customer happy."
good,"The pay as a contractor was good, however, job security is low.  I worked there for only a few months and the manager decided to cut its contractors. I would not work there again as a contractor."
good,"This company has it's pros and cons as with all jobs; however, I would suggest working here if you have some military background as it takes a certain kind of person to really relate and can understand the POV of the members that are being served. "
good,Entry level position - taking phone calls everyday and they are typically back to back phone calls. Depends on what department you are in will determine how much calls you receive.
good,Very stressful job and the demand is high. As an employee you are just a number. The work is never ending and you're not compensated fairly based off the demand of your job.
good,"I worked in the fraud department. This position was interesting enough to keep you awake."
good,"In theory USAA seems like a great company, but there is a hidden culture of non-transparency. The mission was to facilitate the financial security of it's members by providing a full provision of financial products and services. They always preached we are not a sales company, but you were evaluated on your sales numbers. The initiatives changed every year, hard to adjust to what you were being evaluated on. Then when company was fined for banking violations sales metrics changed to reps being evaluated for compliance and technical."
good,"USAA as a company is wonderful.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to advance.  Within the year that I was hired, there were another 1000 new hires in the same position.  Also, they tie the annual bonus into your pay.  It is nice getting a 16 1/2% bonus, but it is once a year.  I would have preferred for the amount to be spread throughout the year onto each paycheck.  They will tell you that you are making $44,000.00 annually when you are really only making $37,000.00"
good,The benefits are so small they are almost non existent and you don't qualify for paid time off until January of the following year. So you may end up waiting a very long amount of time. Also their benefits package is by far the worst I have ever seen
good,"The company was good but as a contractor I had no benefits, insurance, paid time off, or any kind of benefits because I was under contract, other then that it was a good job."
good,"USAA is still one of the best insurance companies out there.  The work culture though, has changed so much over the years.  Managers are under pressure to have their sales teams make unrealistic goals.  That pressure trickles down, make that pours down."
good,"Fantastic place to start your career, especially if you take advantage of the education benefits. The most successful people I knew at USAA maxed their education benefits, collected as many credentials as possible and leveraged those assets outside of USAA. "
good,Management in positions that should require degrees if subordinates were. Cannot effectively manage your employees if management has less experience and education.
good,"A typical day a USSA consisted of assisting customers in the car insurance needs. It was a fast paced call center environment that provided many services regarding policy concerns, car accidents, potential customers, etc. I thoroughly learned how to access and explain a client's insurance policy as it pertained to their current situation. Management provided several valuable tools that helped me become a very good claims adjuster and customer service representative. The culture was team oriented and a fun place to work. Management and other staff were always willing to help and out and assist whenever they could. The hardest part of the job was having to tell someone that his/her policy can not cover them in their situation. That as difficult news to relay to people at times. I truly enjoyed helping people and seeing them to a solution and also offering further services for future references. I truly enjoyed that aspect of the job."
good,"USAA is a great place to work, if you want to do routine work.  It is not for people who intend to make an impact to the organization.  Management is closed-minded, inflexible and unable to understand statistics.  If you are trying to make an impact, this is not a place for you."
good,USAA themselves has great values that unfortunately Teletech does not stick to. Management is often unwillingly to help you and simply refers you to a workers manual to find all your answers
good,Great place to start when fresh out of college since there is a program to help determine your strong points and they will do their best to find your niche in the company.
good,"USAA is a great company with top notch benefits. A typical day as a Property Field Claims Adjuster is busy interacting with insureds, Public Adjusters, Attorneys, Contractors and Restoration Companies.  I make appointments at the homes of insureds to assess damages, determine coverages, write repair estimates and come to agreement with the parties involved."
good,Company that truly values their employees.  They are attempting to adjust their culture as more business moves to smartphones.
good,"The management is burdensome, over your shoulder all the time, making some suggestions not based on policy but personal opinion on how what when you say to the customer. It is not easy being someone else and some managers did not understand that goals can be accomplished without turning people into clones with no individual thought."
good,A typical day at work consisted of identifying the financial needs of our military families. I completed various duties from opening checking and savings accounts to issuing home and auto insurance policies to processing consumer loan applications.
good,"I appreciate all the opportunity I've had at USAA. I have learned various skills and have unlimited educational opportunities. My biggest issue is work life balance. My job is very demanding in mortgage as we all strive to provide above excellent service. This overtime becomes draining and with the combination of a night shift I cant get out of ... I am just too exhausted to continue school. The military culture is great as we get a chance to serve our veterans!! That personally means alot to me. As far as the office politics--horrible.I wish there was more management that showed a genuine appreciation for the sacrifices we make as employees to provide world class service. I have been to HR too many times for inappropriate behavior that should be common sense things that managers should not do and say. So, I can say the Top Executives are extremely qualified-- though I cannot say the same for lower level managers.You have to fight tooth and nail for every single opportunity.  Nothing will be handed out to you-- which can make you stronger in the end. Once your in, the Seniors are a wealth of knowledge. The pay is above average for San Antonio-- though raises are slim. Again this is a good step if you are looking to finish your degree (tuition assistance) and just have great resume bullets. If you are already skilled at what you do-- get ready to start over and work your way up."
good,"A call center environment"
good,"If you are a follower, USAA is the company to work for. Even as management, you don't lead. A typical workday involves non-stop work with consistent badgering on how to improve. Do you have a lot of great ideas? Keep them to yourself. You will never see any benefit to expressing them at USAA. Your co-workers will be the only people there that are sane. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you have yet another day of work in front of you dealing with the deplorable management. The best part of the job is payday."
good,I have enjoyed working with our Miltary and honoring their service by working closely in their time of need to make it an easier process. However the management inconsistencies have not created a fair work envoironment for many and I am seeking new employment at this time.
good,It was a great job until they downsized and laid us off. I was a loan closer. It was the best job I had and I really enjoyed it. The people I worked with made the job fun.
good,"My typical work day would consist of handling inbound calls and managing delegated administration duties."
good,Working for a company who focuses on the military and our veterans can only be described as a honor. They give so much and being able to help with their financial needs is a great feeling.
good,"USAA is good at making you feel valued, especially early on.  You have to strictly conform to their needs but if you do, you will be rewarded with a steady job, amazing benefits, and a sense of purpose.  If you have to remain independent or think your ideas must be listened to, this is not the place for you."
good,Great place to work with extremely supportive managers and staff. Upper management is very accessible even to entry-level employees. Management takes criticism very seriously and is always working to change for the better.
good,"A typical work day mostly included taking in-bound phone calls from customers reporting property damage. Calls were consistent and there were many opportunities to work overtime during catastrophic events around the country. I enjoyed speaking with customers, building relationships, and putting their minds at ease. Management changed frequently, and they all managed very differently, some with much more stringent requirements than the others, even though all managers were to be consistent."
good,"Most of my day is spent in meetings.  I love the freedom i've been given to develop the people that work for me.  Benefits are great, but they keep getting stripped down.  Politics exist here, as they do everywhere."
good,USAA is a good company to work for. Fast pace for some departments and slow for others. You get great benefits and plenty of paid time off. Starting pay is good but hard to advance in some departments and easy for others.
good,"Love the company. Was/continue to be a member for 20+ years. Great company for those just out of school and want a solid start to a career or with established skills in banking, insurance or investments that can immediately have an impact on the business. Company is so big that positions, by nature, require specialization. Hard to see the big picture or impact of your work. Simply was not the right company/position for me at that point in time. Your results will vary."
good,USAA is a good company I just did not have a good experience.  I have my car insurance with them and the rates are incredible.  It was also a easy drive from my home.
good,"I think this company is a great place to work, the managers I have had, have been fantastic and understanding. I do like the work ethic and ethos of this company. But the part of the company I am working for is not the greatest and there are a lot of changes that are being made that I don't like. I did not like the fact that they changed my job description right after my training. I also don't like the fact I can't go anywhere else in the company, it is almost impossible to get out. Other than that though I do love this company and if I could stay here I would."
good,"I like the job, but not for everyone. Very busy, very compliant. Very metric driven, they say it's not sales but.......? The fellow employees make the job."
good,"If there is an emergency, and you have to leave, chances are you might not have a job. Good pay. And if your sick, they will hand you a bucket, and say, ""get back to work"" no joke it has happened."
good,"Great Pay, Great People, Great Environment. Work/Life Balance was a little hard to manage in the aspect of how in demand workers in my specific department were."
good,Taking incoming calls acting as insurance agent and front-line underwriter and point of contact for active and retired military community around the world as well as their families.  Handles complex billing issues as well as opening bank account for clients contacting USAA after hours.
good,I did not like working in a call center environment but the pay was ok because of the bonus and the benefits couldn't be beat. Plus there was a lot of PTO
good,"Wonderful company where you can do work that you know is making a difference. For salaried employees, compensation and benefits are top of the line. Work/life balance at times non-existent. Management and executives are often caught in internal politics."
good,"Overall, a lot of needed emphasis was placed on productivity. By doing that, it typically resulted in an inferior work product and quality was sometimes sacrificed"
good,Didn’t really like the costumers where rude sometimes and very unprofessional. No one ever knew what they were supposed to be doing when I was in training.
good,Job was ok just the hrs could use a little more work. Management was a little lazy and behind the cue ball and didn’t take opinions well. Needed more raises.
good,Structured workplace with financial incentives. Management changes frequently. Staff is typically well taken care of and is offered opportunities for relaxation during break time.
good,"USAA is for a specific type of employee. It can be exceptionally rewarding and there are tons of perks and many great coworkers and growth opportunities... but you will be micromanaged. Questioning authority or credentials in any way, shape, or form - no matter how apparent the lack of a manager's skill might be in that same area - is strictly a no-no. Just nod your head, do your job, and move up or lateral. I really loved USAA after I assimilated. It's very different but the mission is important and everyone there makes a difference to those that give their everything."
good,USAA is a great place to learn how to be an adjuster and learn how to be a good employee. They have high expectations and teach people how to be a part of a team.
good,"I was in total loss claims. You are expected to do the work of 2 people, for barely the pay of one. While the company is amazing overall, the pay provided is not fair to the amount of work you do. Even though the perks of working at Usaa are awesome, most of the core benefits are middle of the road in my opinion. That being said, I will be eternally grateful for the parental leave Usaa gave me. I was able to bond with my son for 3 whole months! Paid at 100% of my salary! Unfortunately, it is very hard to support my family when I am taking home less than 2k a month supporting 3 people. I would reccomend anyone to give Usaa a chance, but not claims."
good,"Members Rock, teammates rock!!!!"
good,Solid company with strong emphasis on service culture.  Your experience with USAA will largely depend on the individuals you work with because it is such a large company.
good,If you like working inside and a desk and being on the phone all day this is the job for you. The people that work there are nice and you are on a set scheduled that is very maintained to meat the goals.
good,Coding environment is good at the company and they use upcoming technologies and adapt faster. They try to act more like a technology company than a financial institution.
good,"Not a bad company however, you better be ready to be fully committed to the culture and military. PTO was available but you have to schedule in advance before its all gone. Its a full call center life. Everybody is on the phones!!!"
good,"For me it started as a great company over 18 years ago, but it has changed.  The company operates in highly regulated industries (insurance and banking).  As the company has grown it has seen more scrutiny from regulators.  This has put pressure on staff with higher expectations (more work) but management did not increase the staff until recently.  However, I would still recommend USAA overall but just be aware of the stressful job environment."
good,"If youre looking for somewhere to retire this is that place."
good,The most interesting thing about USAA is the never ending client service focus and putting members first. Not all companies have this focus.  I will always remember my days at USAA fondly.
good,"I felt as though USAA was very fair with compensation in terms of benefits and salary combined.  However, I did not feel as though there was enough job security or career advancement based on my level of education."
good,USAA Is a great company to work as a Fulltime Employee. The benefits and opportunities to grow are endless. Management is supportive of new initiatives. I would highly recommend USAA for a fulltime job. The office is centrally located in DFW metro area.
good,"Job offer great benefits.  Management did not have an ""open door"" policy.  You are micro managed from the time you clock in for your shift till the time you clock out.  Try hard to schedule your bathroom breaks during your scheduled breaks, otherwise you will hear the wrath of management as in to why you were not at your seat when they have calls in queue."
good,USAA strives to provide top-notch quality service to all of their members.  Employees are highly trained by the company so as to provide excellent standards to people of the military and their dependents. Highly professional at all times.
good,"I didn't like the call center.  Very focused on referrals to Member Advise and people would get promoted based on how many referrals they would get even if the referral wasn't worthy.  That said, I learned so much at USAA, the training is incredible and very focused on customer service."
good,"The office is amazing, great breakrooms and healthy food options along with a free onsite gym. The daycare facility was incredible and salary was fair."
good,the overall experience was amazing but I wished they paid more for the type of work we were doing. our department were the lowest paid area and for the kind of situations we had to face were not worth the money. Their bonus system is unacceptable.
good,"Good place to work "
good,"USAA is a great employer. Unfortunately their mortgage department is unorganized and devoid of sound structure.  Managers are not trained in coaching,  leadership,  or even trained to perform the job that their employees are tasked with.  This makes it almost impossible to coach,  support,  or assess the proficiency/opportunities in day to day performances"
good,"USAA provides employees a lot of benefits that other firms are not at this time. These include additional PTO, and Paid Paternity Leave. However, USAA does not promote very well within the ranks. AS an employee, I have seen multitudes of skilled employees leave becasue USAA would not promote them. It is easier to get a job at USAA, quit on good terms, and apply for a better job as an external job applicant, than get that job."
good,"Wonderful to work at a company where EVERYONE is aligned on the mission to server members first. You must always prove how what your are doing is going to help the member, or be good for the member,"
good,"Loved working at USAA, but moved after offered a remote position. Networking was strong there, but development is really behind. Still using COBOL lol."
good,"USAA is a great company to work for, the contracting company, not so much. You are treated like a replaceable unit, not a person. There are little to no perks about having the job."
good,"The company seem concerned for it's employees, but there is a strong profit undertone which takes away from feeling truly comfortable. Left to pursue an MBA. Now I'm too qualified to get my job back."
good,"I followed a previous mentor/manager away from USAA mainly because after 17 years there, I was looking for a change.  COmpany is very strong although there were several years 2002-2006 that were difficult as the company went through a cultural change with a new CEO.  During that time, most employees were uncertain of their future there and that was a catalyst for me to look elsewhere.  I believe today that it is back to a something closer to what it was before 2002 but not sure it is that way everywhere.  Either way, it is worth a hard look as the company will be around forever (my opinion) and they have a very solid bonus program for all employees."
good,"Performed basic networking upkeep, to include preventative maintenance, moving POTs and network connections, & adding new lines "
good,Great place too work at has a very good way of showing appreciation for employees once a month with a luncheon. Hardest part is meeting standards as they continually keep rising them.
good,"- Test Scoping, planning, Execution and Report generation of Testing for the business team."
good,Constant in-bound and out-bound phone calls relating to auto claims. Management is well trained in coaching and mentoring their employees. The hardest part of the job is the high call volume.
good,I'm a Contractor for a Fraud Analyst. I do data entry work for the back office. I review members accounts that has been reported fraud and make the corrections to their accounts.
good,"Great company to be a part of where Member satisfaction is the drive that employees strived for.  From the moment you took the first call of the day, to your last, the pace was very quick and demanding.  Active listening and attention to detail were critical and drove me to excell in all aspects of Member satisfaction."
good,"Awesome workplace with great benefits! "
good,Its a great place to work. The members that call in are all military personnel and are all very easy going which made the job easier.
good,"No esperes home office... nunca, tampoco cambiarte de área ni subir de puesto. Estabilidad laboral alta y buen salario aunque hay mucha rotación probablemente por aburrimiento ya que contratan level 3 pero hacemos labor de level 1 o 2 cuando mucho."
good,"Very few companies care for their overall mission like this one. Definitely a gratifying and challenging place to work. Most employees are placed in a call center environment, which can prove to be a challenge for those who prefer a more physical human interaction from day-to-day."
good,"Leadership can be lacking at times, does not give full direction in projects, and can create poor communication. Overall great company to work for, specific jobs require a lot of self motivation while others are guided."
good,"Very structured company, learned to work loans in a efficient manner and enjoyed working for the veterans of the military. Hardest part of the job is working in San Antonio..."
good,USAA FSB is a part of the USAA conglomerate. The benefits and the pay are comparable to most Fortune 500 companies. Some opportunities exist with the culture of the Bank and the leadership within but overall a good company.
good,"rush through claims work on a steady telephone que that is on going throughout the day. "
good,"Call center atmosphere was not for me, but company did provide generous training.  Lunches were short, but break rooms were nice."
good,"Strong mission, good co-worker environment, good support system from co-workers and management, excellent benefits."
good,"USAA is centered around the military.  In your first two weeks you are drilled to respect military, be respectful at all time, the military members are God.  Most of the time there were no issues, but every now and then the wife of a retired Major or General would call in and have an issue, be very rude or disrespectful, and you were expected to deal with it.  The benefits were great with the holiday bonus and also the merit bonus."
good,"-  The hardest part of my job was calling members back to back on a dialing system, with the majority of them upset they were recieving phone calls. Often screaming and yelling"
good,"With broad experience in a truly enterprise IT environment, I am a proven leader in many aspects of executing large scale, multi-million dollar IT projects.  At a high level, my experience and expertise includes:"
good,"Great benefits, high rate of pay, very nice bonuses and paid time off. High call volumes, expect more from their employees than most other insurers. Weekly call reviews that have you feel somewhat discouraged and that no matter how well you provide quality service to a member they want you to look at every opportunity available to sell additional products even when you have no business or expertise in the products they want you to sell (i.e. offering financial planning services, banking products, life/health insurance etc. when you are solely licensed for P&C products). This creates a very stressful work environment."
good,"USAA is a nice place to work.  Friendly coworkers, excellent benefits, ability to work from home."
good,"Team environment with small teams, a lot team participation and support. Great benefits and campus."
good,"Great reputation and community involvement.  Excellent place to work if you're not in the call center."
good,"I have involved in Development Activity, Team Handling and Delivery"
good,I gained an incredible amount of skill and knowledge. However management was not focused on the job and spent time on numbers and nit picking the quota items rather then the true member service experience.
good,Taking inbound calls from members regarding their policy's. Members can get personal article floaters and renters insurance in addition to their auto. Each team has a lead or supervisor who work individually or as a team if required. It can be difficult to let someone know their accident is not covered.  It so rewarding to let someone know they have insurance to cover a loss.
good,Great company to work for. Co-workers are always friendly. Call center environment and strict work schedule.
good,"providing exceptional customer service to the members"
good,"USAA is a great company to be a customer of, but not so much an employee of."
good,"An eight (8) hour shift consisted of continous in coming calls for claims."
good,High stress sales environment - sales expectation matrix not revealed in hiring interview process
good,The organization focuses on member satisfaction and employee satisfaction. Opportunity for growth and advancement are scarce.
good,"good job, low stress, not very easy to move to different departments"
good,Good stable company with great loyal memberss. They treat their employees fairly and have great benefits. Very good retirement benefits which include matching 401k and health insurance.
good,great office environment with a focus on doing what is right for the customer
good,Please see USAA's reviews online. This provides a greater overall picture of the wonderful company and opportunities that USAA affords its employees.
good,I am unable to judge the work atmosphere in depth as I was on contract only. Most managers are pleasant with a good understanding of what work is required.
good,During a typical day I processed visitors and employees on to the campus. The work day was 12 hours long and a mix of working outside and in the building depending on the day. I learned how to work in an admin setting by working in the admin office on my days off. The management team was constantly changing so you never had an established leader. Everyone who came in to the management position tried to change things and caused to much confusion. No one really set a clear outline on what we really did and what was expected of us. The hardest part of the job was trying to advance which was something that never really happened. Internal jobs were not offered inhouse and always considered to for incoming hires only. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with other employees and the 3 day work week.
good,"USAA has three cafeterias, Starbucks on-site, three fitness centers and Medical, Dental, Vision insurance."
good,"The hardest part of this job was that it was a seasonal position with the possibility of being hired on full-time. No one knew the chances of us getting hired on full-time, so there wasn't much of a feeling of job security. The management team assigned to us wasn't helpful either, it seemed they would rather see us fail than move along with the company."
good,"Typical day of work included taking calls in the wire transfer department. Making sure the funds made it successfully to the receiving financial institution domestically. The micro-managing style atmosphere makes it feel like someone is always looking over you. Making it a little uncomfortable. Hardest part of the job was the attention to detail that was needed for each transfer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks, which I used to play ping pong."
good,"great place to work, management was the downfall, good pay. Stressful environment at times, busy on the phones, if you can handle micro managing and being on the phone all day this is a great job"
good,Great company however they do lay offs. Was great while I was there and benefits are good. People and management are understandable and very nice. Wish was still there
good,USAA is one the top places for employment in the San Antonio market. The benefits alone attract many people to USAA. Their mission to their members sets them apart in the industry.
good,Poor management not held liable for fraudulent activities against employees. Company does not honor terms of their contract which has historically resulted in lawsuit award settlements paid out to employees over the past twenty years in the hundreds of millions.
good,Great place to work.  Excellent benefits but you pay for them. Salary is extremely low for the industry.  Great people.I love the family/work balance that they offer.
good,"Primary contact for loan process on VA, and Conventional Loans. Focus on member needs and offer solutions to meet member needs. Focus on meeting loan closings within 30 days or less."
good,"USAA is a wonderful place to work. Depending on the position that you have, the day could seem a bit stressful. Back to back calls and slight micromanaging."
good,Lack of industry leading tools and environment. The Property Casualty Group which is the largest in USAA has the poorest work environment. Very tight micro management coupled with a work load that doesn't allow for the customer service USAA was known for. Job advancement is extremely difficult and your list of denials there will be 50 to 1. Your manager has to approve even letting you apply for another position. Some managers shoot down your chances without the recruiters even getting a chance to see your resume. If by chance you get a good manager you will have a very fair shot. The only good thing is the managers seem to rotate out pretty frequently. Work load has steadily increased and bonuses have dropped year to year. The culture and Management outside this department is better. I do believe that USAA does care about its members but has a long way to go to fix its claims department.
good,"I started as a low level mortgage processor and was pretty much in heaven at first.  As the season began to push through new loans and new applications, it seemed to me that the management couldn't keep their answers straight nor did they practice ethical behavior regarding clients and members."
good,"USAA has a very relaxed work environment unless you are in sales.  Sales will need to adhere to a schedule and are tied to the phones. The hardest part of the day is quitting time as you will not to complete the call that yo are on which may bring you over your time, however, it is manageable."
good,"When I worked there, I worked with a team where we had to hit the ground running with learning code. I was able to learn from my teem and the technical lead we were assigned."
good,Great company. Benefits are excellent. Very strict time adherence requirements. The training program could use a process improve project. Many new employees would like to have the training program improved.
good,"Local management is great, not much faith in executive management after 265 people in the mortgage department were let go. Loan Officers receive a base pay with the possibility of funding bonuses when multiple targets are met.  Not all targets are controlled by the Loan Officer which has caused many of us to lose thousands of dollars and seek employment elsewhere. Once they get the pay structure to be fair it will be a great place to work again."
good,USAA is an overall a good company. schedules are getting harder to work with. overall job is very sales oriented and they push you to make unrealistic offers or referrals. Nice company paid events like holiday party and family day. Bonus every year depending on how well the company did.
good,"USAA has an awesome environment with a great group of people. I am currently a contractor, and even working hard doesn't guarantee a full time position."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefit, care about their employees. My manager however was a pain to deal with. "
good,"Directors act like children. If you are in their group, they will offer you many advancements in your career. If they don't like you, they do not talk to you. Bad experience."
good,There are lots of changes making the company less desirable to work for. They expect so much from employees but we are becoming less and less competitive.
good,"Great company, but fairly immature in their pursuit of process excellence. There is not a complete understanding of the skillset brought by engineers in the manufacturing industry nor how best to utilize that skillset."
good,"The goal of USAA is to provide an environment where there are four key pillars everyone works from - Honesty, Integrity Loyalty and Service.  USAA offers a great benefits package to include 401K, health and life insurance, dental, vision and paid time off."
good,It's a HIGH STRESS call center environment. One mistake and you're out. If you love talking on the phone go for it. Being that it's such a HUGE establish you can easily get lost in te hustle and bustle.
good,Benefits  were wonderful .  Was nice having a gym and cafeteria on premise which limited the need to go off campus.  Was a pleasant challenge on a daily basis which drove me to ward excellence.  Was very motivating and exhilarating.  But the workload seemed to increase more and more each year which made it difficult to maintain a good home life with children in school without compromise of quality time.  It was a pleasure being able to serve the military community and be there in their times of need and celebrations.
good,"I worked as a contractor. My experience was good overall, however, my experience is limited as contract workers are not given the same experience as a permanent employee."
good,"A very challenging call center environment...one call after the other.  Attention to detail is an absolute must, whereas you are dealing with thousands of dollars and information within reports must be accurate."
good,"with 2 degrees, yes 2.....degrees i was unable to advance. applied internally 10x and was doing mock interviews, volunteering for special projects, and assisting with  my manager. i was getting passed up for people who were always ""friends"" with the managers instead of education/experience. i was frustrated and set up a meeting with my director. she told me i was not trying enough!!!!!! though the money is good, in the long run  you have to be happy."
good,Led a team of problem manager. Assigned problem based of expertise and workload. Performed problem management function and worked with subject mater experts to deliver highly available systems.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the work day.  As long as you are not bothering management and meeting your sales  quotas, they will guarantee you have a job the next day."
good,Good company. No room to advance in the Colorado Office. Can really burn you out if you are looking to advance or even move around within the company.
good,The atmosphere was very relaxed.  The manager was very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting.  Good group of people to work with.  Great working hours.
good,"Typical day at work involves fielding phone calls from members and assisting them with their financing of automobiles, RV's, Motorcycles and personal loans. The culture is great and helping members is the main focus of the position. Giving them financial peace of mind is the mission of the company. I have learned to work with multiple facets of the business from lending solutions to insurance for their vehicles in a seamless transaction."
good,"In my current role working at USAA is very stressful and underpaid, changes are constant especially with leadership. Worst immediate manager ever. no motivation when all feedback being provided is negative."
good,"I really don't have anything bad to say about the company other than my manager was very spiteful. I loved the people I worked with, the job was ok, lots of opportunity for overtime, but someone could easily become overwhelmed."
good,"lot of great reasons to work here if you just keep your head down. promotions are hard to come by outside of the typical progression-based ones. "
good,USAA is a good company to work for with good benefits. The office has a relaxed atmosphere with many friendly faces. Starbucks in office is a big hit.
good,"Great company, excellent benefits, as an auto adjuster, life is very stressful with little time for personal chores to be done. Knowledgeable co-workers"
good,Take inbound calls from family members reporting the death of loved one. Advising documents needed to close accounts. Provided billing info and what to expect moving forward. Also making outbound calls advising of documents needed to close accounts.
good,"Its ok, just very competitive.  The claim is that Usaa is a relationship company and not driven by numbers. The fact is that they are driven by numbers. You have to be very scripted in your interview if you want to get a new job."
good,"USAA is a great company.  Working there as a contractor is not so fun, however.  Although we do the same work as other USAA employees, we get none of the benefits.  We do not get paid holidays, sick leave, PTO - anything!"
good,"Very repetitive. Not much thinking involved, do you job don't make a mistake. There are some managers that will try to help you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but there are many more that are do not think outside the box."
good,"Stressful environment, if you are an over achiever this is the place for you. They demand every call is handled perfectly..or else you feel your job is in jeopardy."
good,When I worked there it was much different from what it is now.  I had more layers of middle management than the post office.  And the message was never clear from leadership once trickled down.  They were great about training and education.  Always giving you time and bending over backward to make sure that was a priority.  Middle management was stagnant.  Unless you have a degree you will always be on the phones.  And they keep a tight watch on that and other KPI's that don't really always tie into overall performance.  You may bring in more business but if you time on the phone isn't good you will get a PIP.
good,"Upon showing up you are to log on your computer and phone. Once you have the computer and phone set up you start answering incoming calls with the opportunity to assist non-member and members with auto accidents and guiding them in the process of the insurance guidelines and procedures. The most difficult part is to force particular requirements into the conversation (i.e.: the caller has a broken arm and you ""upsell"" and try to advertise personal property insurance). It makes the calls awkward and creates unease for the caller. In retrospect there are those opportunities to really help our members with coverage that was needed that they weren't aware of. Some of the management in the P&C department does make it hard to excel but other departments in the USAA family have totally different outlooks so it does vary. The absolute most enjoyable part of the career is to assist fellow veterans and prior service members with issues that are within my power to help with."
good,"Although the company has moved in a different direction and the culture has changed (more focused on sales versus the members) the benefits are good.  If you are fortunate enough to have a great manager, it's a great company to work for.  The only negative, management is not consistent with their message and they are not forthcoming with information that impacts the organization and/or their employees.  I wish management were more transparent."
good,"When working for website support, safe and encouraging management and staff. Continue training for work and personal classes. Flexible work hours. Fun to work."
good,"Work itself was good and flexible.  Pay in San Antonio is lower than in Austin by about one third.  Facility is very large, about 1 mile long with several cafeteria and restaurants on site."
good,"I enjoyed the work, but it was hard at times to hear all the details of a house fire or serious car wreck.  The management had a very extensive training program but it did not prepare you to talk to someone who had lost everything they owned in a house fire."
good,Job is ok but I want to do more the help the company in a time of catastrophic events.  Unfortunately I was informed my help was not needed.  Which is disheartening when I want to be the best employee I can be for the company and help our member in time of their greatest need.
good,"Excellent compensation and benefits. I was trained in Life Insurance when I started I did not know anything, and learned a lot about life insurance because of the awesome trainer. The facilities are amazing."
good,"Company as a whole is great. Great benefits across the board, but the P&C  side of the business is significantly understaffed and employees are over worked."
good,"I investigate auto claims to determine liability. Co workers are great to work with, but with little time to react with them. I enjoy helping members that are in an auto accident and need help."
good,its very fun environment to work here all co-workers here are supportive throughout the project and some times during the release there would be lot of complications
good,"o	Worked on System Testing & Voice Response testing."
good,My typical day consist of assisting military members with purchasing or refinancing their current homes based on VA guidelines. I have learned all of the guidelines and differences between a VA and Conventional home purchase. My current manager is exceptional and attempts to do what is needed to help you be successful in your current role. My entire team is made up of team mates that are always willing to help so we can all succeed as a team. The hardest part is when you are unable to approve someone for a loan and having to advise them that they are declined. The most enjoyable part is completing the entire process with the members and congratulating them on their new home purchase!
good,"I enjoyed working at USAA for the most part, but I do not miss the heavily micro-managed call center environment. I was in school while working there and they back you better than any other company I worked for. Several other perks were available otherwise. Company matched 401K was solid. "
good,I enjoyed working there but there was no opportunity to move up.
good,I have no review of this company. I don't want to write anything.
good,"No room for advancement, yet great benefits given.  After receiving a Masters degree and there is no way of advancing and attempting to work toward a great career."
good,"The company tries its best to look after its employees.  Managers are helpful, and the benefits are good.  You could make much more  in salary for your perspective position somewhere else.  At any company, to move up, people have to leave out of their positions to make a spot for you.  Due to the relatively low turnover here (compared to other banks), there are lots of people that have been stuck for YEARS at their position and are not advancing, despite their individual accolades.  If you want to be a manager, for example, you better come IN as one."
good,"Really great company, but the pay is way under industry standard. IT staff really seem to love the company."
good,"You will never work so hard, or be so proud, to work with the quality people at USAA. While 12 hour days and 7 day weeks are not uncommon, the dedication and performance of these people is incomparable."
good,"USAA isnt a bad place to work but it would be much better if the claims section was restructured. Most insurance places will have adjusters actually work their files while a different team takes incoming calls. USAA is more focused on adjusters taking phone calls and adhering to phone stats, leaving little time to actually adjust losses. While they may advertise the ability to work from home, included in that position is mandatory Saturdays. (not worth it). Overall it is a good place to work, excellent benefits and atmosphere. Poor claims structure and too much emphasis on phone stats negates the positives about the actual job."
good,"Its extremely flexible and the people are great.  I love the amenities, food options and benefits. They have gyms throughout campus, healthy meals are 50% off for employees and if your position allows it, there is great flexibility to work from home."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company and learned a lot from here. Friendly environment, helpful group members, supportive supervisor, flexible working hour."
good,"Great company! Unfortunately the pay was not sufficient for amount of work, preciseness, and needed overtime just to stay a float. The amenities are wonderful, but cannot utilize them fully between work time. Very strict - even as a prior military retiree, the day 2 day is tiring."
good,USAA is a wonderful company to work for. They have great benefits and salary. USAA takes into account the employees and really values them. They listen to you and want to make changes with you in mind.
good,"USAA is an awesome friendly place to work, the casual dress code and building amenities you never have to leave the building including a day are facility onsite,"
good,"Workload volumes are high and very demanding with ever changing deadlines and priorities;"
good,USAA has many of the pros and cons that many large comlanies have. A lot is expected but we are treated fairly. Individual managers are usually good. Director level leadership can be out of touch.
good,Good place to work but you can't grow strong with the technical stack. Lots of legacy tools and old way of doing things.Slowly moving towards the latest technology stack.
good,"17-18 an hour for licensed insurance agents is low. Period. I now work for a competitor making double. It’s a shame because USAA has so much to offer in terms of work-life balance and home office amenities. "
good,"The good: Good people. Excellent facilities and employee activities. "
good,"working in the call center was extremely stressful.  I enjoyed going to the Recharge Zone and watching TV, walking on the elliptical or playing pool.  I gave me a chance to rejuvenate and provide excellent customer services to our military community"
good,They want their employees to be financial secure so they can share that with their members. The company gives every opportunity to learn how to make your money work for you.
good,Management is not the greatest. Promotions based on who you know but not knowledge or performance. Salary is decent. Tuition Assistance pays for any degree you want and however many you want.
good,"Overall it is a fun workplace. The work is what you will expect based on your title. There is a healthy amount of food and the like. Sometime however, you will run into corporate politics and potentially bad managers. Sometimes there are decisions that aren't well thought out and parking can be awful at times."
good,"Great place to work.  Great benefits! The focus is on getting the job done to meet member satisfaction and that can be overwhelming at times, especially for the property and casualty side.  Once the business finds a balance to support their employees as well as their members, they will be phenomenal!"
good,"Great ""Corporate"" Company to work for. Fast paced and good compensation/benefits. Culture seems to be continually changing, but enjoyed my time with the people I worked with.  It can be stressful if you are tied to the phones, but you are compensated for the ""stress.""  Lots of benefits, but lots of external hiring at the senior level which limited some of the promotions from within."
good,Great company and culture. Work life balance. Good management.Call center focus and metrics. Great work place culture. Learned more about Military service and country.
good,"USAA is a good company that tries to look after it's employees. There can be too much favoritism within certain aspects of the company however, there are ways to move up without that favoritism, it is just harder to get there."
good,"When I started working there, people were extremely friendly, there were quite a few family corporate events, and there were a lot of perks--onsite daycare, gym, etc...People were very helpful and wanted you to succeed."
good,"It was a great company starting out, although they pull the wool over the eyes. Its a corporate company that has only one end goal. The employees are not valued to the extent of the desired position. Its a great company but I want to work for a company I feel valued and not just a number"
good,I worked at USAA while I was an undergraduate in college and it provided a flexible work schedule which worked with my college schedule.  The management is a pretty centralized form of management.
good,"Fast paced call center environment, (claims)  "
good,"Nothing but positives to say about USAA.  Great place to work.  Very collaborative and respectful to each other, including senior management and executive branch."
good,"Great opportunity to bring our veterans home with home ownership."
good,"USAA offers amazing befinits, and the work/home life has been great. However management has been poor in showing they care about the individual working, and helping career advancement."
good,Overall good place to work but it is so tightly controlled that you gain little experience of the actual industry if you stay at the same job.   Some of the manager were great and others weren't   There was a big difference in management style.  The education benefits were awesome.   Other companys are so restrictive on what they will pay for.
good,"They are an awesome company,  that has good core values.  They have exceptional benefits and most buildings have great amenities.  They work/home balance can be stressful depending on position.  It's mostly call center environment so your time is accounted for by the seconds. So it's easy to be put on the ""red"" list if u take too many/long bathroom breaks etc."
good,USAA is a great company with a great outlook for young professionals looking to start in the claims field. The PTO is great and your managers will support your decisions.
good,Company is great and the bonuses are even better. Overall it is a great place to work for.  Like any other place there will be some workplace issues but that's where change and adjustment come into play.
good,"I worked for first notice of loss so often talked to people who had just gotten into a car accident. so, the phone calls are very stressful but the managers try to make it as fun as possible."
good,"Good company, pays decent. Basically, a giant call center..  if thats your thing then this is the place. Probably the best call center you can work for though. Not for me, but lots of my co-workers loved the job. You can eventually move around within the company, takes time."
good,"Good place to work for beginning and intermediate financial professionals. Company has a good reputation for insurance and financial products. The also have expanded their technology division into the Plano, Tx area."
good,Mostly computer work interspersed with meetings with internal customers.  Learned to handle diverse personality types and egos.  Great manager in one job; not so good in the other.  Good workplace culture.  Hardest part was learning to have patience with a poor manager.  Enjoyed meeting new customers and meeting their reporting needs.
good,"Great company, but the culture is shifting to be more sales focusd and numbers driven. Most jobs are phone jobs. Great bonuses. Career path needs to be more defined for entry level employees."
good,"I worked the phones as a insurance specialist and as call centers go, USAA is the cream of the crop. Still very stressful taking back to back calls for hours on end. Advancement was focused around who could brown nose the best or out perform their peers."
good,great workout rooms. nice enviroment. new age kitchen. esalators and a starbukcks. big with easy directions to each building. i would love to work at usaa again
good,Positive environment with great benefits. Most difficult part of the job was being monitored and one phone call after the other. I learned how to multitask and empathize with members.
good,"I liked working at USAA."
good,Great Place to Work.  Great place to grown and learn.  USAA provides several programs that will allow advancement of your career.  It is one of the better companies in San Antonio.
good,Prestigious place to work with a big emphasis on culture. Ideal for an individual who enjoys working in a fast paced environment using the latest technology.
good,"Job security is GREAT! That being said, its great for those that don't need a lot of creativity/change in their work lives.  Gets boring really quick."
good,"Company matches up to 8% for 401k contribution. Unprecedented. If only the hourly pay was increased, maybe more employees could afford to take advantage of this benefit without having to starve."
good,"They are not interested in making things better. They only want to hear how great they are. They are petty, vindictive, and unwilling to adapt to the changing landscape. They only want yes people and bootlickers."
good,"Overall, I love USAA as a company. However, I didn't enjoy my particular position, which was based on a call center environment. The pay and benefits were great."
good,"Real nice place to work, some members will try to take advantage of you. The job over all is great as long as you are willing to sell, sell, sell. If you can do that then you will be great here."
good,"The hardest part of working at usaa is attempting to drive deep strategic changes with certain leadership that has no desire to change course, representing conflicting direction at all levels of leadership.  It's nearly impossible to point everyong in the same direction to accomplish the commandors intent for large enterprise-wide initiatives."
good,"The Mission of USAA and the ability to serve those who have served is what gets me out of bed every morning."
good,"A great place to work, however there seemed to be very few advancement opportunities.  There is also a very high call volume to work with.  Their computer systems really leave a lot to be desired.  Overall professional but you do feel like a drone answering phones, a lot of the customers are nice, but about 25% of the people you talk to are entitled horrible people."
good,"USAA has amazing benefits and perks. Once you're there for awhile, you realize why they have all the perks. If you don't mind being at your desk, on the phone all day, then this will be a great place for you. If you want to have work relationships with your co-workers or take your time reviewing claims, this is not the place for you. If you can get into a higher position, things are better. Otherwise, it feels like you're just another worker bee and can easily be replaced. You will be taking calls all day from not only insureds, but also claimants, other insurance providers, repair shops, enterprise rental, lawyers, etc. The huge call center environment is very different from other insurance companies."
good,I didn't work there long enough to have a review I went to training and had to quit because of a family emergency so I'm not sure what else you would like for me to say
good,"Typical day was fast pace,  Management was not the greatest.  Work place culture they tried to make if fun. The people that I worked with were fun and personable."
good,Internship was a good experience.  Learned a lot about the company and spent 12 weeks where I was given specific roles and duties.  Projects were not very exciting nor did I get that many.
good,USAA is a good company to work for and they value their employees.  The pace is fast and their is a heavy workload but the atmosphere is good and the managers seem to be available to the employees.
good,It takes a while to get hired with USAA but they are a great company to work for with great advancement opportunities.  The training is excellent and gets new employees ready to do their jobs very well.
good,"member oriented, field claims position is very detailed and managed, working from home was most enjoyable and gave time for family interaction, salary commensurate with position"
good,This company takes care of their employees and pays for their education. They care about your career at USAA and do everything to help you advance. Seems o be a lot of perks
good,great benefits but can be stressful. workload can be heavy. during times when workload is heavy have to work overtime in order to stay on top of work.
good,"It's a call center. Back to back calls. Manager expectations tend to be unrealistic in this kind of environment. USAA is a great company and takes care of their members and employees (great pay and benefits) however at the end of the day it's still a call center."
good,"You will Definitely feel overworked. It doesn't matter how good you are at your job managers expect you to stroke their egos. If there is ever a manager that dislikes you, you will never get out of the call center."
good,"USAA serves the military community. It was always a good day to serve those who served. USAA pays well, has bonuses, and one of the best overall work facilities."
good,There are so many areas of USAA.  Depending on where you work it can be boring and slow to frantic fast and crazy.  The phones are insane and you will have calls coming in solid for your entire shift.  Thankfully most of the members are wonderful.  Claims is a different story as it is crazy busy and you need to deal with claimants as well as insured.
good,"I was hired as an insurance adjuster but told of all the other opportunities I would have for upward mobility and to work in departments more suited to my experience, skills and desires. This was completely untrue."
good,USAA is a great place for people who want to help support military personnel and their families. Good management with room to grow. Opportunities for advancement can be very linear.
good,"Much of the workforce is on the phone. Those not on the phone are very lucky. Those that are wish they were not. "
good,"Working at Agero for USAA was definitely a valuable learning experience for me. I had never worked for any telecommunications job prior, and I gained so much knowledge from my time there. I feel like I have an amazing grasp on interpersonal relations now, both with my coworkers and with my customers. Though I felt as though I had already mastered this skill in my previous work experience, I feel like working at Agero taught me a lot about time management. Working on my own, in my own workspace, for a specific client gave me the liberty to manage my time in the most efficient way possible."
good,"The days were very busy but for the most part there was not micro managing. I enjoyed learning about insurance. My managers were very supportive for the most part. My co-workers were easy to get along with and you felt like a real ""team""."
good,Heavy inbound call center with heavy focus on adherence to time on phone.
good,"All the materials you need to do the job, plus you'll work with smart, dedicated people."
good,"I have a great work enviroment, with a lot of chances to train with good managment and co-workers but the job is not a permanent postion."
good,"Underwriting and reviewing credit, income statements, bank statements. I also help with the new training for new employees. The hardest part of the job is when new employees start and it's hard to curve their way of thinking from job to job due to every employer does things differently. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have done the my best and being honored for my great work by the management staff."
good,"• Front line representative for automobile, and property insurance policies."
good,Great place to work with very good benefits. It is hard to move to other areas in the company.
good,The company has great benefits and pay but work levels are not able to be maintained.
good,"A typical day work is assisting members w/their insurance needs (review policies, issue new policies, take payments, make payment arrangements when needed). I learned that listening is very important not only to what they are saying but also to what is going on behind them. You could discover an unstated need they didn't even call about. Management is great. Co-workers are awesome, some of the best I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I worked in the billing department, so I would have to say the hardest part is making payment arrangements with a member that couldn't afford to make their payment but also trying to make sure they were fully covered and protected which sometimes would increase their monthly premium. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that at the end of the day you have done your best in helping the member."
good,"It is an excellent company and it is great to know that what you do matters since you are supporting the military and their families. It is a very rewarding experience. With that said, it is ran like the military and there is little room for feedback or advancement. There are also no branches or offices so everything is an inbound call center. The ideal person is someone concerned about job security, great benefits and wanting to do something where you feel your work can matter. It is not ideal for someone looking for rapid career advancement or the ability to maximize earnings since pay is average at best compared to the industry, all positions are salary only and promotions are increasingly rare."
good,"Great benefits and pay for San Antonio area. The people are nice and you great access to gyms, Starbucks and food courts. The office politics however can be difficult."
good,"A typical day at the office is very busy. Working in a high pace call center enviroment answering complex questions about member accounts. Keeping book of business by managing proper paperwork, clerical filing information properly for Undewriters, or managerial purposes. Environment is very chaotic at times, but is managable. Managers keep up attitudes by providing positive feedback, and encouraging walk arounds."
good,"Great campus, the best benefits you'll ever see, great people, but can be highly stressful and competitive. Employee moral is bipolar - huge highs, terrible lows. But overall, if you can manage the politics and stress, it can be a rewarding place to work."
good,"USAA has an amazing staff including managers. Like anywhere you could end up with one of the few managers who is not a joy to work with but there are not many of those. USAA has amazing benefits. However it is a very time consuming, stressful and competitive job. It is not a family friendly company. USAA pushes sales all the time and constantly is restructuring everthing even staff."
good,"If you LOVE the military it's the place for you. There was a lot of pressure to refer people to other departments and get them interested in new products. Although I was great at all my other metrics and provided great customer service, my low referral rating hurt my numbers."
good,"Employees have excellent benefits while working at the company. Free gyms, half priced healthy food options, onsite starbucks, etc. Multiple ways for company to show appreciation of employees, company party, bonus, etc."
good,USAA was great for many things just not what I needed in that stage of life and it is a slow grind to get out of the entry level positions or to make even small changes to your schedule
good,Great Company to have insurance with but if you dont like sales then not the company to work for.  On the phone the whole day and monitored how long on the phone.  You can never sale enough as far as your manager is concerned.
good,USAA is an everchanging culture that shifts with the tides. There are always ups and downs with every job but the employees that you work with every day make it a great place to work.
good,"In some areas of USAA it can be quite stressful and intense. As a contractor you receive no discounts or benefits. However, if you become full time employee then there are discounts at Starbucks, the dining halls, on site daycare, company store and the convenience store. Also, there are relaxation rooms, nap pods, game rooms, on site nurse, and covered parking."
good,"Many changes occurring during my transition time.  USAA is like any other large corp where profit is a focal point of the company.  They seemed to go away from ""taking care off the member.""  Depending on the position held at USAA changes may affect the employee.  For example, if you work the phones--very difficult; as members not happy with changes USAA implemented in past year..., but if you work back office--things are still great, same hours, same benefits.  So like any company, there are great thins about working at USAA and some things not so great..."
good,"Your typical day at teleperformance consists of laughing with coworkers, assisting clients however you’re capable, and staying motivated in your work."
good,Every new employee starts at the same pay whether you have experience or not. Pay should be based upon experience and skills relevant to the position.
good,"Good company.  Heavily hierarchical.  Being a company that focuses on military, it has a noble mission.  Opportunities are limited for non-military background."
good,USAA has a culture that separates it from most other companies. It is ingrained in what they do and helps drive them to do more. Always focused on the mission to take care of its members.
good,"I worked hard, was treated well, and not micro-managed.  I served only employees and my work was appreciated.  When I started, the culture was one of trust and loyalty between employer, employees, and members.    That seems to have eroded over the past several years judging by the number of class action lawsuits and fines the company has received."
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company, especially the co-workers i interacted with on a daily basis. The description of my team has changed many times, a consistent change of responsibility was to be expected, however it was difficult to narrow down each change. When attempting to get clarification on new procedures multiple sources and coaches would provide different and some times conflicting answers."
good,Got good experience in visualization tools and techniques with business knowledge. Very interactive and good place to explore the latest versions of tools
good,"There is a lot of talented individuals that are extremely loyal to the company.  The benefits offered to employees are wonderful, especially the education assistance program."
good,USAA provides a great work environment that treats everyone as an individual and not just a number. Only down fall is that the managers do not have to licensed and most of the time cannot answer job related questions in regards to insurance.
good,"USAA is a very large company with a strong corporate culture. The company is very employee friendly & offers extremely competitive benefits & compensation. In addition to that, the company encourages professional development & offers many things to assist with that such as tuition reimbursement. Overall, a very good company to work for."
good,USAA is a great company to work for. my manager kind of sucked. they changed the job requirement for a property adjuster 3 to FNOL only. unfortunately there isn't claim ownership for a PA3 anymore.
good,Good work experience.  Beautiful campus!  The project I have been on does not utilize my experience.  I would like to get back into contracting.  That is what I had been doing for 17 years.
good,I never thought I would like insurance but this job helped me learn the value of insurance and educating people on a topic that people normally do not like.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get through management.
good,If you come in without  degree you will likely be on the phones a while. Once you have a degree though then you will be able to move up. Must be a change agent and work in fast paced environment.
good,USAA is striving to become an all-inclusive compliant company.   They are a fast-paced environment with a culture you can be proud of.  We truly serve amazing men and women each and every day
good,Pay seemed below average but if you are able to live off of it you will enjoy the environment. Plenty of discounts. Great cafeteria. Very diverse. Lots of longevity.
good,"Once the honey moon stage was over, management harassed and made working very difficult.  Management did not deal with other employee's harassment.  Created a very stressful work environment"
good,Hardest part of the job was the never-ending calls with little down time between calls. Very competitive work environment that doesn't leave much room for error.
good,San Antonio was my oyster because I worked there. Very secure facility. Strong company culture. Liked how it is massive but not technically corporate.
good,"great company with advancement opportunities, good company bonus structure. Tuition reimbursment. Causual dress code, great company culture. They seem to care for their employees."
good,"My heart is at USAA. Unfortunately at the time I was there, life-work balance was a big issue for me. My other challenge was how much I sacrificed for my members but it seemed to never be enough."
good,The Employee Benefits are awesome at USAA.  USAA is a firm supporter of the Military and their customer service in Insurance is the best!  They truly believe in their mission!
good,"I enjoyed my time there. I enjoyed the facilities, gym, parking and cafeteria. The people are very nice and professional. The office politics are a bit overwhelming. The communication could be better."
good,USAA is a great employer.  The managers are great and the career advancement opportunities are frequent and vary. The culture is fast paced and demanding.
good,I have enjoyed working at USAA. I was laid off is the only reason i am looking outside of the company as i am loyal to my employer. Great company and people.
good,"I think if the priorities of the area I worked in had been dealt with 2 years ago when I started my career at USAA, there wouldn't have been so many lay offs as of late. I learned the more you can get done , with the fastest turnaround the safer your job is, where a lot of hats, culture has never been amazing, since I've been there a lot of disconnected employees."
good,A lot if information is left out in the hiring process. Often unrealistic work goals on a daily basis. Great overall pay but no commerserate to the day to day expectations.
good,"Excellent benefits, ability to work remotely. Gap of communication between front line employees and upper management. Family and work life balance if willing to work non peak hours. Time off for personal reasons can be difficult depending on management."
good,"USAA is a great company to work with great employee benefits."
good,"Working for the USAA project at third party facilities seems to be less beneficial than at the main site. There is a very high turn over rate at TELETECH within the project. The positive side is that Team leaders are amazing, and coworkers are friendly."
good,"Their products and services are top of the line and their member experience is fantastic.  They are currently going through lots of organizational transformations, so employees often experience the usual bumps in the road that go along with those changes."
good,Nice stepping stone job.  Beware of getting too comfortable...this job gives you a very easy walk down stagnant way .. too many people have worked here 10-20 years in the same position with a college degree.. don't let it suck you in for too long.  Competitive career advancements due to the large tenured employee pool.
good,"Good company to work for. In some cases is very fast paced.  Not all managers are equal, some do not have the same qualifications as others who are more competent and are that are ready to lead.  Very noisy environment during lunch.  Great benefits."
good,They have ping pong tables and great atmosphere. With many eateries to choose from and events to take part in. They definitely are a good place to work for
good,"Can be stressful, especially during any storm season.Micromanagement permeates throughout the working environment, adding to the stress of non-stop calls from customers."
good,"The work life balance at USAA was great, they truly take care of you as an employee.  They also have a great healthy program in place and are dedicated to you and and healthy lifestyle."
good,"I worked for First Notice Of Loss, that is taking claims for car accidents, so naturally the incoming calls are very stressful. The culture of the work place was fun and outgoing and they tried their hardest to make it a good experience."
good,"I really don't remember much about working for USAA, other than it was very fast pasted.  The was very litter interactions between the  mangers and the contractors."
good,"Great company, however be prepared to start at around 35,000- then very slow and low raises. Job are very competitive and difficult to promote no matter your work experience or performance."
good,"flexible hours"
good,"Opportunity to learn skills in many areas of the financial services and insurance industry.  Has great benefits including financial, health care and education."
good,"If you work within the call center you come in the gate, swipe your badge, and log on ready to take calls. Take your breaks on time and adhere to call volume expectations. IF you would like to move up, consider taking advantage of the educational perks, certifications, and classes offered. Do WELL in the position you are in! However, in the event you get a manager that is more interested in their career advancement, do as your told and try to MOVE ASAP. Remember, it is a great company with a lot of benefits. Consider those things before you decide if you want to depart. If you work hard and are a team player things will go well for you. After all it is a Military environment. Play within the box, keep to yourself (opinions, social life, etc.), and when asked to participate raise your hand. If you do these things you will have a wonderful career. Mind your shadow, dress for the position you want not the one you have, and continue to network any chance you get."
good,"USAA is an overall great company to work for, but growth within the company is not very attainable and starting salary is a little lower than most companies in the same industry."
good,This company caters to the military and their families. The culture is beyond any other company. However the management team is way below qualified. The decisions are made emotionally rather than professionally. To advance you have to become friends with management. Employees that are not qualified are the ones that get promoted.
good,"Typical day is stressful"
good,"Overall this company was great to work for. Most of the jobs with this company make you stay at your desk the whole day. Awesome benefits, but my job made me feel like all I did was have grunt work and not feel appreciated."
good,"stressfutl work place not fair does not always go on you merits, but by other ways, favoritism is big there family members come first as in management members"
good,"I am a better worker and person after experiencing 30 years of employment with this company for the reason I have been trained on the importance of providing excellent customer service as well as learning the importance of self development.  The hardest part of my prior job role was having to multi-task several requests that were equally urgent in their own way thus prioritizing workload was key as well as quality assurance.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the pleasure of working with and getting to know so many different people from varying job roles across the company.  Because of that opportunity I was always learning something new, as well as making long lasting friendships."
good,"Amazing management. Never micro-managed, and trusted to do my job. It's very difficult to work there as a contractor, as we are not able to have any benefits, and room for growth is almost impossible."
good,The organization as a whole is good.  They can sometimes treat you like you should be honored to work OT and make people feel forced to work and guilty if they do not come in to meet their needs.
good,Good company and benefits but you work hard for them. Hard to keep working with usaa as a military spouse but is doable. Claims is the toughest job in the company.
good,"USAA is a great company to work for. Unfortunately in the Chesapeake office there is not a lot of room for advancement outside of claims."
good,"A very demanding position. Start my day by saying good morning to everyone and then begin working. I try to avoid conversation to avoid mistakes and try to be as productive as possible. Something to learn everyday in our department. Changes occur quite frequently. I enjoy workplace our culture as we motivate one another on a daily basis. We strive to keep a positive vibe in our department. Completing work can be a hit or miss on a daily basis. If you can complete more then pend, your chances for meeting goal for each day can be obtained. If not, you have to follow up for the next four attempts until you can complete and that could effect your overall monthly goal. There is nothing more satisfying than being able to resolve an issue for a member and the member is grateful once notified."
good,All of the outsourcing - especially their technical tiers is not so great.  I had to leave USAA and get hired with a temporary agency to stay in the technical support department.
good,All in all USAA was a great company to work for I actually worked for the company threw a sore branch which was a OK but sitel was not into providing what I believe it takes to let a company filling correct and that was care!!
good,"USAA is a great company to work for and does take care of their employees. Although there is opportunity for growth in business, if you do not like being on the phones and answering calls day in and day out, the position may not be best for you. Many of the advancement opportunities kept you on the phones, but would make you handle tougher calls (retention, escalated calls, etc)."
good,Good chance to work and learn new things and i came to learn many new things here and the management is very friendly with the workers and co-workers are good
good,I love USAA. I loved working for USAA. They're banking is top-notch and they treat their members with overwhelming levels of respect. The company remains consistant without sacrificing stability to make new products or offer a new line of products to their members. The training was great and very informative. Helping the members out connected me with people from all over the world.
good,"Overall there are great benefits, opportunities in many areas. I recommend one not get comfortable with being in the same position for years to come. Be flexible, and agile in the business. My favorite thing about my career is the amount of recognition and types of recognition one receives and is able to keep track of."
good,"Fast paced inbound call center"
good,"This was a phone Job so we rarely left our desks. High Volume, being in the California office we took the majority of calls due to daylight savings time and inclimate weather in offices in other parts of the country. "
good,"USAA is an outstanding company to work for along with a great environment and opportunities for advancement or transfers within the company.  They offered competitive salaries and chances for educational growth within the company.  I personally did not experience any politics, but I was only at the company for a short time."
good,Outside of the call center USAA is a great place to be. In the call center though it feels that you are stuck without a chance to leave unless you get lucky.
good,"USAA treats its employees very well for the most part, however the job is pretty strenuous. Back to back phone calls all day and many are people who are angry about one thing or another."
good,"This is a great place to work..but there's a caveat to that statement.  It depends on what department you work in.  I hear the auto insurance area is very stressful. The bank isnt too bad, but if you are in an origination position you work in a call center environment.  So you can get lost when it comes to promotion plus if they are making changes in management that can prolong advancement even further. That would be one of the reasons why I left.  So if you are lucky and your boss is connected then promotion is much easier."
good,"I learned all I know today about insurance and banking through excellent training, a few good managers and a lot of great fellow employees. The hardest and best part of my job were the members. Helping them make decisions, sometimes through life's greatest challenges and knowing that I made a difference in their lives was the greatest gift I could have ever received."
good,This is a good place to work with the caveat that it is very difficult to get time off to have a work/life balance. It is not uncommon to talk to 60 people in 1 day.
good,"-Receive and process the first notice of an auto accident until the claim is complete."
good,"Work hours vary but options to work from home and the facilities are first rate."
good,Great environment to work but management was poor. They made so many changes for no reason and at some points it didn't seem they knew what they were doing.
good,USAA has its ups and downs. The biggest downside is the sheer volume of calls. They are timed 3 seconds apart. As soon as you hang up you will immediately get another call. They are very micromanage oriented. With that said the customers tend to be respectful and the benefits are good
good,"Pro:"
good,"A typical day in the claims office was very busy.  There were back to back phone calls with two short breaks and a small lunch in between.  The phone calls were typically easy to handle but a script had to be followed to a T, and referrals were expected to be made on most of the calls.  "
good,"When it comes to benefits and compensation, I will admit, I am overpaid. If I left this company, I wouldn't start off anywhere near what I am making now, salary-wise, and there are no other companies in San Antonio that provider better benefits than USAA -- hands down. The building is amazing, we have nap and study areas, game rooms, on-site fitness centers, and Wendy's just to name a few. Depending on your position determines the corporate culture. For the most part, it is very laid back and we have a casual dress atmosphere (Jeans, t-shirts, sneakers). However, those that have a more ""higher up white collar"" position (basically, not involved in the call center environment) tend to still dress in business attire on a daily basis despite the CEO allowing corporate-wide casual dress. This is the headquarters, so even though it is laid back for the most part, probably not as laid back as some offices that do not have CEO's and VP's walking around on a daily (my bathroom breaks always coincide with a VP's -- I can't escape her!). The only negatives I have are related to working in the call center environment. The bulk of USAA's employees work in the call center and want to move away from it so competition is TIGHT. I have no college degree and sit next to someone who has an MBA and make more than do. If you work in the call center, they say you have a better chance of quitting and reapplying for what you want then being hired from within. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's extremely competitive when you get in. USAA PAYS for your undergrad and grad degrees (not tuition assistance"
good,"I enjoyed talking with and educating customers and being able to assist them with their insurance and other needs."
good,Co-workers were mostly dedicated to the company and the advancement of such as well as helpful and encouraging.
good,"Overall, my experience at USAA was mixed.  On one hand, working in a call center was stressful due to call volume, excessive monitoring on each call, and a push towards a selling attitude.  They offer great benefits to their employee and a great 401k matching."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"I really enjoyed working for USAA! The people there are very friendly and helpful.  Training is very indepth and the management team is very helpful for the most part. This is by far the best company to work for as far as work-life balance. They go above and beyond to the point of even offering assistants to run errands for you such as taking your car to the shop, grocery shopping, pay bills etc., anything aside from care taking they will do!"
good,"A typical day at work consist of coming in during your assigned shift to be readily available to help members in the best financial way possible. We strive to be the provider of choice for the military community and their families. The hardest part of the job is connecting with the members to help hold their hand through every transition in life, whether its moving half way around the world or loosing a family member who served and took the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to relate, lend an ear for empathy, and provide the best financial products and services to help the members get through tough situations."
good,"Enjoy the company, and the culture. hard to advance unless you have been their for 10+ years. Pay is low for the position."
good,"Great benefits needed if you are on the phones. You are constantly yelled at by customers and to add insult to injury, you are expected to sell them something."
good,"USAA is a good company to work for.  There are many issues with management in the injury departments, however, the people are wonderful and the benefits are amazing. "
good,Great company with good compensation. The medical and dental was a little high priced when I was there.
good,"The company is obsessed with advancing alternative lifestyle individuals and women regardless of their experience, skills, or punctuality. Leadership wanted to fast track these individuals regardless if it was fair or not and couldn't care less if people left or not over it."
good,This place is good for someone who wants security and no real challenge.  You can forget moving up unless you’re in the good old boys network or are a female.  They are really pushing diversity too far that they discriminate against males.
good,"Excellent workplace.  Depending on your team, the experience could be very positive.  I wish I would have been on a different team.  I probably would have stayed there if that were the case."
good,"Great company that focuses on providing financial services for those who have served in our armed forces. Opportunities exist for leaders to become more effective ""leaders"" and not just ""managers"" who execute on tasks and duties."
good,"Good company, employee oriented. Activities on an annual basis to keep the employee moral up. Flexible work life - works with their employees and great benefits."
good,"The environment is great! It is a call center so work-life balance is difficult.  Great benefits and extreme training.  If the schedule was more typical, the position would be perfect."
good,Great work culture that provides fair compensation as well as an accommodating work life balance. Provides multiple opportunities for improving personal financial goals and skill building.
good,Good place to work but leadership is not always what is expected.  Leaders often seem to more concerned about their own welfare and inner circles than those on the floor making the progress.  Work life balance seems to be the strongest benefit.  Advancement can be difficult without a lot of tenure and favor with those above. Technical competency is often more important in leadership roles that strong leadership skills.
good,"I loved working at USAA for a long time. The members were mostly military, so it was great talking to them all over the country and helping them with their needs. As soon as it became all about selling other products and call center quotas, it was not great anymore. It became a job, rather than a career. There is also a ""good 'ol boy"" culture which is apparent among the managers, so don't mess up."
good,"A typical day at work had new challenges each day. "
good,It’s hard not to bring work home. Benefits are amazing but being tired all the time can take a toll on you. Opportunity is there to apply for advancements but in office politics exists and usually jobs are already designated for someone else in mind.
good,"Good culture about serving the armed forces and their families.  Highly customer focused.  Lots of technology roles across locations in San Antonio, Phoenix, and Tampa."
good,"USAA took the time to make sure that all their reps understood the culture.   Lots of fun things to do with USAA"
good,"Great benefits, decent pay."
good,Culture is good for a large organization. Opportunity to provide your voice. Flat organizational structure which helps foster more open communication.
good,"good place to work....business casual dress...cafeteria, covered parking and daycare on site. made lots of friends. would recommend to anyone with some call center or customer service esperience"
good,Nice place to work.  People there are very friendly.  Lots of amenities.   The workplace culture seems professional yet somewhat laid back.  There aren't any real negatives.
good,"USAA is a great organization to work for. They have a great company culture and really care about their members. Great benefits! Many different job opportunities, but call center positions can be exhausting."
good,"Put in your time, and work hard. There are more politics the higher you go that you'll have to cater to, but play the part shake hands and show your face often and you'll be just fine."
good,"8 hour days. "
good,"The culture and benefits are unmatched.  I actually enjoy and can't wait to get back to the job after the weekends.  Only downside is career progression.  I've been under-compensated since joining; my position is not commensurate with my experience, but for the most part, everything else makes it worth being there."
good,"USAA is great about offering a lot of different jobs, however they are more likely to offer a promotion to someone with a degree, even if they have far less to no experience compared to a candidate with no degree and excellent work experience and job metrics."
good,"A typical day at USAA would be taking calls as they come in and addressing the issues the Members are having."
good,USAA is a good place to work. I mostly liked it because the facility was nice and it was close to home. Their is typical culture issues found in most employers. Its competitive type atmosphere which brings out the worst in people. But its a company and they need to compete.
good,USAA is a really good company to work for if you like being on phone calls all day long.  This was my first experience in a call center and was not my cup of tea.
good,USAA is great company to work for. They provide growth and opportunities to better ones self by paying for higher education. USAA has equal opportunities for all.
good,Challenging position that requires great attention to detail and constant movement through software. They were in growing pains while I was employed there.  They needed to re-organize and prioritize tasks differently. I had to leave to devote more time to finish a degree.
good,laid back need improving with management overall s nice place to work. Their turn over rate is really high. Made sure i worked really hard with company.
good,"Good work life balance."
good,I find my time at USAA to be very productive as I was able to learn a lot and use a lot of the skills I had learnt in the cause of my work at USAA. It was a great opportunity to work there.
good,"Overall, I look back at my 3.5 years at USAA as one of the best decisions I ever made. I was desperate for a job after school, and it wasn't my first choice, so I didn't have a good attitude going in. Nevertheless, the company does a good job of onboarding college hires. It's important for meeting new friends, but training at USAA can feel a bit brain-washy."
good,"As far as call center jobs go, this might be the best. They don't jump down your throat too much with numbers. But it is still a call center job and you will still take call after call for your entire shift. This type of job just wasn't for me. If you're going to work in a call center, you might as well try and get in here."
good,It really is a great place to work.  Starting out you're stick in an aweful schedule for your first year.  Definitely don't enjoy sitting down all day.
good,USAA is a great place to work with competitive pay and bonuses.  It is a place of constant change that is dedicated to the mission statement in every way.  USAA dedicates itself to the members and believes that we can retain every member with our excellent service and core values.  We pride ourselves on excellent customer service and achieving our goals in the most efficient way.  We meet our closing dates to ensure that every member moves into their new home on time and without the stress of taking off work or completing tasks that we can do for them.  We make mortgage as timeless for the member as possible.  We took on as many mortgages that came our way and treated each one with time and attention no matter if we had 5 or 31 loans.  We do our best because our members deserve it.
good,"USAA provided a great place to work with great benefits.  The amount of PTO is fantastic. The pay could be better. Overall, it's a great place to work."
good,"Very productive . Management was great until our Director resigned. "
good,"the health benefits that are offered are great and amazing to cover you and your family. the sponsored company events are great for you and the family as well. The annual bonus is always a great gift at the beginning of the year and an extra paycheck during Christmas is great help also. "
good,"USAA is a great company to work for, its culture is very diverse which is awesome to see employees/contractors from many different cultures and from many different places walking speaking different languages and sharing their knowledge so we all can grow."
good,USAA is becoming more up to date regarding dress code requirements and work/life balance. Management has somewhat unreasonable expectations at times but the company provides top level benefits.
good,"Excellent culture, however work life balance was lacking,  Excellent people to work with.  Great pay and benefits. Nice facilities.  Member focused.  Good location.  Tuition reimbursement.  Good coaching and mentoring,"
good,As a contractor it was difficult to transition to the full time role even with great performance and skills. Enjoy working here but unless you are working directly for USAA there aren't much benefits as a contractor.
good,"Must be able to handle multiple tasks in high call volume. Typical day involves emails, chats from managers, incoming tasks, incoming phone calls from members and non-members."
good,Working at USAA has been rewarding and a great learning experience.  Although I like my job at USAA I travel a little over an hour each way and work a 10 hr day.  Too much time away from home and my current manager does not seem to be very adept at helping you move up with the company.
good,Working for this company is great. The workplace culture is like no other. Management is very supportive of continuing education. The most enjoyable part of the job is being apart such a great company that has a great rapport.
good,"Great management. Be ready to deal with high call volumes and expect constant change. Change mostly comes from compliance and technical requirements for the position, as they are subject to regulatory changes."
good,"One thing I can say about USAA, they truly care about their members and employes."
good,Work/life balance was poor. Strong focus on customer service.  Good benefits and salary.  Great employees.  Excellent core values.  Regular coaching and interaction with our employees.
good,Great company to work for.  Managers give you freedom to operate on your own and development your own style.  Excellent amenities offered to its employees.
good,"Learned about working together as a team to handle the heavy caseloads especially during hurricane season. Handled many clerical support duties; proofreading and typing reports,  Management worked alongside employees during time crunches."
good,"The reputation draws you in and the pay keeps you there.  Many want to leave after a few years but the salary and pay benefits, etc. keeps you trudging along and returning day in and day out because you cannot find better for the work you are doing.  I call it the 'golden-handcuffs'.  Enjoy."
good,"Great opportunity to learn, however not an environment to grow when team dynamics are not there. Contract to hire role is tough only because egos come into play. You might be technically competent, but on the flip side you might not be converted full time, because other factors come into play."
good,USAA is a great company to work for. They have a wonderful culture and you learn a lot. I advanced in my career from the bottom to a claims adjuster within 8 years. It was stressful at times but you are compensated very well.
good,Typical work day are inbound calls to handle total loss settlements and hopefully not encounter an upset customer or claimant.  Current position needs be improved since there are too many adjusters handling one account.  Wrong or inaccurate information is given to member and claimants.  Management has been encouraged and have taken notice that the total loss department needs added support or changes to their process.
good,USAA offers great benefits and many opportunities to grow and maximize ones skills.  The most enjoyable part about my job is the technology that I work with day in and day out.
good,Awesome training ! Unfortunately since they pay for your insurance licensing if you leave their employment they take your licensing away. At least that's how it was when I worked there 11 years ago.
good,i enjoyed working for usaa even though i was a 3rd party rep ....the job was easy....answering phones helping the members it was great because i always put myself in the members shoes that is why the job was awesome to me
good,I worked in the call center at USAA. It can become very repetitive and the guidelines change frequently. Its hard to know what to expect from your role.
good,"On the job training, work life balance is not always what it should be. Lots of over time.  Constantly changing procedures, many of the other department are not always aware of new changes in procedure.  Keep your own CYA documents."
good,"Good place, very educated and skilled workforce. Management provides good guidance, however, it is pot-luck on getting a good manager.  Great benefits, great facilities.  Overall an excellent place to work."
good,Great place to start off your career. They really embrace learning and training. I would recommend this to any college grad looking to get started in IT.
good,I love USAA as a company.  But the management focuses on themselves and not the success of their team.  The benefits are unheard of for a corporation this size.  You also have no opportunity for growth out of the call center.
good,"USAA was overall a good place to work. Employees are great, management was very encouraging. I would highly recommend USAA to my family and friends. Their overall focus is truly about the member and not the dollar."
good,"The typical work day is spent taking incoming phone calls, counseling member in financial matters, and selling USAA products. The environment is relaxed, they have a great culture, and the management team was great to work for."
good,"company paid training"
good,Benefits were extremely competitive and all workers were great to work with. Job security is there and the bonuses at the end of the year were great to get.
good,"I learned a great deal of knowledge and skills from this company. As a military spouse, I appreciate the company culture and values. Pay is decent, benefits are great. A typical day consists of sitting in a cubicle answering phones and adjusting property claims for members. The hardest part, for me, was managing back-to-back calls (FNOL's) in addition to handling my diary and files. It was too much when having to handle Catastrophe events and the expectations were unbearable. I tried to go part-time,find projects to get me off of the phones, and requested a lateral transfer to another position before quitting. Unfortunately, they could not accommodate my requests due to company needs."
good,"Working with Realtors and title to get members into their new homes. Average about 20 members at a time, ranging about 20-90 day close times. USAA tries hard to take care of their military members."
good,They have very short breaks and very strict policies the training happened right away and they paid for everything associated with training to ensure the employee could concentrate and step time on the given training. two weeks total
good,Had an amazing time there just as a contractor it isn't the best place to be so many mundane rules and regulations that make the experience less attractive for the grunt workers
good,USAA is an amazing company to work for. It continues to value it's members and employees by providing them the necessary tools they need to be successful. The employees at USAA truly care about their members.
good,"High energy fast paced environment, where you learn how valuable team work is in a large company, that being the best you can be for your customers delivers big rewards. The management staff for the most part cares about their people and go above and beyond to create an enjoyable rewarding expeirence. The hardest part of my job, due to certain restrictions, was not being able to help members in difficult situations. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people."
good,"I worked from 7:30a-4p, Monday-Friday, 40 hours a week. I would come in at 7:30a and immediately start working on the Flood report which consists of balancing the flood accounts to the report and sending the report back to SWBC; I then started working on a report that consisted of Estate accounts and Florida residents and faxing over proper paperwork to the correct department; worked on report to match members to the correct social security numbers; worked on report to verify address to members; worked on extensive report to reconcile members who had adjustments to their accounts; "
good,"USAA employees have a passion for providing the best benefits and services to our military and their families. As a result, the employees are driven to excel."
good,Really love this company but sadly one bad manager can ruin the whole feel. I would gladly continue my employment if it were easier to get one of the dozens of managers that work with you as an employee
good,USAA was a great company to work for. This was just not my career path and schedules became an issue for me as a college student. There was a great culture.
good,"Great managers. They really want to see you succeed. "
good,They do a great job servicing veterans and their families.  Very limited growth and room for growth.  Post externally for advancement opportunities as opposed to internal opportunity.  Great job security.
good,This was a good company to work for. A typical day was doing auto loans for veterans and their families. My coworkers were the best hardest working people I know.
good,"Great work environment.  Some managers were difficult."
good,"My wish is for greater advancement and the ability to work remotely. I know we will get there within years, but it will still have to be a local location."
good,"I felt that USAA was a great company, that valued its membership and employees. The reinvestment into their employees and membership through benefits were remarkable"
good,"Great company to work for.  The mission is to serve veterans and their families, which is tied into almost every decision made inside the company."
good,The company overall is good. The department I was in was constantly moving and they had different managers. They didn't help to pay for school if you were trying to work in a different career field. The facility is nice.
good,"USAA is an outstanding company with great benefits for employees. I worked here and was able to learn banking from many different angles, from services accounts, establishing new accounts, maintaining meaningful relationships with members and also providing members with customized plans for new products with USAA."
good,I recommend this job for any recent college graduates or transfers into management or strategic planning positions.  If your going in to an entry level position make sure that your willing to take on extra assignments and activities to distinguish yourself from a large employee pool.
good,Do not micro manage different departments.  Overall the company is good to work for and provides a stable environment.  The building and grounds are enjoyable.  The facilities are more than other business provide for their employees.  Training is provided in house to allow insurance licenses to be kept up.  Lunch was the best part of the day when time was spent with friends in the cafeterias.
good,"It is a great place to work if you can handle frequent feedback on your work."
good,Great company to work for. USAA makes most decisions based on the member's need. Good job of developing the Managers with consistent training.
good,I worked as a contractor for USAA. The experience was very beneficial. A typical day consisted of administrative and data entry work. It was my first job in corporate America and everyday was a learning experience that build my foundation as a worker.
good,"I've worked in many call centers, but my time at USAA was the best. I would take initial reports for both auto and property insurance claims, meaning I would often be on the phone with the member at the scene of the accident and had to diffuse the member's emotional state accordingly. I would arrange for immediate needs such as towing, rental cars, and repairs. I also had the authority to resolve simple claims like chipped windshields, clear at-fault/no-injury collisions, and property damage/theft below a certain monetary threshold. For all other claims, I was responsible for routing the claim to the proper department for investigation. I also was tasked with capitalizing on marketing opportunities and identifying potential fraud. "
good,I loved my hours my co workers were wonderful and of course my customers that would compliment me all the time management was great i don't think I had a hard part in this job and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting out early and having to rest of the day to rest for the next day .
good,"By far the best aspect of working for USAA is getting the chance to work with/for some of the best people in the country. Our military and their family. I am a huge supporter of our military and everyday I felt a true honor to get up and go to work. USAA is tough to work for in some ways because of their military like environment. It is the exact definition of corporate America. You really need to be ready to go to work, be professional, go home then be on repeat. You are a work bee here and replaceable. That's the only thing about the enterprise. You don't feel appreciated in within your smaller work group. The benefits are fantastic but it just feels way too large to truly feel part of something."
good,"USAA has been a top-notched company with a mission I believe in 100%."
good,"Good place to began an IT career, work is steady and busy all day. policies change a lot. it is all internal employee support and sometimes the employees don't treat the IT group with mutual respect and we as service desk have to just deal with it."
good,"Shortly after taking the job, I became very ill. They worked with me to make sure my employment was protected until such time I was healthy. Amazing company to work for."
good,Was there a short period of time in the mortgage department. I wasn't familiar with mortgage at this point and unfortunately that was the department I was in which made it difficult to adapt.
good,"I have a productive environment in which to grow , my ideas are valued by my co-workers and management . The company provides great benefits to improve health and well being. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the customers and discovering their needs"
good,"My experience at USAA was an  exceptional one. If you get a chance to work there, I highly recommend you take it. I can't say enough about it, but if you want to know what it's like to work there, do it yourself, don't listen to what other people say. Experience it for yourself."
good,"Create claim loss reports, confirm coverage, explain procedures and answer inquires for auto/property claims ;"
good,Its not easy taking in call after call when you first start but you get into a groove of things. I found the most challenging is that every minute is monitored down to your bathroom break. Management and culture is very supportive and positive. Benefits are great but I could not continue and go to school at the same time
good,Its always a good and healthy learning environment. Always provides an opportunity to learn and adapt new technologies and skills. An environment to balance life and work evenly.
good,As a Physical Security Officer III at USAA life was fast paced and pleasant. Coworkers always encouraged your growth in the company and there was plenty of training involved. Great benefits were provided and the overall work culture was easy going. Good transition job from military to civilian.
good,"A typical day at work is coming into daily tasks in the properly claims office or in the field, handling member calls on claims issues, taking new claims losses, determining contract law and coverages, liability losses, contacting attorneys on settlements and liability losses, closing exiting claims, using Xactimate & Xactanalysis, PLR, CLR, & ICU databases, handling large losses, Additional Living Expense (ALE), and CAT deployment in major storms across the country. "
good,"USAA is a great company - from leadership support, benefits, and ability to impact the organization overall."
good,Overall great company to work for. Fast paced environment. Outstanding learning environment.
good,"You have varying shifts that will be up for mandatory change each year, and based on performance and time on the job one would have better choices.  You get two short breaks a day and of course lunch.  There are in-house places to exercise, walk, read, converse, a full cafeteria, grab and go station, even a Starbucks!"
good,"They have excellent employee benefits"
good,great place to work. good pay and benefits. caring employees and staff. slow to advance tho
good,The bank was amazing at providing training and a good deal of collaboration with colleagues.
good,"It's certainly an honor to be a part of such a prestigious company. It's very structured and routine. Adherence is a huge part of the job; taking breaks at exactly the time your schedule produces, etc. The managers are great at coaching and my coworkers are fun and eager to please. I've learned how to open and close loans and make an exceptional member experience calling to a call center. The hardest part of the job is not wanting to use the facilities outside of breaks for fear of being out of adherence and how emotionally exhausting it is to talk to one person after another with more than half of the applications being declines."
good,Great company to work for with great values and work culture.  
good,"I loved USAA, but it's a different culture and atmosphere and not one that I was used to.  It's hard to move up and advance unless you know someone there.  Felt more like a number working there than an individual."
good,"If you don't mind sitting, micro management and agenda driven stats, then this is a great place to work. Management is competent enough, the job can be stressful."
good,"Loved the 4 day work week, my typical day was heavy in telephone calls, sometimes as many as 80 a day. Over all management was fair but at times there appared to be a double standard. the hardest part of the day was keep up telephone status. I enjoyed working with customers and loved the over all family feel"
good,USAA strives to be the provider of choice for the military and the best company to work for. I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge and gained experience through the many training classes they put you through. I have been lucky to have had awesome managers who have helped me with my development and growth at USAA. They have been supportive and a great leadership team.
good,Very busy call center
good,Open up a claim for tow/glass reimbursements.
good,I enjoy the unity in collectively working on a project to benefit our military families and friends. The work environment is positive and designed for career growth opportunity.
good,"Dress code is very casual. The main campus is quite large with several gyms, cafeterias, company stores and Starbucks on site. The security take their job very seriously but are always very friendly."
good,"It's a great place to work where you can find amazingly kind people. In terms of creativity and technology, they have some distance to go still. They care deeply about their members so I think that will serve them well into the future."
good,"I really dont want to do this.. Usaa is a wonderful company , employee oriented and centered on passion to help those who have served, continue to serve"
good,"good company to work for.  good benefits. nice bonus, can excel in career there easily. if you dont like the phones dont work here.  nothing much more than phone work there"
good,This work was in a call center. I learned about organizational culture. The management was replaced several times during my tenure. The hardest part of working there was change.
good,It provided an opportunity to learn and grow.  Management styles varied greatly from pod to pod and directly impacted ones ability to move to better opportunities
good,Good place to work where there is a chance to expose to different technologies. Work environment is good and the colleagues are really good in helping.
good,"Great place to work the culture was great. The management style was intense. I liked working there it kept your mind working, made you evolve. I had a great staff."
good,Great company that caters to the military.  Lots of military hired by USAA.  Cares ab their employees.  Great Bonus every year to its employees.  Remote working is encouraged.
good,Guaranteed once hired! Really great benefits! Professional environment. A great place to retire. Family oriented company. A lot of room to grow and advance.
good,"Great group of people to work with"
good,"I liked USAA, the benefits were great and I met some amazing people there. The only reason I resigned is because I worked for home and I need to be around people. I would definitely return to USAA when I move to mainland."
good,"Really Enjoyed working with one of the best companies located in Plano, TX. They offer nice benefits and workplace culture is nice. Management is nice and understanding."
good,USAA has allowed me to under the basis of auto claims and provided me the knowledge to succeed in my daily work life. They provide world class benefits and strive to improve the work environment.
good,I worked at USAA for 7 years. During my time I had the opportunity to work alongside many amazing professionals that encourage and believe in you. The claims floor is fast paced and requires a lot of attention to detail and customer service. You will likely be at a desk taking phone calls from members. You will have two breaks and a lunch.
good,USAA is all they are advertised about going above and beyond for their military members. The cross selling and quota system to get referrals to other products and services in a claims office was not my favorite. I had to move to a different state soon after this program became mandatory in 2014 so I had to resign unfortunately.
good,The mission is paramount to the organization and mostly everything coalesces around that. They are proponents of work life balance and invest heavily in employee training.
good,"Working security at USAA was a great place to work, convenient location, Supervisor was excellent, Co-workers were great, working both inside and outside was great."
good,Challenging and fun place to work.  Superior customer service standards.  Management and instruction/facilitation experience can be gained with above average work.
good,I liked working there but in my deot the management wasn't organized well though they did try.  You have to get used to the military culture and way of thinking but it's still good.
good,"USAA has been a blessing for me, they have provided some really good education and dental benefits for me, even when I was a part time worker they provided the same benefits. Also earn up to two bonuses per year. Now I am working from home!"
good,"The older you are you get an additional retirement incentive based on age called retirement plus so someone in their late 40s gets an additional 8 percent if you stay with the company 6 yrs if your are 50 or over it is 9 percent and 9 percent is the max but you have to stay 6 yrs to get it all if you stay 2 yrs you only get 20% of that additional amt.  They have an excellent match on 401k which is 8% better than any company ive ever heard of for that.  "
good,"The type of job is dealing on the phones military people who sometimes have suffered a life changing claim can be stressful at times when they are taking it out on you but is rewarding also because you are there to help ease some of the anxiety.  There are alot of chances to move around, just do not stay in the same postion for too long."
good,USAA is a really great employer with an amazing campus. USAA encourages healthy life style for their employees by providing discounts on healthy food options and a free onsite gym. My only complaint I had as a mortgage loan processor was the compensation for the amount of work. The job could be very stressful during purchase season and it was not worth the compensation for me.
good,Management is great overall. Pay is not competitive in the mortgage sector but the environment is great. There is alot of pressure behind being the #1 VA lender in the country. It is always busy and not enough bodies to evenly distribute the work so expectations is not  friendly to the actual workload.
good,"Fast paced but friendly and helpful environment. Very competitive when it comes to promotions, however the pay is decent for the type of work that you do."
good,"Stressful Job but the company has a lot of things for relaxations. Relaxation rooms, starbucks, various food locations and even a gym on the first floor which is available 24/7"
good,USAA is a very employee oriented company.  USAA has alot of benefits for their employees because they believe if the employee is happy they will do their best to make the customer happy.
good,Pay is Comparable for the job. It is stressful in property claims. You stay really busy. You tend to work overtime to stay caught up. Benefits are good. Company bonus is awesome! A good manager makes all the difference. A bad one makes it horrible to work there. I've been lucky!!
good,"USAA is a great company. It is very large and sometimes slow to act, but is a force to be reckoned with and has plenty of opportunity for growth within."
good,"Typical day at work involved selling policies to active duty and veterans of our armed forces.  Learned culture ,   Property and Casualty insurance and phone sales."
good,"I gained a comprehensive knowledge about going and above and beyond for the customer. I developed my leadership skills, that enriched my strengths and enhanced my opportunities to make a difference."
good,"A typical day at work was sitting at a desk providing customer service on the phone.  I learned customer service communciation skills, problem solving with data, and providing additional services to customers.  The workplace culture is positve.  Hardest part of my job trying to get to all the customers.  I enjoy talking with the customers and solving their problems."
good,A typical work day was 8:00 to 5:00. I was primarily tasked with auditing year end property and casualty tax returns. The workplace culture was conducive to success.
good,"High-paced call center environment. Not really much of a team concept. Training was subpar and complete waste of time. Managers (most of them) female and catty especially if you are pretty and smart. Shift bidding process was garbage. Hours sucked working 11-7:30. Time off for holidays based off senority and metrics I believe. Great benefits. Doctor on campus. Beautiful and clean building. Nice gym. But being stuck on the phone all day truly sucks and the work load is beyond abundant. No way to properly adjudicate claims and be fast with efficacy. Great company and they try to recognize you with little incentives but not for everybody. Claims will beat you to a pulp and stress you out, but OT normally permitted."
good,"As a recent graduate it was very difficult to find employment. Even with a bachelor's in Business Administration and a few years of experience it was tough. The company will hire you based on your credentials first so the schooling or years of professional experience. Then based off of your character and etiquette. There's an online assessment, then a phone interview, then an in person interview. Hiring process is extensive. Company has many avenues for promotion but your first year which will be on the phones in some way shape or form is mandatory for 1 year hire of lock in to your current job as of date of hiring. Meaning if once you're hired and you qualify for a better job you can't apply for it until you've completed your one year minimum."
good,Everyone was very nice. Managers seem to care about their employees. plus there is an onsite fitness center. The company really tries to focus on  a non stressful work environment
good,"As MLO you are on the phone all day long making inbound/outbound calls. Must be able to multi-task, communicate efficiently, & adapt to constant change."
good,"Some of the management were not knowledgeable in the job role. Must stick to compliance, attendance, productivity. They did do a good job of having team builder moments, like potlucks, team outings, etc.  There were way too many meetings, especially when you are trying to assist customers and work pipelines.  Meetings became annoying because we had more important work to do. Christmas and annual bonuses were DEFINITELY worth it."
good,"USAA is a fast paced, forever changing, and a call center environment. Work culture is good and they take care of their employees. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the veterans."
good,USAA was a great company to work at and benefits were great.  The company provides employee recognition and competitive pay and bonuses based of work performance.
good,Overall good work life balance.  Many opportunities to make a difference and move around the company.  Best overall benefits of any job I have ever had.
good,"I was a contractor at USAA.  I participated in Agile and Waterfall projects.  It was a good learning experience and met hard-working, talented individuals at USAA."
good,"lots of perks, great benefits and freat company to work for , enjoyed helping people to help get life back and to feel I accomplished my job in helping someone"
good,"The Benefits package at USAA is very generous. This is the main selling point for this organization. All of the other factors are better than the general industry average standards, but the benefits are awesome."
good,I love this company. It really works to make sure employees are happy and offers different avenues for employees to advance. It was by far the best company I've worked for in terms of caring for its employees.
good,"first of all nothing is for free so I'm questioning do I have to fill one these surveys out in order to attain help from a job search site...ok my time there would be as regular as anybody who read from a script and was mandated to find ways to sell more,, I didn't feel like a complete loser only because occasionally I felt as though I helped a few people when they were certain they weren't covered but most knew and understood that they were service members and required a particular service which I was obligated to grant"
good,Good place to work and good leadership.  High ethics and dedication to members is second to none.  listen to employees and always willing to help advance.
good,The company is a great company to start your career but is not a viable option to continue or advance your career. Many layoffs in a volatile field that you must take in to consideration.
good,"Would work there as a licensed rep but not first notice of loss again. Wasnt a fun place, low pay, high stress. No opportunity for advancement. Great company though"
good,"Job satisfaction is based on what your boss is willing to entrust you with and your attitude and competence. Management and mgmt style is variable. I worked a 4-day work-week, with health and life insurance, 401K, pension, vacation/sick leave, college tuition, and training for upward mobility."
good,"USAA is an incredible place to work were people are valued and appreciated. USAA has outstanding benefits starting your first day including 401K benefit matching (up to 8%), education reimbursement, and Health Insurance."
good,"Great company to work for.The culture abd benefits are great.If you work a job with member contact, it may be stressful at times.Thr company has wonderful benefits."
good,"Call center: Outbound calls to various delinquent accounts with in USAA financial to include credit cards, home loans, car loans and personal loans. Part time work only."
good,"I enjoyed working at USAA. It was consistent, fast paced and strong work culture It serves the community and its membership with sincerity and their best interest."
good,"Great place to work if looking for a career. Yearly bonus, atmosphere is great. Overall great company. Great people. Always eilling to help. Gave their employees everything. Compensation was great."
good,USAA matches up to 8% for your 401k retirement with an additional retirement called retirement plus given every February each year.  Excellent health/dental/vision benefits.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Busy days in call center environment to handle policy questions/adjustments as well as claims. Good continuing education program, tuition reimbursement for college."
good,On the phones is not were you want to be.  Starting pay for people with experience is not considered . Annual merit raise do not match performance. Life/Career balance is good.
good,Everything about this company is above average.  The products for customers to they benefits for employees are all designed to be best in class.  Always a great day there.
good,It was a great place to work but too boring for my liking. Being monitored and micro managed was not for me. It wasn't bad at all. I would recommend working there
good,It's is a great place to work. Lot of opportunities to work on new projects. Great experience. Business users are friendly and easy to work with. Excellent management.
good,"I started working part time as I finished college and worked in different areas of USAA. My regret is that I never applied for any special events and/or promotions jobs due to the fact I was studying Engineering and Math but my heart has always been in the entertainment/promotions area. Currently, I manage my daughter, Alaya, who is a singing talent."
good,"The company does take care of employees, but being tied to a phone does get repetitive.  Upselling was the main priority it seemed and not always taking care of members."
good,"USAA is a great company to work for.   They have great benefits and try to accommodate all employees.  Contractors are not treated very fairly; can attend any USAA functions, not given the same recognition as regular employees."
good,"Great place to work but have to bring 100% effort to succeed. Great benefits and services, can be politics at times to advance but lots of opportunities in multiple divisions and areas of focus. Important to network and build a brand. Very fulfilling membership and mission."
good,Benefits were great and pay was average. The phoenix campus has very few jobs that are not on the phones. Every day you are expected to take calls and provide great customer service for the members.
good,"Best career opportunities are available to former military.  The company does pay for licensing, and handles renewal of all licenses.  The workplace is very conservative."
good,"The company is very supportive of you, for volunteer opportunities and work life balance. Leadership is genuine  and caring. It's a good company with great benefits."
good,"USAA offers great benefits and amenities. They provide on site workout facilities, some locations have a medical office on site and they are great about making the environment a fun one. The work load for a claims adjuster is way to high."
good,They were ok . Pay was ok they do try to push the mission statement and the yearly bonus was a good if you qualified for it. not really room for advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working for USAA!! They have great benefits and time off. Management was okay, like any other company some good some not so good. Good Comany"
good,"USAA has a beautiful campus with all of the amenities a person could want or need.  There are relaxation rooms, gaming rooms, decks outside, beautiful patios and fountains, free financial advice and other services, several places to eat decent food at decent prices, and an on-site clinic.  They focus on training and encourage employees to advance.  They recognize those who do a good job.  The training is intense but there's a lot to learn."
good,"I learnt and grew at USAA. Have built a very strong set of analytical, and quantitative skills and in-depth business knowledge in credit risk and Mortgage. I also had the opportunity to be the business owner of a complex risk model and validated it under heightened scrutiny and standards."
good,"Decent salary plus work life balance. Con is that you are basically one of 22,000 employees and sometimes have to be very bureocratic about things. Easy to move up if you get along with the right people."
good,"Was phone calls from clients.  They were in need of help for vehicle reasons.  You took the information, set up a claim and helped the client through the situation.  Management was very helpful when you had questions.  The culture was very considerate, helpful, relaxed, and at times could be fun.  The most enjoyable part was the success of helping the client to a good resolution."
good,The benefits at USAA are rather impressive and a majority of the staff is helpful. My only critique is the boiler room like atmosphere that permeates the entire claims division.
good,"It was a great pleasure to work, every day was challenging. I learnt new stuffs everyday. I liked the Team and my Manager and had good management. "
good,would try it again due to being able to work from home but was not prepared initially for the amount of time spent during the day working on coworker files since claims were handled like a call center
good,I miss it a lot. It was a great job that taught me a lot over the years. There is a lot of opportunity within. They take great care of their employees.
good,Overall a wonderful organization to work in.  Benefits are the most comprehensive around.  Opportunity to live the mission everyday.  Great culture with supportive co-workers and no typical day.  Most enjoyable part of the job were the diverse opportunities to learn and grow.  The hardest part was the constant degree and pace of change driven through the department.
good,"USAA's fast pace and detailed environment really stimulated my mind, and helped me be a better employee.  It made me feel better about myself, and to see what I am capable of."
good,Workplace culture as collaborative and profesional. Hardest part of the job was being on the headset all day. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customer satisfaction.
good,"Since this company market is military just expect to see some of the same things as you would on a military installation. The place has everything that is needed to work, eat and play."
good,the place i worked made sure everything was done properly. people that worked there were good about what they do. we always had meetings to keep everyone up to date and customer servicwe was a must.
good,"GOOD company to work  new things to learn and great employee welfare and care, good to work for this company if you are in san antonio , though there are few who do not like here"
good,"Data Entry"
good,Love working there. I am only leaving as I wanted to receive a job using my degree. I do believe that this is not a job for everyone as it does deal with phones.
good,"worked there for fifteen years, best experience ever great people to work for and work with, hard to get in but if you succeed you will enjoy it and they treat you like a person"
good,"It provides the best services and value to its customers.  Its insurance products are competitively priced, and services are without comparison in the industry.  It is also very pro-active in developing new on-line tools and user-friendly features."
good,"Company had a high-paced work environment that may be a turn off to some individuals, but if you like high pressured, stressful work environments, this company is a great company to work for. They require a great deal from their employees, but the compensate EXTREMELY well."
good,"Great team atmosphere, inviting culture.  A typical day at work includes, training, coaching and developing new hire employees  The most enjoyable is team interactions."
good,All of the employees were nice people and easy to get along with. The work was standard IT development (nothing weird or over the top). The culture was possibly the best part of the job.
good,Had a great time working with employees at this position.  Learned about have valuable life insurance is.  Their customer service was first class when is comes to taking care of those in the Armed Forces.
good,"it was a pleasure to help guest with their banking need, but every once in a while you get a guest that over drafted and blamed you for the over draft fees."
good,"USAA employees take great pride in serving the military community.  The company pays a generous amount toward continuing education, such as college degrees or CPCU.  The job is stressful, in that the members expect excellent service, as is the reputation of the company."
good,Working for USAA is a wonderful experience. Very big on work culture. pay and benefits are very good. it was overall a nice place of employment. my last manager was pretty good
good,"USAA is a great company that truly loves their members and employees. The military community is one of the nation’s most diverse, and maintaining a workforce that is reflective of our membership is vital to our mission. USAA’s diversity and inclusion credo is “Many Faces. One Mission.” This philosophy describes who we are, a place where all employees count and contribute to the overall success of USAA."
good,"Employees feel proud to serve the military and they give outstanding service to them. USAA has won numerous awards for customer service, best place to work with great benefits, best bank, etc. USAA however does expect top production from all employees. Often employees have to work overtime to keep up to production standards. Due to the pressure to consistently shine many employees are stressed and do not feel a work life balance."
good,A feeling of accomplishment when you help someone put their life back together.  Work day goes quickly with inbound and outbound calls and claim worklist to complete daily
good,"Just a job and very difficult for advancement. It becomes tedious after a few months. Flexible company, but it depends on which management ultimately."
good,"If you enjoy finding solutions for members, then this is the job for you. If can be difficult to deal with upset members, but if you possess good conflict management skills, and a bit of empathy, then you can turn any difficult situation around. When you provide effective results to members then their attitude usually turns around."
good,"Call center environment. Answering phones, taking new losses, meeting customer expectations. Working within your team to meet the companies goals and your own. Claim investigation to determine liability and policy exposure. Reviewing medical records and injury information to evaluate a settlement range, and then negotiating that settlement with the individual or their attorney. Maintaining your pending claims and pro-actively bringing them to a conclusion."
good,"I worked as HCL America Inc employee in United Services Automobile Association."
good,"Flexible, good work life balance.  High employee engagement.  Mission oriented.  Being a leader at USAA, my most enjoyable part was working with the team."
good,Very helpful managers and co workers. Great work environment. Always upgrading the workplace and down time facilities. Excellent training format. Great chance for advancement.
good,USAA was an extraordinarily pleasing and beneficial environment.  Fellow workers are pleasant and easy to get along with.  I would love to work here again. :)
good,One of the best companies I have been associated with. It provided me with great skill sets and values for internal and external clients. Besides internal management issues again one of the best companies I have been with.
good,USAA goes out of the way to train excellent customer service specialists and gives them many excellent benefits.  A wellness plan and retirement options were a part of the employment package.  Everyone receives training and has to pass insurance licensing exams for the states they will be helping members in.
good,"Assisting members with insurance needs, questions and opportunities to grow with USAA. assisting with new pipeline classes and training, Assisting Manager with team."
good,"I have worked in usaa more than 1 year.it's a very good place to work"
good,I really enjoyed the place of work the environment is really laid back and fair place of work. It was easy work to answer calls dealing with auto insurance.
good,USAA has a very nice job culture to it. A typical day at work would consist of answering the phones constantly and helping members with bank loans. I have learned even more about the financial world. Management is easy to talk to and very personable. I love being able to help my members. I wish there was more work/life flexibility.
good,"traning is boring but informational. trainers do their best to keep you awake via games etc. traning is on the software you use during your work day. some managers are better than others, if you want to succceed they will help. they dont always have the answers to your questions. culture is great, they have a fun committe. immiturity is medium to high amongst agents, as well as, managers. pay is good if you can be bored. time between calls can be excessive"
good,Very busy call volumes with not a lot of time off of the phones to interact with other team members. Learned ins and outs of insurance contracts and whats provided. Great people on campus just majorly understaffed.
good,Agile methodology with scrum meeting in the morning. Manage off shore team with assignment and review and update development team of any issues and questions. Excellent team work and knowledgeable resources.Management is great and lot of new technology are replacing old systems.
good,"I have worked for USAA for two yeas in two different capacities. Although, I did not always enjoy the call center environment I always enjoyed the people that I worked with as well as the members that I spoke with on the phone every day."
good,"As a self starter, I was left to my own devices and as long as I got my work done, I operated with a great deal of autonomy.  I didn't have a boss breathing down my neck, I was given updates and expected to do them and allowed to work my own way."
good,"What I loved about the company, compensation, bonus, benefits medical, dental, vision and 401k . What was hard call center environment with high call volumes, opportunity to sale on every call."
good,Good project to work.This is the name of the project that i have worked as part of Accenture Solutions Private Limited. It is an Agile based project..
good,USAA is very helpful and will do everything they can to help you succeed. The supervisor and team leads give you outstanding tips and pointers to help you take you calls.
good,I enjoyed my time as a USAA contractor. The working environment was one of the best that I had ever been in. I like how within the many buildings there was always a safe environment.
good,Great corporate culture and employee benefits. Only wish there were more advancement opportunities at the Tampa offices.
good,USAA offers great starting salary and benefits to their employees. Paid training and yearly bonuses. Automatic membership with employment and access to USAA services/products. Constant team building and free education to all who desire continued education.
good,"I'm not very big on call center work, so that was the biggest adjustment for me. Outside of being tied to a headphone all day every day USAA is a great company to work for."
good,"At USAA there are many competitions with benefits of cash payout or gift cards. This made everyone work their hardest. My Processing team was amazing. if one was struggling, we all helped each other out. Have such a strong team made the job fun and easy to look forward to daily."
good,Great place to learn and work.  People are great and the job is rewarding.  Hard to find parking.  But in general everyone is great.
good,"Great company to work for, great co workers along with benefits. It is a call center to it some times can be a little much looking at a computer all day."
good,"Usaa is a good place to work overall. New management just came in and they are looking for slaves.  I worked there for 15 years and enjoyed it for the most part. It used to be a fun place to work. Now, no fun and all work. Feel like a slave. Management wants more sales but they are not willing to pay more."
good,"Great company culture.  Training is extensive and long but you learn much about the business so you are well prepared when ready to work with clients.  They take an active role in helping you succeed but the job is not very easy.  Sales quotas are reasonable but client base is challenging due to their limited resources and poor financial situations.  If you show up to work and follow your training the odds are in your favor.  Like any other business, there are bad days and you may feel concerned about your job security because of missing your goals.  Overall a good place to work if you can make it work."
good,I had a great time working at USAA during my time there. I work in policy services where I handle inbound calls in regards to auto and renters insurance. I enjoy helping people and the customers were always very friendly. The only reason I was unable to stay with the company is because I was hired on through a student intermediate program and when they offered me the permanent position I had to decline due to my school schedule as I could not accommodate what the training schedule was going to be.
good,"Large company - project based - employment depends on always being on an active project."
good,"Work Ethics, Job Culture is too good at USAA. Job Security is good as well. I have learned a lot from the colleagues at USAA. I enjoyed my time a lot here."
good,"I love the job culture,  he one thing that I did not like is that they are not afraid to replace you.  My job went to someone else and they are paid less"
good,"Lead Mortgage and Home Equity system modifications going through the Agile process."
good,USAA is a great organization to be apart of.  Compensation packages are competitive and management is very supportive.
good,"USAA is truly a great place to work in IT. They provide world class benefits, genuinely care about their employees, and are continuing to grow."
good,"A typical day - Helping people in need of assistance during a challenging time."
good,Call center environment -- micro managed.  Work/Family balance does not exist.  Benefits are GREAT! Great co-workers.  Don't be late unless you want to be written up
good,"I only have experience as a software developer here, so I can only speak to that area of the company."
good,"Great, stable company with lots of room for advancement and training. Even entry-level employees are given a lot of responsibility and authority."
good,usaa provided great compensation and training to be able to sustain a family and work life balance in AZ .  Aside from insurance there are other areas of opportunity to move over too.
good,"USAA has pride in it's employees and it shows in how they take care of them. Between the clean halls, amenities and campus recreation, they do believe in playing as hard as you work."

good,"Productive great workplace, with good pay and great incentived for employees. Also, bonuses are a great plus. Culture is also nice."
good,"The culture at USAA is great. They really take care of their employees and put their member's first. The campus has all types of recreational centers to keep their employees healthy, fit and entertained (ping pong tables, on campus gyms, basketball courts, etc). Their benefits program is great as well (health insurance, retirement, etc)."
good,This is the best place to work in San Antonio. The processes that are set in place makes it easy for everyone on the team. You get to work with one the best people in the industry.
good,"Great company to work for, just limited in job positions based on location. This is one of the better insurance companies to work for when it comes to benefits and compensation."
good,"Great place to work. The company truly stands behind it's mission and helping the military community. Does have the typical office politics, and management can take themselves VERY seriously at times."
good,"The company seeks to hire many former military personnel in order to aid in maintaining a thorough understanding of the needs of their customers. Customer delight is of paramount importance and is the central driver of key activities within the enterprise. Maintaining the necessary tension  between a more structured and authoritarian based culture while seeking ways to innovate and exceed customer expectations, all within a highly regulated portfolio of products tends to filter out less valuable innovations while letting the cream of the crop rise to the top. However, this at times requires a longer time to come to fruition than would be optimum in today's highly competitive global economy. Leaning less to the side of risk avoidance versus taking calculated risks might propel this great company even further ahead of their competition."
good,Provide member onboarding servicing and facilitation through various communication channels.  Deepens and retains member relationships through needs assessment and offer effective solutions.  Gather information and close on product sales
good,Loved working with great people. Handled incoming calls. Management was great and very understanding. Great work life balance.
good,"Lots of opportunity and competitive wages. Managers are helpful and friendly and want you to succeed. Hardest part of the job is being on the phone all day and dealing with difficult customers. Co-workers overall are nice and friendly. The only person you compete with is yourself, the opportunities for advancement are based on your performance."
good,"USAA is an excellent organization with a top notch mission, solid leadership and the best Members. They are military & military spouse friendly. They are very financially secure which provides employees and Members with much needed stability. Innovation is important to the organization, and all employees are encouraged to help innovate. The compensation is fair-good and the health benefits are pretty good but the retirement options are some of the best in the market! They offer tuition assistance, ample paid time off, and have many onsite amenities (depending on location). "
good,"	Application development using Java web based technologies such as Wicket, Java Web Service     (REST/SOAP based), WSDL."
good,Usaa is a wonderful place to work. There is a great feel about the AZ campus. The on-site daycare was the best part about working at usaa.
good,"USAA lives for their core values (Honesty, Integrity). Working for USAA is very rewarding as you support the military and their families  with multiple products."
good,"The work can be either repetitious or demanding depending on the position, but the company takes good care to ensure its employees' well being.  The benefits cannot be beat.  If you are ok with a call center environment, this is by far the best place to work."
good,Managers were professional job was easy you just had to work seriously to meet goals and expectations for your team. Co workers were great. USAA to really good care of employees.
good,"1.Good Co workers"
good,"A typical day at work was answering the phone and assisting members with loan questions.  Helping the processors move the loans along.  Supervising loan processors. "
good,call center environment.  it is a city on the campus and everythng you need is located there.  very nice people
good,"Working as a QA Lead and managing 20 resources across different locations. Having Expertise in HP ALM, HP UFT, RTC, Excel Macro, VB Script, SQL."
good,It's a nice place to work very friendly people and staff. They support the employees and they care about the members. They cater to the military community and they make sure that they are top priority as they should be.
good,Call center environment with opportunities to contribute to on-going projects and training. Fair compensation with opportunity for over-time. Positive culture and good work/life balance unless you are in management. Job can grow boring unless you continue to cross-train or advance.
good,great place to work with lots of opportunity for movement and promotion if you do things well.
good,Would work for USAA again.  It is a little micro managed but working for this company was enjoyable and my co-workers were friendly and helpful always.
good,"As part of this organization for many years I learned a lot. From Microsoft Office products to HTML, to Human Resources software, Peoplesoft, Property & Casualty Claims systems, and the list could go on and on. Also I learned how to better organize my work by watching how others organized their work and have adapted these changes as I've moved from company to company."
good,"I love working at USAA, people are great my managers are amazing and it's very inspirational. My biggest issue is that I do not want to spend all my time on the phone. In other USAA campuses, mobility is much more versatile but at the Colorado Springs campus it's very stagnant. If I could see a light at the end of the tunnel for getting off the phone it'd almost be the perfect job."
good,"The best part of the job was talking to the military community all over the world, and having the opportunity to thank them for their service.  Especially nice to thank the military spouses for their sacrifices."
good,I enjoyed putting my book knowledge to real life experience at USAA.
good,It is good at USAA with friendly coworkers but I am not convenient with the shifts in the project I am in.
good,"SAP Business objects ,Webi ,BO Dashboards developer"
good,The best part of USAA is its people. They are caring professionals in a highly competitive and stressful industry.
good,What can I say I left this wonderful company that offered so much. But there was something that I was lacking and needed to venture off . I have not one negative thing to say about this company.
good,"Very Good Place to Work, Very Good and Mature Infrastructure"
good,usually the company had free lunch for the employees. They are very strict in the time spend at lunch.
good,"on a daily basis I help members with processing their auto claims. I gather, investigate, and negotiate liability on auto claims. I return voice mails and handle a large amount of tasks related to auto claims. The workload is huge, the call volume is high. Co-workers are great to work with. the hardest part of the job is handling more than 1 claim at one which requires a great amount of multi-tasking which can sometimes be stressful due to the workload. What I enjoy most about the job is the environment and the benefits that come with the job."
good,"•	Responsible for quality customer service in deposit accounts to retain members and meet the needs of elite bank members. "
good,Great company with great benefits. They invest in their employees for the long run.
good,This company holds true to their mission and I have enjoyed working for them and the rewarding feeling that it gives. I have been a part of helping military and their families through disasters and everyday mishaps that requires insurance assistance. The company cares about its employees and compensates for the any stress with the job. The hardest part of working for this company right now is the extensive commute.
good,"I learned how call centers worked and operated, how to manage my time very efficeintly."
good,I worked in several different areas in the 10 years that I worked for this company. I started out as a secretary in the claims department working with several managers in writing letters and fielding calls.
good,Position is phone driven customer service. Deal directly with members concerning automobile accidents. Management is dedicated to representative self improvement and advancement. Co-workers are happy and usually in good spirits. There is not any particular portion of the job that is difficult. My military experience and training have prepared me well for adversities. The most enjoyable part of this job is dealing with the members and assisting them through a difficult time in their lives.
good,* Running scheduled reports and adhoc reports.
good,"• 4+ years of ETL and data integration experience in developing ETL mappings and scripts using Informatica Power Center with client tools like Designer (Source Analyzer, Warehouse Designer, Transformation Developer, Mapplet Designer and Mapping Designer), Repository Manager, Workflow Manager and Workflow Monitor."
good,Productive and enjoy workplace with a big company. I enjoyed work my job. Learned to serve military who also serve the USA country.
good,A typical day consisted of servicing our members in a call center environment. We were responsbile for assisting members with the automobile claims process while simultaneously taking care of tasks associated with our personal files.
good,"Learned a lot about mortgage underwriting. Typical day included phone calls, helping clients figure out the best mortgage for them."
good,"High call volume, aggressive sales environment, licensed to write personal lines insurance in 36 states. I have done this for over 25 years and enjoy educating customers. The hardest part of the job would be the phone volume. For example, not enough people on the phone to handle the amount of calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is educating customers and having the tools to do the job. USAA is very organized and has the procedures and guidelines necessary to do this."
good,"I started out as a temporary hire, but was offered full time employment within three months. I left after 17.5 years to persue what I thought was the perfect career, and I regret it to this day!"
good,Stayed busy at all times .Made work easy and fun. Met alot of people.
good,Great place to work. Good hours and learned much of my experience at USAA. Management was great. Co-workers were great to work with. Hardest part of the job was move projects. The most enjoyable part of the job was the enironment we worked in.
good,"The nature of the company is very enjoyable, there is clarity and transparency of the roles and job descriptions. Fun activities from team building exercises to Ping pong tables etc"
good,"Nice benefits, however, they kept promising they would even the workload by hiring people.  After a while, due to burn out, people would leave the company and the new hires would simply take the place of the ones that left.  Management always will find that one thing you could've done better but will not really acknowledge the millions of things you did great.  Workload is very high and demanding.  220+ files is outrageous per person.  Also, they would hire college graduates as managers who had no claims experience whatsoever.  That doesn't make a lot of sense when you have dedicated employees who have worked 10+ years and who have an SCLA certificate."
good,"As long as you work directly for the company, you have 2 weeks of studying before taking a state exam where you will either pass or fail after that six weeks of training how to answer insurance questions."
good,I enjoyed working here and enjoyed my team as well. I learned a lot the 2+ years that I worked at USAA. The management genuinely cared about the employees.
good,USAA is a company committed to both its members and employees. The company strives to provide in-depth support and training in order to provide customer service to those in need. The company is also willing to invest in technology to provide resource staff needs to complete their jobs efficiently.
good,"USAA is a member focused organization focused on taking care of military past and present. Culturally, the company is soft on it's employees, allowing emotion to outweigh logic. Work life balance is great. USAA doesn't pay as well as other industries in technical fields, however, they do take the edge off with decent benefits. Technologically, they are behind the curve and playing catch up with the industry. Don't expect to adopt new technologies quickly. Roll-out for enterprise is extremely slow and bogged down by process."
good,Fast paced work environment that is very rewarded.  The environment is very competitive when it comes to progression so you have to bring your A game.
good,"The training was awesome! I love the relaxation and rejuvenation rooms. They seem to really care about the well-being of the employees. I just wish there was a bit more flexibility with the training. It's really easy to be fired by missing more than one day."
good,"This was an amazing job! Great benefits. Advancement does take a while but it is possible. Don't plan on being rehired though if you leave, even if you leave on good terms. Once you are in, just stay."
good,"The hardest part of being in a contract role in USAA is knowing how to fit it without asking. The culture is very different than the mainstream. It is different, but in many ways much better."
good,"I learned a lot and your experience is what you make of it"
good,Great place to work overall many benefits for employees; One of the best tuition reimbursement programs and bonus packages to help employees balance school/work/career growth and family balance.
good,USAA is a great company with a strong corporate values and a mission driven culture that puts the member at the center of every decision.  Expect a good work-life balance.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, management, and the company as a whole. The only issue I had was having to wait one year to advance to other departments."
good,The amount of flexibility and autonomy is dependent upon the job you have and possibly your manager. Call center employees are more tied to the phones. Staff jobs tend to have more autononomy.
good,USAA maintains a culture that puts their employees at the top of their priority list.  They are extremely concerned w/ their employees growth and development both personal and professional.
good,Really good placed to work and build a career. Changes in leadership and because of results of their decisions there were corp layoffs. It is unfortunate. So many good people and long term employees were let go.
good,I love USAA but there was zero opportunity for advancement unless you went through management. Not everyone wants to spend their whole working lives tethered to a phone/desk
good,"Good Company, good people, good benefits. Advancement opportunities can be limited with a lot of external hiring. Solid benefits but overall compensation packages tend to be lower than competitors."
good,"Overall, Teletech was a laid back kind of work place. Everybody was nice and helpful; however the job itself was very stressful due to the professionalism required since it worked with the military."
good,"Very demanding, but well rewarded.  Tends to bring in leadership from the outside after a certain level. Good opportunities for work at home and great culture."
good,"It was great experience with TCS, it's a good platform for freshers. Loved the working culture."
good,Not a better place to work in the industry. Mission and Member Driven. Great pride in why we work there beyond our personal employment needs. Gives an extra reason to be dedicated to the organization.
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. The workload and work place politics were the most difficult thing for me. Workload can be overwhelming and very stressful at times. A lot of gray areas in the mortgage processing position. Metrics and scorecards do not reflect the amount of hard work you put into the position. Serving the military is rewarding and seeing how excited someone is to get into a home.
good,I truly enjoyed my time at USAA as a contractor. The culture of the company was the best I've worked with by far. The management and my team were amazing and always helpful.
good,"The salary is nice and you get a full benefits package, but many of the areas are phone based, which results in many positions being evaluated using performance metrics for the most part."
good,Loved working for USAA. I had to live due to family conflict. The demand in my position wouldn't allow me to take care of family and work at the accelerated pace I was at.
good,"Typical work day includes starting up your computer and sitting on the phone until your shift ends."
good,"It's a fantastic place to work as long as your a permanent employee. Contractors are treated well by fellow employees and even direct management. However, decisions and short sighted upper management doesn't see the value in keeping good people at any cost. "
good,Busy pace but rewarding serving our military members. Learned multiple insurance and banking products. Management very approachable. Great teammates and managers. Very high paced but reworded for your hard work. Good feeling help those who protect our country.
good,"USAA is a great company to work for, the only downside is the inflexibility when it comes to your schedule. There are only morning shifts available at the Tampa office, with the shifts being no later than 6 pm"
good,"I really enjoyed the work environment and chances of advancement. However, it was pretty difficult for claims adjusters to maintain their claims when they also had to maintain other adjuster claims as well."
good,"USAA provided relocation for me as my first job.  They had a good team of managers and colleague to work with.  "
good,"USAA is a quick paced environment where you will talk to in excess of 30 customers a day based on you position. Despite the pace USAA is a friendly, warm, and supportive environment to work."
good,"USAA is overall a good company to work for: it has very modern offices with several amenities, provides good benefits, and has a respectable mission statement. The insurance claims side is often understaffed for the customer growth that the company leadership has pushed for, which can be very stressful for employees. There often seems to be a large disconnect between employees who actually work with customers on a daily basis and operations staff."
good,Company is wonderful but working in the call center is horrible. Very micromanaged. Difficult to advance out of the call center. Nearly impossible to get off the phones.
good,I can only speak for the information technology departments.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and you might even get hit by a nerf dart from time to time.  Anyone at USAA working in IT will tell you that it can be very stressful but the company is also dedicated to work life balance.
good,The company has loads of events to show employee appreciation. The environment is comfortable and relaxing. Great team dynamic among coworkers. Great Management
good,"The workplace at USAA is exceptional for a call-center. The work is fast-paced and you have to adhere to standards of customer service, but if you are up-beat, helpful and dedicated, you can go far."
good,Great Place to work under the right management I would have stayed. benefits are awesome and bonuses are very generous. can be stressful at times but the perks make it worth while
good,"Good place, great company, takes care of the veterans, just really cliquey. Management is good. Health Insurance is a bit pricey for the employees. Good training."
good,"USAA expects a lot from it's employees, but also provides great support from management. They also have a good company culture and excellent benefits."
good,"It was a great place to go to if you wanted a secure job, the work wasn't hard and the people were really easy to get along with for the most part. If you're not someone who enjoys talking on the phone then this wouldn't be a good fit for you."
good,Working here can be stressful as it is a fast paced environment.  You must be prepared to meet goals set.  If you do your work right you will enjoy working here.  The benefits are also awesome!
good,"USAA is such a wonderful job to work for. Be prepared for stress, loss of hair, and no work/life balance. I have been trying to get a schedule change since January of 2017, It is now July 13, 2017 and I still have not been granted anything."
good,"USAA offers an excellent company culture, truly competitive pay and great benefits. As far as call centers are concerned, there is not better call center to work for, but USAA can only do so much to improve their call center environment. For many, it doesn't take long to grow tired of the redundancy and/or rigidity of any call center role and there is not much anyone can do about that. "
good,"Work for a world class company in a challenging, rewarding role where I can utilize my advanced analytical skills along with my wealth of knowledge in Workforce Analytics and Business Intelligence.  This position will offer the opportunity to use other key strengths, such as my project planning, organizing and implementation of best-in-class business strategies. "
good,"USAA is overall a great company with excellent work life, compensation, and educational benefits just to name a few. The culture is very much about the membership and serving the military community which is admirable. The main negative for me is the call center environment and 95% or more of the positions are on the phone. It just doesn't work for me but overall really an excellent company."
good,"A lot of inbound calls and job advancement was difficult."
good,"I actually love the company. They are all about the employees, work-life-balance, education and empowering the employees. They encourage employees to progress and move up! The only drawback for me is, it is extremely, extremely difficult to move to another department. As they say ""you have better luck moving up (in the department), than moving out (of the department)"". All in all, greatest company I have ever worked for! The jobs are very demanding and you are held accountable (which is a good thing), but they provide amazing benefits, time off, employee functions, pay for your education, and many other things! You won't make a lot of money for the first few years there, but you can climb your way up the ladder and do OT when it's available. I would LOVE to stay with the company if I could actually work in my field and put my degree to use."
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. The benefits are top notch. You have a set schedule for the most part. Call center environment was not for me.
good,"Though only for a short period of time. I truly enjoyed working for USAA. The company has great benefits, absolutely great work culture and I had an excellent supervisor. Budgetary cuts shortened my work experience, but I truly would go back in a heart beat."
good,"Make sure every customer that came in was fully authenticated before assisting or giving any information on account. Also accessed public records for fraudulent accounts. Assisted with web support, mobile support, and pc."
good,Great culture and to instill those good work habits that you need to be successful in your career. Provide great resources and tools for self-development. Not very flexible schedules for work life balance.
good,"Management comes from the top down.. Still one of the best employers in the city.. "
good,"Company is fantastic. Really the only downfall is that it is hard as a mother to have time to spend with my kids. Compensation is good, but not easy to move up fast and when you do the increase is not that much."
good,This is an amazing company to be a part of. Their Mission is truly exemplified in all aspects of the business. It is a fast paced environment with a strong culture.
good,I would say that I received the most joy from speaking to customers and the feeling of just being able to assist them.  Talking every day about their financial goals and offering products to be able to accomplish their dreams makes you feel good.
good,USAA is  good company to work for. I enjoy talking to members of the military and helping with issues that they trust usaa with.
good,"USAA is a remarkable company to work for.  There is opportunity for growth and their compensation plan is remarkable, In claims, your day flies by and it is a very awarding job,"
good,USAA is an amazing company to work for. Great compensation and benefits. They truly believe in work/life balance. Co-workers are amazing and have become extended family. Consistent on the job training and new procedures being implemented. Career growth with USAA is extremely difficult.
good,Stable work environment with an honorable mission.  Enjoy my coworkers and development opportunity.  A great place to work if you value stability and the opportunity to save for retirement.  Can easily work here for 30+ years and be satisfied with my career.
good,Very nice environment to work in. Lots of perks. The amenities available on campus and the discounts available around town and the country are great. There are many different departments to move to and the college tuition help is awesome.
good,USAA has a unified workforce with a common mission.   Great opportunities for advancement and great benefits.
good,worked from 7am to 5pm. learned licensing and compliance. worked with good management and co-workers.
good,"A fast paced cross selling environment.Teamwork and stand alone stats,. Very energetic,fun and creative work area."
good,"Most polite members, best benefits, excellent training, wonderful coworkers."
good,USAA is a good company with good benefits to the full time employees.
good,"A typical day at USAA... Sign on the the phones and start working your claims list.  You get 12 to 24 new assignments per week and you do need to prioritize each day and several times during the day so you make contact with your new losses in the required time period.  Your pending can be anywhere from 25 to 100, depending on the time of year.  Work through your already existing assigned claims toward settlement.  There are denials to be written, experts needed on certain files, as well as working with the direct repair contractors and insured's hired contractors to get work done.  There is negotiating  needed sometimes when working with independent contractors and there is also  reviewing of independent adjuster reports and direct repair estimates, as well.  We are separated into units but we all work as a team.  There is file ownership but an insured may ""0"" out to get another adjuster to speak with, ask a question, or to report a new loss that insured has not been contacted yet on.  The hardest part is keeping up with all that needs to be done in a day.  I like to clear out my diaries/come-ups every day and stay in touch with my insureds.  I answer every voice mail with an immediate call back and make sure my insured understand the claims process and if there are any questions that I am there for them.  I am passionate about claims adjusting and I find every part of it enjoyable."
good,The hardest part of the job is often the expectations that are set by upper level management in such a fast-paced environment.  The strong military values increase company relations and the compensation and annual bonuses make all of the gripe worth it.
good,"The best job I have had so far in my life.  I learned management of time, and training here.  I was able to complete my insurance license, help servicemen and women with their needs, and overall get satisfaction from my job.  The hardest part of this job was not being able to help everyone you wanted to.  The best part was the ones that knew you were going out of your way for them to make sure they got what they needed."
good,service and sale insurance while building customer relationships.
good,"Great place to work, however days are very busy with heavy workloads."
good,"USAA is a good place to start your career.  If you are on the insurance side, it's a fast paced environment that will challenge you every day.  "
good,A truly great company with a mission that is easy to get behind. 
good,"Talked to customers for the most part of the day, offered solutions to their currect issues regarding product lines with company and also their financial situations. Management was always very helplul and made sure all tools necessary to perform our job were given to employees. Co-workers were team players, respectful to one another. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping to find a solution for our members."
good,This is one of the hardest companies to get into unless you apply for a phones job.  The company is internet-based and 99% of their jobs are phones because of this.  They have changed standards in the past year and make it difficult to achieve pay increases unless you meet their strict standards.  Their pay is great but there is alot of turnover due to their strict policies and quotas.
good,"It’s good to be working in USAA. We will be having opportunities to get involved in lot of technologies. Friendly environment, with very big office in IT side."
good,"The company is singularly focused on serving its core based of military"
good,Good company to work for. Just live to far. Company is heavily centered around customer (members) and always does the right thing for members. I would work here again.
good,"Great place to work. Interviewing process can be stressful at times, but the wait is worth it. Compensation is not as high as competitors but the benefits and bonus potentials more than make up for it. It can be difficult to move up. Its very competitive inside, but opportunities are there and you are set up to succeed from day one."
good,USAA was a great place to work. They offer competitive wages and benefits packages. The hours are flexible with many shifts available. It is a call center however so the environment is ever changing and very fast paced.
good,This company has some of the best benefits. Great culture. Some of the management was not the best but still a great place to work. they really tried to give you a work life balance .
good,"Good company, slow paced decision making. Leaders care about their employees. "
good,"I took it really hard when I was let go. It was fair, but I was making progress. The company is about performance metrics. If you don't perform according to their standards, your time is numbered. Unfortunately, I did not apply for and get chosen for another job within the company before I was let go."
good,"I am a new hire at USAA and wanted to add my two cents. I worked a prior career in another profession and did employee advocacy for years.  I recently retired and got a job with USAA with the goal of working a few years more. I have no insurance experience but wanted to work here and am eager to learn new things. "
good,Overall a good company to work for however it is understaffed and very little consideration for overall work experience and tenure.  I would recommend to friends and family.
good,Understandable when situations arise in one's personal life.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast paced environment.  What was the hardest part was lack of time to get everything done.
good,At the beginning of my career at USAA it was more of a relaxed atmosphere where there was time between calls and you didn’t feel like you were over worked. Towards the end there wasn’t a moment to breathe between calls. You were micromanaged and had a specific times to do everything and your adherence  was monitored. Two 20 minute breaks and a 35 minute lunch and they measured your bathroom breaks. The training and discipline you receive from working here is top notch and prepares you for your future career.
good,USAA has lived up to the elevated expectations I had going into my employment journey there. They are great and offering time off and benefits that make their employees know they're valued members of the team.
good,"This is a career focused organization.  Most employees will retire from this company.  Great pay, benefits, and job satisfaction.  As the expression goes ""people leave an organization because of the management, not the company"".  This organization has its challenges, as all companies do."
good,"Great place to work overall. USAA has everything you need in the facility. Working Auto Insurance however, is stressful.  Very quick pace all day, everyday. Weekend work opportunities available but so tired from daily work you don't really want to work on the weekend unless its to play catch up prior to the start of the next week."
good,"Balance between work and life "
good,Work is challenging and fulfilling with great leadership.  Culture is professional and I have never heard of any other company that follow their mission statement more.  Great company to work for.
good,"USAA is a great company to work when it comes to benefits.  They always listen to their employees and their members and find ways to improve to accommodate the needs for everyone.  The company offers life insurance, discount for purchasing special products, wonderful benefits, and top notch 401k!  They offers education funds as well.  I didn't like how difficult it was to advanced in other job category within a company.  Another negative side is difficulty with scheduling.  In order to get your time off, you have to bid a year in advance.  And requesting time off is not flexible at all."
good,"USAA is a great place to work. The work is always evolving and you will work with some great professionals. The benefits are outstanding and include health, dental, vision, matching 401K to list a few."
good,The Mission Statement is recited before every meeting. The company goals are always brought back to The Mission Statement. USAA provides great benefits and makes the effort to enhance their employees with training and development to progress in your role or find a new role to suit your skills.
good,"USAA has a great culture. They love their members. There is great opportunity for advancement. The management seems to care about their people, Great company overall."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, my first manager was tough but she was encouraging and fair! She promoted learning and being ourselves to help members solve financial issues. The next manager was the opposite. She wanted us to imitate how she would handle members. That did not work for me."
good,A typical day will include attending meetings to provide insights on processes for newly identified risks.  Continuation of research for different areas within the company to determine risks and mitigation of those risks. 
good,This company is great to work for however it is really important to get a position in the proper department. Do not just apply to any job because if you plan to move you have to wait for a year to apply to other departments and it is very competitive so you may not even get to move after that year.
good,"a challenging call center environment. fast- paced. customer support and assistance while showing empathy, understanding, and enthusiastic manner. go usaa"
good,I enjoyed the first day all the way to my last. My job was what I made it. The Calls are back to back but you learn so much about the members and why they feel entitled.  The wok hours were my issue after training they promised flexibility to those in need but I wasn't looked at as a person with a reason to switch from night back to day. Management has their picks but what job doesn't. It was a peaceful environment. I would go back if i could work 10-7 again oh and got off early or Saturdays
good,Usaa is a great company to work for. The benefits are amazing and life/work balance is always a priority. It is a huge company so you have to get in where you fit in. Advancement could be a waiting game.
good,"I enjoyed working at USAA, the pay and benefits were good. Annual pay raises were usually very low but we always got an annual bonus."
good,"typical day at work was staying on the phone to answer any incoming phone call coming into the queue. helping all members with request to quote and issue auto, home and valuables. assisting customers with any and all questions concerning property and casualty policies."
good,"Typical day at work is buys & fulfilling"
good,"I started in collections at USAA when this department was still in it's infancy so I didn't have many co-workers to begin with. The people were great and friendly and driven by success. I learned how to communicate with customers when dealing with delicate situations like finances as I would collect on credit card, auto loan and home loans. There wasn't much time to mingle with co-workers as the job was 100% phone calls. The hardest part of the job was finding creative ways to help customers find solutions to their debt. The best part would be when an agreement was made for payment and customers were happy to be back on the right track."
good,"USAA is growth oriented and employee focused. Results are a key focus and they will provide the support in any area you need help with. One on One coachings once a week just to talk about your progress, concerns, and questions."
good,"Good.  "
good,"Pros:"
good,overall great company. They really take care of you and want a healthy lifestyle. I just think they need to staff for the future and not wait until its too late.
good,"show up to work on time, clock in, go to your computer desk, answer incoming calls, no sales, no up selling. Ive learned so much about insurance even passed the certified insurance test to be registered in 18 states. co-workers are great everybody has a positive attitude. the hardest part of the job, is the high call volume, and the notes you have to type in within the call. the most enjoyable aspect of my job, is that it is consistent and you will get a honest paycheck."
good,"Working with USAA has given me the best opportunity of assisting our Military Forces.  With all that they are dealing with it gives me great comfort that I am there to help them when they need that assistance.  When they are getting deployed and are needing help with banking and just advice we are there to listen and make their transition easy ."
good,"Very relaxed environment, easy going environment for the full time employees. Lots of exciting project going on and they are growing in Plano location."
good,"Located off of Fredricksburg, the main entrance to the plush gardens of USAA don't do the place justice until you are driving along the backroads of the sealed off compound. With ample parking for all employees and a dozen different entrances, this idyllic environment hosts three separate cafeterias, two gyms and even a nursery for small children."
good,"USAA takes really good care of it's employees. The bonuses are a plus! Management always makes sure employees are shown appreciation for hard work. Job security is also a positive. With the economy the way it is, USAA is growing every day so you know your job is secured."
good,"Great company with wonderful benefits package, career advancement and culture."
good,"Be ok with change cause there is change everyday. People are nice, friendly."
good,"The training process for Financial Foundations Associate is extremely intense and you do not secure your job until you have passed certification about 10 weeks after the start date. The company is wonderful and overall has wonderful members but this position is not for everyone. The environment on the call floor leaves you feeling lonely at most times since you only meet with your team once a week, as long as call volumes are not too high. If you love face to face interaction this is not the position for you."
good,My department was a call center so my work consisted of answering incoming phone calls from members to answer questions or make changes to their insurance policies.
good,"A typical day at work involved answering heavy phone queue, and providing superior, knowledgeable service."
good,Great company to work for that loves on their employees (family) and customers equally with a stellar benefits package. Fast paced work setting with great advancement potential.
good,"Overall a good place to work, the culture is great.  Would recommend to others.  I learned many skill sets while employed here, and intend on continuing to learn more."
good,USAA is a wonderful company to work for. They really take the time to develop you personally and have such a wonderful mission for serving those who serve our country.
good,i love working the experience was eye opening on how usaa treat the members good. Being on the phones all day and listening to some members stories through the military gives you appreciate on them
good,"A call center environment so most days expect a lot of incoming calls, take each claim as far as possible while on the phone call. I learned accuracy, problem solving, customer service, and so much work. Management is great and very understanding. Work culture is amazing, with relaxation rooms, great view at Commerce office, walking trail, gym, great cafeteria. The hardest part of the job is when the calls are back to back and you get no breaks in between. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with."
good,Working for the military is an wonderful honor. USAA is a company either you love it or you hate it. I find 99% of the employees love it because all share the mission of the company.
good,"USAA is a great place to work and the several opportunities employees have while working there is amazing.  However, although the expectations should be the same for employees across the board, sometimes they are not and they change from one week to the next - sometimes even day to day.  I was apart of my manager's first team ever and at the beginning he seemed to know exactly what he was doing and upheld his expectations of everyone.  However, over time those expectations started to change and his favoritism started to show.  It was quite unfortunate.  I love my job overall.  I just wish it was more consistent for all employees and managers/districts and that there was not so much calamity when it comes to the workplace."
good,"I truly enjoy working for USAA, a great place for growth opportunity.  I had the pleasure as a contractor to work in two different departments and it was/is a great experience."
good,"Great place to work, care about employees and family, great benefits/pay, development/promotional opportunities, pay for performance, values diversity and inclusion, some of the most talented people I've had the pleasure to work with. Lives the Core Values of the company all are help accountable to the Code of Conduct no matter what position they are in within the organization."
good,"awesome place to work with amazing core values and amazingly friendly employees. calls can be back to back, however, very rewarding. company treats their employees really well."
good,"We can learn many things in USAA."
good,"USAA is a company very focused on doing what's right for the membership. Flexible work schedules are available depending on departments and business needs."
good,"I enjoyed working at USAA, but it was not the job for me. I loved the culture and the environment, but I got bored very fast. I have many years of management experience behind me and I was hired on as entry level. There was room for advancement, but you had to have your degree and I am still working on mine. It was almost as if my work experience was not enough."
good,"The communication between management and different job titles could improve greatly. While I was here, there was a hiring freeze in my department. So there was not a lot of growth available in my area."
good,First thing i learned is not only the part of my job but my life.I learned to be in patience all times which helped me to acheive lot of stuff personally and professionally.
good,"Fast paced environment, need to be ready for change. On average 3-5 managers a year. Plenty of things to do on campus like shopping, gym, pool tables, restaurants, tennis, volleyball etc."
good,"Company is definitely very employee and customer oriented. The job is very demanding, but definitely rewarding if hard work is put in consistently. Not for people who do not prefer a call center environment."
good,A typical day at work is 10 hours on the phone taking service and sales calls. 9 out of 10 managers are amazing leaders. The culture is driven by optimistic happy employees. Hardest part of the job is getting a good work schedule due to the number of highly tenured employees. You will have to work at USAA for at least 15-20 years to get Christmas or Thanksgiving week off.
good,"I was a contractor there. It is a great company to work for, lot of stuff happening. This organization is growing at fast pace and is good for folks who want to grow quick up the chain, well if you got the skills"
good,exciting work environment. It' s quite difficult to grow due to their small size of employees and vacancies.  they operate like family and you always feel the team support
good,"A terrific wonderful company with outstanding benefits starting from day one.  Training is ongoing, paid for. Many , many opportunuties for growth, limited only by one's own personal goals but it is a call service center bottom line."
good,"Work should be puntual all the time,Never be delay for everything... the most enjoyable part of the work is honesty... My co-workers is very helpful for every target."
good,USAA is member focused and most times that can get in the way of employee satisfaction. The position is rewarding and the benefits are top-notch. The amenities are phenomenal but only if you have time to enjoy them.
good,I really enjoyed working for USAA.  It is an organization that truly cares for its members and employees.  I learned some of the best leadership and customer service skills from having worked there.
good,Helping the military family with their needs from auto insurance to health insurance. I learn that if you truly have a conversation with members you can learn what they really. My co-workers were having to work with it felt like we were a family.
good,"Good place to work. Large office and good benefits for employees only. Not contractors but."
good,"Very family oriented, great work/life balance"
good,"Most positions will require you to be on the phone, so essentially this is a call center.  The clients are (mostly) amazing so I did enjoy speaking to them, but the sales direction of the company has changed quite a bit over the past 10 years.  Expect to be required to upsell."
good,"A typical day involved being available to receive incoming calls to handle customer requests and/or complaints.  These calls could literally be back to back."
good,"It was an honor to assist members of our community who fight for us. The work is stressful, but at the end of the day we're supporting them."
good,I Worked at USAA as contractor on 6 month project in a consulting capacity. I must say USAA is a very unique place compared to other financial institutions. USAA is very flexible with contractors and promotes a good and safe working environment. I also had the opportunity to work remotely in many instances which is very uncommon in many other financial institutions.
good,"My experience there so far has been great. I’ve been with the company for about a year now. They take very seriously the protection and security of their members. The culture is great, and I’ve met some amazing coworkers that I’m happy to call my friends. But the HOURS!!! The newly hired adjusters get great schedules, but my team is stuck on third shift. Not a very fair practice. Tenure means nothing"
good,"Very professional, a lot of politics to work around and network. Managers and Directors are Amazing leaders. All on the job training which can be difficult."
good,"I was not actually employed with USA Federal Savings Bank.  I was a contract employee through Sutherland Global Sevices."
good,"Call center job can be tough, but working for a great company.  Do have to make certain goals and can be stressful.  Overall the benefits and the members we serve makes it worth it."
good,"P&C and Claims are very stressful departments. The company treats each employee very professionally. USAA's home office in San Antonio, Tx is an unbelievable complex. Multiple gyms, cafeterias and company store."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the military and their families to ensure their financial security. I enjoyed being the point of contact that they depend on to get their loan application processed.
good,Best company I ever worked for.  Great benefits. Great if you are a member because they go above and beyond for their members.
good,"USAA is a great place. A typical day at work means a high volume of inbound calls. It is, as the description suggested, a call center. The training is excellent, by far the most structured training I have ever gone through. Management is a hit or miss, some are great, other not so much. "
good,"The company itself really is amazing. The managers and higher-ups genuinely care about the USAA customers as well as their own employees. I loved my colleagues and my manager was amazing. "
good,Great place to work love my mangers they were great to work with each day the job was pretty good when it cam to training. When my grandmother passed they were very understanding.
good,"Ethical issue not identified by management led to early termination of contract.  Management should have been more aware of the situation, which impacted employment."
good,"Great company, however, very little room for advancement across the company. They unfortunately carry a reputation of being strict and micromanaging, which they are not.  This is a great place to work, however, ensure you apply to a job you would like to do long term because they have little time to cross train to allow employees to venture their career throughout the company."
good,Just be careful of management.   If you are not used to the Call Center life this is not the job for you.  There is no work/life balance and to get a new schedule will be a chore.
good,USAA is a great company to work for. The benefits are amazing and they really take care of their employees. There are many corporate events that include the whole family.
good,"USAA is a wonderful place to work as we serve the military and their families; however the ability to advance is very slim.  Experience is not a major factor in promotions.  The hardest part of the job is completing your work as you are not allowed any time off the phone to investigate claims, type letters, review policies or make out-bound calls.  You are constantly in ""auto-in"" and the inbound calls come back to back without a second in between due to constant staffing issues.  There appears to be a very large turn around in this position.  It is not a situation where one feels they are set up to succeed.  The facility is beautiful and has great amenities if one can find the time to enjoy them.  Everyone at the company has tenure and newer experienced employees are not treated with any respect for their prior knowledge or work experience.  Regardless of experience, education, etc. you begin the job here as a ""grunt"" and it is near impossible to advance."
good,"This says I have to put 20 words about this employer, when I have already done so. I enjoy my pay, but not the work culture or management. If you work hard you will move up quickly. I would not recommend this employer as a place to make a lifelong career."
good,"I worked as a non-injury claims adjuster. Most of their practices are industry standard, you're tied to your phone, scheduled breaks and lunch, aux time, etc. Work load was unmanageable, claims get assigned regardless of what you already have. Have to stay on the phone and work on existing claims at the same time. If you can't make outbound calls in between inbound - oh well. Manager didn't have a family - didn't care about unexpected situations, marked unscheduled as negative... Cafeteria was nice (not free, but nice) they have quiet rooms, game rooms fitness center and our facility had a day care for employees, I couldn't use it due to conflicting schedule, but it's nice that they offered it."
good,"After 10 years working for this company I can to the following conclusions."
good,"low pay expectations high poor management .... repetitive position, entire department unhappy, no advancement opportunities"
good,USAA provides their employees an excellent work-life balance and follow-on education opportunities.  The work they do is challenging and rewarding and allows you the ability to see the fruits of your labor.
good,"My 6+ years with them has been great. I have grown and had meet effective coaches that guided me to move up my career ladder. I started taking phone calls in the call center, the promoted as a senior. Did a rotation with training then became a business advisor because of my performance."
good,"Team meetings, customer service phone calls, learning new programs. Truly was a great company to work with and I gained a lot of skills from working there."
good,USAA emphasizes the customer in every action. That starts with taking care of their employees to ensure that employees feel empowered to help customers the way they need to.
good,Good company that attempts to take care of its members and employees. Decent benefits and chances to bonus. Overall good company to work that tries to put the USAA mission first and take care of the military community
good,"USAA is one of the greatest companies I have had the privilege to work for.  Excellent training, benefits, work environment, and mission of a company."
good,Be prepared to work.  The territories are throughout the state but the company is fair.  I enjoyed my time at the company.  Needed a change of pace.  I would work there again in a smaller territory
good,"I worked in the Wealth Management Department:  female manager  in charge of temporary employees was very difficult to work with; she would get feedback on employees from one of her moles who listened in and watched, then reported back to her - was not professional."
good,"The culture of USAA is so well grounded into the entire sales and operational plans, performance management standards and employee recognition programs that all employees can clearly articulate the mission and understand the ""why"" USAA does what it does."
good,"A typical day started for me at 9:30 until 6:00 or later depending on last call received. This included a 20 minute morning and evening break with a 35 minute lunch. With it being a call center environment we were constantly on the phone helping members with their insurance needs. A very rewarding however sometimes daunting depending on the member's situation, overall a great place to work."
good,"Amazing company, great customer service, pay is on the low side. Hours were good and management is great. Work is expected and with several military personal people just get the job done!"
good,Best place to work - Culture is amazing and the people are great!   Benefits cannot be matched anywhere!   Very military and family friendly. Great paternity leave program
good,"Great benefits, great management and support of everyone."
good,"The best company I've ever worked for.  USAA is excellent in many facets.  However, what stands out the most is that they go above and beyond to help their employees balance their life and work.  They also take the time to ""listen"" to their employees."
good,"Great place to work, always investing in new or improved projects, systems and processes. Overall great culture but can be extremely over collaborative to the point it slows down decision making."
good,"When I worked there I worked in the call center as a claims adjuster for auto losses. The work load was overwhelming, at times very stressful and there was nothing done about it. You just had to take it."
good,I had a great experience working at USAA. Would highly recommend this company to anyone who is willing to work hard and push themselves to achieve their goals.
good,I enjoyed the challenges that each day brought. My coworkers are exceptional people and I miss them very much. USAA brought such joy to my life with it's community focused culture.
good,Working at USAA really is a dream. My manger and team genuinely want me to succeed and reach my career goals. The benefits and amenities rival the most sought after employers in the nation.
good,"I was a contractor for my time here. I actually moved out to San Antonio to work here. I loved working here because I met good people, of course there were some bad ones."
good,"There is a lot of flexibility in this role."
good,This is a great company to work for. Not only do they take care of their members they take care of their employees just as much. I highly recommend this company.
good,"I absolutely loved working for USAA. I would go back if I could. I moved and couldn't work remotely at the time. The benefits, atmosphere, and the people are all amazing."
good,"Going above for those who have gone beyond , helped military members as well as their families with their auto insurance policies. Excellent experience , , everyone should look into this company"
good,Great management teams and benefits. good people and great work culture for those who care about taking care of customers and their needs.  I would recommend USAA
good,I had an amazing experience here!  The culture is untouchable in my opinion and the opportunities to learn and grow are outstanding. And there is always an opportunity for advancement.
good,"Great company to work for and they not only care about their members, but they also care greatly about their employees as well. Beautiful office with lots of amenities."
good,"loved to work here and i just needed to relocate back to Michigan for family. but it s overall an excellent place to live for sure!"
good,"Awesome Company I loved everything about them.  There is absolutely nothing in the entire world that I would change.  They have ping pong tables, and an awesome cafe."
good,"nice place. good location. good people. decent salary.  Work hard, play hard. Benefits so-so. That's about it.  casual dress. food provided sometimes..........."
good,"This is very nice place to work. You have very good scope and future in TCS. Management is also good and you get proper review comments. "
good,"its been a long time since working here, but I always have loved the company. I remember it fondly, and there was always excellent employee perks, etc. It is a genuinely employee/service member organization."
good,the company had very good environment and people feel proud to be part of the company.and it had many  branches all over the world.it provides great privilege for us.
good,Workplace is good.Enjoyed working at VISA.Nice team I have got to work with.The harest part of the Job is to please our Client.
good,Overall had the best few years working here. I learned many new skills from administrative management to improved customer service skills. The hardest part of this job I would have to say is leaving. But what I enjoyed the most was the people I worked with and how a team effort made all the difference in the workplace.
good,"Great place to work, learning at its best and loved being there every moment."
good,"This was my first insurance job.  I learned so much about insurance, investigating auto claims and written and oral communication at USAA."
good,"Great company culture. Promotes from within. Large pool of talented and devoted employees. "
good,Plenty of opportunity to grow within the company.  Wonderful benefits.  Great work/life balance.  A lot of support from upper management as well as peer support.
good,"Pay was good."

good,"USAA made the decision to close their Norfolk, VA office.  We were provided the opportunity to relocate to either TX, CO,AZ,FL or retire. "
good,"Usaa allows you to have great benefits and overall great flexibility. Constantly evolving workload, so you have to stay on top of your career. They do offer fantastic benefits and take great care of their employees."
good,"USAA really is an amazing place to work,great pay,  great benefits, great work-life balance, and great flexibility. Management was ok but needs to work on being transparent."
good,Very important job serving military members.  Very interesting and enjoyable work.  Loved my co-workers.  Difficult decision to leave because of family issues.
good,"Applies expert knowledge of the business, mortgage, home equity, consumer lending and credit cards. Experience managing complex, proven use of critical thinking skills."
good,I assisted with incoming calls from members which needed assistance with their banking products. I enjoyed how well employees are treated and their open door policy. I have no complains about USAA. Most enjoyable part of the Job was being part of a company that serves those who serve our country.
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. Fun contests in some departments. Really wonderful cafeteria. Only downside was it is a call center and you are ALLWAYS on the phone."
good,It was a great place to work. the team I was on were supportive and knowledgeable. Mt manager was awesome and did everything we needed to complete our daily task
good,Great company and mission.  Collaborative workforce and family oriented.  Membership is extremely important and the basis for all strategic and operational plans.
good,"helped customer with their banking needs, checked funds avail., investments, ira, open new accounts based on customer needs, that's about it"

good,"highly recommend USAA as a great place to work"
good,i learned how to empathize with customers and what they go through to take care of their families. Have a better understanding of the sacrifice that military families make to protect out country
good,"Resolve client queries regarding insurance policies, claims and payment formalities"
good,I would like to work for USAA again. I have my car insurance with them. They have great customer service.
good,Great Employer! Phenomenal work place. Great beneifts package. Understanding work/life balance.
good,"I like the fact that it was a company based on the specific needs of the military & their families. Offered many services and was ""family"" orientated."
good,Great place to work.  Go to meetings and run projects for IT compliance.
good,USAA is a wonderful company to work for. Management is always pushing to excel.
good,Every day I looked forward to going to work. I love what I did and the people I interacted with.
good,"This was one of the most outstanding companies I have worked for. I would help people with mortgages, refinancing, credit card programs and credit repair. I liked that the company took such great care of the employees. The hardest part of my job was constantly being tied to a phone. The best part of my job was the team members that I worked with."
good,Planning to relocate to the Seattle area to join my wife who is a Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington Medical School and continue with my financial services career.
good,My typical day at work was coming in and being greeted by everyone. worked in a call center environment so myself and co-workers sat  at workstations.  used computer 90% of the time and talked to our military members who were involved in automobile accidents
good,USAA values their customer as well as their employees and returns dividends to members and gives bonuses to employees
good,"A typical day at work included processing refinance loans. I was responsible for completing and verifying financial information on loan applications. I had to  look over the application files and contact verification sources such as credit bureaus, sellers and buyers’ employers to make sure the information was thorough, accurate and met individual loan specifications.  The data I collected confirmed  type of mortgage, terms of the loan and a buyer’s assets and income. I also had to correct data errors and obtain missing information when necessary."
good,Great company. It was a great experience to work for this company and learn so much about products and how to serve customers and close loans
good,My typical day consists of assisting members with their immediate needs as well as educating them with additional products USAA has to offer that may fit their current or future situation. I have developed the skillset of building trust within a small window of opportunity which allows me close the business. The management staff is extremely supportive and that truly fosters the progression of the company. My co workers and I share ideas and assist one another with pertinent information at times which may be viable to concluding the call whenever our manager isn't available. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure that you log off the phone on time for scheduled breaks and lunches. There are times that I find myself assisting members  beyond the start of my break because customers are a direct reflection of the reasons we are here. The most enjoyable part of the job are the team building exercises that are designing to help boost moral so that you can be at your best every time the phone rings.
good,"USAA is a private financial services company which sells P&C and life insurance, banking and investment management products to active duty service members, prior service military, and their families.  The company focuses on providing high value products to this niche market while maintaining financial independence from the capital markets."
good,"Working  for USAA was great.  I learned a lot in the short amount of time I worked there.  My typical work day was arriving to the office to see friendly co-workers & a manager who showered us with positive attitudes."
good,USAA is a great place to work and have a bond with co-workers. You can learn every aspect of insurance for vehicles and also homes and personal items as well. The hardest part of the job is being able to understand that USAA has members and they love the company and passion that USAA brings to them. That is what I love about the job and the company.
good,"A typical day at USAA keeps me very busy.  I spoke on the phone, provided exceptional customer service, and issued or amended automobile insurance policies every day.  I also attended intensive training in order to accurately and successfully provide the best service possible.  I learned all about insurance, which I had very little knowledge of before my employment.  My managers were amazing and encouraging.  They were always available to provide insight and support.  My co-workers and I were able to support each other, answer each others questions, and celebrate our successes together.  "
good,•Direct onshore and offshore project work plans for client releases and enhancements.
good,"Upon my initial employment, I worked minor auto accident claims. Within a few years, I advanced twice to a Senior Claims Rep. working more difficult cases. Applying, and being accepted to the Auto Claims Training Specialist was my favorite job. Teaching new employees became a love of mine. I taught everything from contracts, phone courtesy, computer skills, and investigation of auto claims. My employment with USAA was cut short because of a PCS move with the military."
good,Great place to work. A typical day at work is helping customers with their bank accounts and collecting on past due credit cards.
good,"This is a great company to work for. The only problem is I was under a very poor manager who perfered male employees. The company takes care of their employees and its members. Salarey was okay, not great. I reccomend this company to anyone and everyone."
good,"great place to work, good people, fun working conditions. the hardest part was heavy phone volume, but you learn to adjust."
good,Great company just a pressure cooker everyday of someone looking over your shoulder. Got a lot of training that was great and fun.
good,Unless you enjoy sitting and speaking to people on the phone all day and no face to face interaction with anyone this would not be the company for you
good,"The best company I have ever worked for. Very friendly employees and wonderful members. USAA really does instill the ""We Know what it means to Serve!""."
good,USAA is an excellent place to work that provides many educational and career opportunities.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, trabajar arduamente, puntualidad, cordialidad"
good,The company is great. The job itself can be overwhelming. Working in a call center environment is tedious while also working your own claims and meeting their expe
good,"Customer service has ridiculous requirements that are almost impossible to maintain. If you do not maintain, you are written up. Very stressful and purely numbers driven."
good,Working for USAA has definitely increase my financial stability. As long as you have a great manager you have job security. The benefits in house are awesome cafeteria gym childcare and they drowned you and USAA swag. The only complaint is there's not much work-life balance the are mandatory scheduled shift bids that you cannot opt out of and have no choice.
good,"Non injury adjuster very stressful job position and micromanaged. Would work at USAA again in a heart beat just not as an adjuster. Management sticks together and word spreads quick whether bad or good. Benefits, Bonuses, and pay good."
good,Very fun company to work with but the pipelines are low and unless you are befriended with your manager there's no possibly of growth. Great benefitss
good,Great company but I was pigeon holed into a very technical hard to replace position and supervised by someone I did not have confidence in much less considered a mentor.
good,"Great Company just wished the compensated the employees a little better for salary. Great bonus, some management is to political, hard to move up unless you know the right people in the right area"
good,"Working at USAA was unbelievable-- the sheer scope of the place, as well as the professionalism of people working there, is unparalleled. The campus is a universe unto itself, and has everything imaginable. "
good,"Daily I would make corrections to member personal information, resolve billing concerns, advise members on coverage and how they worked while telling them how they could save money on the benefits provided by the auto insurance. management was very regimented and was not very flexible. My co-workers were easy enough to work with, I never had a problem with anyone. the hardest part of the job was being micromanaged. The best part of the job was resolving customers concerns and putting members at ease."
good,"Excellent company to work for, Lots of opportunity for growth in the Mortgage Industry in other locations such as San Antonio, Phoenix & Tampa. The Addison location is relatively new and still working through challenges."
good,"I had a 7-3 shift - answer phones. "
good,Worked in a call center enviornment where the main focus was answeing in-bound property claims calls.  The backup duty was to work and adjust the claims we took off of those calls.  The job also included taking and returning all voicemails and emails from the members whose claims we were working as well as maintaning our personal USAA email with the company. This job is multi-tasking to the 100th degree.  The hardest part of the job was hearing about the unfortunate incidents the members were incurring on a daily basis but the benefit of that was being able to make them whole again through the claims process.
good,"No advancement opportunities, but that is only because I am working through a Third Party."
good,"Insurance sales for auto, rental & home"
good,"This is a great company, with great values and service. The membership makes this company. The service is excecptional and the employees are treated very well with yearly bonuses as well as company picnics, dinners, parties, etc."
good,This company offers great ethics regarding what needs to be done and how it needs in order to get a job done. Management is very approachable and are always open to listen to different opinions and ways of working.
good,The job uncertainty right now at USAA is extremely high. The company continues to take hit after hit. Many changes have occurred and foresee many more in the near future. Not the mission or culture I was hired in at this time.
good,The workplace environment and culture were two things about USAA that remained steadfast in excellence during my employment. I was treated well and recognized for my hard work.
good,"This was a great place to work at first, but over the years there have been too many changes with our roles and the metrics were getting harder to achieve."
good,"Great overall company to work for. Overall, many negative changes are impacting mortgage/banking which caused a lot of cuts/terminations. Other areas of USAA is solid and can be a amazing career."
good,Member is always right. No matter what. Even if they are wrong. They will go over your boss’s boss head to get their way. Did not like that part of the job.
good,It was a great place to work.  it is still a call center and USAA is going through growing pains.  it is becoming better and better every year but when I was there it was difficult to have a good work/family balance.  They are not very flexible when it comes to shifts and time off even if you have the PTO.  It's a call center.
good,"Gigantic Campus, very secure. professional enough work place internally if not a contract employee. Management style unique of site management depending highly on contract employee feed back that is not properly trained to do so."
good,"It is a fast pace, highly stress work environment which requires you to work more than your typical 40 hour week. I did learn a lot with working with USAA."
good,I learned a great deal about fraud and how to try and protect my identity with social media. It's best when a person does not put all their info online
good,"Call center jobs require you to be on the phone for atleast 8 hours a day. Some managers are more micro managers than others. One office that I worked for was my USAA family and the other office was horrible, which is what drove me to quit."
good,"this company will not recognize experience from previous jobs with regards to management positions unless you have a degree.  There are great benefits and bonuses each year are awesome, but unless you obtain your degree you will not advance into management."
good,Very nice place to work.  Being a Contractor you are not included in functions that the employees are.  People are friendly and environment is very nice. Only worked there 6 months and would have rather been an employee.
good,"This is really the best place to work..family and friendly environment."
good,"Giving back to the military community and the overall environment of always wanting to help our members. When you help someone at one of their most important times in their life and they recognize you for it, it is a great feeling."
good,"If you like working for a company who micromanages you all day, then that's the place for you."
good,"USAA has a great culture, they believe in their commitment to the member.  Very refreshing, positive culture.  Work life balance is fair, and compensation is fair as well."
good,USAA is a great company to work for. They provide their employees with the best benefits any company could offer.
good,"I love working for USAA as a contractor through Teletech. we have very high call volumes, and typically great members who are willing to work with us - Some members dont like some of the wait times or the answers we have for them. We do what we have to to make our members feel that they have been taken care of."
good,"Great place to work however the management is very unpredictable, and have an empire building mentality"
good,learn new skill sets and applications daily
good,"Great place to work, they really care about there employees.    They model there facility after Google so everything is top of the class.  Great pay and culture."
good,There is a lot of room for opportunity. Great pay and benefits. Hardwork is recognized by as all companies there are politics involved. Come in with a strong work ethic and you'll go places.
good,"Positive workplace where you have at ability to demonstrate your computer skills. You learn how to multi-task, enjoyable management team, positive employees"
good,its a good place to work for and also a good culture which is encouraged by the management. Cafteria's amd game rooms everywhere and also a nap room to help you rest
good,"Great company to work for, lots of focus on personal growth. Extremely willing for employees to take chances and try new things. The work-life balance is wonderful as a designer."
good,It's as professional as it comes. High stress but they give you all the necessary tools to accomplish your task. Every individual has to be motivated or you will not succeed.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the engagement with the members.  It was rewarding to assist the military community with their financial needs.
good,"Great company to work for, work life balance and great benefits for employees. Opportunities for advancement. The organization is mission driven and focused on taking care of the members"
good,financially solid but not much upside financially. annual bonus not tied to specific production. Management opportunities are minimal without a advanced degree. Culture is extremely well defined.
good,"Excellent benefits. Onsite fitness centers. Covered Parking for employees. Can be stressful, depending on  the department you are in. Pays for training classes."
good,"fun place to work "
good,Great place to work at and great company culture.  I learned that going from being a contractor to getting a full time position is more challenging than I anticipated.
good,"Results oriented, need to improve communication, better link to business for feedback on candidates, work culture collaborative, continuous improvement"
good,Highly mission-oriented work environment.  Management is generally supportive of employees.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the general comraderie. Hardest part about the job are the IT difficulties and lack of data technology.
good,Love the company.  I am a USSA member for life. A day in the life of an insurance can be very rewarding.  With insurance you are working to help people secure their future.
good,"Leadership is former military and the culture is formal and politically charged, the pace is slow and steady. This highly corporate environment can lead to group think and outdated processes. If risk aversion is your goal, this company is right for you."
good,"This company truly puts its employees first. They believe in making sure the employee is healthy and well in order for the membership to be serviced with respect, quality, and immediate results."
good,A typical work day would be receiving a pipeline in the morning and calling members as well as realtors to collect information to move mortgage loan forward to processing.
good,"You wont get paid in line with the industry average however management does try to make up for it with all the benefits and at the facility upgrades."
good,the managers were really relaxed and nice but they did have their favorites. their favorites got more hours and easier work than the other temps. the managers will say they will recommend you for a position but it doesnt hold much weight.
good,Worked with Problem Management and Technical teams to create technical debriefs and identify follow up actions on all SEV1 events and events deemed critical by upper management.
good,"I got extreme satisfaction from helping our members and learning more about the military culture.  I learned how to manage my own financial situation, but I am definitely not a call-center kind of person.  I left USAA to pursue teaching, but I would go back to USAA in a heartbeat after I retire from teaching."
good,"You'll love working with USAA, it's mission, culture, and focus on taking care of our United States Military and their families gives you an excellent opportunity for a developing career"
good,"USAA is a great company to work for, with outstanding work/life balance and friendly employees.  USAA struggles with promoting those with leadership skills over those that have been in the company for long periods of time, often times overlooking military experience and leadership."
good,I enjoy the fact that I am able to speak to and help former military and their families regarding their insurance and financial needs.
good,"USAA is a great company to work for with amazing benefits for their employees.  The USAA Tampa, FL office is a great place to work and the USAA Management team is always there for you."
good,"typical day work be opening and servicin accounts for members ."
good,this was a great company to work for i loved every aspect about this job mainly cause i got to help our military when they got home.
good,"Claims was a different type of job. You were on the phone all day, mulit-tasking, and handling customers over the phone after a car accident, some were serious, some were minor."
good,"Usaa is a wonderful place to work. I have a relaxed enviroment, and loving co workers."
good,The work place is very encouraging with a lot of manager support and flexibility. I would say that they lack the ability to have a great work/life balance but for the most part they are understanding about family issues.
good,Benefits are great but the work life balance needs someadjusting. There is a lot of stress that is involved at usaa. They do have some nice gyms and extra curricular activities to help releive stress but you cant be weak minded.
good,"Fast paced work, training and continued OJT.  Focused on innovation and continued education.  Empathy and seeking solutions are a large focus.  Business casual dress code."
good,"Arrive in the morning, no need to stop anywhere, everything you need is there. Most managers were friendly and helpful. Everyone loves being there.  Hardest part was having equipment that you needed to work not work. And of course the most enjoyable part of the job were the people you are working with"
good,I have a very enjoyable experience. I am happy to have worked there and they supported though personal things. If I still lived in Arizona  I would have continued to work there
good,"I worked for USAA for 21 years so I saw a ton of changes over the years, some good some not so good.  The company as a whole is wonderful.  Great benefits and opportunities for advancement and change.  The only downfalls I had in 21 years were that they didn't view corporate training as a career, only a stepping stone to management.  Not everyone wants to be a manager, I loved being a trainer and helping people.  The other downfall was the management team in the Colorado Springs office did not know how to recognize and capitalize on an employees strengths.  My strength was helping and teaching my fellow employees based on my 20+ years with the company, not cross selling outside of the property & casualty lines of business.  I was not of the salesman mind but since I couldn't sell like others I was kept from being on the help line but those who could sell ice to eskimo's were promoted to the help line.  Management put so much pressure on me that I ended up out on stress leave when all they needed to do was place the employees in the positions that capitalized on their strengths.  They fired  days short of my 21st anniversary with the company.  Too bad, I loved the company."
good,"I have enjoyed working at USAA.  Unfortunately they hire a lot of contractors, and it is not always easy to get on fulltime.  If you need benefits, make sure you find a good staffing agency."
good,"Overall great experience. Talented people, great opportunities and outstanding benefits. However, too much of office politics. Too many people letting power and ego get the better of them."
good,"Its a family type of culture there. A lot of resources for employees to grow personally and professionally. It can be stressful at times but there are resting areas and an onsite workout facility to help decrease the stress. Overall, its a family type of feel place."
good,Great family/work balance and great benefits. Flexible schedules and awesome recreational sports leagues. Opportunity for advancement and opportunities within different departments.
good,"Great place to work. I felt very valued. Great retirement plans 401 K match"
good,"USAA takes great care of its employees.  Though I don't regret leaving back in 2001, I have yet to work for a better company.  They treated me well.  Highly recommended"
good,"It's a great company with great benefits. Health, 401k, and tuition assistance is all great. Can be somewhat difficult to make any moves laterally within the company which does confine you to a single aspect of the business."
good,"I was a contractor at USAA, and was given great opportunities to advance.  However, when I was offered a fulltime position, the salary was much lower than what I expected."
good,"The mission to serve the military, their families and associates is very inspirational.  I appreciated the opportunities to do meaningful work, as well as volunteer in organized community service events.  Expectations are high, but so are the rewards!"
good,"happy with company / personal family emergency caused separation."
good,"If you are a veteran, USAA will be very comfortable place to work. Management is a very tough position to have here. Where as management treats their employees very well,  they do not treat other managers the same. Very little collaboration between departments. I believe this is not the culture the CEO"
good,Interested l fun at night but when you get home you get to know say something about to go home I’ll let y’all in and on that weekend and I’ll come get back in and get some rest and
good,"Was a great place to work until department closed down in Largo, FL. PSI (USAA) closed due to having to pay out too many claims during hurricane erma.."
good,"The culture at USAA is military based, as they serve the insurance needs of Military Personnel.  It is structured and there is an air of positive discipline that permeates."
good,"USAA is a wonderful company to work for. The benefits are absolutely amazing and so are the core values. It is wayyyyy too competitive though. Basically, if you don’t have a degree, you’ll be stuck in entry level until you get one, or you’re there for 10 years. I understand wanting us to strive for higher education, but keeping us in a low income job where 500 people are competing for one open spot (just within the company, thousands are applying who are not with the company yet) is just absolutely absurd. You can work 20 times harder and your stats could be 100% better than someone with a bachelors, yet they get the position over you. I’m all about higher education, but make it more fair."
good,"Fast paced, goal driven company.  Company says it is not goal driven, but it is.  Goals are based on incoming calls and can be skewed by wrong numbers, hang ups, and misdirected calls."
good,"Tuition reimbursement and great benefits , lots of perks, gym reimbursement, allowed to work remotely, outside training was covered .  Maternity benefits are awesome,"
good,I was sad to leave USAA. They were a great employer. Many of my colleagues from that time are now in senior management positions. As with any large enterprise there were some organizational challenges.
good,USAA was an amazing company to work for. With that said they need to work on work life balance a bit more. I choose to leave to spend time with my children as well as a new born.
good,The company as a whole is pretty good. For the most part they do practice what they preach. Pay and growth can be lackluster once you get beyond entry level positions.
good,"Overall, USAA is a very good place to work.  While there was more work incoming than could reasonably be done in a normal 40 hours, it is more than made up for by a generous PTO program.  Most of the front line managers work well with their teams to ensure they grow in their jobs.  USAA is a culture of service both to the members but to one another and if you are one that just wants to ""do your job"" and not work as part of a team, this is not the place for you.  The front line employees are being asked to do a lot and to learn quickly for movement into the next levels, so there is room to grow."
good,Help members with financial security and service military families the way the should be treated. All work is to contribute to the mission and actions USAA .
good,"Nice environment with lots of ammenities"
good,"Awesome place to work, despite the wages as a contractual employee. Other then that awesome management, dress code, and culture!"
good,"The company really takes care of its employees by offering plenty of PTO, bonuses and great insurance. I have learned a lot about military culture through this wonderful company."
good,"Great pay for entry level positions. Good work culture. Opportunity to move into management available at all locations. Very few corporate jobs at regional offices, only in Texas."
good,"My typical day at work was answering calls and assisting our customers with coverage disputes, form request and obtaining important information from the customer for proper policy rating."
good,It was an amazing place to work. Co-workers really made the job enjoyable due to the sheer sense of camaraderie and willingness to help get the job done. Upper Executive Management has the right idea. I really hated to leave.
good,"Great Company with excellent Benefits for its employees. Location is not the best for our family, San Antonio is not ready for the amount of people moving to this area."
good,"I work with USAA members on the phone dealing with their insurance needs. I assist with servicing and sales of all insurance policies. I uncover unrealized needs the member my have and help facilitate their financial security. I am 100% dedicated to exceeding my members expectations to the fullest, making sure that when the call is finished that they are completely confidant in what was done."
good,"There are so mamy great things about USAA it is too difficult to pick just a few. Compensation is great, 401k match is more than any other company, the San Antonio campus is almosta city in itself."
good,"USAA is in a league of its own. This company taught me plenty on professionalism, integrity, loyalty, conflict resolution etc. The culture  is like no other company  I have ever worked for. The benefits are great."
good,"More than 75 teams"
good,"taking calls - working claims  - making liability decisions "
good,"- A typical day involves logging in to the computer and taking calls from members"
good,Wonderful company when I was there. Great pay and wonderful benefits. Hardest part of job was the politics.
good,A typical day is living by the mission. Taking care of the members needs and finding solutions for them. Hardest part of the job is when you can not help them.
good,Love working here. As a contractor I've never been treated differently as a regular employed analyst.  I will say there is no formal training. As a contractor your picked up based on your resume. So of you talk the talk.. they expect you to be what you sell yourself as. If you can't. Then look somewhere else cause they will spot you and send you on your merry way.  Many say contractors are treated unfairly. I would say that's not the case. Was a contractor I have regular employed people come to me for help and support.  I will say that if you speak up and are honest in your work and work hard you will be noticed.  I love the work environment and USAA has everything you need there.
good,USAA has given me an opportunity to grow as an employee and as a person. We provide quality loans to our country’s military community! I would recommend USAA to anyone looking for a good job.
good,"USAA is a company that cares about their employees as much as they care about their member base. The medical and program benefits that are offered for employees far exceed any company that I have ever worked for. The managers are also very involved with making sure their teams perform at their best and offer weekly performance reviews and meetings for brainstorming opportunities. If you are someone who wants to improve their career you would definitely enjoy this aspect. If you are someone who just wants to skate by and earn a paycheck, that could be an annoying aspect of the job. Managers will also do whatever they can to help you maintain your work-life balance and steer you through the process to make any job accommodations you may need to meet your job requirements. What makes this job difficult is that they are very strict with their security protocols and although the ""information is available to access"" a clear explanation is not provided of what could or could not be in compliance for employees. Given the opportunity I would reapply to USAA immediately."
good,"Enjoyable work"
good,"Nice company to work for. The pay is great, the people arent too bad and the calls are pretty easy. The day to day is that of any other call center..."
good,"USAA is a great place to work, the company cares a lot about the members we serve and the employees who work there. A typical work day, you can expect the work environment to be fast paced and friendly."
good,"USAA was one of the greatest places I have ever worked.  The environment was a bit like pleasantville but overall it was pretty cool.  The only downfall is that they promote employees to management sometimes with little to no knowledge in the departments.  I had an insurance manager who used to work in IT and had zero experience in speaking to people on the phone, when told some of his ideas wouldn't work he dug up anything he could to get me fired."
good,This was a good place to work. The only difficult piece is the referral process. Every interaction with a member meant trying to refer the member to another department. Most  members just wanted the request completed quickly and accurately.
good,"Great place to be, strong connection to the military.  The company is in a period of tremendous member growth while lagging behind in systems and hiring.  Overall great experience, would do it again in a second."
good,"Usaa is a great place to work no doubt about it, the vibe and environment could and should improve, although working at usaa did show me a lot in regards to taking automotive claims as well as handling and control the call,"
good,Great company for any Veteran. They have a great military culture. I learned that there is a lot of potential for growth but it is extremely competative.
good,USAA is a quality company to work for. They offer excellent benefits and work to provide a strong work life balance. Could not recommend them enough as a customer or employee.
good,"While the position left a little to be desired, the company itself is tough to beat.  The work/life balance was among the best I've ever experienced, and the managers are committed to seeing their employees grow as much as possible."
good,Excellent pay and benefits. Underwent extensive specialized training for licensing and career advancement. Gained valuable experience while working there.
good,Great opportunity to be able to work for USAA! It's been a great experience. Looking to see what other opportunities are out there with my financial experience and education.
good,USAA is a member owned company.  They have great products.  No fee bank accounts.  Great customer service.  Good people to work with.  Good benefits and pay.
good,Great mission serving the military and veterans.  Great opportunity for advancement if you are in San Antonio.  Great upper management and culture.   Great overall compensation package.
good,"Good people doing business honorably and for the right people.  If you don't work in a department that answers the phone, you'll love working there.  Otherwise you'll grow tired of answering calls within about 6 months.  On the plus side, there is opportunity to move around the company as well.  Most everyone on the phones wants to get off of them to non-phone jobs within the company.  It's a good sign when they want to stay, just not on the phones."
good,It is a great place to work. My team members are fantastic. We meet our goals and are rewarded. Benefits are wonderful. I wish there was more opportunity to advance in other areas.
good,"Is an inbound call center, so you would go in and sit in front of computer taking calls all day for 8 hours and sometimes longer a day. The hardest part of the job, for me, is sitting in front of a computer all day talking only on the phone with people. If you prefer talking with people face-to-face this won't be the job for you, but if you would like to hide behind a computer screen and phone all day this is the perfect job."
good,"As an FTE, USAA is a company you can't beat.  The organization is amazing both in terms of benefits to employees as well as resources and opportunities for employees.  If you're a contractor, be ready to be treated as a contractor especially if you're a threat to someone on the team."
good,Great place with awesome deserving and caring coworkers.  Management just started to nitpick and over scrutinize your activities. Loved the work environment.  Top facilities.
good,"I love USAA, my position is just a double edge sword. I feel as if I am constantly choosing between the business, its mission and the people who we are serving."
good,Regret leaving. Have not found another company with same core values and employee appreciation. This company truly believes in excellent customer service for our service members.
good,"Interned here a couple years ago(2013). I'm sure there has been many upgrades but the time I was there plenty of chill rooms, great people and opportunities to grow in your field of study."
good,"I enjoyed my time with USAA but, I am seeking a career change and while I enjoy working for USAA, the selection pool is small.  The pay is about 30% market standard but, they make for it with a very strong benefits pacage."
good,"USAA is a great workplace to start a career, there are ways to advance however it may take a while for a spot to open up.  The challenges you may face initially are days off that you want to take off if you are a new employee."
good,"USAA is a great company.  There is opportunity to continuously learn different parts of the business.  A typical workday includes leading engineers and managing key deliverables.  I have learned a lot about the business of USAA as I've moved around to different roles a lot over the years.  As a high performing leader in the company, I expected to have more autonomy.  I struggle when put in a box. The culture is very hierarchical.  On the other hand, the culture is really wrapped around who we serve and everyone lives and breathes the mission.  I love that I'm able to come to work every day with purpose."
good,"Good experience learnt a lot from this company moreover its more of friendly environment feel proud for serving army people askfasoiof asjffahsva V amfkjjQSFBa,m,sv KFJSDFFV"
good,cubicle call center. phone all day non stop. Assists members with transactions on their auto/property policy. Management is great. Everyone willing to help. On site food court and gym make it easy to balance life on the go.
good,"USAA is a great company to work for. Outstanding job security and the benefits are really what make working here worth it. Progression is slow and tenure based, but the workload while being in that grind is not all that heavy. USAA for me was more of a place that enabled me to figure out everything else. The job itself was always easy, but the different certifications you can take, groups you can be a part of, networking available and the tuition assistance really allows gives you all the opportunities to make you feel progression. May not be everyone's experience but I had awful management. The management team (my manager in particular) are not very accountable, coaching sessions are a joke and this combined with the slow progression are what led me to look elsewhere. "
good,"The culture is very energetic and positive."
good,The work culture in the Phoenix office is amazing. It is very collaborative and supportive. The campus is beautiful and employees are provided tools they need as well as escape rooms when needed.
good,"worked there 20 years and was able to climb the ranks and eventually become a claims adjuster responsible for the areas of"
good,"My time at USAA was short, but my overall experience was good. My boss was fair, flexible, and constructive. I would work for them again if offered a job."
good,What a great place to work even for a call center very fun and relaxed.   Very good training programs and amazing to all military and family.  I would recommend this company
good,USAA is a wonderful company to work for. very caring about employees. good work culture and excellent benefits. would recommend it to people as a place they would enjoy to be
good,I loved working here. There is no micro managing. If you can do your job and do it well then you can enjoy the many benefits and the availability of a Starbucks just around the corner.
good,"really liked usaa, mgmt was nice, understanding, fun place to work. they allow you to balance work and personal life.  would recommend this place to work at."
good,"USAA is a culture driven company focused on its membership. They cater to the military and as a prior service member, I am glad to work here. The only downside it can take a long time to move to other areas of interest."
good,"good amount of training and support.  managers are excellent.  take anywhere between 30 to 80 calls to start, the more senior the longer calls get.  promotions beyond call-center (manager, quality ect) are rare."
good,"Take on average 20-30 calls per day.  Plenty of training, plenty of support.  Managers are second to none!  Co-workers are engaged.  EVERY EMPLOYEE KNOWS THE MISSION OF USAA AND FOLLOWS IT."
good,"Great team-work environment, had a great work experience working with management and being able to share with others on different learning curves.Given chances to talk to other management in other areas."
good,"Each day is new and exciting; combine with independent and collaborative efforts.  There is clarity and timelines on department plans and goals.  Communication, verification and documentation are key elements in every aspect of Your job."
good,Its a good place to learn the practical skills which enhances our existing skill set and improvises our technical skill set. I never found any hardest part while working here.
good,"Enjoyed working with the company, a very rich culture. Schedules are flexible overtime are always available. The only setback is when you are working as a contractor you don't get to enjoy the benefits l the direct hires  get although you get to do the same job. Transitioning to a full time employee (Direct Hire/FTE) is very hard to come by."
good,"Basic Administrative responsibilities, I learned about using skype for meetings, working with diverse groups of people, the basis USAA work environment is very different than other businesses."
good,USAA San Antonio is one of the best employers I've ever worked for.  The culture is amazing and they truly believe in the member mission.  Work is stressful at times but rewarded wonderfully.
good,love this place - love the people and the structure- took awhile to get in but well worth it-- as far as assisting military to USAA-- it doesn't -- you just wait your time like everyone else
good,It was a great working experience good work ethics learn many new tools it was helpfull to achive new goals working as a team player helped me
good,Reputable company to work for.  Great people and management. Professional and productive work enviroment. Starbucks coffee in every bulding. Diverse in culture and friendly people.
good,"Very good place to work with people  in USAA."
good,USAA has a great mission statement and core values and I was proud to live them all. They have high standards for all employees and have great resources that will help you develop the skills for success.
good,Excellent organization with which to work.  Customer focused environment in which world-class service is provided on a daily basis.
good,"over great company"
good,"I worked as a temp - short term assignment."
good,"Working was very well balanced between personal and professional life. Learnt lot of things which is very good for my career. The co-workers were really good, will look forward to work again at USAA"
good,"Long hours but good mission and good people. Noble mission and sense of purpose is a big attractor for people, as it keeps employees grounded in a sense of purpose."
good,Best part of job is relationships built and knowledge learned. Employee Education and Insurance Benefits were excellent.
good,USAA is a fair place to work they offer an incredible work environment and great benefits package good advancement opportunities.
good,"-As a service manager, I would coach my agents to improve and provide good feedback when deserved"
good,Call center in an amazing facility. Nice to work for a company that actually cares about its employees. Especially being an US Army Veteran its nice to see a company care so much for other Veterans and service members.
good,"Start early, leave late."
good,"I arrive at 7, Begin working on emails for our lawfirm."
good,"A typical day includes daily standups (agile), team collaboration, coding, mentoring and a work hard/play hard mentality."
good,USAA truly lives the culture of helping military members and their families
good,"Working as a frontline underwriter for an elite community all around Europe. My everyday job involves decision making and critical thinking in deciding whether or not to issue policies using certain criteria, and an in depth knowledge of the job. As the job focuses on policies in and around Europe, I am experienced with the varying insurance regulations of this continent."
good,I loved this job. it was fun and easy. people were good. I mostly enjoyed talking to the client and keying in data.
good,"#1 on Computerworld's ""Best Places to Work in IT"" for 3 years in a row! Great company with a noble mission to help our military and their families."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits, great atmosphere, but very corporate"
good,Over all great work place
good,I have had the pleasure to work with USAA for 4 years. I have gained great experience. The reason I choose to leave is I can no longer work nights with my family.
good,USAA was a terrific place to work and offered excellent benefits and a progressive and pleasant work environment. USAA always put the customer first and valued its employees.
good,Must conduct yourself in a very professional manner at all times. Closely monitored at all times. Most management level employees micromanage their employees.
good,"USAA is a awesome company to work for. There's so many different areas of expertise to accommodate every individual. Friendly staff, great compensation, and healthy work environment"
good,I worked at USAA for eight years. I appreciate the care they have for their employees. They paid well and did their best to value employees and customers.
good,"USAA is a great place to work, but unfortunately i was just a contractor and my two year contract is coming to an end.  I am edible for rehire as a contractor in 6 months."
good,"great benefits, great culture, hard to move up, it was a great place to work but hard to move up in the company. plenty of opportunities but hard to find out what those opportunities are"
good,It is a good place to work with incentives to do the best you can. Usaa rewards good metrics with bonus's and provides a good work life balance with wellness time and PTO available. It offers an enjoyable work environment.
good,"Been part of a wonderful team and the environment is great to work in."
good,"An excellent place to work, learn, and grow. Involved managers, friendly work environment and kind co-workers really do make a difference. Our members are also very interesting and most have served, which is wonderful and I feel very lucky to work with them and help them daily."
good,"The work schedule is very firm and doesn't allow for a lot of flexibility. You are able to bid on schedules when the time comes around, but there is no guarantee that you will be awarded the schedule that you would like.  Management is very fluid and consistent.  There are so many benefits and options to maintain your peace of mind and work/life balance.  There are many different diversity groups within the company, and I felt that was very important in my time there."
good,With the people I talk to everyone has different experiences. My role was responsible for managing complex development and requirements for complex heavily regulated fields. So the hours I worked as a product manager are dependent on that environment. I can say with 100% that everyone is dedicated to the noble mission of this organization. Working side by side with the people I interact with made long hours and weekends worth it. Not to mention the time that USAA gives so that you can grow and give back to community. I believe in the mission.
good,"I've been here over 6 years and have had a wonderful experience. However, I am aware of the everyday challenges those in the call center experience: heavy workload, difficulty in advancement, high stress environment. However, as a staff member we experience great flexibility, awesome benefits, and a more-than-fair pay. Would recommend."
good,"I love working at Usaa! Great culture, and benefits. Of course you do have stressful times with the overload on calls but the pros definitely outweighs the cons."
good,Miss the Enviorment and Challenges. People were great everyone worked as a team.The benefits were fantastic and help was always just a phone call away.
good,Definitely enjoyrd my time at USAA. It takes a special person with a special heart to work there! can be stressful so make sure your life outside of home is peaceful and a great escape! great campus!
good,"I am thankful for the opportunity to work at USAA.  It is fast pace.  Strong management provided to assist employees.  Great benefits including vacations, in house support, wages.  "
good,"You have old bad apples everywhere but other then the few, the company was awesome. Great buildings, environment, and you make what you want out of any situation and place you are."
good,I've had the pleasure of working in three of the USAA offices in SATX. All have relaxed atmospheres and great amenities. All of the teams I worked on were self sufficient and the people were hard workers. Incredible benefits for a company of its size.
good,"I will probably work here for the rest of my life. Incredible benefits, the management strives to take care of you. There is plenty of opportunities to move up, you just have to work hard to get there. I started in 2017 as a call center employee and within a year and a half I was promoted to a staff role. Cant beat working at USAA!"
good,I loved working at Usaa. They provided a free full gym that i took advantage of and allowed plenty of opportunities to grow within the field. Most people love working with the company.
good,"Very good company to work for, the culture needs a little improvement. It is not easy for remote employees to get the desired career development if management team is not supportive."
good,"Usaa is a great place to work. Benefits are awesome."
good,"Culture in SAT can be entitled and protective of roles - and can be very political and change resistant.  Longer term employees were sometimes ""embedded"" in roles and unwilling/unable to change, especially organizationally."
good,Job was very fast paced in a call center environment. USAA is a great company to work for with great benefits. I regularly recommend job seekers to USAA.
good,"When you start contracting at USAA they lead you to believe you'll be hired Full Time, that never happens! I started there in January 2017, as an Underwriter, Returned May 2017 as a call quality specialist. All the Underwriters were let go June 2017. Replaced by their own Processors!"
good,"USAA is a great place to work.  There are pros and cons with every place, but overall I have been treated well.  Don't expect it to be what it isn't.  They relied too heavily for too long on their reputation, and the products are plain vanilla which they are proud of.  It isn't fancy, it isn't free thinking complex advice. It's a job where you get to take care of great people and facilitate their financial lives."
good,Great place to work. I would go back. Benefits were great and pay. Management worked well with their employees. The work environment was positive and it was a joy going to work there.
good,Management was great.  Recived pay increases. Unlimited overtime.  Some managers very understanding and considerate.  Management kept up with performance review to let you know how yo are doing. Bonuses were great.  Great place to work!
good,"For a recent college graduate its an amazing place to learn, grow and advance. For someone that has been in the industry for much longer the level of stress can be a burden."
good,"Its benefit program is one of the best in the industry. It has a nice campus with lots of facilities. However, the company is flexible for working remotely."
good,USAA employees live and breathe the mission. We take pride in giving the best customer service to all of our members. USAA encourages your personal growth
good,Just in wrong position at the company. The company itself is great and has a lot of good benefits. I wish I could stay but I am just very unhappy in my current position.
good,"I love USAA and still have many accounts with them.  There is pressure to sell and you are micromanaged a bit.  I felt that the intention was good and the company did follow the mission but sometimes I felt like I had to be ""pushy.""  There was a lot of competition to move up."
good,"I love USAA."
good,"As a whole, the company is a wonderful place to work.  There are less than desirable mid-level managers but I would go back there in a heartbeat.I would recommend this company to friends and family."
good,No complaints great place to build a career if you are interested in the banking/insurance field. Plenty of extracurricular activities and team building exercises.
good,workload wasn't bad at all. great people to work with. if you are contracted its not guaranteed you'll stay. the mortgage industry went down and all contractors were let go. planned on staying unfortunately wasn't able to stay because of this.
good,"Working at USAA, it was a very fun and joy able working atmosphere with everyone. Managers are on standby for any questions or concerns you may have day to day."
good,The manger didn't like contractors. Contractors were separated and treated differently. This made the environment very cut throat. It was still a good job and the perks of the facility made up for the manager being negative.
good,USAA was a good place to work. I didn't intend to leave but couldn't pass up another opportunity. It was a fairly relaxed environment but people were a little too comfortable in their positions. Senior leadership were hit or miss.
good,"great benefits, training, facility   learned new computer skills  learned how to deal with difficult members"
good,"I love everything this company stands for, the management team is very supportive. The company listen to its employees and makes changes when they change."
good,"The hardest part of the job was that management focused on metrics out of our control.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping members, and coworkers were fun."
good,They care for their employees and provide a very open work environment. The Company provides a lot of great benefits. I really enjoy working there. I enjoy working with our member base
good,Faced paced but family feeling. There is always someone there to help and guide you. There was always new things to learn. They help with the progression of career advancement.
good,Great place to work. Great health and retirement benefits. Great work culture and ethics. Good mission to serve the military. Successful financial institution.
good,"USAA works hard to hire people who fit their culture which is one of service, diversity and tolerance. Excellent benefits and PTO and they are extremely employee friendly.  I love working for this Company. It's certainly not perfect - it's a call center and very stressful but hard work has never intimidated me. They care a lot about making certain members and employees have access to financial security."
good,occasional system issues. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people you work with. The annual bonus and the Christmas bonus were great. And the Christmas party in December
good,"I worked in IT operations and loved it. There was a lot of new technology and room for advancements. Lots of late night calls for emergencies though. Salary may seem somewhat low, but its made up for in amazing amenities and great benefits. There are 3 Starbucks on site and in IT the culture is very relaxed as long as your doing work and finishing your projects."
good,"Everything good no complaints so far, Recommended company with nice benefits  and good gym.  Old technologies used but recently upgrading to newer frameworks, business side adding functionality is bit slow."
good,"USAA is a great place to work. Careers are made here and if you can handle the stress, its a great environment to be in. There are vast amount of jobs and opportunities"
good,"Large Campus, provides everything needed for work life balance. has multiple cafes with large variety of food and dietary options. On Site health clinic and pharmacy."
good,Overall a good place to work and grow in your professional skills however pay is going to be less than if you worked elsewhere.  Great organization with a heart for membership.
good,Good place to work just the dropping of departments is a little depressing. I want job security for my place of employment. It is a very relaxed environment
good,"Great place to work, comfort level is largely based upon the job, manager and type of production required from each individual.  Many amenities available for those wishing to pursue them."
good,"In three years, I went from the Front line of the call center to CEO Escalations. Although trying at times, I wouldn't change the experience for anything in the world. It was great having management and teams that were so supportive."
good,"Fantastic company to work for."
good,"A typical days work consists of being outside for 8 hours, the facility is pretty huge so your job is pretty much set for the whole day, The best thing i liked about this job was the scenery was beautiful and my job was to keep it that way."
good,Work with customers in call center environment to help customer reach their financial goals. Heavy focus on the call time and quality. Daily coaching on how to discover the members needs and making actionable recommendations.
good,Campus is great safe an welcoming everyone is nice welcoming an full of energy everyone seems to love their jobs n the company that they work for so they are for doing something right
good,"While they pride themselves on their customer service, the emphasis is to sell as many different products as possible. The culture changed dramatically in the 17 years I was there. Performance is based on ""meeting the customer's need"". But what that truly means is selling them on the need for placing as many products with them. From insurance to banking to investments to car buying and selling, whatever the customer ""needs"" they want placed with them."
good,Exceptional Organization to work for as a Full Time Employee. Offers many benefits and opportunity for career progression.
good,"The company itself is awesome. Great culture and benefits. 8% match on the 401k. You will always have a job unless you really mess up, and you will know in advance when you mess up."
good,USAA is a fantastic company to work for.  Its greatest opportunity would be to enable incumbent growth potential as opposed to the frequent external hiring.
good,"I honestly have only two things to say that is not absolutely great."
good,"Loved the work culture, good employee involvement, all in all great benefit, worked from home, good gym, shopping and cafe in home office"
good,"Great Company to work for with the best benefits I have ever seen. All my co-workers were very helpful, and the best part of work."
good,Loved Working for USAA through Teleperformance. Being able to help people in the arm and their families is an amazing feeling. Giving back to those who have giving so much. Setting them up with the credit card that would work best for there everyday lives.
good,"Get in in the morning, get breakfast in the café.  Log on, check e-mails, plan the day, answer voice mails and e-mails, manage a pipeline of 15-30 loans. Member and realtor contacts, collect conditions, 20 minute break in the morning.  Back to work, answer more e-mails and voice mails.  One hour lunch in the café, healthy options at 1/2 price, energy room upstairs, nap rooms on floor 4. TVs every where, watch news, sports, daytime.  Back to work, collect more conditions, address incorrect documentation, move files forward as the underwriters ok them.  20 minute break in the afternoon, then home at the end of the shift. "
good,Great company to start your career with great opportunities for improvement.  Educational opportunities are limitless
good,Very busy job being that its a production environment. Worked well with all co workers and managers. This company provides avenues for all employees to advance within the company. Employees are well compensated with excellent benefits.
good,Started out as a Auto Service Representative and eventually advanced to the training department first as a Life Company Instructor then retired as an Instructional Developer.
good,Friendly place to work. Enjoyed the culture but if you are not a call center person then this is not for you. Benefits are by far the best I have seen a company give their employees.
good,"Amazing company with strong core values and mission. Really care about the membership and employees. Learned a lot about insurance, customer service and leadership skills. Very fast paced."
good,"I have worked with USAA as a contract employee on two separate occasions and would continue to do so.  The employees are treated with the upmost respect and appreciation, and the benefits even for contract employees far exceed any company I have ever worked for.  I would not hesitate in returning to USAA whether for a contract or my ultimate goal of a full time employee."
good,The attitude and culture at Addison did not mirror the rest of the organization.  Salary and benefits are great.  Serving the members is still the #1 focus even with rapid changes in mortgage.
good,Great customer base to work with. The company values its people and helps the succeed in life. Would recommend to work here if given the chance.
good,"This is a Fantastic company to work for. The company has everything from great compensation, benefits, excellent working environment etc. The only draw back is that the company is so big that there are pockets of weak leadership at certain VP level and above. So if you hit a bad VP,  the job will be tough. If you hit a good VP, it is a best job in best company."
good,"Great professional environment to work in.  Great place for diversity with the ability to learn an continue to move upward,laterally or stay where you are."
good,"Handled inbound calls from members to go over billing concerns, issue new policies. Processed insurance quotes for Auto,Renters, Homowners and valuable personal property. I really enjoyed speaking with the members. Helping to sure that their needs were being met."

I loved helping out our customers with different options for savings and the many products available to assist in many life events."

good,"My day would start with responding to customer emails as we have a 24 hour turnround then voicemails from clients , third parties and vendors. Work through my dairies and complete incoming post"
good,Micromanaged but great place to work. Get your own desk. Work by yourself for the most part. Constantly on the phones. Kind of wish I didn't quit because you could get over time when you wanted it. Great bonuses!
good,Great place to work from the people to the management it was always a place I felt good about going to each day.
good,"This company is structured, fast past with a lot of opportunities to its employees. This company is focused on always doing the right thing for its members."
good,"Fast paced, clear goals and expectations."
good,I loved USAA. To know that I was able to help military families and make life a tiny bit easier was a big thing for me. They have fantastic employees that I worked with as well. For me the hardest part of working there was being on the phone in one place for hours at a time. Overall I would love to work there again if given the chance.
good,I enjoyed my job. Great benefits and steady work. I learned how to process loans more effectively.
good,Great opportunity. Traditional Bank end underwriting also I had the chance to do VA IRRRLs
good,"I feel very good all the time to work with a global name and inspired environment,genius colleagues,challenging work."
good,"our goal is to be the mortgage company for our Veteran, we strive to service the Veteran in all their banking needs...."
good,Great company that treats employees very well.  Great benefits and pay.  Lots of fun and provided lots of training.  Offered great services to both customers and employees.  Flexible shifts available
good,My workday consisted of answering the phones for Insureds calling in with a claim. I either set up and completed a towing claim or set up the claim to transfer to an Associate to complete.
good,A typical wrok day is like any other work place. I learnded things every day about P&C Insurance for the year I was there. hardest part was adjusting to tricks to working a new system. the most enjoyable part was the customers are the best customers to talk to in any call center that I have worked in.
good,excellent operation - plenty of room to grow - you have to be willing to live in San Antonio... its hot
good,"I've been a consultant for 10 years and worked in 14 different IT shops. USAA is easily top 2 places I've worked at from an IT shop. Just ""do the right thing"" and you will always be rewarded"
good,This position started out as a customer service position when I started in 2004 but due to changes in upper management the position turned in too much of a sales position.
good,"Theis company has too many advantages to list~job advancement, college tuition assistance, health plan, and more."
good,The people I worked with were great and the client (mostly military) were the best. Too bad the contract ended.
good,"This company is stuck in the past. They're stuck in the past in a great way though! They still believe in take care of their employees. Any extra money this company makes is invested back into the employee. Whether it be a super cheap fitness center, top notch health plans, an amazing 401k or the best two bonuses a year, this is THE company to work for!"
good,"This company offers the opportunity for advancement, ensuring employees work happy and are given positive feedback on performances well done as well as comfortable locations throughout the facility to recharge and remain focused."
good,Loved the work place and fellow peers. Many accomadations for the employees. Ping pong tables and activities to releive stress. Places to relax and take time outs from work on campus.
good,"What can be said. "
good,"USAA is committed to work, life balance and career growth for each employee.  You are made to feel valued.  There are clear expectations and evaluations set for short term and long term goals.  The environment provides everything you need on the campus from a variety of restaurants, a gym and the ability to obtain healthy points to reduce your health cost.  I would recommend this company every time to everyone."
good,USAA is a great company overall.  They provides great employee benefits and provide employees many opportunities to grow professionally.  The biggest challenge most will face is standing out amongst a large pool of highly talented individuals.
good,A typical day of work consists of you calling out on your new claims as well as things you have on your work list for the day. You also take incoming calls with people filing new losses or that have questions about their claims.
good,"I learned a lot from my team. USAA is a very good place to work . They hire you for one project and offer you other projects before the project ends if you work delicately, they always like to keep the good resources."
good,"Overall great place to work amazing benefits, schedule preferences are very accommodating pay is good could be a little better the amenities and again the benefits of just being an employee are amazing"
good,USAA is a great company to work for. Very fair business practices; employees are treated with respect and fairness. Managers are helpful and approachable. The gold standard by which other companies should strive to emulate.
good,"Had a great experience working for USAA. Hardest part of the job was speaking with unhappy members at beginning of calls, but after a few minutes this changes and they are a delight to speak with."
good,The corporate culture has changed since I began work there in the late 80s. You are expected to get your work done and in return they will recognize your efforts.
good,"USAA was a tremendous working experience with an incredible work life balance and excellent benefits. Their overall compensation package seemed fair but was not necessarily overly competitive. While the work environment was fun and challenging, I did feel my lack of military experience was a progression inhibitor."
good,It was working with the LMS and scheduling classes for required courses I work with the banking group and the wellness center.  It was great environment.
good,Great company and work environment. Pay is competitive as well as the benefits. No Work life balance. There are no real options to change your schedule.
good,"It’s all about the members, remember this and you’ll succeed. Being the provider of choice for the military and their families means going beyond simple claims adjusting. Show up when you’re supposed to be there and do your job and all is well."
good,I enjoy the cafeteria and smoothies. It is a call center so the hours can be a issue with home life. I do enjoy most of the members that I get to work with.
good,USAA is a world class employer. They offer good training and good benefits. It's a company that operates with the highest level of ethics. It's a very good place to work.
good,Working at USAA was a wonderful experience. A typical work day would consist of an early morning meeting with the teammates and the underwriting manager. It was a pleasant experience.
good,"The company has a wonderful job culture, the pay is above average. The job is stressful but can be rewarding, tons of opportunity for job advancement, just keep in mind there are thousands of people competing for the same job."
good,"I enjoyed working for USAA because they fairly paid me,  By providing me with bonuses, overtime and adequate pay.  They train you for 4 weeks that way when you hit the floor you actually know what you're doing. Once you get a job with USAA you are set for life, unless they leave then you have to settle. I myself was a chat representative, and I just adored the job in general as well as the company thank you so much for alloweing me to experience such a great position. While being an undergraduate student I was able to maintain my work life and my home life because they were willing to work with my schedule. Thank you guys!!"
good,"I love this company's mission. They are all about serving the military. It is not just a slogan, but everything they do is to better the financial situation of their members rather than making money."
good,Overall experience was nice. Work environment was intense at times but co-workers are incredibly helpful. The culture is similar to the military. The benefits help out-weigh the stress of the amount of work that is required.
good,A typical work day consist of working the phones in a state of the art call center. Many amenities for comfort and get you through the day. Voted best place to work in Arizona.
good,I love USAA. It's one of the best places to work but recently seems unstable. There have been layoffs to front line employees (phone reps) due to errors of management. This is unfortunate considering the execs salaries continue to increase year after year. Kind of makes me sick. But the people and the members are great!
good,"Overall, USAA is an amazing place to work.  USAA provides a solid work life balance and great benefits. You can stay very busy with USAA and when you asked to be challenged there are plenty of opportunities."
good,"Working at USAA was a true blessing and the ONLY reason I chose to leave was a lack of career advancement.  I truly have nothing negative to say at all, I just had wished there was more room in our office for me to grow."
good,Great place to work. USAA really cares about their employees. There are plenty of opportunities to move around the company and try other career interests. The benefits are top-notch.
good,"My role as an adjuster was very fast-paced and extremely stressful.  There was more expected of you then there was time to get the tasks accomplished however, I loved my job and was never bored. There was something new every day."
good,USAA was a great place to work. The culture there is nothing short of amazing and it really is a place where you can grow. I started on the phones but really quickly came to understand that my management had better plans for me. I'd highly recommend to anyone.
good,USAA is without a doubt the most mission focused companies I have ever experienced.  The ongoing military acumen and celebration of our military was inspiring.
good,"Great company to work for. It's all about the Member so the company is great instilling  the mission. much like the military, you feel you are a part of something bigger than a job."
good,Sales goals became unrealistic but company culture is great! Benefits were outstanding and management did their best to keep us in the loop of all changes.
good,"Extremely competitive benefits, good salary. On site gym, cafeteria, and day care. Great security and work environment. Educational assistance provided."
good,"Solid management but the computer applications seemed outdated.  There were always difficulties using the simulator in the training environment.  I received a job offer which payed triple my salary so I felt compelled to leave.  However, I would return to USAA if given the opportunity."
good,"USAA is an exceptional employer they provide excellent benefits and compensation. If you work hard you will be rewarded. The company insures military officers and has been managed mostly by top military personnel, very impressed with their vision and desire to take care of members and employees. The company had amenities such as several full cafeterias, fast food, Starbucks, company stores, recreational areas to include two full fitness centers and many more such as volunteer opportunities and large elaborate holiday party."
good,"I enjoyed working for USAA. they offer great benefits, care about their employees and customers, great benefits, gym, job training, good pay. The hardest part about my job was the extensive time spent on the phones."
good,USAA is a great place to work with great employees that have a passion for giving members great service and ensuring their financial security. The compensation and training was great too!
good,"USAA is all about understanding and serving their members.  As an employee, you are a member of USAA and they strive to serve you as you serve the other members."
good,"They bring everyone into the company as an adjuster 3 , regardless of your past experience and state that promotion happens quickly.  Then the rules change company wide on how long you must wait for those promotions.  If you are young,.  Awesome place to work,  If you are mid career.  You may want to think about it."
good,"This company is amazing hands down the best company I have ever worked for. The only gripe I have is that the management team doesn't seem to care about the employee's advancement or requests. Its a dog eat dog type of movement everyone out for themselves, I had been promised advancement and then when it came down to actual action I was denied. That hurt. The company as a whole is amazing however, work life balance, pay, the community, the opportunities. AMAZING!"
good,"Always work to be done within 8 hours, employees treated to a better standard than contractors such as discounted lunches, events, swag, opportunities etc. although contractors are worked just as hard if not harder than employees. huge environment which has plenty of areas allowing for work and play definitely a place to make 30 years easy"
good,"Best employer I have worked for, they really care about their customers and employees.   Great benefits, great organizational culture.  Unfortunately to much of a commute for me."
good,call center enviornment can be stressful. Also micromanagement from management. The job can be challenging but the company does offer a competitive salary and great benefits.
good,"USAA is a terrific company.  I have not since worked for a company with such great benefits."
good,USAA works hard to be a great company to work for. They do a good job of it. They care about each other and their customers. The main issue I see is they have not fully moved to a meritocracy. You have to put your time in to get promotions. Not the worse thing ever.
good,"working with other team members, very friendly and some were helpful,. Team Mgr was always busy and could help when needed. Leaned compliance with closing documents in for mortgage loans (new terminology). Over all a good place to work  directly with USAA"
good,"I worked as a contract employee at USAA.  I was very well compensated and was moved to a new position every few months.  I learned so much about the insurance and banking industry.  If we had not moved, I would still be happy with a position at USAA."
good,USAA is a great place of work. It has probably the most diversified workplace I have ever been apart of. It is the most relaxed working environment that one could ever want
good,Fun place very strict but very good benifits could do a little better with managment and respect but overall I recommend this job to anyone  fun employees to be around
good,"I wish I liked call center jobs because I literally liked everything about working for USAA...except my job. For the most part, I didn't feel micro-managed and felt appreciated. And the pay was superb in comparison to other similar call centers in the area."
good,"Good culture, plenty of ladder rungs to climb as far as advancing your career.  I came from another industry and felt undervalued as far as compensation, but it was the only offer on the table.  I've since found out that colleagues make significantly more and are also new and from outside industry, but some are military veterans, and that goes a long way here."
good,USAA was a great place to work and the culture was good.  The benefits and insurance are great.  My managers seemed to really care about our improvement and they allowed me to work on my own individually and not be micromanaged.
good,It's a fulfilling job to take care of our members and ensure that we are looking out for their overall financial security by recommending the products they need.
good,"I was fortunate enough to get hired with no previous claims experience and learned a lot in my time there. Long hours and an ability to focus are definitely required but, are rewarding since there can at times be approval for premium pay on top of overtime pay. The education assistance is awesome and they are always encouraging you to develop yourself both professionally and personally."
good,I will actually be going back here soon and I am very excited for this. I think that if anyone is able to work for this company they should. They are very understanding. They come with many benefits and opportunity. They train you very well and they are the most friendly people you will ever meet. Their goal is such a wonderful one that it helps you feel like you are making an actual difference in peoples lives.
good,"USAA offers competitive salaries, quality benefits, and a stable work culture.  The workload can add up as some parts of the company are understaffed , but overall USAA is a quality empolyer."
good,"On a day-to-day basis, personally, I take incoming phone calls for property and casualty insurance. This is truly a company that cares for their employees and members all at the same level. It can be difficult taking certain phone calls, but at the end of the day there will always be your teammates and upper management to back you up. There is always something to learn here. If you have excellent customer service skills and care about giving back to our military and their family, then this is the place to be."
good,"USAA is amazing. They are innovative, they push you to be great, they have awesome benefits. The main down side is that working in a call center is more difficult then I ever imagined. I never though being on the phone all day was difficult... but after about 3.5 years of doing this job, I'm worn down. "
good,"I learned immensely about the insurance business, and liked working in it. I left because I was part time, but my manager was down to earth and easy to talk to. My co-workers were smart and driven. The hardest part was selling, the most enjoyable was the customer interactions and the weekly meetings."
good,USAA is a great place to launch your career.  Their employee benefits are fantastic and the company culture really aligned to my personal core values.
good,"USAA has a collaborative workplace striving for best in class service to its membership.  Their leaders are passionate about their jobs, and most strive for the success of their teams.  The job can be tiresome for being almost strictly a call center atmosphere, but the memberships believe in the company helps dissipate that struggle."
good,"Assist members with their insurance needs by providing quotes  and  assisting with any insurance questions or concerns making sure they understand their coverages, you learn from your peers whom are always willing to assist and management is their for all your concerns, Enjoyed talking with our members and helping them"
good,"Get in, stay in!  They take great care of their people and set you up for success.  This company really listens to the employee's input and makes changes to improve the workplace."
good,Working in a contact center is never easy but USAA works very hard to ensure that they are doing everything they can to take care of both their employees and their members. A truly ethical company that lives by their mission and values.
good,"USAA provides a comprehensive training program for entry level claim employees. This training yields dividends in claim handling turn-around times, member satisfaction and higher member retention levels."
good,USAA is a solid company with great benefits and a solid work/life balance. Like many institutions it can be very slow moving and it has a very conservative and unique culture. The employees have a passion for the members they serve and that makes its way into everything they do. I would only recommend this company to a person who I felt would be a good culture fit. USAA can be a very hard company if you don't think and act like the rest.
good,"One of the greatest company i have ever worked for.  They give a thorough and extensive training for every position and make sure that every employee gets the proper training to obtain their necessary licensing for their job.  A very busy place to work at which makes the day go by faster.  Management are trained well, but, there is always one or two that abuses their position, unfortunately.  Nothing hard on the job as long as you have commitment and discipline.  The most enjoyable part of my employment servicing the USAA members and with that being said, I received the Presidential Coin Award for my customer service."
good,I training new on-boards on proper procedure for going thru a file with regards to V.A. insured loans. The facility was huge and customer service was the most important factor.
good,"USAA has top notch management and their culture is nearly without parallel; however, if you work in a call-center, it can get pretty tough."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the integrity, honesty, and security of the company. Great place to work if you are looking for that next step in working in a call center."
good,"Sales is the hard driven main goal in all calls.   Stressful.  If you thrive on sales this is the place for you.  Great pay, in-service, opportunity for advancement and training.  Benefits are above any employer I have ever worked for.  I did not like the high pressure sales.  I loved the customer service element to the job."
good,Company has had their core values in place for almost 100 years. Leads the industry in best-in-class service.
good,"During my tenure of over ten years in Lifeco I reached a plateau in the Phoenix center with no room to go except to San Antonio but no thanks.  If you work at any of the centers outside of S.A. there is little room to grow.  Most of management is the good ole boys club and they are so separated from you like a cast system.  If you were not hired into management getting into that threshold is near impossible and the call center environment is micro-managed to a T.  The best part of working there were my coworkers who were amazing and provided the best service to our members.  Another big reason to be there was serving our active duty and retired service members.  This gave real purpose to be at your best each day and I took great pride in helping them.  USAA overall is a great company with a great retirement plan, great health benefits and other perks.  I just could not handle being in a call center anymore.  If you can handle the call center atmosphere, want to develop yourself and have good benefits it may be the place for you.  Overall I enjoyed my time with the company and it was time to move on.  Serving the military group is a very unique and rewarding experience and teaches you what the word respect really means."
good,"USAA, a company culture build upon the shoulders of the US military, past, present and future, provides a relatively relaxed, holistically impressive working environment.  Considered a campus, USAA provides employees with a park-like atmosphere (walking trails, wildlife, sports and recreation fields), as well as an onsite gym (membership and fees required), nurses station, and cafeteria ($$$),  They also have a gift shop, and invite several independent vendors in that sell small gifts such as jewelry and books.  "
good,"Great working environment."
good,"I worked for USAA for 24+ years and loved it.  I started as a file clerk and worked my way up to Project Control Analyst.  USAA provided many opportunities for advancement and training. "
good,"A typical day here is assisting members with various requests, constantly learning new things and you are expected to be at 100% for the member at all times."
good,Answered inbound calls from military or military associated members of the organization. Processed requests and referred new products or services to members. I learned how to build relationships via phone and conduct sale transactions via phone. The hardest part of the job was to earn a persons trust over the phone in minutes. I enjoyed serving the military families financial needs. 
good,"A typical day at work is coming in about 20-30 minutes early to read emails and follow up on member's accounts that do not need to be contacted back. Then once it's time, log on to the phone and take calls until the end of the day and follow up with those members that need call backs."
good,"I was on the phones in policy service and new member solutions. It can get very repetitive at times as well as frustrating. If you have a great manager that will not micro manage you and dissect every sentence you say over the phone it makes it bearable because the pay and the benefits are so good. But chances are you will get micro managed to death. They will even pull up a spread sheet showing each log when you went off the phone que for personal time aka ""bathroom break"" and they will ask you to justify you bowel movements, and yes, they will even ask you to try and hold it until your break."
good,"Call center environment that focuses on numbers rather than success or value of the phone call. FULL benefits from the beginning, great co-workers and management. Lots of room for advancement into different career areas. Awesome work place with tons of places to eat, relax, and play."
good,"Teletech is an amazing place to work for. I enjoy working here because the environment is upbeat, energentic, and positive. My co-workers are very friendly and they are very helpful, I have learned alot working here and continue to learn something new each day. The hardest part of the job is- really there isn't any, I make the most of everything I do and try to not anything stress me down. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I see my coaching being effective and the agents are succeeding. Management is great, always here to help us."
good,Best job I ever had. Working for this company was an absolute joy.
good,"I love this place, and if you live in a place where you can get in. Try!"
good,it was a good solid company with great benefits it lacked in employee moral.. but is the best in customer service
good,"Co-workers are great, everyone gets along with everyone. Great management, hardest part of the job is being on the phone all day."
good,I love company that work for 6 years and I had to leave because birth twins and take care for three years till twins decide to go school and they want learn and they are now today as 18 and soon graduation high school and go to college.
good,"The benefits are amazing. They paid for my Bachelors and I am currently a Graduate student. They offer to pay for college up to $10,000 annually. The health benefits are fantastic compared to previous employers. They offer two bonuses annually. One is a performance bonus. The other is a holiday bonus."
good,"Smart people, clear mission, cohesive company culture and great benefits. I really enjoyed my time working at USAA and regret leaving. USAA has a very clear mission (serving its members) that comes through in everything they do, which is unusual in such a large company."

good,USAA was a great company with an wonderful culture. I just didn’t like that I was stuck at my desk the entire shift. All of the benefits that USAA provides were great as well.

But they don't stop there, they also make sure that their employees are taken care of too!! There is a reason why they have the retention rate that they do. They are simply amazing!"
good,"I really enjoyed working at USAA the company.  Benefits were great and  Coming from the military I was moving around a lot.  I couldn't sit down doing the same thing every day.  Fortunately, I had a manager that was willing to work with me and would give me an extra break or would allow me to just sit and blow off steam."
good,USAA is an amazing company with many opportunities for employee development and growth. Compensation is generous with many other employee perks and benefits. Highly recommend looking into USAA for employment.
good,A typical call center environment. USAA cares for its employees has a very competitive salary and benefits package. However advancement is very hard and unless you know the right people or have a lot of experience you will be stuck.
good,"Summer internship lasted 10 weeks on a 40-hour work week basis. Gave plenty of off-time during this internship such as 2 volunteer days, floating free holiday, July 4th, etc. Home office campus is plenty huge, with 2 on-site gyms and intramural fields for intern sports leagues."

good,Best company I've ever worked for. Amazing facility that offers so many amenities. Comfortable work atmosphere and dress code. Decent options on work hours and schedules.
good,"Wonderful place to work. The atmosphere is a joy to be in.  You are busy 99.9% of the time, but thats why its called work, right? the other .1% is your weekly team meeting.  The training is great and they set you up for success. The state insurance test is not easy, but if you study and pay attention in the training, you will be fine.

good,"Great Company years ago, it has changed to mostly temporary in the department I worked. Saw a lot of slack from those people vs full time employees which made it unfair to the permanent workers getting paid about the same.  Management has failed to do a good job of rewarding good workers now. Favoritism is shown a lot."

good,"I loved working with the clients, it was a big change from the irate clients that I was used. However the Managers did not hide that they had their favorites on the team. This made the work environment very uneasy."
good,"Wonderful culture and environment to be a part of. I encountered nothing but good people in management, with some of course being better than others, but no bad experiences. Work could be stressful at times, but that is not unusual for call center and loan production jobs."
good,"USAA is a great place to work overall. The company as a whole puts a considerable amount of effort into taking care of its employees. There are a wide variety of benefits, reasonable working hours, and a culture that thrives on taking care of its members."
good,USAA is a great company to work for because they value their employees and members.  The take great strides in caring for members investments.  I look forward to coming back to USAA when I return to San Antonio.
good,"As a substitute teacher, each day was a new adventure. I was in different classrooms all the time and I loved it. I was able to get to know each one of the teachers and be introduced to each age group. This job was a challenge because it was my first time in Early Childhood Development. At the same time, it came very natural to me. The staff was awesome. Everyone is very encouraging and they all help you to be your best as a teacher. This specific company offers great incentives. One of which being offering raises as you complete next stages in your education. Management was very helpful. If they see you struggling, they reach out and help rather than criticizing. Everyone is very collaborative and works together very well. It was such a fun environment to be in everyday."

good,"Loved the process, the training, the job, and the people.  Too many mortgages for 1 person to process.  Could not give Veterans the amount of dedicated time I wanted to."
good,"USAA is a great company to work for. They care about their employees but you'll have to work hard to succeed. They are a surprisingly innovative company with a clear focus on who and what they are, If you don't mind giving 110% every day, you'll find you have a lot of opportunity here."
good,"Great work life balance with amazing benefits.  It was difficult to move from one department to another unless you have military affiliations, but it was still a great employer."

good,"I love my job and clients however the paid is not  what I expect for my skillset. Every day coming to work is fun and enjoyable, because no day is  a like, nor will I not be challenge for doing better to meet the expected performance quota. The managers are respectful and appreciate the effort and hard work the techs do everyday."
good,"I really like working with other Veterans."
good,Although I am merely a contractor I still find the work environment and atmosphere amazing. I would highly recommend this organization to anyone who is looking to work for a military based organization.
good,If they wouldn't have closed down the mortgage department in Addison I wouldn't have left. Awesome company to work for and they take care of their employees.

good,"USAA is a wonderful place to work. The company and employees all abide by the ethics that the company was built from. Honest is key. The supervisors put a lot of trust into their employees and are there to support. While being an adjuster is fast paced, quick, and can be overwhelming at times, USAA strives to provide each employee with a great work-life balance. I ended my career with USAA to become a stay at home mom with my 2 little ones. I would recommend this company to ANYONE and truly love this company."
good,"Loved my job, loved being able to make a difference. Enjoyed working with teammates in a local center. Unfortunately, all but 4 were closed nation wide. USAA takes excellent care of their members and their employees. Cannot beat the benefits anywhere!"

good,"I handled auto liability claims."
good,Everyone there each other to succeed. The mission is taken into account for everything the company does and what all employees should do. There is a lot of opportunities but the competition for the positions are high. The culture behind the dress code is interesting as shorts and casual cloths are permitted. It seems this is frowned upon and creditability is diminished if your choose this attire.
good,"Pre-technology age, typing, copying, filing, issuing drafts, taking messages in assisting co-workers.  Learned office skills, phone etiquette.  Management was encouraging, while workplace culture was thriving.  The hardest part of the job was remembering form letter codes.  The most enjoyable was working with the people."

good,"Workplace culture is world class, always promoting employees for professional development. Innovation is highly welcomed, management always promotes to think ""outside the box""."
good,"If they would stop outsourcing their IT positions and realize they are a tech company in the sense they want to interact with their customers via phones and mobile devices, then they will be stronger than ever and be able to attract even stronger techs."
good,"USAA's culture is entirely driven by its mission to facilitate the financial security of the military community. In what would be a sales-driven environment in other companies, USAA is mission-driven. At the end of the day, member service representatives are asked to reflect on the service they provided--did they fulfill the mission for each member they spoke with? Will each interaction with a member improve their financial security?"

good,"It's a great place to work at. The call center is never a dull moment. There's always something new to learn. Highly competitive place with many applicants anxiously ready to take your place. USAA has military standards and expect that from employees as well. You really can't go wrong with working there just keep your cool, don't anything personally, and keep your priorities straight."
good,"United Services Automobile Association was a great place to work with a great atmosphere with many advancement job opportunities,"

good,Great place to work. The staff is very understanding in the wintertime when bad mountain weather hits. Hard to advance though.
good,"Working for USAA was the most rewarding experience I have ever had in a company. From the team you work with, to your Manager, Director, all the way up to the CEO, USAA challenged you, they build you up to be successful, they train you with the most intense training to become successful, they develop you into a professional and see things from a different perspective, and most importantly they were open with everyone who works for USAA. You walk into work feeling confident, feeling like you matter and you walk out feeling more confident and more important. They invested into you to become successful. What makes USAA so different from any company I have worked for is they want you to succeed. They do not break you down, criticize you for your mistakes, instead, they provide you tools to make your opportunities into strengths. "
good,"Excellent training, management, benefits and culture.  I really can't say enough good things about USAA.  I gave it three stars in work/life balance for two reasons: First, the ""new employee"" schedule can be very challenging if you have a family, although in time you would be able to bid for a more accommodating shift. Second, you bid your paid time a full year ahead. Getting time off for your kid's school play or a friend's wedding can be difficult. But if you can handle that, it's a wonderful place to work with almost unlimited potential to explore new avenues and advance your career."
good,Typical day of work is to take 35 to 50 calls from members regarding their investment accounts. During the day you are helping members uncover and meet their financial goals. Management is extremely helpful with career development.

good,Started as young woman and advanced in many areas of the company up to retirement.
good,"USAA is a company that cares about its employees and their members. I had the opportunity to work under several excellent managers during my 7 plus years there. We were encouraged to participate in training courses both in classroom settings and online in order to advance in the company. The hardest thing about my job at USAA was the fact that as a call center, we had very little time to follow up on calls."
good,"I enjoyed working at USAA because the employees' opinions were considered and appreciated.  I saw changes made because of employee opinions.  USAA, although a very large company, made each individual feel as though they counted."
good,USAA's culture is amazing.  They have such a way of training their employees initially that you honestly feel proud to work for this company.  Their computer system is web based and easy to navigate through.  Great benefits and employees.

good,"I had a great time working at USAA, it was a very positive experience. I enjoyed working in a call center environment where I could speak to the customers and resolve their computer issues in a timely manner.

good,"Positive work environment and supportive management.  Reston office was downsizing and had to move to Norfolk or leave the company - otherwise, I would have stayed with USAA..  "
good,"Great job"
good,"I worked in a call-center environment handing about 50-60 incoming calls per day. I was licensed to handle insurance sales and policy adjustments in 12 different states. The variety of the issues of clients was extensive and I enjoyed that every call was different. Management and co-workers all worked with me as one unit. I had a lot of support. The benefits were wonderful...I even had a private gym in the office. The morals and values of the company are outstanding. Even though I was laid off, I still live by such values today."

good,"good company to work with, uses latest technologies."
good,- A typical day at USAA is coming into work knowing what is expected of me and to do everything in my power to exceed my expectations every call every time.
good,One of the best companies to work for! Great benefits and team enviornment! The most enjoyable part of the job was on-site recreation for company employees! As an employee of USAA I learned time management skills as well as a structured enviornment!
good,If you truly desire inside sales and customer service then you can't find a better market of people to help than military. Just be sure you're the type that can sit in a chair for 10 hour shifts and never see your client face to face.
good,"This really helped me out . Prior to USAA, I worked at a commission based only job and it was hard for me fresh out of college to be financially secure. It causes me a great deal of stress. Once I got the job at USAA I learned so much and became a part of the family. As a member and an employee I can value the things I see here. Like with any job there are pros and cons, however, the pros outweigh the cons for me. Proud to work here and help my members in the claims side."
good,Big companies require top personnel and much training and USAA provided that..there have been mistakes along the way but we do our best to see the company runs well for the benefit of all

good,Great place to work and grow professionally. The typical work day allows great timeframe to complete work tasks without any difficulties in internal or external teams
good,Met plenty of wonderful people and learned a lot during those 11 weeks. The culture and the amenities was wonderful. Everyone goal is to be the financial military provider of choice.
good,I would definitely go back to working for USAA. The people that work in the call center are extremely helpful and they are patient. I loved my manager and they invest a lot in their staff.
good,"I had a wonderful experience working at USAA, it was a challenging environment that required a commitment to work but compensated me for my commitment. I only left to take care of family other wise I’d still be working there."
good,This company cares about their employees and it shows. You start earning PTO right away. Benefits are offered on day 1. Endless advancement opportunities. I can see myself retiring from this company.
good,I loved my job as an Underwriter at USAA. If I lived closer I would go back in a heartbeat.  I loved my managers! Also had Starbucks and a Gym onsite!

good,"USAA is a member-centric organization composed of very smart, professional, dedicated, and fun employees. USAA employees (including leadership) play hard and work hard on the right issues and initiatives. All employees sincerely care about the members who make up USAA's Association.

No wonder it's one of the very best organizations to work for."

good,"daily que on coming calls in regards to auto accidents "
good,great place to work. very fast pace. every one there works hard so there is different areas at the job where you can relax or have fun on your breaks.
good,On a typical day I would get breakfast at one of the many cafe they had setup along with a cup of Starbucks coffee.  I would check my emails and find out if there was anything pertinent that needed to be addressed in the day.  Working in the Workforce division I was responsible of taking in data from different databases and transferring it into a database that would feed out to other systems that are tracked by management.

good,"*World Class Customer Service"
good,This company has a firm commitment to their workforce.  They believe in putting the customers and employees first.

I have seen people rise above director level in just five years.You are definitely working for your money especially in claims. Constant inbound calls and you have to learn a way to make outbound calls or you will not make it.  Everyone has diaries which are the files you are personally responsible for.

Usaa makes it a fun place to work with many off the phone activies."

I will highly recommend this company to anyone that wants a company that cares about them and their career growth.  We start every meeting with our mission which is to protect the financial security of the Military and their family members.
good,USAA is a company that provided me with an initial start after retiring from the military.  It is a company with great benefits and an excellent work environment.
good,"USAA is an Excellent employer.  They offer fantastic benefits including game rooms, work out facilities, and nap rooms to distress during your breaks and lunches.  I learned to multi-task at a much higher pace."
good,"•	Provided customer support to adjust low to moderately complex auto claims."
good,My typical was awesome and enjoyed working as a team and made sure my work day was successful. Working for an excellent Financial Institute and making sure my work was completed by end of day.
good,"Typically I clock in and answer calls with multiple different issues such as password resets, to printer installs to more complex application specific errors. I have learned that resolving peoples issues is more important than rushing and that getting the job right the first time makes for very happy customers! Sadly management has had a revolving door throughout my time here so I have not been able to see a regular management force in action. The hardest part of the job is lack of team building from management but I know it takes work and they will get there eventually. I really enjoy helping people solve issues and looking at ways to educate people on solving the issues for themselves later."
good,Great people to work with. Great training and room for advancement. Unmatched benefits and wealth building opportunities.
good,"doc rpt to show the reason a customer should be eligible for pay out or not, If it was car accident whether or not the insured was at fault or not"

good,Working with the people not so much. People are rude and lazy. Having to help is great until you help someone that is ungrateful.
good,Love the USAA mission and mindset! Work is meaningful and and coworkers are a pleasure to work with! Management is great as well.

good,I like working for USAA because they gave me the opportunity to receive my P&C license. It is an enjoyable place to work with great employees and good benefits.
good,USAA is good place to work. The Process is being followed properly and there is lot of fun at work. The only thing some of the team is giving more pressure to review the work because of the process. that is only one issue.
good,They treat our military like kings and queens.  This is a company that will bend over backwards for the military.  If you can make it through the training without shedding a tear of pride for our military then you have no heart and don't belong.
good,"Further information on cover letter & resume."
good,Wonderful company to work for. The culture and workplace is amazing. The benefits alone are worth working for. I have been able to advance quite a bit within a short period of time.

good,A tpyical day consited of assisting members with anything they needed with a smile. It wasn't forced it was something genuine and made you feel like you did something great with your day.
good,I love my job. I take calls from members wanting to service their existing policies or request new business. I service the call & evaluate their situation to see if we have a product to match their needs. I don't feel like a salesmen shoving products down their throat but feel good when I make that connection and they respond to it. I never feel micromanaged even though I know they are looking at every possible number they can find about my calls in relationship to how many products I sell. They have taught me so much in just the year I've started working there. I see a lot of reviews where they feel forced to sell and micromanaged but I feel they are stearing away from that mentality & taking a much more human approach to selling products. I do know I have the best entry level job & love my work schedule.

good,"Fast paced, yet controlled."
good,Typical day is coming to work and checking emails and doing the daily tasks to better serve the customers. Always learning something new at this place due to the vast size of what the company handles. Co-workers here are amazing with great attitudes because of the atmosphere USAA creates. Most difficult part of the job would be getting used to doing the same task on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part is the people who work there. They make it a very enjoyable place to be.
good,"Daily  routine consisted of AM report time working in inbound/outbound call center environment managing job pipeline varying from 40-100 cases with strict closing deadlines. Processors adhere to all Federal, Underwriting Guidelines while collecting, reviewing, approving all loan documents required for closing and funding of loan withing set time frames, deadlines.

good,"USAA has the honorable mission of serving the men and women of the military and their families and helping to ensure their financial security. I have worked for the company for over 15 years and can tell you that this culture of service permeates how the company is run and decisions are made. USAA is probably one of the only companies I know of, outside of a non-profit, where a viable business case can be made for an initiative or project  solely because it helps the member money or improves their financial well being."

I enjoyed talking to all the different people. I answered every call like it was my first call of the day and with a smile. My manager was the bomb very supportive, positive and upbeat. I really liked being part of a TEAM. The most enjoyable part of my job, I would have to say was ""doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do"" (it's the company moto and they live by it).

good,A typical day for me was working 13.5 hours shift with highly productive numbers as a mail tech operator. I learned many skills but one important thing that I learned was that I was able to cross-trained in operating mechanical machines. Our management team was very outgoing and supportive in our work environment. Our management team would always encourage us to continue our education. The hardest part of the job was losing my job because of false information by one of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was being a lead and supporting my teammates.

They have been in business for 90+ years and still going strong because they have such a strong conviction and they pass it on to the staff of honor, integrity, loyalty, and service to the greatest customers/members the United States Military and their families. They do the right thing because it is the right thing to do. An example is when wild fires devastated large areas of California, instead of having our members send a detailed list of what they lost, USAA gave them the total face value of their policies; and when there is a natural catastrophe such as Katrina or a unnatural catastrophe such as 911, USAA is there. I am proud to say that I have worked for USAA."
