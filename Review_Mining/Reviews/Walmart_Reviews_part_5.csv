rating,review
good,"the company itself isn't the issue.Its the people that are in management.Its the lack of communication and the lack of care.Its hard for a full time college student and full time walmart employees didn't mind doing both full time however when they started scheduling me to work on days at the hours I had class, thats when i realized they wanted me to just work for them full time."
good,"Working at this company is okay, but you have to have patience and have a positive attitude.  They people are nice and friendly there. Its okay so far."
good,"The management at the Mesa Riverview store feels clueless. They don't communicate with each other, leaving associates stressed out when three managers come by one after another asking about the same concerns. "
good,the management is too lazy. managers do not take complaints seriously and are biased based on ethnicity. new employees get targeted by people who have been working for a while and try to rule or pressurize the new ones.  they expect a lot of work and pay minimum wage.
good,"sorry I do not want to talk about it,thanks. I learn how to stocker the item on the shelves. the management is sometime good, funning. when your task is to work in many department."
good,Management is only concerned with the company and not with employee. No consideration is given to what is going on outside work or how health may effect job performance.
good,Most employees were a joy to work with; supervisors played the politics of the business quite well. The hardest part of the job was satisfying everyone
good,"Walmart was chronically understaffed, making it stressful for customers and employees. I was harassed by lower management until I quit after being embarrassed in front of a line of customers. I was never allowed to get full time status, even after working 40 hours a week. My schedule was changed 24 hours before my shift and I was not notified until I showed up at work and my direct supervisor said I was late for my shift. I was not valued as an employee, and was told in no uncertain terms I was replaceable. My coworkers and the customers were the only high points to working in this environment."
good,Walmart is a challenging job because you try to help the customer and follow the guidelines too.  A typical day for me is servicing my customers by returning items and helping them make the right choices with paying there bills. I love my customers some makes your day.  The hardest part about my job is when the customers comes up with an attitude and you have to be nice.
good,"The job is a physical job, you are on your feet for 8 hours a day."
good,"Not allowed to have a personal life. If you want to advance or Make a decent pay, you almost have to live their. Hours are all over the place. Unorganized. Penalized for unauthorized overtime (10+ minutes over regular end time) . On a positive note, most the managers and the store manager are amazing people."
good,A typical day at work was usually stressful. Management was never easily available to settle dispuets with angry customers when there was nothing more that the customer service department could do. They had to many regulations that did not allow us to go above and beyond our job descriptions to help the customer.
good,just put your hands out and spin around its that like working at wal-mart just go go go with no where to go or direction its always changing from one boss to the next hurry up and do this way to only do it again and there is never enough time to do job because your always doing someone else and then there is the threatening of getting coached daily.
good,Walmart should work with the employer school schedule and never ask a employer to pick between there education or there job. Walmart manager will ask their employees to work over time then the next day tell you tell leave early because you can not get paid over time. I worked for Walmart for 4 years and never got promoted for my hard work. A customer called Walmart Corporate to give me a compliment   about my customer service ethic and I did not get recognize for my hard work.
good,I like the way they have there crew set up it’s a fun work place i don’t like they way the mangers ignore you when u need there help with a customer the mangers don’t do anything but run crazy around the store
good,Walmart is ok for the time.. Hate losing hours for no reason when i am a hard worker and dedicated to what i do.. Walmart need to give more praise to good workers
good,"It all depends in which department you work for and who you report to.."
good,Productive company to work.not flexible enough and it was very hard for me to balance my kid's and life as a mother with the hours I could never get the right hours to make it so I wouldn't have to pay extra for childcare.
good,"To begin, I would like to thank Walmart for the opportunity..."
good,"Very poor management, there were times where I felt very much stressed. Under so much stress I was unable to breathe on three occasions. The management team did not inform me of a schedule change. I had no clue, until I showed up to work. By then they said they just figured I quit."
good,Management sucks @ 2025. It’s really not up to how hard you work it’s about who you know and get close to before your even allowed to promote. The managers are rude.
good,Managers were not very interested in the needs and obstacles in the way of associates. They showed a lack of interest in making sure associates are accommodated well. You have to jump through loops and be favored by management in order to advance your career within the company. It is a good job to start with because it teaches you a lot of valuable skills and nuances that are helpful in the work field.
good,"stressful, with low to no benefits they need to improve on the management aspect of things. In addition, they should listen more to the employees to help make the company more suitable."
good,"deciphering physicians handwriting and typing prescriptions into the system, billing insurance,counting and filling prescriptions and working a cash register."
good,Walmart is very busy on Friday through Sunday. Very stressful environment. Would not refer anyone to this site. Department manager for cashiers will not approve anything requested. But i did notice the other department managers are very reasonable.
good,Walmart is a highly demanding and labor forcing company. Management can be very mean or has a niche for having an exacting    culture with only high care for the company goals rather than employees
good,The work environment was kinda stressful sometimes because the management was not very good at scheduling people and the days they had massive workloads. The compensation was decent.
good,"The job pays okay, management is a joke. Family first is a lie. The only money Walmart cares to save is its own. Unstable working hours, they will mandate 50 or 60 hour weeks one week then the next you wont even give you your full shift."
good,I was not here long enough to get any benefits. I was able to move my cashier position to then work in the auto and lube department. Soon after that i had my car accident and could not come back to work fast enough.
good,Poor working conditions for the pay and for the job.  Tell you one thing and do another. Made it sound good in the beginning and turn around and do something else
good,A Typical day at Wal-Mart is liking being at the store all day I learned that team work matter here management was very cool fast going place in fun place to work at
good,"They treat maintenance like the bottom of the burrel. Customers are rude, and management is ruder. They want you to do your job, however they always ask you to do something else. Then when the original job doesn’t get done they swear up and down you don’t do your job...."
good,It was a summer job before collage started. Was a cashier and people didn't treat me very well almost looked down upon wasn't a fan of the Management/ culture of Walmart.
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. The work isn't overly difficult, but the management could use an overhaul (at least at the one where I worked), and employees are treated as if they are expendable."
good,"Good for people who have nothing but time if retired and money but when you got a family no snowball chance in hades, and to think pathways was supposed to make walmart employment more equitable, and competative. just dumping potential salaries into wasteless void of program."
good,"I worked for Walmart for many years. The first 6 were great. Management was fair and treated you as an employee/person well. We received great benefits. When I had issues medically doing my job they found me a comparable position in the store to move to. When the Management changed is when the store changed. They are not fair to all employees. If you are not someone who brown noses them you will get singled out and treated poorly, especially if you have any sort of medical problem. "
good,"At Wal-Mart you would you would typically come in clock on  and ask manager what cashier register they would have you at, at Wal-Mart I always learned about my customer service and leadership."
good,"Overall if you need a job to make ends meet then yes Walmart would be the job to seek! Other than that if you can't do better than unloading big semi truck sized freight, breaking it down assembly line style ,coding and categorizing then putting it all out on the floor, then go for it!"
good,"Fast pace, the typical day at work would result in long hours and hard physical work. The management staff at DC 6024 was top of the line and would do anything for you."
good,"Typical Day at work: Stocking and Pushing Carts"
good,"Working at Walmart is okay, although it can get stressful. You learn to have patience because your gonna get asked a lot of simple questions. Walmart’s management can definitely use some work and their work ethics rules."
good,"For the most part I do enjoy working for Walmart, but my store in particular is very drama filled and immature mostly on behalf of the management department. No one uses the open door policy due to fear of being reprimanded, and management treats its employees like children and has a bad habit of talking down to them. I do enjoy most people I work with and have had a mixture of different types of customers I have had to deal with but find it enjoyable and exciting. They have been really good about working with me as far as my schedule due to my children so that is a plus."
good,"Hardest part about working at Walmart is always understaffed, having to do other associates work due to them not wanting/willing to work. What was enjoyable about working at  Walmart? probably learning new things, helping customers who were actually NICE and appreciated your service and meeting new people. Culture is very diverse but depending on where you live it can be a hassle. Typical day is cleaning up after people constantly, keeping things neat and clean for customers, cleaning up messes, assisting customers to what they were looking for. Management was mediocre, depending on the manager they either liked you, or didn't like you and made you do more than others. It was never meant to be sided and picking favorites, but it happens more times than none. I worked at walmart for 5 years and i honestly hated going into work sometimes, other times, didn't mind so much. It all depends on the store, department and management. I got treated fairly good for the most part because i was dependable and independent and did what i was asked to do."
good,"Every store is different. There is much dissatifaction at my particular store in several areas such as: lack of hours, poor management and an increase in ""customers"" shoplifting."
good,the management was poor and did not help with anything. they changed my schedule with out my knowledge and then wrote me up for it. they did not care about my opinion.
good,"overly managed, rude and nasty managers, talked to employees really bad. underpaid,overworked. Attendance policy changed for the worse. loved meeting new people everyday."
good,A typical day at Walmart is having a staff meeting at the beginning of your shift and completing your tasks. What I have learned from working at Walmart is everybody expects you to know what you are doing on your very first day. Management to me was hard to find when needing to ask for help and management also asks you questions that they already know the answer to but still proceed to ask you and interrupt your work. The workplace culture at Walmart is relatively nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job is trying to remember where items go and sometimes working with unrealistic time frames to complete tasks. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was when other co-workers decided to through a pot-luck.
good,Work hard help where needed take care of customers stock shelves clean you are in constant contact with people if you are not a people person then this may not be a job for you
good,"At first I loved my job. They decided to change my hours, the old manager was such a nasty person. I do not do well with nasty. A person that feels appreciated will give their best and or beyond best. We all work very hard, but aren't treated well at all."
good,your  pay per hour is good they just don’t give you enough hours . Everything was part time and they would not give you the hours you need.  I have the best customers anybody could ever have.
good,Wal-Mart is a company that has its flaws like every other the company out there. What you have to keep in mind is that you are the one asking them (walmart) for a job not the other way around. So if your intentions are negative your experience with be negative.
good,"Company required a lot from their employees, high expectations and demanding.  Not much room for movement up as there are many people struggling to move up."
good,"The way that walmart has their system set up, it doesn't really have a good set-up for students. You would think that, the biggest business would be flexible or have remote options."
good,"El trabajo es tranquilo mientras no se encuentras los jefes superiores ya que ellos generan estrés en los empleados ya que los empleados tienen mala actitud hacia sus compañeros, si tuve la oportunidad de tener un buen jefe directo que siempre estuvo al pendiente de mis necesidades y de enseñarme todo lo necesario para poder ejercer mi puesto como debe ser"
good,its hard to work there because you don't get paid enough money and even when your hours get cut they expect you to do the same amount of work as when you have the full time hours.  also they dont appreciate the good workers that they do have.
good,I had to plead to get a couple of days off for my daughters surgery because it was considered to be in the no time off period but the night manager was able to take off for a gun show.  The hard workers had to pick up the slack of the slow workers and still got criticized.
good,i did not like working for this company. they did not take care of their associates at my store. the store manager put band aid fixes on the problems instead of taking care of the real issues at hand.
good,stressful and sometimes hostile.  things are always changing for no good reason.  there doesn't seems to be a balance between work and family.  management constantly changes. once you get to know one manager a new one emerges.  sometimes we lack the bodies to get things done.  turnover is high
good,"Not enough training,short staffed most days not fair to the people that show up and work everyday.Walmart can and should raise there pay for the stress level alone! Customer first scheduling won't work!!"
good,"The one i worked at was pretty busy so it was fast paced which i preferred. The management wasn't great. You don't get treated with respect all the time, almost like you are lesser than everyone and replaceable. I understand it's a business but they do not care about your life outside of work, like they don't care for doctor excuses or anything. Other than that it's okay."
good,"- Bad management ~ no communication"
good,"Casual days with bad management , didn't learn anything but how to be cashier, hardest part of the job is trying to end your shift . most enjoyable part helping the customers."
good,"No one there seemed to care about their jobs, even most managers. I worked at the customer service desk with three other girls. They booked off all the weekends so I never got to have a weekend off. They wouldn’t even let me have my birthday off when I booked it over 2 months in advance. Was bullied by another associate but nothing was done about it."
good,"Stressing over making your numbers - which are set at unattainable levels. No benefits until your 13 months of employment. Plus side, the warehouse is climate controlled and very clean and safe."
good,"Love working with customers. No day is the same, as they bring up different issues and concerns. Had the support necessary to complete daily functions and job requirements."
good,"Job was great. Better without Current Management Team. management was very unprofessional! got injured on the job due to poor working areas. my injury and issues was talked about around work area, and i was hurassed outside the worksite."
good,They show favoritism and do not promote people who deserve to be promoted. They take advantage of good workers. Management also needs to be trained better. You should not be a store manager that hands out work to be done when you don't understand how to do the work.
good,"I worked at walmart for a year. I was there when the starting pay was $7.90 an hour, and that got raised to $9.00 an hour. It was alright, I didn't really like the managers. Most of them would get mad at you for following the policy on returns."
good,Supervisors treat people with disabilities different and do not like to give accommodations. This was not a job you can see yourself growing in. Walmart as a company may be different but the store I worked for acted completely asinine to many people with disabilities.
good,"My manager specifically was a joy under which to work, but their is little to no room for advancement. And the flow of information is inconsistent and bottle necked from person to person."
good,"A typical day was clocking in at the time clock, then sitting through a fifteen to thirty minute ""Prep"" meeting.Then it was either receiving freight and distributing to its proper location, or managing the product modular for different areas of the store. "
good,"younger people are ignored and used, not appreciated and looked odown on by the older department managers.. hard ton get time off.........................................."
good,"Very fast paced.  You are expected to ring up so many items per minute, and process credit card payments, gift cards, etc. within that time period. Stressful."
good,"This job wasn't bad, but it was an inconvenient drive for me at the time, and the job itself was very slow-paced and the hours could be inconsistent at times."
good,its very stressful working at Walmart.You have to worrie about if theres going to be enough help to assit the custumers.its a diverse work population the custumers and co workers are the best part of the job.
good,"I think walmart has the potential to be a very professionally impressive workforce, however, they need regular professional Auditing of there leaders."
good,"People Greeting,  tendering, Working service department.  Helping and answering questions for customers, zoning your area."
good,"Well, I kept to myself at work and I didn't experience too many issues while working at work aside from some of the management members slacking sometimes on schedules and assisting during a busy day."
good,"A lot of multi-tasking and customer service issues, Time will most definitely fly by no matter what department you work in. All associates worked together to make the customer's shopping experience a good one."
good,Was demanding job and we were expected to do more than one could in the time they allotted for us to get certain jobs done  and on top of that they would pull you from assignment to help other areas then get upset that things were not done on time...
good,They work extra hard to keep employees from receiving health benefits by making it so that you have to work 40 hrs consistently to qualify for health care benefits . They do this by hiring a lot of part time employees .
good,Fresh manger didn't know how to do her job would stand and watch when there was one employee in deli and would let the struggle instead of helping she should be more concerned with her real job instead of trying to get co manager the people in the deli was unprofessional and was nothing but drama
good,"Smaller walmarts are impossible to move up in without being someone's friend in management, or sleeping with them to get ahead. Bigger walmarts are fantastic, but be warned."
good,"Es muy buena la remuneración y el trato personal si llegas a las metas, pero si no llegas es estresante y agobiador el ambiente laboral . llega a un punto de estrés y cero consciencia con las personas que trabajábamos 9 horas de pie y con sólo media hora hora de colación."
good,They pay different for different people for the same job. Fast paced. No benefits. Not full time hours. They fired me for a dumb reason. I guess you can't get sick or have kids that get sick.
good,If you don't like dealing with customers & being available 24 hours a day then don't apply here. Hours are cut from your schedule if you don't have open availability (aka: a life or family). Full time will not be granted if you don't have open availability. There were too many managers that talk down to their associates & not enough managers that stand up for them or praise them when it's long overdue.
good,Management needs to be trained better on guidelines and procedures and how to enforce guidelines and procedures more effective and efficiently with employees! The work atmosphere could be better!
good,It was good for the most part I earned alot of money and met alot of new people I learned alot of new things and learned how to push myself harder. Awesome.
good,I have worked in walmart for a total of 2 years now and i wish some days I would have never gone back. Management are all one for there own and doesn't care about anyone but themselves
good,"It was hard job at first. They do not train well. I stocked shelves, helped all departments. I was wellimy to learn new things in the store. Got along with the other associates, team leaders and managers. It was a revolving door if associates. My favorite area was cosmetics."
good,"If you only need a job and make some money, it's not bad. But if you're looking to advance quickly, work in an extremely friendly environment and looking for good management this is not the job you want. Everyone gossips about everyone, all your secrets are told to everyone, and management doesn't care about your problems at all. Management is there for their paycheck and most of them are power hungry. Glad I don't work there anymore. But hey, if you just need a job to go to, go home, and get your paycheck, then it's not a bad job at all."
good,"associates were great, some of management had never had their hands dirty to understand jobs they were over last manger had no idea of how to manage a shop or what tools were actually used for in the shop, nor could he find stock in the shop. Associates would express needs or improvements that would create a safer workplace and constantly disregarded. Appropriate tools and staffing not provided. there was very little communication from one assistant manager to another that made it extremely difficult to keep up with changes in order and process."
good,Ótima experiencia aprendi muito e foi uma grande oportunidade.
good,The break periods are very good but other than that it's pretty fast paced and you are alone most of the time. Managers aren't around often and 3rd shift is very hard to balance life with.
good,"This place seems to have the most bizarre and backwards ways of handling things. New rules are in place nearly daily, though not discussed properly. They do not act on rules that would benefit the company and its customers by saving money so we can sell cheaper products but instead prioritize all customers, especially it seems those that have a tendency to steal and thieve. Making a valid and informed decision tends to lead to poor consequences, however doing literally nothing will seemingly get you higher up on the chain."
good,Great entry-level jobs. Good for students coming to Antigonish and need to balance work and school. Scheduling is fairly accommodating. They make an effort.
good,"Empresa boa,porem a carga horaria e muito cansativa"
good,"Okay place to work at first, then you are treated like you don't exist. No matter how hard you work it's not enough. Decent starting pay unless you have a family to support. You're promised full-time but never get it."
good,The employer and management in several locations is very biased to the managers favorites. No provided room for advancement because of this. No real benefits and hours are always cut then added.
good,Management constantly pushing associates to meet unreasonable expections. Favoritism is seen every day.  Hard to transfer.  No appreciate for anything
good,"Busy running to the back of the store to cover the 2nd department, as well as taking overflow customers from the check-out lines."
good,"the front end employees are great and unappreciated for all they do, it would make a difference if they could take a step back and reevaluate management."
good,Managment is pretty awful and people just geniuinely don't care the only nice are to work is produce but then the job just draines you emotionally there are a few good people there but other than that good luck
good,When I got hired it was during inventory season so i worked full time hours even though I was told it was temporary part time and when inventory was done my hours were cut by alot and i couldn't pay my bills so needed a full time job instead.
good,"Didn't like it. No communication, no opportunity to advance. Schedule was all over the place, don't take time to listen to employees. Not paid fairly for your work."
good,"not so good management , management did not know a lot I had to teach them , workplace culture is better than most company's , people not doing there jobs , going home at end of the day!"
good,It was me big componey.  Team work and also personal job.  Motivate job.  It was the second level of position and responsibility after receiving room . I learned using gun telezone.
good,"Everyone is in a bad mood and the Walmart I was at had bad management, so when things are unorganized it makes it difficult for each department to perform efficiently."
good,I would not recommend this to anyone. Third Shift cashiers were expected to do the work of four people combined when there was only two people actually working. SEVERELY understaffed.
good,I didnt appreciate the new management. How they treated their employees and how they did not care about the health issues of others. they put people in places where they shouldnt have been.
good,"Wal-mart has a great sense of team work and cooperation when it comes to duties around the store. Wal-mart has a productive, fast paced environment serving customers in a timely fashion"
good,"Working for wal-mart in Oregon was amazing but once transferred to the Madera store I realized that not all Wal-marts were the same. The management team is never around when you need them."
good,"they work you like a dog, only care about results , kept shrinking overnight staff but wanted everything done , the Customer service managers ignored customers fought with them  did not care. The management  there were only a few good managers  but if a manager helped employees or went to bat for them the got transfer"
good,"They make you work even though you might be sick. They have a point system where even if you are sick they will not let you get of work unless you were in the hospital. No doctors notes or anything. I do love my coworkers, but the management is was too strict and you can't get through your work day without feeling the stress of management. There is never enough workers because no one wants to work there."
good,i'm there but it's still a wrong place for people to work now and  days.management is zero.i will never recommand someone near me or a friend to work there.
good,I felt like i was always on the run or being discriminated because of my skin tone. I felt like everyone was watching me and the mangers were rude and mean.
good,"My experience with Walmart is that this generation has completely forgotten that Sam Walton built his company on excellent customer service and the culture he created dictated that his associates are important. I found that management is completely disengaged from its associates, is disrespectful and sometimes does not adhere to their own policies, such as scheduling associates outside of their availability or even greeting customers and/or offering assistance."
good,Walmart did not care about their employees only the money coming in. They did not care if you were sick or had a death in the family they wanted you to be on-call all day everyday in case they needed you.
good,I liked working there. I liked my department manager. I got a promotion in a short time. But I could not get enough hours and the pay was low for the responsibilty.
good,Wal-Mart is a great company...i love the stebilty it gives the areas they are in but I hate there mangers. I've worked for 3 different Wal-Mart and all the management are the same
good,"Not he best place to work, and that is all I am going to say about that. If you are a college student or high school student do not get your hopes up about them working with your school schedule."
good,Management wants you to do more work with less pay. Do not recommend. Atmosphere is not positive and give false information regarding pay and promotions.
good,"My managers spent more time talking about there personal lives smoking cigarettes and joking around with other members of the team, as it would get closer to the end of a work day the would then start to team up and speed through their work not actually finishing anything their selves. i would stay behind for hours after my shift was over to help put up restock and have to clock out at 7 and not leaving till 9 sometimes 10, i relocated do to the issue of being worked over 40 hours not receiving a pay raise or overtime pay out. Had i not relocated i would of been fired for refusing to clock out and stay to help others"
good,"As working for Walmart for a good amount of time, every request I put in there got denied, and  they do not except doctors notes whatsoever so it is counted as a full absence"
good,"A typical day at working at walmart, can sometime be very long and stressful. The times of the shift was extremely early depending the shift you are on and that makes extremely hard for singe parints."
good,"Not productive."
good,Management is horrible . Makes the environment terrible . Worked here for 1 year and it was terrible . You can never advance in this company at all . Everyone is rude
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for seven and a half years. I liked it for the first 3 years because my store manager was a man who actually interacted with his associates. He was a clean, organized store manager who kept the store ""ship-shape."" He eventually left the company. It WAS a fun place to work. There was room for growth with the company, but only if you knew someone or were favored over someone else. The four years following, my experience was not so great. The management team did not care about the associates (in my previous store). They do not care about your medical health or family obligations. (An experience I have had recently) In my opinion, we were all just numbers to them and they were ready to replace us as soon as they could. Again, this is just my experience and opinion from my previous store. I am sure someone else may have better experiences."
good,"Very horrible company to work for, it's hard to move up in the company because they play favoritism to there employee. They don't give you enough hours and the pay is horrible and they work you to death. I have seen people get fired for nothing, I suggest not working for walmart."
good,a empresa e era boa quando eu entrei a cinco anos atras hoje ta muito ruim pra trabalhar perdemos direito   como convênio médico e a empresa faz vc fazer funções q n é da gente sem nem dar treinamento
good,The management team needs an over haul. That store has been through four store managers in the past few years.  The turn over rate for the entire store is horrible.
good,"My Wal-Mart experience has varied from facility to facility. Some Wal-Mart's can be a great work experience, however the one that I'm at now is a disaster. It's management is shoddy at best, chaotic and no accountability.  Moral is at an all time low. I hope that when my year and a half is over, I'll be tranfering back to my last Wal-Mart."
good,If you are a college student do not work at wal mart. There is really nothing else to say about this job but that it is a regular non college student oriented job.
good,Typical day at work is hectic on weekdays and slower on weekends. I learned to drop and fill prescriptions. Management needs improvement and employees are bad.
good,The changes are stupid to me. They took a lot of things away from the employees and then expect them to stay. Management is still lacking in the right leadership. There is a lot of play with the roles of management with the employees. The ones that work are rarely noticed.
good,"A typical day at work at Walmart is never typical, it is all over the place and rarely focused. As an 11 year associate I would say it is a great temporary spot to work but it will eat you up if you let it."
good,This company the associates are nice to work with.  Some of the managers are not moody and if they don't like you they will make it difficult for you.
good,Walmart was not a great place to work for. I started out as a door host and was sexually assaulted and none of the managers seemed to care except one. They moved me to her department and I was continually harassed because my best friend was in the same department. We worked great together and our department manager saw that but other managers wanted us separated.
good,"Terrible co-workers, they are all discriminating and talk about others. No body can get along everyone doesn't have there stuff together especially mangers,"
good,I worked at Wal-Mart as a seasonal worker.  Pay was nothing impressive but it definitely helped with the holidays.  Hours were not to bad seeing as I worked it as a second job.
good,management had unreal timelines and was understaffed. meat department manager had no idea how to run the department and left his job up to department staff. higher management was sloppy rushed tasks and had one person on meat department for 8 hours with a heavy workload. higher management would not fill department openings and had to pull staff from other departments including managers for other departments to do the work of the of department manager.
good,Pay is great depending on what area they put you in. Treatment isn't always fair or right. Hours get cut without you knowing. Not always flexible with hours.
good,"The people I work with are amazing. The manager I work under is not very understanding nor caring. The manager is unwilling to work with my college schedule, nor did he understand that I'm in school for a trade; welding. The best part of my day is when I get the chance to work the customer service desk. I love the people that come in and my co-workers who usually run the service desk."
good,"What more do you have to say about Walmart, other than ""It's Walmart."" The name alone incites a cringe to former employees. They work you to death, have you work every other department but your own, get mad at you for not having your department done, and then stick you at the checkout anyway."
good,the management was always somewhere else when you needed them half the time they were in the back just hanging out and talking. never actually got trained by a person it was all by computer
good,"Hard to get breaks on time, schedule are changed daily so you must check all the time. Long waits for help from management. The managers are rude to cashiers and move very slowly when you may need change, etc."
good,"Days are very atypical compared to the guidelines that are supposed to be followed.  It is an age-old problem that everyone is aware of, yet cannot seem to get fixed."
good,"Handle cash daily and assist customer, wire transfers , handle large amounts of cash. Close store at night by pulling all the money from each register."
good,Terrible place to work never again. The employees where very good and nice to be around the main problem was with the mangers. Just like everyone else that works there.
good,When I went to walmart the trainers did not have to really train me because I've had experience in customer service and I knew what I were doing. Working at walmart is a fast pasting environment.
good,"A normal day consists of working the register, stocking the shelves, assisting customers, and making sure the shelves look neat and orderly.  There isn't much to learn at the job other than what you do on the register as that can vary from day to day.  Management can be helpful at times and other times you have to seek them out to get any help done.  The culture of the job is below average."
good,"understaffed crew trying to work on a project that is way too "
good,in my experience It was hard work for bad pay. I worked overnights for 3 years and only made it to 9.10. your night does go by fast do to lots of freight so your always busy.
good,"Management was very scattered, disoriented, & unprofessional. Store manager did his job well, in my opinion, and was enjoyed by the associates and managers. Lower level management didn't not know how to accurately do their jobs, or just chose not to do so."
good,"Communication is atrocious, Management finds a way to dance around important questions regarding pay and policies, the majority of employees are unhappy with almost everything except for the pay, which is actually pretty decent. A typical day at work is long and mind numbing, and the only enjoyable part of the position is the few like minded people and leaving at the end of the day."
good,"Essa foi a minha segunda empresa, sobre o local de trabalho foi de controle de entrada e saída de funcionários e promotores, controle de docas e inibir contra furto e roubos de mercadorias."
good,It went okay. The managers decided to get big heads and decided that the workers didnt matter. The my share and discount cards were cool. I hate that we were only paid every 2 weeks and the discounts didnt cover food.
good,"Mis compañeros de trabajo excelentes personas, nos apoyabamos en todo"
good,Good jobs for students or someone seeking management in retail but very stressful and fast paced work environment.  Doesn't have a good family to job ratio
good,"My typical day at Walmart began with me beginning my 9 hour shift by speaking to a floor manager about which register I would be taking over and about any promotional deals, I would chit chat with the customers about their day while bagging their groceries in a swift but tidy and safe manner,  I would return their change and receipt then smile to send them off , wipe down my register area then I would go wait to greet my next customer and repeat. I did get two 15 minute breaks paid and an hour un paid lunch, which was sweet."
good,The customer service their sucks and all you hear from other employees is its not my dept or its not my job.Everyone including management passes the buck and blames someone else for why we can not help the customers. Always under staffed but the cashiers never get 40 hrs.
good,Took awhile to advance. Money isn't worth the stress.its not bad if you can stay away from highschool behavior.prepare to be overworked.they have current technology available to ensure product availability.
good,"They fired me because I said raw chicken is nasty, during my lunch break. They were looking for a reason to fire me, since they only hired me because they knew my mom was having surgery, she worked there at the time. When she got back to work, I was getting ready to but in my 2 weeks since I was going to become a full time care giver to my dying grandmother."
good,I have worked here for a short period of time and can honestly vouch for this being the most unethical and unprofessional setting I have ever worked for. Upper management such as; co-managers and store manager do not efficiently delegate. Store manager unresponsive to recognizing employees other than winking at them. Many co managers do not even know how to operate computer training system at the store. Most of the team the tools needed to do the job you are there for are not even provided. Wal mart will take initiative to go through your belongings inside of lockers to see if you have taken their property. (Where is the sense of privacy?) PATHETIC
good,"it started off great loved the atmosphere, then with new management it became more about pleasing them rather then the customer. "
good,"não tem trabalho em equipe."
good,It was a good learning experience but there was no room for advancement. Manager​ was very unprofessional. I did learn some good skills. Also l learned good communication skills and how to perform good customer service under any condition. Overall decent experience.
good,Great co-workers. Enjoyed interacting with customers. Enjoyed helping seniors and disabled.  The children were a delight. Enjoyed learning new things about baking and bakery products.
good,"Having the opportunity to help customers find certain products and also having the tools needed to complete task such as manual jacks,store scanners to find products etc"
good,"Unfortunately at the store I worked in, the management staff had a double standard of dealing with employees. The employee's they like were given lots of leeway while those that they did not like were treated like slaves. For example, when stocking in a particular area the computer only gives the employee a certain amount of time to complete the nights' tasks for those employees who were liked these times were never applied. However, employees who were disliked were held to the times, and if they did not meet these times, they were written up and eventually terminated."
good,"Decent work place, a bit unorganized but i think because the company is so large, thats what happens. Management could be better but I didn't stay long enough"
good,A typical day at work for Walmart in Bastrop Tx consists of trying to figure out which manager to listen to and how to untangle the mess of different instructions each manager has set for the day .
good,i never really enjoyed working for walmart due to the fact that management was never on the same page and each member of management thought they were above another which in turn made my job and my co workers jobs alot more diffcult
good,The Wal-Mart i worked at was extremely ghetto and unprofessional... They always had a new store manager because they couldn't keep them. Not all Wal-Mart are like this one though
good,"Company is very company oriented.  All changes seem to be for corporate benefit.  Consistently understaffed and consistently overwhelmed with work to do, seems to be a methodology of consistently being able to complain about work not getting completed - yet death on overtime.  This may be location specific as I have heard rumors that other stores follow a different path. "
good,it was the best place that i have worked so far but i hated it. i think that this survey is a waste of my time. i dont understand why i need to do this survey.
good,I've worked at Wal-mart stores for 4 years and in those 4 years I can say that they do believe in advancing their employees and hiring from within however the starting rate could have been a lot better. The work /life balance is very poor. As a cashier I worked every single weekend and barely had time to spend with family. Micromanagement environment.
good,"I work in the photo lab and I work  also in fabrics, site to store, and electronics.  I also help with freight every night. "
good,"I enjoyed my work in the accounting office, but was unable to keep the early schedule due to my family needs. "
good,Working for Wal-Mart overall wasn't too bad. Most of the stress came from dealing with over-excited customers and managers who really didn't want to be there.
good,"I transferred from a store to the Home Office. At first, my job was amazing, but then there was leadership change. From that point on, there was no longer job security. My team alone lost over 49 people due to poor management."
good,Walmart was childish work place. I know that's not very  professional but it's the only way I can describe the  environment  I was placed in for 2 years and 10 months. Management did not act as managers very unprofessional with everything.
good,Única coisa que era difícil lá é a questão de trabalhar de domingo a domingo
good,"No work life balance so if you have a family this is not the job for you..  Too many tasks to get done within a tight time frame."
good,I learned cashiering. Working there is too much drama. Management judges you and watches your every move to pick at you. I only enjoyed working there for the first few months.
good,it was an okay job the manager made you do their jobs and your own and u will get in trouble if your job wasn't done. Must of the manager thought since they was above you they can treat you how ever they like
good,Really bad management they don't ever do what they say they will do always wanting to coach people never their problem always on you an they always make things difficult an put to much on the employees
good,"commencer ma journée de travail"
good,"This can be a hard place to work. When it is good it's great, but when it's bad it's horrible. If you can handle it you'll be fine. If you are very sensitive, try another place."
good,"Do not plan to support a family with Walmart hours and wages."
good,Walmart has became a money hungry company. The customer service that was trained to us was if you see a costumer help them but dont help them to long. If you do then you in trouble for not doing your job. They want to see how to make more money and how to cut cost thats why there are less workers then what it use to be.
good,"nice, safe, clean, fast, and friendly working enviornment. I have learned stocking, zoning, and keeping a clean and safe work area. Also, to serve all customers to the best of my ability."
good,"The company is not geared toward individuality, however, the management at the individual stores, are trying hard to be open and accommodating to employees needs. Individuals are outgoing and do what they can to have a good outlook on each work day."
good,Everyone knows Walmart pays little and expects a lot out their workers. The benefits are expensive and not that good. Even management positions are not always given 40 hours.
good,"If you weren't a usual they wouldn't treat you fairly, managers would constantly threaten to fire you over nothing especially if you didn't stay for overtime,"
good,"This place is no longer where i want to work, I get treated very poorly. Management has wanted to get rid of me due to my identification"
good,I love working in the Deli it was a fast pace job which i like. And interacting with the public was a plus. the hardest part of the job was running the deli by yourself when there should have been 3 people to each shift but i just did what i had to and did my job.
good,"começo o dia de trabalho tendo que aceitar perseguição ate se precisar ir ao banheiro tenho que dizer o que vou fazer."
good,"walmart is a great place for people to start building working experiance but dont get caught up there too long. get what you need and get out."
good,"three days on, four days off. sounds fine."
good,"En general en lo personal no es buena empresa ya que los salarios son muy castigados y nunca me pagaron las horas extras que labore, adicional ni el finiquito fue acorde a tiempo trabajado y cuando solicite apoyo por estudios excusaron que no era posible por no tener medio tiempo y a quien no lo necesitaba se lo otorgan."
good,"Long hours, not time for a social life. People can be a pain but it's can also be a fun place to work. They pay you over time for working holidays an on your birthday. Your work days will be very long an you don't get to sit down at all except on your lunch an your 15min breaks. So if you can't stand for long periods this job may not be for you."
good,"I had anxiety when it got close to time for work. the customers and employees where aggressive. I had a horrible experience with a department manager, who made it hard to get out the car to work. I suffered bad anxiety"
good,"In the Jewelry Department I learned to: change watch batteries. piece ear lobes and cartilage, change watch bands and remove links from certain watch bands."
good,I really thought I wanted to go back to Walmart loved working for the company in Texas but this store is like the twilight zone of Walmarts It doesn't matter how much you know or how hard you try it is a popularity contest. I have been interviewed for management positions that I have even held before and always told a BS reply as why I didn't get it. Sorry I have to go out side the company to put my degree to use and my years of knowledge but I know I'm more than a cashier.
good,N'est pas le domaine ou je me vois terminer mes jours. Je suis plus bureau que physique.
good,I personally think that management is very rude and unprofessional. The heart of the store is management and you cant promote smiling faces and happy customers if you have an attitude all day. I think that my co- workers were pretty nice and I miss some of them but had to resign. I just feel like that was definitely an environment I had to get away from.
good,"Basic daily lift driver operations,management not on same page. management not on the same page.Enjoyed coworkers.Provided assistant for order fillers."
good,If you are in need of your first job or are desperate. this is your company. Fairly simple training and day to day duties. Management has a lot going on so you wont get any one on one time.
good,"I was not comfortable with my manager, vulgar language and very rude to the customers. Regularly asked and tasked to things that were against store policy."
good,Working for Walmart is face pace and unique. I learned how to deal with all different types of people and how to defuse misunderstandings and upset customers. The management was not always there when you need them but you learn how to deal with things in your own way.
good,"There were times that it was tough, it sometimes seems that the shoplifters have more rights than the business.  My shift was an 11 hour day.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with a shoplifter that ran.  The best part was catching a shoplifter and sending them to jail"
good,"Aprendí mucho sobre los diferentes tratos en los demás países sobre el giro de dinero, aprender sobre las diferentes divisa su cotizaciones, documentación, trato con extranjeros, estar siempre atenta e informada. El trato con los compañeros fue siempre muy cordial, había mucha integración, trabajo en equipo."
good,Great place to meet new people. Associates was very friendly and helpful and management was lazy. Perfect job for a collage student because they work with your schedule.
good,"The pay sucks, the customers are rude but its to be expected considering its Walmart. The only good thing is the hours are pretty flexible since they have so many people employed but not enough hours for everyone."
good,"Not sure if my experience was the average or an extraordinary circumstance,  it was a bad roller coaster ride.  Super long hours and  management team that could care less who and what you brought to the table.  I went through 2 store managers and 2 district managers in 9 months.  Super red flag for anyone looking at this company.  Overall a great well paid company but the atmosphere for anyone in management is like living in thought the ground hog movie but with no end and it keeps getting worse than better."
good,"The main issue I had with this experience was the extremely low pay with a high work demands. I believe that an hour of my time is worth more than $7.25, regardless of the task(s)."
good,The day started out with a little meeting with the managers telling us our locations for the night. We then grabbed some scanners (that would help us find the location of products) and headed out to our aisle that we were assigned. Once done with that we went to the nearest manager to ask for our next assigned location. We then went to that location and started to restock that location. Breaks were every 2 and a half hours and were 15 minutes long. Lunch was 30 minutes long. Management was pretty poor. Super strict on breaks. The best part was the co-workers. I looked forward to seeing most of the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being constantly watched by the managers.
good,"Daily job includes clocking in, receive keys for the floor, auditing the register, responsible for every cash register in the building, and high customer service throughout the day"
good,"Open availability for 28 hours a week with no promise or outlook of being brought on full time. "
good,"the store isnt too smart in their operations. typical overworked understaffed and underpayed. many of us who are assigned to a certain area are asked to work many other departments as well due to them trying to save money but cutting everyone hours. i worked here for about 3 years, it has shown me nothing but hardship. my hours were consistently cut to the bare minimum sometimes further. my pay rate was unreliable to get me through a week. i had to work other jobs to make ends meet and ask for assistance just to get by. if you arent friends with the right people in the store, you will have a hard time progressing. they do it by like ability than skills"
good,Walmart is a great place to work but certain areas don't offer many hours and this is hard for a person that has a family. While managing other staff members it taught me to have empathy for others and how to be patient when dealing with irate customers and young adults. It is fun to learn several positions because you can become an asset to the company by being a flexible employee.
good,"Wal-Mart was a great part time position for college students needing to balance classes, activities and personal lives."
good,"I lived in a small town where there was no where else to work within a 45 minute drive. The store was small, the people were were small-minded. Management didn't care, there was no opportunity for advancement, and the salary wasn't enough to make working there bearable."
good,Okay company to work for. In Opelika the associate is always right no matter what. When your Doctor tells you that you have bad insurance you know your in trouble. Good pay but they do not care about you or your health. Impossible goals for Management and as management you Will pay the price if you do not conform or Kiss A##.
good,I didn't have a good experience at Walmart. There's bad management & no organization there. The workers are overall great people but it's not a job for me
good,"Horrible place to work. Management only cares about themselves and its very difficult to advance. Benefits suck, I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
good,"I am simply looking for a comfortable, nice, competitive working environment, where everybody is being treated equally. I worked at a majority Spanish store where it seems as if they get first hand on everything by networking with each other."
good,Communication from bottom up is awful. They pretend to be all about family but love making people work unscheduled holidays.
good,Management had so many favorite associates. All the managers and co workers had this favoritism going on. Walmart wouldn't allow us to work over time.
good,I worked at Popeyes for a year. The manager was okay but not to organized. I enjoyed working as a cashier but it got out of hand after a while. I was in high school at the time and they would keep me too late.
good,"Stressful. Management unprofessional and rude. Told to do one thing then get yelled at about something completely different. Management want to start too many things before finishing the last,"
good,Walmart would be good company to work for if their manager new how to treat their associated with respect. And offer them better money and allow them to keep overtime when work.
good,"Different IT environment. I really do not feel comfortable rating a place in which I currently work. Therefore, I respectfully decline to do so at this time."
good,Walmart has a lot to learn about employee relationship.  Underpayment and their high turnover rate is proof that Walmart has not mastered the importance of success with fair employee treatment.
good,"Walmart offers great compensation compared to other companies, however management and most other coworkers are over dramatic.. Our walmart offers plenty of chance for advancement but they only move other managers around. Never giving other hardworking career oriented workers a chance to move up in the company even if they've passed all required assesments."
good,worked for 9 years saw many changes over the years treat employees like slaves only interested in making money and saving money by cutting hours on the staff and giving the minimum amount of hours.
good,The hours at this place of employment varied too much. No benefits at this job which was a major drawback. This job was not difficult and centered around stocking new product received.
good,"Not the best company to work for when brown nosing is not your thing... if you love to brown nose to rise in ranks then Wal-Mart is the place for you! I recommend it to anyone who likes putting people on pedestals, if you do not brown nose and refuse to brown nose and you do decide to work for this company, be prepared to stay on the bottom of the barrel"
good,Great job for high school students or college students. It provided a great chance for me to make money to go to school & also as a second job. I enjoyed my time at Walmart & made plenty of friends. They also provided experience in customer service & other useful areas.
good,Management not very considerate of their employees. Lack of communication with their associates. Over worked and under paid. Not to flexible with schedules. Not very understanding when it comes to days off.
good,"at one point I felt like the managers here at this Wal-Mart played favorites, to certain races.. and from a professional stand point the management was not that great either. they were childish and spoke about people rudely, right to their face."
good,"Great people."
good,"It's very hard working at a billion dollar retail store as a Christian and a mother of 3. The benefits doesn't add up, the hours,  neither the wages. Over all I thank God for allowing walmart to be my season but it's not a great place to work"
good,they would change your hours or cut hours after they give you a raise so you would make less then what you made when you did not have a raise. its hard to get approved for time off and they give certain people different treatment.
good,"Work in a very fast paced, ever changing Environment, I have always excelled in multitasking. I have always loved the work I do, until recently. I have two children at the ages of 10 and 3, and I encourage them to be involved in extra activities. Recently its taken its toll driving 100 mile a day, and trying to be home in time for a ball game. Co-workers have always been great, although the use of cell phones in the work place contributes to low productivity, and unhappy customers."
good,"I didn't mind the work. I did have a hard time with management, my peers did as well. There's no tolerance for tardiness and absences which is fine but there's no flexibility and in my store we had some dishonest managers and some lower downs suffered, it was quite stressful"
good,ok place to work- employees did not want to help train you and sometimes team lead wanted you to skip break because of how busy lines were. I don't think they really cared just a huge wheel and deal environment.
good,"Laboro 7 Hrs al día soy jornada parcial, eh aprendido demasiadas cosas buenas tales como ser mas responsable y llevar un cuidado administrativo de la empresa, en cuanto a la gerencia no hay coordinación y organización, mis colegas todos buenas personas que al igual que yo nos esforzamos por dar lo mejor, la parte más difícil de mi trabajo es abordar ladrones, por otra parte solicitar permisos o bien algún beneficio, en realidad me gusto que hay trabajo en equipo por parte de los colegas y apoyo por parte de los mismos trabajando en equipo"
good,"needs drastic improvement."
good,i was a cashier. the lead never would help you if you needed help they were to busy. know one knows your name your just a number. cashiering was sometimes difficult
good,"I worked at night for Wal-mart for over four years. The first few years I was a cashier and they asked me multiple times to pursue management duties. I saw what the managers had to deal with and decided against it. Finally a manager that treated me with decency and respect, a rarity at this company, offered me a position and I took it. I worked the night shift for the next two years until they forced me to work outside my availability without asking me. I am an extremely hard worker and took my management duties very seriously but could not work the hours they wanted me to."
good,"Poca oportunidad de crecimiento, trabajo muy activo, poca vida social,  se puede colaborar con otras areas"
good,"work hard get nothing in return but you didnt work hard enough , no respect for no one not customers not a soul , worked there for years loved it , the customers and co-workers made my day , I learned a lot wrking in many areas"
good,"I liked the work because it was fast paced, but managment demanded one employee work the same as five employees. It did give me a chance to learn more about inventory control in a retail environment."
good,"I enjoyed hanging out with my peers in the break room. Even while working with them, it would always be fun and productive. The hardest part of the job would have been, the customers. The customer is always right motto, need to get tossed out. They feels as if they have power over us and so we as the associate get stepped on by everyone including management. My lovely co-workers were and will always be the reason to get off of bed in the morning to show up for work. Management is a joke, they forget how it was when they started from the bottom. They treat anyone who doesn't kiss their boots, just as bad as customers do. Those who have heart and low self esteem tend to be the first to go. The ones who swallow their pride and are courageous will make it through such a rough environment. A typical day at work would be to keep the department clean and help all customers who are within 10 feet of me with any questions or concerns they may have."
good,"One time at Walmart, a customer came in my lane with a full cart of stuff. As I Started scanning her items I asked her how were she today? she said,"" I been in here all day"" she gave me a Bucket of Blue Bells ice cream it messed up. She asked if I can get her another one, so I asked a CSM to get another ice cream she told another CSM to get it . I'm waiting ,the customer was waiting. I went to front and I asked,"" did anybody get the ice cream"" they told me No. I told the customer Ill go get the ice cream ,so I went and came back to my register with the ice cream. she was very happy ."
good,A typical day at Walmart is somewhat relaxing because you get out and meet new people. When they walk into the store some are friendly and some are not
good,"I worked as a cashier at a location in a small town, this may or may not be the reason this store was ran the way it was, I say this because I only worked at this location so I honestly have nothing to compare it to. As with any job hard work is involved, there were long hours, and being it is Wal Mart there was a variety of customers to work with. I handled registers with cash, dropping cash once a certain amount was in the drawer, handled department phone calls, inventory, returns, wired money, overlooked self check out, as well as stocking inventory."
good,"Not enough pay for the amount of work that is done.  Hours are not great.  Leadership was very poor communication.  If trying to keep a family afloat, this really is not the job for you.  However, good starting point for teenagers."
good,Didn't have steady hours.  Schedule would change on a daily basis.  Making me late or coming in on a day that was changed to day off.  Employees are rude to customers and managers don't care.
good,hope i don't have to come back. they make me work full time hours but they don't make me fulltime so they din't gave me any beneffits is really sad they use you
good,"Pay was brutal.  Workload was intense.  Before every shift they tell you how much the store made that day.  When they tell you $300,000 per day and pay min wage thats hard to take."
good,"Downsizing constantly, Point system unfair, stocking times unreasonable. Management treated everyone poorly. Poor woring conditions. Never recieved raises or bonuses."
good,This place is not the best place to work in as far as working with your managers. If you ever gave an opinion you were shot down as quick as you gave the opinion.
good,"I really do enjoy most if my days at work because I know I am working to be greater. Working for Walmart has taught me quite of bit of things even if it was unrelated to the job task at hand. I was given the opportunity to begin my journey 3 years ago as a sales associate in toys, and oh boy, to me it was the best position ever. I loved some of the managers that were over me, but there were some others that I just didn't quite care for. However, they all taught me well on how to stock the counters, zone the aisles, build presentable features, help customers find exactly what they are looking for, and also how to take down the counters to redo them for modular resets. I didn't really find anything terribly hard to do, but what made woking hard was the STRESS. This job can get really stressful at times due to the multiply tasks that almost everyone of management can ask you do. I can say that the only thing that made this job enjoyable for me was some of the coworkers I was able to meet and many of the customers I helped that became clients of mine."
good,"Unless you plan on making a career out of walmart, being employed is just a filler till you get a better job."
good,"Employees are awesome.  Management is rarely ever seen, if they are seen they will not help cashiers in getting lines down, love to scream and bark orders at customer service manager."
good,It was a good job at the time.  Became dull after a while. Same thing every day.  Loved working with customers and other associates.
good,"they expect this done "
good,"the work was good and steady, there were lots of times they wanted you to complete the impossible but we always managed to get the work done, the problem is the management team they are always out to get even or make you regret asking for days off. they are very anti social to the dept managers and assisociates.the part I liked most about my job was I was always busy and I loved the people I worked with and my customers."
good,My work environment was nice besides the bosses being indecisive about 80% of the time. If it one thing one person wants you to do there is another one telling you the opposite. My co-workers where great for the most part. I could get along with almost everyone.
good,"I've worked at Walmart for 5 years and I'm still just above minimum pay due to the increase of minimum for new workers who will make the same as I do after a short training period. (or the Walmart equivalent of ""training"" which in most cases is just do it.)"
good,I wouldn't recommend working here unless there is nothing else. No support from upper management when dealing with a hostile customer. Some managers  will take off absence points off their favorite associate so they don't get into trouble.
good,Worked the registers for my shift and helped out in the lot or entrances as needed. As a part time employee there I had no benefits and almost no opportunity to go full time.
good,"the customers are great but management no. Very disrespectful, not understanding, do not contribute to help the team to succeed. have favoritism"
good,Job is good for first time employees.  Pay is low but work is high volume.  Upper management needs work on employee relations.
good,"Walmart is not a very organized company. Walmart do not care about employees. They just care if you come to work. You can be dying or on your last breathe and they do not care as long as you clock in. I know first hand because I was sick and I was having chest pains and I told a member of management and the first thing she said was "" Do you know the about the attendance policy"".. I was so in shock because WALMART says they are family oriented and they care but they do not. The company do not have great benefits. The benefits they do have you have to work there ten years before they even apply to you. Walmart tell you about the ten-foot rule when you work for them and one of those rules are to speak, greet and smile  at your customers but they are mean and hateful and they don't even do all of that to the employees. I am grateful for the job but I hate working for people that do not care about me as a person."
good,"A typical day at work begins and ends with me doing maintenance work. I am responsible for fixing broken machines, ordering new supplies, filling out data sheets and keeping the store tidy. "
good,management fails to communicate properly with one another. Come shift change everyone is lost. Advancing or transferring positions here is only possible if your a close friend or relative to management. Backroom associates are treated poorly and are blamed for all things wrong in the store. The only upside to working at store 02255 is they will hire you back on 3 months after they fire you.
good,As soon as I walked in it was non stop high pace activities all day.  Constant interruptions all day. Always working behind or having to do overtime to complete own task for agents.  Constant in and out of Call Agents.  I had no job security as it was a temporary agencies.
good,"Its Walmart, not review is needed.  You are working for a large box company.  Can and will be treated badly by customers, but the pay starts off good.  May've a chance to advance within."
good,taught me to work fast. how to don alot of things. i worked there for along time. Had my bad days and my good ones only few years be fore i left did it start getting misable to being there
good,"Eu deixaria está parte em branco, é uma empresa que impede o crescimento profissional e uma multinacional que não valoriza o trabalho do empregado."
good,working in the deli at walmart  was to much drama. to much to do not enough people to do it its hard to find management when u need them also hard to get them to work with u on ur schedule
good,I never received the hours I was suppose to receive when I worked here. I only ever received one raise and it was .40. The people I worked with were great but management was terrible. I learned how to operate a register here and PCU codes for food. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. At one point I had to train a new CSM and I was only a cashier. This place unfortunately was terrible. The part I enjoyed was the customer service end.
good,This company expects too much in terms of compensation they provide to its associates.   A lot of unrealistic management expectations.   A lot of work for very little compensation.
good,"A typical day at work was very hectic."
good,"As the Business Manager and Merchandise Manager I was responsible for accounting for and maintaining the daily revenue stream, food service areas, food, meat department and maintain all regulated health and food safety standards. My daily routine consisted of updating and maintaining the daily P&L reports, balancing the stores accounts and motivating and encouraging the sales team"
good,"I attended this job in high school. The manger was very hard to work with, I was given too many hours with very low pay and I felt my check had been tampered with. I was treated unfairly due to my appearance but I still maintained to work hard and get things done no matter the circumstances."
good,the back room is very understaffed and because of that the few that work in the back a overworked they want 4 people to move as fast as 10.
good,the managers at walmart on 40 hwy do not seem to really care about there associates they will over work you and still not be appreciative of you as a walmart employee the customers themselves will state to you how management lacks in customer service.
good,"I honestly applied for and worked here after high school in order to save money before I started college. I don't really like Walmart in the first place, but it is 10x as worse in a place like Trinidad. If you're not from here, people are likely to treat you like you're scum, which most of my coworkers did (except for a hand full) and most of the customers. Everyone who shopped there seemed to act like they were owed all the attention in the world and more. I must say, it did prepare me for any negtive customer or patient experience I might have in the future. That said, it wasn't all that bad when it came down to being just a job. There were frequent breaks and those few great coworkers and managers that made everything worth. I never comlained about the little things because I never let them get to me, but if you are someone who has that tendancy, then maybe steer clear if you can. It's a stressful customer oriented position where you have to be flexiable. Also, schedules were always flexiable incase you needed time off; a nice bonus!"
good,"mala sin preocupacion por sus trabajadores , no dan explicaciones buenas cuando despiden"
good,i love meeting new people that came in.i loved my co workers.the managment team was ok and some of them was horrible.the job was fairly easy.
good,"Store #483 is not the best or worst in the company. It has some great friendly people, but also lots of favoritism or clicks. They also do some things that are against their own policies. They are not big on working around school/ other work schedules, but want mostly part-timers. Depending on who you get depends on the training you get. Most of the time they just throw you right in. Management does not communicate well together & tends to have their favorites when it comes to following policy. They also have a bad habit of asking you to stay late, come in early/late and then have you take the time off during your lunch, preferably. They expect you to come to work sick (regardless of what is said other wise) & excuses from doctor's are not excepted. The hardest part of the job are lots of double standards, doing the job of 3 or more, always short handed, covering up for visiting VIP's,being improperly equipped & the every changing schedules (sometimes without your knowledge or consent). The good part is the new people, benefits, & for new hires the pay."
good,Deli duties; hours flexible and no overtime allowed. 32 hours a week only and low pay with no promotions available. Wasn't any incentives to take on extras and motivation attitudes low.
good,"Typical day is started by running left over freight that the night crew was too lazy to do in the allotted time frame given. You are then expected to clean up their mess, deal with customers, and finish what they did not do, also take care of your other daily jobs. Very time consuming, fast paced and no help in your department. Often you are left alone to do the work of 3 people."
good,It's ok  place to work at they don't pay you that good and only care for the merchandise then the workers.and some of the management was great to work for.Alot of BS goes on there.
good,When I worked there people would have bad attitudes and would not do their job and nothing would happen to them but the people that would actually do their job would always get in some sort of trouble. Management picked their favorites.
good,"Walmart paid better than average, but that is the only good thing that I can say about them. They never replaced workers when they called in, but expected the staff to do more work. Management instead of helping when we were slammed and shortstaffed would yell at us employees in front of customers! They also like to cut hours unexpectedly. My hours went from about 35 hours per week to 6! I was scheduled for only 6 hours a week for three weeks straight! This was despite me being told what a good worker I was. They also like to fire long-term employees for bogus reasons, because they make too much money. And Walmart is all about money, not customer satisfaction!"
good,es un trabajo donde te da la posibilidad de que sea por turno así que se puede realizar y no dejar aparte a la familia
good,"The associates and co workers were great, The upper management does not support there supervisors and they bring personal feelings into how they rate your job performance.."
good,too many chiefs and not enough indians...i despised this job because when my daughter got sick and i couldnt work they didnt understand they insisted i work because they didnt care
good,"Great place to work if you are just entering the world force. Not much room to move up in the company, not very flexible with regards to work schedule."
good,Do not wish to review at this time.  Thank you.  Although rate of pay is now increasing it is not enough for work performed in all areas of store.
good,"Never got any hours, very low pay, would overlook you for promotions, benefits was ok but not worth the low pay, work atmosphere was good, co-workers had no problems with them."
good,this company can do alot better by helping their employees better by being more understanding and giving better pay. they didnt understand so many thing can be done in an 8 hour shift they wanted a work horse for barley no pay. my co workers were amazing and fun to be around.
good,The company experience was odd and being an employ too. Over all i did gain skills such as social and customer service. The typical job day was simple but at moments was more difficult because of horrible customers or unprofessional managers.
good,"Walmart only thing nice is the co worker.  I learn a lot about customer service.  The most enjoyable about there is friends you made with your customer,  Management work you hard and did not care about you."
good,"I often worked with individuals who did not preform their workload, which made the workload heavier on others.  My hours were often cut, and although I was hired before the Christmas hire, I was laid off with the Christmas temporary staff. I received no warning of any lay off."
good,Was able to start with no experience as an optician and become a great sale person  and able to developed my skills in the vision center
good,when I started working for the company it was a really good place to work. then the management changed and the store started not caring about there associates and there needs.
good,"Enjoyed the job, but I found the managers and supervisors really uncoordinated."
good,"Stocking,cleaning,customer service daily duties."
good,"The days at Wal-mart are long, and the pay is not enough. Most of the other workers are only there for a paycheck and dont have a love for the job."
good,"This company is just a starting point in one's life in the job field. My experience there was not great. They put me in an area for a few weeks then they had me doing some petty work in zoning. Now with zoning, you can't do anything and I felt useless. They then fired me claiming I was not ""pulling my weight"", however, you cannot pull your weight when you're zoning because you literally do nothing in zoning."
good,too many chiefs not enough Indians. get wrote up if you don't get your break taken within the 5 hour window. hard to do when you are busy or on a deadline
good,Good days and bad. Standing on the hard floors where bad on my feet.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers.  Majority of the customers were very polite.
good,"work was always fun."
good,"A lot of friendly and hard working employees. Typical day was for me to be in my cubby hole for the money center, some times a CSM would think to check on me, but a handful would even ignore your call for help. Loved my customers and assisting them and a vast majority of my co-workers. I was able to learn how to deal with a fast paced environment and go with the flow of things."
good,Love the job enjoyed the associates however upper management no clue of how to manage other then threats Worked 7 years and was always placed on overnights when asked to go to days never got to go. Too much turnover and yes change is good but consistency with change is needed
good,Its a high stress job. The management is very democratic and only wants results. They don't seem to care about their employees. Employees that have complaints agents them clime the corporate ladder quickly and with ease.
good,Worker there were not team players They Didn't want to work they were very lazy the workers would talk about the costumers and employs i enjoy working there with my coworkers who did there job and didn't leave me to do everything
good,"Managment rarely works with you, a lot of pressure is placed on individual workers to get multiple jobs done with limited supplies and time. Time management is key in work environment and being able to get tasks done on your own an in a timely fashion."
good,"Start at the top and remove all managers and Assistant Managers that bully and down grade the workers under their supervision."
good,The customer is always right and the customer comes first is always considered. No matter what you are told to do by Management. As far as company policy goes or whatever the situation.
good,"Poor management, dirty environment, not very flexible, does not care about family obligations, is not family oriented at all, does not care about employees, crazy schedules"
good,The management team poorly executed and seldom follows through in meeting the needs of their employees. Their work ethics are poor and their harassment policies are far from acceptable.
good,"Working at Walmart is like modern day slavery, the managers are rude and some have no people skills.  The pay is not enough for the amount of work you do. That's why many of their employees have to still receive help from the local government. If the managers would give more hours and better pay their employees could live better and not work a 2nd job."
good,Get to work and get to the back of the store.Get in my locker and put my stuff inside.Search all around the store for your manager to tell you what to do for the next hour/hours.Stock shelves until five while helping customers and being scolded for leaving area.Get job done before 5 p.m then have daily zoning.Get sent to a part of the store to  straighten every bit of merchandise while helping customers and being scolded for not getting zoning done.Do this until ten.
good,I've never done any remodel work. But ended being pretty easy. We set mods which meant to change out the old shelves with new ones and put up merchandise according to Walmarts planogram. Also moved gondola's with the assistance of a scorpion skate. Zoned aisles when needed. Helped stock a variety of freight. And did general cleaning around he whole store.
good,Arrived at work had a meeting and everyone went to their designated work zones. Worked until all merchandise was shelved  then took all overstock to backrooms. Hardest part of the job was staying awake because it was an overnight shift.
good,"A bit chaotic/ no really known management/ management comes out of nowhere"
good,"Wal-Mart had a open door policy which meant if you had personal issues with a Department Manager you could tell another Manager about the issues, which I did . However the Manager I talked to was the Manager I had a problem with best friends.And fired me with some fake story that I threatened someones live."
good,A terrible place to work if looking for proper training for advancement. There is no room for the training of newly appointed managers/supervisors. People are placed in positions of authority without training or experience
good,"On your feet running a register every day for little pay."
good,"I assisted customers with electronics needs and proposed certain items and explained functions of certain electronic goods, cashier, stock and inventory, assisted other associates, and maintained a safe and clean work environment."
good,I am not one to want to work at a store like Wal-Mart. I was going to college and need extra money to help pay bills and started working at walmart. I like the hours when I first started but then they up moved my hours to more than I could work. Then they started scheduling me for hours while I was in school. They seemed really flexiable when I first started. The co-workers I worked with were great.
good,Love working with my co-workers. Laid back but get what needs to be done and more. We bake bread and donuts. Write on cakes. Decorate cakes/ Slice meat and cheese. Cook food through out the day
good,"Management slacking, cashiers must wait too long for assistance. Not enough CSM's to help cashiers. Unorganized. Very busy at times and not enough cashiers, there for no breaks are given. Some co-workers are a pleasure. The hardest part about this job is waiting for assistance due to the lack of CSM's on the front end. The bags should be changed, they are terrable. They rip easily and most of the time I have to double, even triple bag items. Most enjoyable part is meeting customers helping them with their orders talking about everything. Learning about what people like and don't like, learning how they like thier items bagged."
good,Will not work with your schedule for school. Threaten people who get injured to not fill out incident reports if not caught on camera. They do not care about their employees unless there is possible legal action that can be taken against them.
good,"My day was never the same.  I had different hours all the time,  I supervised the front end check out, accounting dept,  customer service, custodial and cart staff.   Included helping with scheduling, daily deposits for the store, break and lunch schedules for about 25 people at a time.  Worked with risk management with thefts.  Store was an hour commute from my home."
good,Overall the work experience was good. The only part I really disliked was how management favored some associates over others. Wal-Mart's policies and disciplinary actions were not equal amongst their employees.
good,I love meeting and greeting new faces and Walmart gave me the opportunity to do so. The schedules aren't that great and the employee discount totally not worth the stress.
good,I was ok with this walmart just I got laid off before I could really figure out if I was wanting to stay or not it was a nice environment there were some great people just I did not attend this job long enough
good,"Very fast paced place to work. A lot of responsibility with the job. Ask to perform a lot of duties that do not pertain to your job title. Learned about defective merchandise, inventory control and how to ship hazardous materials by Federal DOT guidelines.Had the opportunity to learn the receiving side of the job as well. Some people are easy to work with, some are not. Management does not back the associates on decisions that are made and do not look at all things involved in making decisions which I guess is part of running a large company. Hard to complete all the job responsibilities and perform the extra ones you are ask to do without extra help. Most enjoyable thing about the job was working one on one with the associates and customer and developing and ability to adapt to any situation. And being able to prove to myself that I could complete anything I was asked to do."
good,"If you have kids and have a limited avalabilty, then there is no chance for advancement with this company. My management team does not and will not stand behind their associates, this is not a team, this store is every individual for themselves."
good,I am a highly trained customer sales floor associate and i have over 10 years experince but i am not valued or respected at walmart but do to needs of finanacial support i remain in the company untill i find a better job
good,Very high volume store with high sales and high customer traffic. I love working with my customers and co-workers and enjoy meeting new people every day. The hardest part of my job is not getting assistance from customer service management when needed.  I've learned it takes a ample amount of patients to work at Walmart.
good,"assisted customers with finding items"
good,Management could be better and the work that they say an associate is supposed to do is different than their job description which is often annoying.
good,"Not only was I a Cashier but they also volunteered me to be a Stocker, Maintenance, and Sales Associate."
good,"long overnights that needed more training. learned supervisor jobs. the management was to say lacking, co workers where nice. hardest part of the job was zoning the food. learning new things."
good,Just don't like the way customers nor employers are treated. They don't give employers the recognition they deserve and policies are constantly being changed and its more favoritism
good,I needed a job while I was going to school and I was hired by Wal-Mart.  I really did not learn much on the job.  The management was decent.  My co-workers made it more easier to work there.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with unruly customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customers that appreciated our services/
good,A typical day at work is trying to keep the customer happy. I've learned many thing about my customers personal life. The management really sucks they really don't care about there staff. My co-workers are fun to work with they make you laugh and make sure you work hard and if you need help they'll make sure to help you out. My job really isn't that hard. The co-workers and the customers are the enjoyable parts of the job.
good,"typical day at work would include stocking front end, checking people out, sweeping, dusting. I've learned a lot, however I had to teach myself. Management is a joke. co-worker some are very good and work hard but the others they just stand around"
good,A typical day at work started the minute your feet hit the floor.  This job was very fast paced and customer-associate oriented.  I have gained a lot of character and leadership skills while being employed with Walmart.  Management was an exciting advancement and I learned many things about myself and about the business world.  The hardest part of my job was making work and home balance. I spent lots of additional hours getting the job done and volunteering for  things in the community.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the friends I made and all the wonderful customers I got to meet and make a difference in their life.
good,"Although Walmart has an ""open door"" policy, if they don't like what you have to say they will belittle you and harass you."
good,"Supervisor rude and unprofessional. Coworkers, people you wouldn't want to work with. I learned how to be a great assembly worker and how to properly use PPE. Hardest part of the job was cutting yourself and or burning yourself."
good,Very result driven environment. Work expectation does not equate with wage offered in many positions. Some positions provide health insurance.
good,A busy environment. I enjoyed working here I learned how the backroom and stocking operation go. My co-workers were great people some of them just complained to much.
good,It's like any other Wal Mart the Management isn't that good they have you work ridiculous house a week and it is kind of hard to maintain school when working their
good,Went in at ten pm.  Left at 7 am.  It was a hard thing to get my body to function with these hours.  Management was very friendly and helpful.  Stayed busy and made the hours go by quick.
good,"Not very flexible. Management not understanding, nor did they seem to care about the wellbeing of their employees. Overall, just not a good place to work."
good,"The customers were great,but management was spotty. lack of communication skills with other managers. Hardest part of the job is being wanted in 3 different areas at one time."
good,"I only worked here until I moved to Charlotte, NC. I worked 3rd shift in the back room. It was very hot and no air flow at all. I would leave work sometimes drenched in sweat. The co workers did not get along with each other."
good,"Dealt with customers on a daily basis. "
good,"If it were not for the store manager everything would be good, but he didn't seem to want to be helpful and he did not seem to care for the customers or the employees.  He seemed to care more about himself and the money he was making."
good,"Walmart was a great way to dive into the work force. Every day is very high paced with a lot of different duties and projects to accomplish. Employees gain great knowledge in multitasking and organization. The employees also are always energetic, kind, and friendly to both customers and co-workers. They always complete their work in a timely manner and with enthusiasm. The most difficult task asked of employees is memorizing what and where all the Walmart products are located. The most enjoyable task is being able to interact and assist customers with questions and concerns they have."
good,"typical day 4:00pm - 1:00am with 9:00 - 10:00 lunch."
good,"A typical night at work would start with me stocking cosmetics and assisting customers to find the right product for them. At midnight, my register was ready for me to checkout customers. I had to manage my time in order to get all of my work completed. I made a system that worked for me."
good,"Hard working and very small pay. I really did not enjoy my time at Walmart. I worked in different departments and was trained in these department with no compensation or promotions, but lots of complaints by a manger they finally fired. Seeing the advertisement aired on television maybe Walmart finally figured it out invest in your workers employee with better  salaries, education and benefits. I am not putting the company down, because my Mother loves Walmart."
good,This is a great job to learn the ins and out of customer service. Its a fast paced environment with a lot of different requirements. Expectations are high because servicing customers is the #1 priority.
good,"The overall experience was poor. The typical work was fine, but the schedule and supervising was not like anything I expected."
good,"a typical day  would include get assigned to an area  of the store to stock the merchandise, management was ok to work with   loved my co-workers"
good,didn't like walmart at all no job security and the work environment is like high school all over again and I would tell people to only work this job just to get on your feet
good,Arrived early every day. Inspected work for the day.  Clock in on time. Started at load/unload bay. Delivered merchandise to proper area to be stocked. Unloaded palette. Sorted merchandise. Helped customers when needed. This was one of the best parts of my job. I like helping people. Transporting 400 lb palettes was the most taxing part.
good,"I would go to my assigned area and fulfill my work duties."
good,"The job sucked, management where jurks, and really did not lije this company. I was sick and was in the hospitol doe a weeks and lost the job."
good,I enjoyed my job it was a great company to work the management was great I wished that they offer healthy benefits to all employ we got food when the company had little parties
good,Wal Mart gave me good experience in various different departments and in a supervisory position. I got to run change to the cashiers and deal with the customers compliments and complaints about product or cashiers.
good,i went in culled produce restocked it made sure everything was clean managers were good not enough communication given correctly hardest part of job was trying to follow what all the different manageers were telling me the most enjoyable was throwing the truck when it came in.
good,"I really enjoy my job, the days went by very fast my position would always keep be busy."
good,Walmart is an okay place to work a lot of favouritism politics though. no senority so it doesn't matter how long you've been there a new associate can get the full time position before you.
good,"The organizational culture at Wal-Mart is non existent; they have a problem with involving top management with middle management decisions. I'm more than sure that there is some conflict between both management parties seeing as how middle management is constantly creating and implementing new rules without the consent of top management causing confusion and role ambiguity with the workers. Co-workers will be co-workers, I learned to ignore them; I don't go to work to socialize I go to get my work done. The hardest part of the job was working with management due to their high level of unorganization and low level of professionalism."
good,"es una gran empresa la cual me sirvio para generar mis conocimeintos en ventas y poder crecer en lo laboral, la empresa te limita ya que no puedes seguir creciendo laboralmente, no tienes tiempo de poder estudiar , y trabaja en horarios de supermercado lo cual no tienes tiempo para compartir con tu familia y eso desgasta mucho el ambiente familiar."
good,"Co-workers were great. Management on the other hand didn't listen to the worker's ideas and complains, even when the co-workers were losing their stuff in the store they didn't do anything about it. They didn't care about customers either couldn't help the customer because they didn't know anything where things were in the store."
good,"This was my first job out of high school and at the time it was all i needed, not much room for advancement or growth. Great job for those starting out in the job force."
good,"a typical day at Walmart is all about a lot of customers long lines busy environment and a lot of work. ived learned a lot of things such as how to be a good customer service representative, and other things such as sending and receiving money and making money orders through money gram, exchanges and returns and cite to store pick up calls to customers. coworkers are very encouraging to work with and fun we all help each other improve everyday. The hardest part of my job is learning to deal with rude customers and how to handle out of control situations. the most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling you get when you see customers walk out satisfied with their shopping experience."
good,"The job is good for starting out for people to build experience for a better career. The job hours are bit of a mess they don't mange the hours well and they don't hire enough people to work the shift and work is never done time if they get done. It pays very little for the work they put you through but i manage through it. The employs are nice and helpful. "
good,Walmart is an ok job. I would really like something better. I am looking for the things Walmart doesn't offer like management opportunities etc.
good,"We would sort packages and organize what department it goes too"
good,"I worked as a department manager in many departments, Jewelry, shoes, women's clothes. I learned a great deal and enjoyed working for this company."
good,not  enough  benefits  job security  they always play with your  emotions  the job culture  is terrible the work  hours suck  they treat you like slaves  and over all its just terrible
good,"Wal-Mart was a very productive place to work. You're constantly on your feet, keeping busy. Although, it was hard work, I really enjoyed helping all of our customers and the other employees that I worked with."
good,Dealt mostly with customers and back room. The job was very simple and offered little in the way of advancement. Even if steps were taken to move up in the company the hours off the clock and constantly losing people would make the pay not worth it.
good,"Management was very unprofessional, they did not know how to speak to customers or employees, which made working there very difficult."
good,"the assistant managers who have been at this store longer then 2 years are just terrible! they are rude and impolite, and are only out to catch their own butts instead of helping the associates like they are supposed to."
good,A empresa não oferece beneficios yodo o trabalho pesado fica pros novatos
good,"I would come in and greet my coworkers and talk about sports, music and the workplace. After the short conversation, I'd begin to load my cart with merchandise and being my shift. As the day began, my coworkers would start to wake up, fully. The managers would come around, and ask certain people to do certain assignments. Throughout the day, customers would come in and have mall talk with me, some of which were regulars and they knew me by name, and not just because of my name tag.  My day at work was usually enjoyable, and fun. However, making bales was awful, because its a thousand pound bale of cardboard.  It was heavy, and terribly difficult to move around the backrooms of WalMart."
good,"Typical day at work was very stressful.  You have to punch in exactly in and out on time otherwise you can lose your job.  Employees are penalized for the smallest of necessities.  If you leave early due to medical emergencies it's counted against you and the end result, again, loss of your job.  Management was very hard nosed to say the least. When I moved on upper management knew there were serious problems in the workplace and not one of them approached me to find out what the problem was or for me to find some sort of resolution so I would stay. Very big turn over in the workplace."
good,I was a cashier at this company. I primarily worked with customers which I really enjoyed. Aside from my co-workers it was the best part of my job. Management was really cold. I feel like they didnt care of appreciate me as an associate. I enjoy learning and was shot down when I inquired about learning more.
good,its wal mart don't expect much out of working retail jobs you might can work up to a better position if you kiss but but again its walmart
good,"A typical day at work... at fitting rooms, you let customers in and out of fitting rooms, assist customers and maintain cleanliness of fitting rooms. I learned about good customer service , the importance of cooperative, friendly coworkers. Co-workers are exceptional, though there are few that are harder to get along with, but others make the time fly as well as make the workplace a fun, easy environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with uncooperative customers and possibly disappointing others when assistance cannot be offered. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers and helping them to find their desired merchandise."
good,Not the best place i have worked at. But it was a good job for someone new to working full time. Learned about deli services and helped in bakery.
good,the job is ok for someone just trying to make pocket money. The management and supervisors are the worst part. People aren't treated equally and disrespected in my opinion.
good,"long hours, no supervision or cross training low pay, no chance for advancement. Co-workers were lazy and pushed their jobs on you, most stood around talking about customers. I did not enjoy working there."
good,"i would cover over 7 departments alone every day would also cashier as well "
good,Overworked sometimes without lunch or breaks. A lot of favoritism in the stores. Managers seemed not to care about associates.
good,"Bad place to work. hours are bad, managers for the most part are bad, bad place to work. people I know got fired because their family died and they took off like three days to be with family. that's messed up mane"
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of standing on my feet for hours on end, weather I was at a register or as a sales associate. I learned that you having a good day, depends solely on YOU. do NOT  bring your personal problems to work. It will only make the day ahead of you unbearable. (However I think this applies at any job, just more so at Walmart.) As soon as you cross the thresh hold of the door your problems need to disappear. The world no longer revolves around you, but on the customers you are there to serve. The co-workers are incredibly fun and up-eat and easy to get along with. They are very welcoming when first starting out. I never ha any problems with my co-workers. I think the hardest part of the job was being on my feet for so long at such a constant rate. Make sure you get VERY comfy shoes! Or your back and feet will not last. (And this is coming from a young person.) The best part of job was being able to cheer a flustered customer up. Weather it was making them laugh or just crack a smile. I love making people happy so that was very enjoyable or me."
good,Walmart acts like they own you and you should be proud that you work there.
good,"Fun place to work, very busy so the day was gone before you knew it, the co- workers were great,management was hard to  deal with at times, due to the stress they have to deal with,the down side of the job was working every weekend and all the holidays.Iearned a lot about cars while there, at least I can change my oil and a flat tire if needed."
good,i did not like the fact everyone was so uptight and rude. Lots of employees were lazy and got away with it. They are very unorganized as well.
good,"a knight at work Boss getting on to you for things you did't even do, finishing a project and was asked where have you when they assigned me to do that project. Lack of honesty,and others not working."
good,"could be a very nice job if the people who ran it would use there brains its there for a reson, people still smoke real cigeretts get over it, plus all the benifit that they had that was desent they have taken away the only that that keep's me coming to work is my family and coworker's"
good,It was ok but they did not want to give hours and I could not live on that pay. I need full-time work. I need a more reliable job and walmart could not give me what I needed so I had to leave. I could not afford on my pay to live on and pay expenses
good,if you are a teen it's good place the work. for me the pay was not there for me . management was not good at all. the health plan cost a lot . co work are cool.
good,"A typical day would be getting there and working as fast as you can to stock shelves and get rid of skids. they don't care about anything other then a skid being completed. that being said it is nice to be independent but this also breeds a lot of people who take advantage and will stand in a corner and text. those who do work at walmart are not appreciated and harassed to do more. those who do nothing get left alone and ride out there time with the company."
good,"This company used to be a great workplace, But in the last few years it has become less work friendly, there is a lot of favoritism in management. It was a family friendly place that had value's."
good,"I didn't go to work to build a career at Walmart, so lack of promotion opportunities didn't concern me. All in all I hold no ill feelings toward walmart."
good,loved what I did. Not all manages were bad just mines was a cry baby. Loved the hour lunch. Very low pay I got paid 8.70 and Publix employees get 14.50 for the same thing I did.
good,Walmart was a good place to work while going to school. The joy of meeting so many customers and finding friendships in many helps you each day.
good,"I was able to work with a lot of different people, do a diversify of work I learned to cut keys, do Customer Service, mix paint as well as translate for Spanish customers. I worked in Deli and learned how to make different platters also learned about jewelry."
good,"Would go in stock milk, then stock the picks for the day. I learned that a lot of people eat a lot of cheese , yogurt, and drink tons of milk. Management was great at first but after i worked there for a month or two they started ignoring my request of days off, or times i could come in. My co-workers were pretty easy going and fun. the hardest part of my job was getting over my hands hurting after work from stocking milk, and opening boxes all day long. The best part of my day was, some of my co-workers, and going home."
good,Not the best place to work. Typical day consists of everything from doing your job with your team to getting pulled dealing with managements leftovers.
good,You can easily get fired they take a long time to advance you and the pay is not great at all.
good,I enjoyed being a part of the walmart family and my fellow co-workers
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. Wal-Mart is a retail store that pretty much sells everything. There is never a day where it is not busy always at a fast pace. I've learned to basically work on my own without any backup because we are always short staffed. The management team does not back up their employees. I would appreciate it more if they would just listen to us workers. The hardest part of my job is when rush hour hits, there is no back up. I'm so used to working by myself."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for when you just absolutely need money, but with advancement in the store, its terrible. Like most places, its all about favoritism so you're stuck in a position you hate and only agreed to because you needed money at the time. I would never recommend working here."
good,"Rude boss, no pay, too many boss's arguing with each other, some boss would tell em to things one way and the other boss would tell me another way"
good,"My review of Walmart would be not so good. This is only because the management in the store is so bad, no one communicates and they act like they dont want to be bothered by their associates.The hours are cut whenever it is convient and you are not garanteed a steady schedule. It is also very hard to talk about situations you have with managers to their managers without retaliation. Other than the negative Walmart is a great business just certain rotten eggs in the business make it a not so nice place to work."
good,"Working at Walmart was not the best experience I had, although the managers i had were excellent the company in general was horrible to work for.  During the holidays hours were great i was getting close to 40 a week but during the slow times of the year hours were cut dramatically some people would go 2-3 weeks without being on the schedule luckily for me this never happened.  My direct supervisors would try to give people more hours but couldn't because of HR.  They didn't care about the employees at all which was really upsetting with WalMart being the biggest cooperation in the world.  I also was told that I would go far in the company and had what it took after multiple interviews for management i realized it was useless to keep trying and started  seeking other employment opportunities."
good,a typical day at work consisted of me doing thosands of carts buy myself and expected to get the entire lot clear by the end of the night while i have a continuous flow of carts and customers coming in and out of the store. i learned a lot of patience with this job. being able to deal with customers was something new to me until i got this job since i was the first to greet the customers and the last to say have a nice day as they walked out of the store. Management to be really honest would and should have been better. it seemed like when you had questions or wanted to be trained on something else you either got ignored or just told they will deal with it at a later date and then it never happen. in my honest opinion management could care less about their employees at least in the walmart store i worked at store number 775
good,"when I started at Walmart in 2000 it was a great place to work it was fun and I enjoyed going to work every day . in the last few years the company took away all the reasons people would want to stay there, they used to give an extra dollar for working on sundays, and were family oriented my store has an 85 percent turnover rate they have lost long term employes leaving do to cut hours. the hardest  part of the job is trying to live up to unrealistic expections."
good,"Benefits are not that bad, co workers can be difficult to work with. If you do not have the pharmacy manager on your side, scheduling can be very difficult. I work a full time job on top of working at Walmart. It has been very difficult to get schedules to coordinate,"
good,"I learned that customers appreciate very much when you do something out of the way to help them."
good,"This job was just that, a job. There is no potential growth within the company unless you are willing to not complain, be a favourite of management and break rules that could land you in jail. This was just a job that helped paid my bills and once they cut everyone down to part time, the pay couldn't even do that. Working for Wal Mart is like being in high school all over again, just everyone is much older. I think Wal Mart would make a killing in the reality T.V. department with how much drama they allow to happen within upper management and lower associates."
good,This is a job for those that are in school and need a variety of work hours to schedule around school hours.
good,"Worked at Walmart for over 4 years. It is, on most days, very stressful. I was a Customer Service Manager for 3 years and most of time the workload was unreasonable. They expect 1 person to do the Job of 4 on minimum wage. No matter how hard you work and if you get everything done you were ask for, you hardly ever hear any praise from Management. "
good,"Attending to customers, I learned how to present myself and the company professionally. Management and the staff worked as a team. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, but I would make the best out of it. Most enjoyable part was connecting with the customers with simple conversations."
good,"There is no job security; may be required to the work in two different positions while receiving the wage of the lesser position; holiday pay is received but your work hours following that pay may be cut to make up for having received that holiday pay; they amount of respect given to associates, by Walmart, is based on the associate`s level within the company"
good,It was simple job to manage. The only thing about this job is that the management was not well organized and the communication with them is not so great.
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart is just like any other day. I feel like they could care more about their employees. I have learned to never depend on someone else word. I have no comment about Management. My co-workers are always complaining and doesn't work together as they should. The hardest part of my job is going to a job where I really doesn't feel comfortable. The most enjoyable part is actually getting a customers who appreciates everything that I do.
good,"The work load is set up or you to do your job without the customer interaction, being Walmart you have to work with customers all the time. This make a very heavy work load.  About the only thing to learn at Walmart is how to your head down and get your hours in."
good,what can i say wal mart has lost sight of its customers and employees.
good,"Avaya Software knowledge & Adept in automated attendant systems  "
good,My experience working at Walmart was not a good one. I always showed up to work and I did my job. Walmart let me go and they could not give me a good excuse as to the reason for letting me go.
good,"I didn't really care for working here, although I was in school. It kept money in my pocket but not enough to pay all bills if you are part time. If you have no designated area prepare to have yourself called for every job possible in the store. Management can be rude and they really don't have many incentives for employees. Moving up is all about favoritism."
good,"not a bad job for right after high school, people are nice and you meet new people everyday and its great face to face interaction"
good,"coworkers  were willing to help you as much as possible, but if u didnt get along with management forget it.the company say one thing and management say another .the management is not very  quick on associates moving up to different positions that become available."
good,"fulfill customer requests"
good,"a day at Walmart is like going to zoo these days, I feel there are to many people trying to your boss at one time, and a store manger who really doesn't care about his employees at all unless he has something to benefit from it I feel. I learned by working at Walmart that everyone is out for themselves and if they see an oppertunity to throw you under the bus to save themselves they will do it. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep what I was doing correct ans to Walmart's standards but yet it still wasn't good enough when it came down to it. i really liked working for Walmart because the hours was great that I had because I could make all my sons football games and able to take him to school because I don't trust him ridding the bus so I could spend that extra 5 mintutes with him."
good,I was hired as a cashier but I ended up doing other jobs more than I did cashier.
good,a typical work day involved janitorial duties for 8 hours. i learned the meaning of hard work. the managment was very unorganized. co-workers were friendly but possesed no ambition. the hardest part of the job was walking for 8 hours a day till late night. the most enjoyable was interacting with customers.
good,"Learned lots from managers and co-workers, great people to work with."
good,It would be a flactuating day where the business would be busy and drop and i would enjoy interacting with different customers.My co workers and management provide a great environment.My best experience  has been being able to deal with all sorts of people and making an impact through offering excellent services and changing the impression they had of the organisation.For me thats been my greatest joy and achievement.Seeing customers walk out with satisfaction
good,"typical day varies if you are part-time"
good,Wal-mart was the worst job i have ever worked for they treat there employess horrible
good,I would never work there. I wouldn't even tell my friends to work for Walmart.
good,"A typical day consisted of scanning items and talking to customers. I learned that hard work will provide me with a good job. "
good,On call duty staffing agency open to any warehouse positions. Fast environment process.
good,didn't enjoy it very much people were rude not very helpful at all
good,"Typical work day is busy!  Being alert at all time . Greeting Customers , Helping Them to Locate what they are looking for. What I learned from working hear is that working hard will pay off! Management shared what they learn an pass it on to associates! Co-workers are Team players, with out a team things take longer to get done! Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the new technology "
good,"I really did not find working here beneficial. They walk all over you, simply because you work in 4 or 5 different departments, they think you are useless. I learned that even if they call you in to work, they will still treat you as low as possible. Co-workers were fine, nice, but management was really bad in some places, if not all of them. Very few listen and just don't care. My hardest part of working here was being stepped on all the time. My most enjoyable part was being able to make customers happy even though I felt like nothing to the company."
good,Dealing with the customers .And dealing with management. the most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day.
good,Walmart is a hard place to work.  I did not like this job. There was not enough workers to cover all that had to be stocked.
good,Wal-mart is not a really good place to work. They work you to death with little pay. Some managers are ok but some give you attitude for no reason.
good,walmart goes on and on about how to do things right when they themselves dont do it right
good,Long hours with no help out in the heat. machine is not well taken care of and breaks down constantly. uncomfortable working environment.
good,"Pay is slightly higher than minimum wage, for hard work. Managers are only concerned with political side of company, not the employees."
good,"management does not care about the employees.what I have learned you have to be in a click to get promoted to. I have entered my 8th yr. and I still have not been promoted. coworkers are good people. supports managers don't act like managers they act more like ""gods"". everynight is different some nights easy some nights hard"
good,Fun job you get to know the people and how to do different things. Not a job security place.
good,"I wanted full time and they could not offer that so, I was not getting enough hours."
good,working for money is about the only thing ive gotten out of this place.
good,This was the worst job i ever had. Not sure if it is just WalMart in general or just my particular store.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working in the public. I have learned that sales and marketing is a field that I enjoy.
good,i would restock the shelves. i learned that its not as easy as it looks. the management was a little unorganized. my co-workers were friendly. the hardest part of the job was finding where stuff go. i liked the job because of the hours.
good,worst work experience of my life and i often warn people away from it
good,"They could not work around my school schedule (would schedule me to work days that I couldn't work because of school)."
good,"The store i worked at was sloppy, when I began there I had customers telling me certain items had been expired for weeks, the employees rarely rotate the milk or check expiration dates. There is drama between all of the managers there, they are not welcoming at all."
good,"A day at work started with auditing the gun case, doing the counts that were left, price changes, & customer service. It continued with a few gun sales a day, which was a skill you have to do perfectly, or you cannot complete the sale. I learned so much from the store, I learned how to be responsible as well to be a hard worker. I continue to be polite in my everyday life, even when I'm not at work. My co-workers were nice, but I kept my distance just because I feel that is best when you're at work. The hardest part of my job was that I had to keep up to date with my schedules, my managers didn't do regular schedules. It was made 3 weeks ahead of time, & since they switched out managers so often, I never had a schedule, & to pay bills, less than 15 hours a week doesn't help. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact I could make someone's day just by being polite, I love working with people. They make the work field easier, & sometimes harder, but I try my best to make them happy so there is nothing to worry about."
good,"Working at Walmart has been an interesting experience, it's gotten me through high school and now college but now it's time for me to move on to bigger and better things!"
good,"Cashier:"
good,Overall it is very hard work. Some managers better than others.
good,"serve customers"
good,Management isn't the best but its a good place to work if your looking for a kick back job.
good,"a typical day in the Walmart backroom would be clocking in and getting to the gm truck. if it had arrived on time, the lock was popped and the rollers were brought in. we would start to unload the truck with the time limit of 2 hours for a 2500 piece truck. our shift lead was Awesome, but with upper management and corp time crunches and to many responsibilities for just one lead to handle, he left soon after i was hired. that would have been the hardest part of the job, you didnt know if you were going to have a lead or if an assistant manager was going to watch over ya. the most enjoyable part was the physical aspects, I.E. lifting and carrying."
good,"sale items to customers, Clean, Stock, Order Product. I learn how to deal with customers."
good,"A typical day includes a majority of customer service, one-on-one interaction with the customer. "
good,"Na rede Wallmart creio que em geral por onde vejo o problema é o mesmo 'falta de organização' onde implica na qualidade de trabalho com os funcionários,o salário compatível com o mercado de trabalho,porém tem bons benefícios"
good,I learned more about the RF Scanner and controlling the inventory counts.
good,"I have worked for wal mart for many years. SInce Sam Walton has passed away the company has gone downhill. My co-workers were amazing and it was nice to have people in the department who were all on the same page as far as goals for our department and how to help the shift go smoothly. Management only cares about their yearly bonus and how they look to the store manager and corporate. There is no respect for the individual from management. Management does not care if you are unhappy with a schedule or equipment not working properly, they do not care if you work your tail end off so that they do not get any sort of rep remand from the store manager. Most managers do not care about customers and act as if they are the most important person in the store. I loved the people I worked with but after working with the current management team I had to leave."
good,"worked overnight , stocking in the frozen food and dairy . very cold . co workers were just that , co workers . management were just bosses ,"
good,Does not give you a heads up when the y no longer need you wehn hired for temporary.
good,"A typical day would be coming in stocking, cleaning up after the managers, or what ever the last employee didnt clean, I learned a lot of patience and customer service there. Co workers were lazy. there was no hard part of the job to be honest, most enjoyable part of the job would be that it was 3 miles from my house."
good,"they were quick to point fingers, they believe that their workers dont  have lives outside of work, they take sides of favorites"
good,"Demanding bosses, to many quotas to meet. No structure behind management."
good,"My typical day at work started with trying to find the proper equipment such as a printer to connect to my handheld which was absolutley essential to my position. Firstly and most important I would check my back room for all safety hazards and my hazmat area for anymistakes my company might receive fines for from complaince. On a day where I would be both DSD receiving and claims I would receive vendors such as Pepsi and Frito Lay using the invoice process, customer's online orders, and store supplies. Acting as DSD I also am part of the operations management team and must keep a flow to the back room so that vendors may be accepted and my fellow associates could effectively do their jobs. The claims part of my job description started the day with processing all damaged,expired food,and processing all donations for our local food bank. Next, I would process all stolen merchandise and recalled product. Then, I would move on to all of my hazmat bins and clear those before moving on to the rest of the store department's bins of claims to be shipped to our return center in Red Bluff. At the end of my day I would ""stage"" the back room to be ready for the four O' Clock freight."
good,"I worked in two states for wal mart, Indiana was great they treated you good and tried to work with you.  changing oil and tires daily was fun, when I came to Missouri the store here turned on anyone they thought was a threat to a manager as they did me. i also lost $1.00 an hour for moving to Missouri"
good,Awesome co-workers good overal work environment. High standards on maintaining a clean work environment. A typical work day consists of sorting buggies and processing hundreds of returns along with answering the phone. I have learned that kindness and patience is the key to success. The hardest part of this job is when policy prevents me from completely satisfying a customer's needs. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,"No longer a family oriented company, department you work in has a lot to do with that.  No work/life balance all work."
good,The job was fun and informational. The pay could be better but you really can't expect much more of an increase when you are not required to ave an education to work there. A great job for a college student.
good,"worked seasonal in garden section "
good,Walmart is a great company to work for if you don't mind a lot of managers. It's not much opportunity to grow because of the management.
good,primarily dealt with customers and irate consumers over broken merchandise. Learned to deal with volatile personalities with ease. Worked with wonderful hard working people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with hectic hours that were from 5am to 12 midnight and working every holiday but Christmas. The most enjoyable part of the job was building a excellent reputation with customers and being relied upon.
good,"From day one to the last day working for Walmart it's always been something different everyday. I've worked in almost every department, from customer service/ cash, seasonal, sports, electronics, cosmetics, fashion, housewares, hardware, and all of the food side. They would always have me use my skills and abilities wherever they needed the most help."
good,Walmart may have started off with a vision but it has since been pushed out the door. The people who are supervisor give the general employees no since of direction as to how a shift should be worked. It's not all Walmart's just the one I've worked for.
good,The workers are very nice. There break times needs improvement. Training could be better.
good,"the co-workers around me were great, and i loved being able to work outside, only problem it got extremely hot or extremely. When management was approached with the details, they often didn't respond or handed the problem out to another manager which did not help us associates. the pay in my opinion could have been better, i worked there two and a half years and was being paid what most people start with.schedules were a nightmare and when i asked for Sunday off for church i was told too many people lie about attending church and too many already have it off, i didn't think they were allowed to do that but i guess so,  overall i worked really hard to figure no one above my position really cared."
good,management is extremely unorganized. most coworkers are lazy or slow.
good,"All depends really on your management (just like any job). They pay is extremely low, but you get experience. The pay ""raises"" are complete trash of .0, .20, .40 and only a few people get the ever elusive .50+ raise. Easy to move up the management ladder, as long as you either, throw other people under the bus for minor hiccups, kiss enough butt, or upset your Assistant and Shift/Co managers enough by holding them accountable, and calling your Market Human Resource Manager (MHRM) they'll either fire you or promote you. Watch out too cause if you don't call your MHRM shortly after an incident you're screwed!"
good,I was a cashier here and didn't mind the work. Somedays it was a lot of fun and other days it wasn't. The benefits wasn't worth it because you had to be there for almost a year before you could get any of them and 2 years to get vacation. Not my idea place to work.
good,I enjoyed the first few months of working at Wal-mart. I gained a lot of friends. I hated how they would schedule you. Some times i would work 7 days straight other times i would work 2 days a week. They dont really work with you if your sick or have health problems. The reason i left was because i was sick and it was not  a cold. Ive had so many doctors appointments and would have to change them because they wouldn't give me that day off. Working there was stressful. !!
good,you will work and never be praised. the shifts dont like one another. toxic environment
good,Management was very unorganized and was hard to move up in the company.
good,Management was always bouncing for place to place. People were not very happy to work there. I enjoyed my coworkers however
good,i liked working there the ppl were nice work was easy management was not good got no wornings the hardest part was leaving the ppl i grew close to some of the co workers lied stole and put the blaim on me
good,I liked working with the people and meeting others. I did not like the fact that walmart treated employees like numbers sometimes and not people I did like that I got to work my desired hours and didn't have to work overtime and was never called in on my days off
good,"they have a set time pace, that you have to take the time off your job to go clock in and out of the job your doing. they have a picking and binning system that is supposed to restock items that are low, yet it would have you picking items that were overstocked or plugged. everything that is brought out that cant go up get brought to the back and binned by the end of the nite, when sometimes one person could get six or seven pallets with no help."
good,Its not a bad company to work for the only problem is the management teams. The location I worked at the management teams have their favorite workers so they show more empathy towards them than other employees dealing with hours and scheduling. The manager always saying she changed some rule but never notify employees of so called changes.
good,Customers and coworkers were great the work was easy just cleaning and stocking and taking care of the customers. coworkers made the time there fun.
good,"I did a little bit of everything. I had to play Department Manager at times,which consists of price changes, redoing shelves. Worked as a stocker"
good,"Oversee procurement process including vendor contacts and approval of"
good,i usually had an ok time at work but when you are not having a good day management puts a lot more on you. coworkers were a lot of fun to be around and they were always there for you.
good,"Hours are erratic, you have little training and managers are as stressed out as you are. You learn on the job and are not given much help. Coworkers were all good, every one is in the same boat. They try to do to much with too few people leading to a lot of upset customers."
good,I enjoyed work with the customers. This is a fast paced company and you will stay busy.
good,The typical day working at Wal-Mart consist of cleaning and tending to customers. While working at walmart I have learned the true meaning of multitasking. I have also learned how to preform under stressful situation. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people I work with.
good,"They do not treat every associate the same, no equal opportunity."
good,"keep department secure"
good,"Fast past environment. I learned that to be a good leader you have to be willing to get in and perform duties and meet expectation you assign to subordinates. I was steady work, productive, and somewhat gratifying. Many of my cashier expressed they didn't mind coming in to work when they knew I would be on duty and customer service manager."
good,"Customer service desk. I returned merchandise, cashed checks, sent money  grams, and check out merchandise. Management was never all on the same page, one would say something and another say something complete opposite. The co workers were very nice.l"
good,walmart is an ok place to work but has little room for moving up
good,Wal mart was fun at first but to many Managers come through and it seemed like no one ever knew what was going on . Every Manager gave a different answer...Wal mart never fallowed there own policies
good,"I had a dept manager for whom i never did anything right, didnt matter how hard i worked on something, she always had criticisms. She was very disrespectful and even called me ""you"" on a few occasions and that just destroyed an relationship that could have formed between us (on an employee/manager standpoint)...She made my time at the store unbearable and i basically had to push myself to come into work everyday...It was hell compared to Sam's club where i had the time of my life"
good,It's not a career but it may be fun for a short period of time. The managers aren't the best but they are there for you. Training isn't that good because I learned most of the things on my own. Co workers are ok and can make the job even more fun. The customers are most important.
good,Worked on unloading daily trucks. Learned product placement. Management was unclear on daily objectives. Co-workers were unhappy with daily objectives constantly changing. Hardest part of the job was getting objectives done with poor management changes. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting the objectives done.
good,"a empresa é boa mas seus beneficios em geral deixao a desejar,sua liderança é pouco qualificada para esse porte de trabalho,a estabilidade e boa porq tem vantagens agradaveis,mas nao á equilibrio com a vida pessoal."
good,"I was pushed harder then I ever thought possible, and all the employees were considerate and worked with each other. The work was rough, working in the freezer meant that I had to spend 1-2 hours freezing, but I did not mind it. Training took forever, as it took my managers 6 months to give me options to do picks, but I was always willing to learn. Management was OK when you let, terrible if they micromanaged, which many sadly did."
good,"They played favorites in everything, there was a lot of safety issues that was ignored until a customer mentioned the issue. They was fond of cutting expenses as much as they could, but the people were helpful, kind, and always working their hardest everyday. "
good,"Typical day at work to me would be tiring because I would only be scheduled 2-11pm and I have a lot of work and cleaning to do on a night shift which caused me to have pains in my back the next day and kept on dragging me down."
good,Company does not compensate well at non managerial level. Management did not give adequate feedback in performance reviews.
good,"I'll admit its not a dream job, but its steady work with a steady paycheck. I have a family Im gonna do what I have to to take care of them. I regret to say the reason I am looking for work else where is the fact that i have never worked for a placewith constant threats of unemployment to its workers."
good,"My typical day at work was fine, this is a great company to work for but every location is different. My location had many problems and one was the management and they way they treated and talked to you, another was being disorganized. This company is a large company who has many employers, at our location is looks very different from other locations as far as it being organized to have customers want to come back to shop. Co-workers were my least issues, get along with everyone, greet and conversations. "
good,"I learned a lot in 8 years of employment; however, the people that are in some of the management positions show favoritism when it comes to promotions, and even who they wanted to keep around in the company. Furthermore some of the managers at the time at the store I was employed at didn't even follow company policies when it came down to coaching, and terminating employees. Having the wrong people in positions can corrupt a company sometimes."
good,"Wal-Mart was good for me because I needed a job during the summer and it was a good learning experience. However, I did not like just standing in one spot all day and doing the same thing all day. It was very repetitive and tiring. Some co-workers were fun and friendly others were not. "
good,"Very busy day."
good,"ok place to work. "
good,they will not let you advance will train you in departments but  wont interview you for positions 
good,"Very demanding jobs with low wages and few to no benefits for part-time employees, which makes up a very large portion of its work force."
good,"A  empresa Walmart  Brasil não é ruim, ela da oportunidade de que nunca trabalhou ter seu primeiro emprego, ela ajuda o associado a crescer, o que a empresa tinha que mudar e o salario e muito pouco e trabalhamos muito, meu primeiro emprego foi no Bompreço, entrei como zeladora e hoje me tornei aux. operações, eu só  quero sair da empresas  para adquirir conhecimento em outras empresas. Os colegas de trabalho são pessoas ótimas e que trabalhos em equipe um ajudando o outro. A parte mas difícil da empresa e que prende muito o associado não conseguimos ter uma vida com lazer,"
good,"co - workers are friendly"
good,"I have no problem working hard, and I really don't mind what the pay is as long as I get some money, But when management treats you like gum on their shoe, I cant really stand that."
good,"Proporciona o aprendizado,mas a chance de implementar fica muito restrita devido a cultura gerencial da empresa."
good,I learned about myself and that I have really good customer service skills. I learned that it is not the place to work if you have exceptions to availability.
good,"You go in,supervisor lets you know whats to do.put up freight,wait"
good,"I hated being a cashier even though at times it wasn't bad (wasn't for me), but I loved being a cake decorator.  The only thing I hated about the bakery was the petty attitudes and behaviors of almost all my fellow associates there, especially with management; I didn't mind the disorganization and busy days, although we struggled because we were understaffed.  After a crass evaluation based on the hearsay and OPINIONS of coworkers who were rude to me, I was ""railroaded"" back to the cash register after they talked to me extensively about why I wanted to leave it 3 months before in the first place. They claimed I wasn't producing enough cakes even though their cold case is empty days after moving me, and that they needed more cashiers (after hiring 7 within the past 2 months)."
good,i dont like the way  walmart treat it employee i learn to deal with customer some good and bad ones the hardest part of my job was learn the different codes and prices my co workers one dident talk very much and the other one i couldent understand when he talk
good,lots of hard work. not bad if you don't mind a large work load..
good,This is a company that grew more and more difficult to work for as time went on.
good,walmart was a fun place to work but management sucks because they dont care about employees . co workers become your family the  hardest part of the job is dealing with management 
good,"I learned that there isn't any room for advancement on the overight associate team.  This position continually stays understaffed. "
good,"Work four in a half to five days a week. My co-workers are decent people. Hardest  part of the job, keeping your head up high when being talked too as if you were nothing. Most enjoyable part of the job is having conversations with the customers and getting to know them. Management could use a course in business ethics and how to treat your staff or employees. I've learned that education is key when it comes to moving forward."
good,"Empresa até certo ponto boa de se trabalhar,mas com poucos recursos para os funcionários,material de trabalho muito defasado,além dos baixos salários."
good,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart almost a year until Management changed. I had dreams of moving up to management. I already managed and trained new employees at night shift. I quit my job because the safety concerns for the customers and employees were not being addressed. Not hiring enough employees to cover one area. 
good,I learned working at work you have to always be on the go. fast pace work. 
good,"Walmart is a very busy company. I get plenty of exercise to keep up with the volume of customers. The company has make a lot of changes to serve their customers by changing different programs to improve customer shopping experiences. Everyday I attend work, I'm learning different areas of the store. The managers work with their associates to help make our job more efficient. We practice team work on an everyday basis. It's wonderful to work with such diverse group of people, including the customers. The most difficult part about my job is trying to assist in five department at the same time. The most pleasant time I have is to train my associates properly and to serve my customer without being in a rush. I enjoy showing the customer where the products at and showing them that I care about their needs."
good,"Management was always changing, and when a new manager took over, it was always chaos because they would come in and immediately change everything. I had awesome co-workers, and CSM's but the whiplash from management would always trickle down and make everybody edgy and job security for anyone who was not there five years was in the toilet."
good,"Long and hard,standing for 8 plus hours,good side meet alot of nice people more so than the bad people or rude.management did not information from back office to the front of the store you get one pers communicate on telling you one thing and the next telling you something different. The most enjoyable was the ""Good"" people that came throught my check out line."
good,Do not strongly advise employment with this company. too many controversies.
good,"Work was really Representative. come in, clean, help customers, clean again, close down, and go home. I learned how to clean a printer, fix printers that jammed. My co-workers were awesome well most of them. They hardest part of the job was to find something to do after you had finished all your assigned tasks. The most enjoyable part of that job was most of my co-workers."
good,I believe It use to be a great company to work for but this was not my experience.
good,"I spent over 6 years applying for a Full-Time Management Position, even passed a Management/Supervisor Quiz and all they could offer me was Part-Time as a Maintenance Associate!!!!! 9 months later still at same position even though they use my abilities and experiences for so many other things??????"
good,"The job itself was decent, but overall management lacks alot of ability in communications with their employees. It is understood that management had alot to deal with on their own, however, in communicating these changes and new challenges to their workers we would have been more able to plan to aid more as a community and team. Unfortunetally, the way the store is run it seems it's based more around gossip than fact. Information is passed if it is convenient to the employer, not if it is important and workers felt the result of this justification."
good,"a typical day was dull, it was the same thing every day almost like clockwork. but i didnt mind that. i learned to work with people and consumers alot better. managment was not very great because they didnt care about courtasy associates. they even told me that they dont care if i had any problems they just wanted me to work. my co-workers was good but some of them had no idea what they were doing when it was the same thing every day. the hardest part of the job was trying to keep the parking lot clear of shopping carts because the cart machine was broken. the most enjoyable part of working was the fact that i was out of my house and working with people i enjoyed to be around."
good,Responsibilities ranged from cleaning the parking lot to returning grocery carts to store and assisting customers with purchased store items both large and small. Loaded and unloaded customers cars.
good,Dificilmente dão oportunidades de crescimentos as pessoas que realmente merecem...
good,Typical day are long lines with unacceptable wait times.. Management typically watches video recordings to monitor that staff don't violate policy. Follow policy even if it means slowing down the process of dispensing the prescriptions. The most enjoyable part of the day was the little time there was to give excellent customer service.
good,"This job makes me grateful for other jobs because it was HORRIBLE. When I put in my notice to quit because I got a WAY better job, my boss was so mad she went to my new job and told the manager that I was a bad employee and tons of lies about me, told her I called in all the time and stuff. Call me crazy but I think that stuff is confidential information.... Anyway, that person is a MANAGER and its because they had friends and kissed peoples butts, not because they were great at the job they did."
good,greet customers and do returns and use cash register. i learn how to work all areas of store
good,Required to work long shifts while barely making little above minimum wage.
good,"Working here at Wal-Mart was a good experience for my first retail customer service job. On a typical day,it was quite busy and crazy, definitely for holidays. I learned the bakground about wal-mart and workeed with diffrent people. Management were not understanding when it came down to personal issues or work schedules.Misunderstanding with customers were not worked out, it was ""the customer is right"" and you have a write up."
good,mangers are on willing to work with you on scheduling . not much more didn't enjoy the worker management or pay nor hour
good,Fast paced work environment. Co-workers were great to work with. Management was not.
good,"A typical day at work is full of stress,but i have learned how to deal with the public better. It's ran by poor managementand if your not one of thier favorites than you need to be on your A game. I adore my co-coworkers, they make you want to come to work. The hardest part about the job is being rushed to stock 9 pallets. What i enjoy most about the job is being around my co-workers."
good,Continual change hourly that keeps your team off balance and task
good,"Também é uma empresa boa,mas como qualquer mercado,tem seus fortes e fracos,não muda muito da minha avaliação sobre a sendas."
good,recieving /scanning in new merchandice
good,"Management picks favorites and they put a lot of responsibility on us to pick up their mess after they leave. I have been told ""I don't know"" when I ask a manager a question, and then expected to just figure it out on my own. If they don't know anything, why can't I be getting paid their salary? I know as much as they do!"
good,My co-workers were always the definition of team work we worked together to complete any task. There was never a hard part of my job because hard workers get the job done right the first time. A typical day at work was always fine a positive attitude can get you threw anything. Management was great.
good,Typical day at work was operating machines and making sure the material was ran correctly.
good,I've had my share of good and bad days working at Walmart. Sometimes there are rude customers and employees but I've learned that when I'm faced with adversity I must turn the other cheek. The hardest part is standing on my feet for a full 8 hours and the easiest part is leaving.
good,i believe that walmart is a great place to work until something that should be taking serious doesnt. there was a situation that had happened and management did not go by policy. it felt like it did not matter to them. they did not take me serious. but yet a situation kind of like mine they dealt with it to the fullest.
good,*Me disponía a tomar posición de la caja.
good,Learned a few things while working here. Co-workers were great. Worked hard and tried my best to get my hours. raises are rare. overall didnt enjoy working here.
good,Management never covers all Departments according to the needs of the customers. They cover according to the stock they need put out. Which makes the Security a major factor in all stores.
good,"Helping Customer with verifying prescritions writting by doctors. Ensuring the best customer service. I learned that you cant rush in this field, mistakes can be mande at any time. My Co-workers were a great group to work for. Hardest part of the job was leaving, they didn't want to go to school and work for them,I didn't understand that challenge."
good,A typical day at work for me would be perform customer service for customers and helping associates when needed.
good,Management is confused and energetic to a default. Need better organization and more job security.
good,"A typical day at work is management making me go unload the truck because apparently we didnt make enough money to hire anyone. Didnt learn anything, Management was HORRIBLE, hardest part was showing up every day."
good,its crazy wild. the day starts out good but with the enviorment it gets pretty crazy.
good,"the best part was working with the associates. most associate except for management was like family. we were close and looked after each other,"
good,Not really to much interaction with co-workers. management sucked. the hardest part of work was being there. the most enjoyable part was leaving.
good,"pressured to stock 5 areas to their entirety ,clean areas ,and help people who weren't finished complete their task. Management was aggressive from day 1, Co workers were all stressed everyday, ive learned that Walmart employees put up with a bunch of stress everyday."
good,"The store I worked in does not care about personal illnesses, They don't like to give raises, they only start you out on minimum wage. They refuse to allow you to be full time so you can have benefits, You can work with the company for 10 yrs and if your not full time you won't be eligable for benefits."
good,I really enjoy working with my fellow hourly associates. They make it all worth it.
good,Its no future in working in wal-mart. Its hard to stay close to your family while working here Its was hard most of the time doing a four person job by myself most of the time.
good,"Foi boa no princípio após esta fase, a ênfase capitalista prevalece."
good,clock in
good,"Typical day at work : I used to clock in , speak to co workers or customers if need be and clock out at qutting time"
good,"They change store mangers too often, early shifts when needed,never a problem with brakes or lunch hours."
good,I love my co workers and my manager but no fulltime available or room for advancement in my time frame such as working part time for years then getting into a management postion
good,"help customers and push carts and maintain facility appearance. i learned that those who dont work hard are promoted faster and hard work does not pay off. management had us cross working in departments that paid more and was not compensated for my work and help. co-workers were typically lazy and rarely showed up to work or worked hard. the hardest part was having to make up for others lack of working, enjoyable part was having breaks, lunch breaks and days off."
good,"The company is a great place to learn to deal with unhappy customers and associates.You can learn time managment,multi tasking, Great way to learn diffrent aspects of retail."
good,"stocking shelves and talking to customers,, managemnt was ok, co workers was ok, the hardest part about that job was staying in the same place"
good,Typical day:
good,"Era un excelente trabajo,el ambiente era bueno,mis colegas eran malos y lo que mas me gusto de este trabajo era el ambiente con los clientes"
good,"Most team members I have known over the last 6 years work 80+hour weeks to deliver on projects. I have met some amazing people come and go while at my tenure here, but due to the excess in expectations and the constant driving to deliever below cost solutions they get burned out and leave."
good,"a typical workday would be coming into work to find out five of our eight co workers called in, leaving the rest us to finish the truck on the same regular schedule as if they actually showed up."
good,It was ok to work here but managment needs improvement hours are good but they have to many call INS which doubles our work load
good,Buena relacion con mis compañeros/as de seccion el resto prefiero omitir y si nos daban todas las mañanas un cafe.
good,you never know if you might get fired however you do get a 10 % discount on everthing and at every store.
good,Chaos from minute one. How to manage my time and do the job of many. Need new management. Great people to work with. Doing the job of at least three areas. My co workers.
good,"I was a cashier for 10 months. It was a good job once I got used to how things worked. It was a small store so you would get a lot of regular customers and get to know them on a personal level. The workers were great, a lot became friends and hung out after work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the hours, I would close to midnight and open at 6am most days. A lot of days I had off were in the middle of the week so I never had a great work schedule."
good,"A typical day at work was nine hours of stocking and fullfilling my duties as a Walmart associte. I learned not to take people for their word while employed there. The management was just very below par, management just wanted those bonus checks. The co-workers did what they had to do to get out on time. The was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was my break."
good,•Responsibilities include restocking and ensuring all items are in specified locations and store is presentable in an effort to meet and exceed customer’s expectations while shopping.
good,do your dont get into cliques and drama and watch your back and always be prepared to have your hours cut
good,The best part about working their was most of the associate.
good,"management dosent know what they are doing, sometimes you dont even get your brakes."
good,"Um dia de trabalho muito puxado, aprendi muitas coisas boas, muitas culturas e a valorizar o trabalho em equipe."
good,Everyday was a new day to deal with different things. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers at the customer service counter when they wanted to speak to a manager and the co-workers were the best part of the job.
good,"My manger never really taught me anything , what I learned was from help from other workers.In fact my manger at the time I worked there would go hide in the back when higher mangement came around.As of now I beleive the store is one of the dirtist and most unfriendly employees of any stores I've been in as a costumer."
good,"A general work day included helping customers find the products and services they needed throughout the store. I've learned that sometimes people are in a hurry and so you cannot take everything said personally, and this is when you get to really woo the customer base with the exceptional customer service wal-mart prides itself on. I enjoy working with people, public, and those I work with."
good,I liked working at Walmart. I had advanced in the company twice. The only bad thing is for what you have to do the pay isnt up to par.
good,"always was bout customers which thats how it should have been, hardly ever busy but when we was busy we was busy, loved meeting new people , the hardest was always pleasing the customers"
good,"It was a store remodel,physical labor using tools like ratchet, hammers, used a pallet jack alot to move merchandise and materials,it was alot of teamwork which I enjoyed...there weren't really many cons."
good,"Work was fast paced , learned to always be courteous to other associates and customers, Management was good at best, my co workers were the best I have ever experienced, hardest part of the job was balancing home life with work schedule, the co workers were the best part of the job"
good,To much work for little pay. Management for most part do not know how to manage.
good,"Typical day at work was the CSM's usually forgot about you and your breaks. I usually went home late. I learned people will do anything to stab you in the back there. The store manager did not believe me when I turned to him for the open door policy. He basically called me a liar. Some co-workers were great, other not so much. Hardest part of the job were the long lines and cranky customers. The most enjoyable part of the day was when I got to go home."
good,"They cut hours, sometimes the hours that you did make was never on your paycheck, its hard to step up in a n new career"
good,The compamy is ok but its just not for me no more. Some things I didnt like. But I deal with it cause i need that job.
good,"I work in Tire Lube Express and i like it. Daily I deal with all types of customers with various situations. I believe the management could do and be better, i dont feel like management put customers first at all. With my position there are no hard parts . The most enjoyable part of my job is making a customers day."
good,I have learned alot being cashier which i love always learning new things.
good,"Unloaded frieght trucks, score cards and task system, stocked shelves."
good,"Now im not bad mouthing walmart at all. The way the night shift runs can be tough. A lot of the workers co-workings quit or were terminated due to the fact of everything was our fault. How things ""run down hill"" well it did. In the few months i worked the overnight shift, i never heard a single "" hey great job"" or any positive word toward an underling. i cant really say i had very many enjoyable days working at walmart. the hours were long and after a nine hour shift doesnt mean it was the end of your shift. case in point the job wasnt for me and my best interest, mental heath. i just cant understand how, when i started, there were 50 people doing the work, when i left. there was 20 people doing thr same amount of work."
good,"As with working in any retail position this was a very demanding and fast paced company. However, management and the treatment of women in the company was less than i desired."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but co-workers were not very friendly and i never met my supervisor til i left employment there by choice."
good,Wal-Mart was an enjoyable job due to customers and being surrounded by merchandise.
good,"This is to help in the meantime to get by, but I am looking for something more steady and permanent."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work, but I want to work in the medical field in which I went to college for, and enjoy."
good,"Working for wal mart was very fun and productive. I also disliked some things about working there, poor poor management involvement. No good benefits. Not a very clean place to work. And LOW PAY!"
good,Asistant managers need to be trained on how to talk to employees without using extreme vulgar language
good,- Company doesnt care about hourly workers
good,"The management does not care about you're needs as an employee at all, almost all of the benefits that were offered to employee's are no longer there now."
good,I have learned many new things since I started working for walmart but they have no advancement and they have no plans of making me full time or giving me benefits any time soon. It is an excellent company for someone who starts out small and works there way up but for a pharmacy tech there really isnt much room to grow.
good,Working for the Walmart company has help me to improve on my people and communication skills. It has helped me build my customer service skills.
good,This should be your last choice. The employees are blamed for the companies shrink problem. That should be the responsibility of management.
good,"At the Walmart that I currently work for management is very rude, they do not show respect for the individual which is very strange being this is a key goal/mission for the Walmart corporation. A lot of management take their titles to the head and go on unnecessary power trips."
good,walmart is one of the kind of a job that there are good days and bad days
good,"The management team at this place posesses a friendly atmosphere but when it comes to advancement they already pick the individual. I know this because I was among the individuals that was picked because they have to pick three, I was informed that I was not selected for the position and that they have to inform everyone that was interviewed. I asked then ""where is my interview?"" They had hired a guy that was a CSM's boyfriend from outside the company when by policy it states that individuals have to be there for at least 6 months for advancement. I was there for three. Right then I knew what was going on and no one cared to listen."
good,Working at Walmart. I feel that you are not acknowledged for following protocols and doing you job at top performance. It does not matter if you do your job well or barley at all.
good,You get to interact with the customers and give them help when they need it. physically what I do is VERY HARD. I thought I was stronger than I actually am but I still do the job to the best of my ability.
good,"I got promoted in 6 months to produce and the manager there flipped out on me when I had an illness and needed some days off, they really don't treat employees well"
good,"they are very rude and dont help if you need it. they cuss around customers, the teenagers that work their talk about drugs in front of customers, hard to ask for things."
good,"Working here was ok, but management didn’t treat me or others with respect, very rude demanding, don’t recommend anyone to work there, plus there have been a Associate who had a criminal record and as well didn’t feel to safe"
good,"After learning the job I enjoyed it. I was trying sometimes ,but to see people smile was priceless. To be able to talk to the kids was good also.We were given two fifteen minute breaks and a hour lunch. I had certain customers that would look for me to check them out ,that maded me feel good also."
good,"Overworked,poor management, not being able to feel safe at work.HR is operated poorly. Few bad apples in the bunch. I was happier in the front department where the management is more helpful and didn’t make my work experience harder then it’s suppose to be."
good,"I have a lot of issues with my schedule and I just started 2 months ago. I also do not feel like management cares about employees whatsoever..it would be nice to know when you are a hard worker, someone sees it."
good,"I liked working at Walmart, the hours were good. I really enjoy working in customer service. The major complaint there is as a Customer Service Manager I was under paid."
good,store managers under alot of pressure thus this is a high pressure job becuase they are never satisfied and expect 1 person to not have anyhelp in their depts
good,it always crowded and a typical day is always productive. how to stack boxes and how stock freight on shelves. Management is somewhat good. there is no culture at the workplace. unloading the truck is the hardest part   of my job. most enjoyable parts is when we get bonuses.
good,Bad management    Did not comply with associated work life schedule  did not have a we’ll oriented group of managers very messy and cluttered store manager was rude to associates
good,"I wouldn’t recommend working here.If you get sick and need more time out ,they’ll fire you on the spot. The new points system is what’s messing up their employees."
good,very unprofessional dont care if you are sick or injured or anything they expect you to show up if your dying and get a point or to if u miss work then u get fired even if u have a dr. note they dont care
good,"It's a good place to work but not for a long period of time, you work a lot for a minimum wage job, don't respect your hours and they overworked all the employees no weekends free and the managment suck most of the times."
good,"It was okay, I liked most of my co-workers. The management are not efficient. The pay is very much less than desirable. Everything you do has to be done on the computer. I am older and not very computer savvy. In orientation their computers kept freezing up and I had days of watching videos on the rules. The videos make it seem like it a nice place to work despite the pay, then you get on the floor. Then everything that you learn is out the door."
good,"Walmart starts you off at about 30 -35 hours per week , then you get 15 -20 and they tell you that they cant help you with more hours , meanwhile your job is harder because there is not enough peoe scheduled to  run the store"
good,A typical day consists of slow and busy spurts. Some of the employees are very kind. While others tend to put everyone around them down. Some days are more stressful then others.
good,"I loved my job but management and a few select employees were very discriminating. They constantly went out of their way to single me out and right me up for the pettiest of reasons. There were times that my job was threatened over a coworkers personal opinion of me. Job, pay, and benefits were awesome. Management needs to have an attitude change!"
good,I had great experience with fellow employees but the work atmosphere was not the best and the work/life balance was HORRIBLE!!! Had some great times meeting new people and learning new things.
good,Great colleagues just not enough of them you must be fully flexible at the drop of a hat .Heavy work at a fast pace with not enough people to do the tasks needed so the company could save on wages .If you like doing the work of 3 people then this job is for you .There is no work life balance for section leaders or managers  long unsociable hours either 6am_4pm or 1pm till 10.30pm working every weekend
good,I've worked for Walmart since 2008. I don't even make $12 hourly. People who have come after me literally make more money then me. It's SAD!! And I work in the finance department.
good,"I am a person with a Disability who wanted to get out and work for Extra Money."
good,"For being such a big company and store, it was constantly messy. No matter how much a worker cleaned , nothing seemed to look better. constantly running around for unappreciated people"
good,Depending on upper management your job was either enjoyable or stressful. I started in the Brownsville location when it first opened. I enjoyed working there and was approached to apply for management. I was chosen to work in the Washington location and upper management there was very difficult to work under.
good,Work at Walmart isn’t bad. This would be a great first or temporary job. The working environment is fast paced and hectic almost like fast food just not as much of a rush.
good,Walmart is a good job for first job people. Management is okay sometimes but it’s hard to find them when you need them. They change ya schedule a lot.
good,"Es una empresa que te permite tener mucha experiencia por el tamaño y el impacto que tiene a nivel nacional e internacional. "
good,Company written police as per international norms & inhouse 1 day training is good but local office management not up to the mark no support from seniors they always support TL
good,Started off a great employer but went down hill all about the money now. My position got eliminated 3 time in this span and the last time in 2018 they wanted me to do just as much work with less pay
good,The managers do nothing but sit in office or go outside to smoke. They expect way to much out of us and if it doesn't all get down they tell at you.  Most of the co-workers are great.
good,"Its an okay place to work. Hard to get more than just part time hours at. Slim benefits. Occasionally stressful. You're expected to pick up other people's slack and overload yourself, without any added incentives."
good,they could use a lil bit of help at the management level sometimes they aren't on the same page but overall not a bad place to work some supervisors expect a lot out of you when the task you were given isn't possible to get done in your shift
good,The days are gone where this was a good job. Replaced with temp workers wherever its possible. production is meant to be unreachable unless a part of a select favorite group. everyone is constantly on the edge of being fired. great for someone fresh out of high school to make good money. wont last longer then 5 years without begging for your job at least twice. Everyone is always pushing off the dirty work on the next person to make their production.
good,"Hours cut after season, managers don't support workers who need hours, no explanation on reasons behind the shortage. Other workers don't appreciate what is done for them."
good,"they worked us hard.  did not stand up for employees.  I liked some of the coworkers. but some of the workers would get special treatment.  wind new management would take over, they did not talke to the employees.  I left Walmart because they  paid new employees more money then meand had worked for them five years. I only want to work part time, about 20 hours a week.  monday through Thursday, about 5 hours a day.  9:00 am to 2:00 pm."
good,"Working here was great at first. My first job, making at least a little above the minimum wage line, but eventually working here just begins to drag. It's easy, but monotonous work."
good,"Walmart has been getting a horrible reputation for not really communicating with their workers. They need to reach out more, and understand their employees needs. I understand from a business perspective, but work should make you feel comfortable, and have a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Only being allowed to miss three days of work before threatening termination is really awful, thing's come up in anyone's lives. I'm not saying that a person should be allowed to stay home whenever they want, its their job, but Walmart should definitely talk with their employees and see if they have a serious issue going on. I think it would help reduce tensions with Walmart and the general public."
good,The job is easy. The management sucks. They don’t care about their employees. The were unwilling to be flexible in scheduling needs. They didn’t show up when needed
good,I liked most of my managers. I moved up quickly from cashier to customer service to customer service manager. Schedule is always all over the place and time off is very hard to request.
good,"I work overnights with a bunch of grannies and grandpas. They're all nice people but all of them and including myself feel very understaffed. They never replace the broken pallet jacks so if you get the shortest straw you're basically fighting a hernia. A couple very confused managers, but most are friendly.  Overall decent place to work, better experience with coworkers  closer to your age. 100%"
good,It would be a better place to work if management was more understanding. they have a point system and its not good for single moms. A typical day at Walmart can be a little hectic.
good,Part time associates barely get any hours at all unless you are in good with HR. Store management make things more difficult for the employees then they have to be. Even if you use your PPTO to call out sick for and emergency they still wanna know why you called out. Would be a wonderful place to work under better management
good,"Working at Walmart is a good place to start if in high school or just out of high school, but I would not recommend it to anyone as a carrier path. While the the schedules are flexible and the managers are mostly nice their is a horrible culture of quantity of work done is better than the quality of it. This has caused many people around me to quit and the rest to have their work ethic slowly degrade over time."
good,"I was hired to do maintenance and found it was just a janitor job ,the problem was they threw me into the lot attendant position when it rained hard and then would throw me in other positions which made it hard to complete my cleaning tasks.Other than that all empyees were very friendly and helpfull."
good,Would like a job closer to home and with reasonable hours and that isn’t as stressful I would really like to go back to a cashier job if possible pay was good at my job I don’t like having to work some of the hours I had to
good,"Acomodo y frenteo de mercancía"
good,The managers feel whatever they are doing is right. You are never consulted in matters related to your field of activity. Management always complaining of low sales but never make an effort to increase them. Most of the time managers sit back and relax at the back office than being on the floor.
good,"Do what you gotta do , Walmart wasn’t easy but I feel like that’s with any job especially if you’re working in retail you just have to have patience ."
good,you have to be Pro Walmart management team is racist and bias of different cultural of people point system is not fare . The pay should be more and some stores need security in them.
good,My time there is up and down. Mostly down. Veteran employees aren't compensated as new employees come in making almost to/or at the same rate of pay as you or more. Issues with your work never seem to be resolved and often continue coming up. The only GOOD it had was it was a place of work I could walk to from home.
good,"Walmart will work you as hard as they can.  No matter how good a worker you are, your hours will be cut back drastically (down to 12 hrs/week) right after Christmas."
good,"Buena en gral, excepto el maltrato de una que se llama Florencia pagola"
good,Most of the time management just yells at you. They give you non-stop instructions. If I was alone in the morning and trying to fill milk I got in trouble for trying to keep on section fill and let another be empty. But being one person it took a lot out of me having to run in and out of the backroom. And making sure that milk and eggs were filled if I were to ever leave the section alone to go to lunch or a break.
good,"I worked overnight maintenance and its what you'd expect... machine cleaning, stripping and waxing floors, cleaning bathrooms, trash etc.."
good,"I’ve worked for Walmart for 8 months working 40 hour weeks as a part time associate. They will not grant my full time status due to unknown issues. On top of this, I work as a customer service, cashier, self-check, toys, and apparel associate and can personally say that the managers do not worry about how many people work in your area every shift so you will be on your own most of the time."
good,"Everyday is something different, you have some of the same daily task, but your dealing with different people on a daily basis.  One thing I don't like is that management is not on the same page with one another, lack of communication."
good,La mayoria de los grentes y puestos superiores se olvidan de la calidad de vida del empleado
good,Good entry level job. Got more knowledge about electronics from working here. Management was not excellent lot of miscommunication between them. Have to be flexible and work multiple departments besides your own.
good,"I know what I have to do when I am at work, and they offer benefits and stock options, but the are not flexible when it comes to scheduling and taking time off when needed."
good,"Day is as one would expect, long and hard.  I have learned I am still able to learn and adapt to new challenges.  I have meet some wonderful people."
good,"My review of Walmart is okay besides if you work there, they don't treat you like they want to be treated and they don't respect others, management doesn't do their jobs correctly. Employees don't do what they are supposed to do and overall the work environment is horrible and that is why I personally quit!!!"
good,After 14 years it was just well annoying. You get tired of not being appreciated. The amount of work expected doubled over the years cause they were trying to operate with less employees.
good,"They have a lot to work on management wise, they forget that you are a human being and that emergencies happen in our private lives, I had to quit in order to make it to see my family member on there death bed, they refused to let me leave. I understand that customers are important and our jobs are there to be helpful to them."
good,The hours/days that they schedule you gives you no time for a personal life. They make the goals they set unattainable.  Servicing the customers was what I enjoyed most.
good,They worked around my school schedule so I can finish and create a better life for me and my family. I would like to see paid holidays be brought back to the company.
good,"It’s a job, nothing more, nothing less. Work/balance sucks but hey I have a paycheck every two weeks!  I enjoy the people I work with and I do a lot of standing and walking! Great exercise!"
good,Doesen't care about workers and doesn't know how treat workers with respect. All they care about is the money they make. They try there best to keep you from getting the bonus.
good,They hire new employees and cut the hours of employees already there.  Management really does not care like they should. A lot of fake smiling and fake people.
good,I worked here for 11 yrs. Not sure how I handled it for that long.  Before the ef5 that it us the store was a great place to work. But after it went down hill from there.  Wouldn't recommend working there.
good,I worked there 1999-2000 I will never go back. They ripped us off and I didn't get my money or even know they did it until 2016 when I got a nice check in the mail. They docked our pays plays without our knowledge.  Do you think they haven't found a way to do it again????
good,"Walmart was ok as a part time job. There are some departments that you needed to work at a fast pace so it was hectic at times.  Mgmt was poor and acted shady, but it does depend on the manager you had, not all were that way."
good,"As an hourly employee I enjoyed my job. I foolishly took a promotion where I began to see walmarts truer colors. You ARE just a number and you can be easily replaced. Dont bother reporting illegalities because, after all, it is walmart and ultimately, you will lose whatever battle you are fighting. Open ended shifts make for very little family time, and I was always fearful for my entry level management job."
good,"Overall, I am grateful for the experience and the opportunity, but as the years went on management continuously got worse. They expected too much out of a single employee because they either fired too many people, or they were putting people in such bad positions they quit. Then would get angry all the time with people who stayed loyal to them. At the end the work environment was just toxic."
good,Bad communication rasict workers not enough pay for work the managers never do they job it’s no transportation after a certain hours and they still schedule you til after then transportation stops running the pay wasn’t enough to pay rent and survive
good,Empresa boa para quem procura seu primeiro emprego
good,"nice shop good workers ,fun sometimes good work times,and bosses meeting people,helping ,fix problems,cars and trucks and give advice for repairs nice store"
good,"The management is like a revolving door. The customers are low-class, trashy, ignorant and abusive to staff. The company tries to operate on a skeleton crew to save money and pressures the staff to work harder to compensate for them cutting hours. Benefits are utter garbage."
good,It's okay for young ones to start there. You have to be nice to customers all the time. Stocking food most of the time.  Organizing the back bing's stockings the freezer and cooler
good,"You must be willing to work in all shifts, including nights and must be flexible to do multiple jobs. You have multiple managers that you may have to address to."
good,"It was a long time ago I worked at walmart so things may have changed since then.  "
good,"The simplest way to work at Walmart:"
good,"they will give yo a bad review just to meet their layoff quota.  45 work week, it is NW AR so you don't have many options.  It all depends on your reporting structure.  For 10 years, the job was ok despite the low pay and long hours.  After a reorg, I got a terrible manager and was out the door less than 3 years later."
good,training program very basic.. wont allow you to take your notes home to study. Its extremely difficult to learn the ropes and feel productive day to day. No leadership and customer's unhappy as a result and using services and products provided by competitors like amazon. No work life balance and horrible hours offered. No parking provided for employees and investment required to work from home.
good,"Walmart has a very high turnover because they do not pay their associates enough to do 2-3 jobs at a time as needed when the store is busy. Walmart constantly under staffs their stores so they can maximize daily profits for the shareholders. Management is often... Not trained, inexperienced or grandfathered in. Management is also required to work very long hours and required to do most of the work."
good,"The pay was nice, but that was about it. I tried transferring to other departments in the store, was always told flat out no. I tried for a promotion to CSM and was passed over for an 18 year old high school graduate with no management experience, despite the fact that I had management experience and a bachelor's degree. The third part they go through for FMLA leave is difficult to deal with and does not always approve leave and if they do, they do no approve full leave. I had gall bladder surgery, I was approved for all but the 3 days before I went into the hospital. I almost lost my job as a result at that time. They do not follow their own policies. Cashier's only have to lift 25 pounds. A customer put a 40 pound bag of dog food on the belt. When I asked them to put it back in their cart, the customer complained and I was wrote up. It don't matter what they reason, a customer complains and they side with the customer over the employee."
good,I loved the people I worked with but management is VERY biased. They have their favorites and they flaunt it. They don't care if you get injured they only care if you get the customers out in a timely fashion and bag the stuff properly once every two weeks or so. I would not recommend the one in Hastings Michigan at all.
good,"I take on a lot of phone calls throughout the day. "
good,When I first started it was fun and energetic atmosphere. Management was fun to work with. Never had the tools necessary to complete work needed done by certain deadlines. Always had to fight r show up early to get the equipment. Coworkers was amazing but a lot of talking about each other....GOSSIP!!  Just like HIGH SCHOOL. Not a terrible place to work but definitely need thick skin.
good,This company use to be family oriented when Sam Walton was alive. His kids took over and messed up the company in my opinion. The associates in my opinion deserves more than what they are paid while the CEO’s are over paid. Favoritism is a problem between management and the associates within the company. Associates are poorly trained on the floor. Management broke rules while I was there while trying to enforce rules on Associates. Communication was/is poor within the company. Bonuses are not fair between Management and Associates. Management gets almost there whole annual salary while associates max out at $500 quarterly. Depending on how well the store sales are. I understand now the attendance policy has changed so that if you miss a weekend day it counts as missing two week days. Making it harder to spend time with family. You are only allowed 5 days missed within a certain time frame before you are terminated.
good,"I enjoyed working for walmart, I felt that work hour flexibility and management ruined my aspiration to work there. When you establish what hours you can work they tend not to stick to it and schedule you for times that affect other things like another job or school you may have. With management I've worked with in the past, instead of working with you to do a job right they demote you when you knew you could have done the job better with better training. not all stores are like that but apparently at one store I did the job quite well and another it was unacceptable. I loved learning new things and helping customers find what they needed and if another employee needed help with something i knew how to do, I loved to help."
good,"I loved my time at Walmart. They need to figure out how to keep people in their positions when restructuring, not drive someone off. If you are outspoken and stand up for yourself, you will not be rehire able. Word spreads between store management. The coworkers are great, most workload is impossible to meet daily. Especially with having fewer employees"
good,"The management above my bosses sucked. The co-workers really make the job. I mean you get points for just for being sick the only way around it is  PPTO, which they don't let you use until after 3 months. The department manager was an ok guy, but after time he got more and more passive aggresive with me. He would basically pull me aside to tell me ""what I should be doing"" when he's the one who ordered me to go do something else! To top it off as employees we can get info on what his responsibilties are and when i looked at it, he does like 1/20th of the things he's supposed to do. Yet I got in trouble constantly going above and beyond doing the job of at least 3 people. Stuff like being pulled from my post to translate, cash people out, (when I'm supposed to be majorily in the shop of the TLE) help the techs finds things (Since they too were short handed), and do a 3 person job by myself."
good,"working at walmart does have its ups and downs. mainly downs considering management doesnt exactly know what theyre doing. If management likes how you work, will deny days off just due to that and will make up excuses"
good,es un lugar muy estresante la gerencia no le da la importancia a los empalados
good,"Always walked into a messy backroom, not very organized, need more employees. Management has little respect for employees. I enjoyed working with my fellow employers."
good,Over all a good company to work for . Mostly leave you to do your job as you wish. If you get a bad manager your work experience will not be pleasant.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, they have benefits, discounts, and you can be promoted to another position if you work hard. When I started in Walmart I started in the produce department and with hard work and determination I was promoted into the pharmacy department."
good,Working there is okay. When you are in you’re in. If not you have to fight your way to position that you may be more than qualified for simply because a manager favors another.
good,working here was alright. The days normally are the same unless something pops up and they need to move you to cover for someone. The only thing i recommend is to make sure to trend cautiously and to look out for yourself.
good,"Walmart was a good job but CSM/management was not really helpful , was not organized and everything was wrongfully put together. But customer’s were always nice , fun on the cashier an building bonds with other associates and some Managers"
good,Depends on the management but my stores wasnt very focused. Hardest for me was the manual labor and getting used to all the walking. The management was okay but didnt cooperate with me
good,Worked for the company for over 11 years. There management team brings too much personal life into the work place. Needs to be higher caliber of professionalism.
good,"If you ended up with any over time they would make you take a longer lunch. I was one of the best stockers there, but management steadily harrassed me about exceeding my times that i already consistantly beat. My supervisors were cool, but the management would micromanage everybody and were very rude"
good,This is an ok part time job. I had this job while in college and they worked around my schedule with no problem which is awesome. It can be stressful at times.
good,Needed more hours and didn’t receive them not very caring overall experience was frustrating and negative never felt like I could accomplish anything with how things were
good,"A typical day would be finding out what station I’m assigned to & than make sure i have everything I need. I would continue by turning my light on & I would than greet customers. The most favorite part about working there was interacting with the customers, the things I disliked were trying to ask for help which took a while."
good,From what a I hear they have put better management in there now.  Higher management was the problem. A lot of walking in my position have to be able to problem solve.
good,"I open shop in the morning. Log in safety checks. Prepare shop for duty. Oil changes, tire replacement and balance.. I guide and train new hires. Wal-Mart is an ok job.. I'm searching for a career.."
good,The company is motivated by profit and not the employees or associates.  They have great benefits and the pay is above average but could be more.  The work environment is stressful and demanding.  The expect you to work hours that are constantly changing so you can not make plans unless you ask time off.  They are not likely to grant the time off.  They also have a strict attendance policy.
good,"Management within Walmart is NOT a very pleasant experience in that they do not treat their workers fairly. Meaning, even if you did an excellent job, if you weren't ""in their favor"" you went unnoticed. A lot of biased attitudes."
good,"Management treated people like they were replaceable 24/7 "
good,I don't have a good review of this company at all because i was hurt at work and yes workers comp paid for my doctor visits. But i was taken out of work for a couple months without pay and when I was allowed to come back they had me doing the same thing that messed my back up in the first place.
good,Salary is a joke. You never see your family.  You work weeks with no off day for ungrateful managers and the market team does not stop bad managers. Even if you continue to report bad managers.
good,"The management is very slow to help and fast to pass off . If your looking for a part time ,don't need the income to live on kind of job,this is it. If your relying on it for a living. No..."
good,"Walmart used to be a great family oriented company to work for, but through recent changes is has become terrible.  Because of recent changes, several employees are being impacted by leaving the company or moving to new positions and taking severe cuts in pay."
good,"At first I liked working at Walmart.  Then, when you come in contact with customers, they are very rude to you and are insulting, belittling, all the while you try to help them. Over time, you become bitter, uncaring.  Dreading to come in. Hours get cut by district managers, good luck trying to get into other departments.  By the end of your shift, you are so exhausted in all forms."
good,"Overall Walmart is an ok job, the department I worked at was the Deli department. The job itself was fine the work wasn't to hard the amount of customer you serve is steady paced. However, you will get a fair amount of rude customers so patience is key in working for Walmart. The pay increased a lot when I worked there but it was because the minimum wage was raised, so everyone that was below the minimum wage got a pay raise which wasn't so bad. The management at this company is horrible I'm not gonna lie about that, They do not care about there employees they only care about the company and the customers. The hours are pretty fixed and not very flexible."
good,"Wasn’t too bad of a job when first started, but as our online grocery service is growing, we’re not staffed to handle the amount of orders given to us. It can be very stressful and tiring on super busy days. Also some people seem to get away with not doing much, while others are working there hardest and quickest to finish orders on time. If anything better management is needed..."
good,"Walmart is a busy store, but. The hours were very scarce. Some weeks you may have close to 40 the next week maybe 0-20. It was hard to work at Walmart and try to support a family."
good,Walmart was an okay job. The management could not get me on the schedule until the last day I worked there and it was hard to plan anything around a schedule that was not there.
good,I was used and abused by Walmart. I ran a team of 26 for 12 hours 4 days a week. The overnight manager was bent on making the most resourceful workers quit.
good,Management is horrible. & I worked in the Deli there was too much drama. Other than that it’s easy to learn everything I caught on pretty quick. I like it there at first. I enjoyed most was working with the customers
good,I would make sure that people feel welcome by welcoming them and saying goodbye as they exit. I helped decrease theft by checking receipts for any unpaid items.
good,management at Walmart treated employees unfairly unless Friend or relative. there was no advancement. jobs were taken away to current employees and given to friends of management
good,If you like living to work then it's a great job.The pay is good. Not a good long term career choice because of the physical work you have to maintain during the entire shifts
good,maintenance.   Customer service.  Maintenance on the coolers and cooing equipment.  Work in the deli as needed cutting meat or cooking food for the afternoon.  Cleaning and maintenance
good,"They only hire part time, insurance is bad, very high deductibles and high payments, have to be employed at least a year before insurance takes place “if you can afford it”. Decent BENIFITS for part time, unusual benefits I’ve never had with any other company I’ve worked for."
good,Well the mangers dont really care about there employees. And the plainly just dont care for customer. They just work for the money. All I have notice past a 4 years I worked they are very poorly motivated
good,"While the job is fairly easy it's also very demanding, fast-pased, and the people you work with will not think twice about talking about you behind your back."
good,keep bouncing my hours around. I need a  constant 40 hours a week to make my Bill's loans and rent payments. They say the listing to there associates but they turn the other cheek when the opportunity comes
good,"The reason I had left my job at Walmart was due simply to their unwillingness to accommodate my scheduling needs due to previous medical conditions. They were not even willing to entertain the thought of an accommodation until I had worked there long enough to qualify for FMLA, despite having a note from a physician."
good,It wasn’t horrible it’s just our managers aren’t great here and they never treated employees like they should. We were all overworked. The managers didn’t care about us like they claim they did.
good,The company as a whole is okay but it is not very family friendly. I needed time off for my daughter as she got really sick and they fired me for taking too much time off.
good,"All in all Walmart was a great company to start with,but now it's going downhill. They don't care about employees anymore it's all about the money. 1 out of 5 for me."
good,"I’ve got some good memories in TLE, yet there’s a lot that needs to improve. To begin, I have to say that TLE is misunderstood by upper management and completely different from the rest of Walmart. You get dirty, sweaty, and deal with customers who want their vehicles worked on yesterday; however, corporate policy and mis-management tie one hand behind your back and expect you to “grab those Benjamins” with the other. For example, staffing was so bad at my store (2544) that I had to run the whole shop on a few occasions with no direct supervisor, which violates OSHA, company policy, and common sense; however, upper management refused to allow me to close up. All jobs deal with staffing issues, but there’s a big difference between not having bacon on the shelf and listening to customers berate and roll their eyes at you because your coworker took a two hour lunch and you (how dare you!) can’t possibly do the oil change and the four tire job in the other bay at the same time. It’s truly sad because there is a lot of potential for this to be a fun and rewarding job, yet they routinely hire two snails for every good worker and everyone is paid nearly the same. That said, my time there as a young man was very educational. I learned a lot from the guys I worked with about those living near or below the poverty line and the mentality that keeps some there. I also learned that if you work hard and try to do more, like volunteering to get numbers to run the register in order to help customer wait time, Walmart won’t give you any more of a raise than what is standard and will still treat"
good,Its ok for some who is getting public assistance but anybody else no. They demand the most but pay so little for certain jobs. I know my worth and they can't afford a hard worker
good,They have a point system that is redicous if you late or to early you get half point an they don't take doctor excuses so there's a point Everytime your sick an there discount for employees doesn't count on groceries .
good,"It's a great place to work if you can get past the cliques an politics, they expect allot especially from dept managers but if your lucky enough to get the position that fits you its easy going an not to bad"
good,"Walmart is always changing. You will be pretty set in  your job and duties and all of a sudden everything will change. They don't really care about their employees, just the money."
good,It's a place that hires you at a part time schedule to work you full time hours at a certain amount of weeks and put you back into part time hours to stop you from being hire full time to receive benefits from the company. Management and employees are never on the same page. I wouldn't recommend this employer unless you were going directly into a management position.
good,Good for people who has no kids or older kids. Fast paced work and very strick work environment. Over all the pay is decent. You have to have a open schedule to get hours
good,The environment of the company has changed over the last decade. It's a good job but you have to expect that it is a business first. The focus has changed from their associates to the productivity of the business over everything else.
good,"we were often very busy and short staffed, management didn't seem to care about their employees at all. pay is good. discount only counts for certain items (food is not included in discount)"
good,"90% of the workers are fine, but those 10% just arent worth all the pay in the world, not to mention customers can be a bit much, but if you have tough skin and know how to keep your head down you'll be fine."
good,They gave an hour paid lunch which was both positive and negative but management was really lacking when it came to knowing what employees were doing in the store.
good,Different mangers do different things and their is no communication with the management  staff it seems as if everyone is running around with their heads cut off u r asked Todo one thing and before u can get it done they want u Todo something else as if u r a robot and not a person no sense of direction
good,"A lot of changes have occurred since I started. Firstly, they used to give you a dollar raise when you finished training, but now everyone starts at the same rate of pay. When they raised the starting rate from $9 to $11, I started making the same amount as people that had been there for ten years, and people that had just started were making as much as I was. When the yearly review came up, my raise and the raise of an associate that had been there for five months, were the exact same."
good,"If your looking for a place to be stuck in the same position with no way to move up, then you've found the right place. The management here is horrible and do not care if you excel. Pay increase is a joke.  Every year if you're lucky you might get a 10 cent raise. The only thing that is good about the job is the people you work with."
good,I’m a disabled worker &  the company seems to care about pregnant ppl more than ppl with disabilities.  Our store is really busy. It’s also seems hard for them to find good workers.
good,"So I loved my job at first til I was there for 3 months. Csm's were very disrespectful and rude. I was doing the most work when I switched to work in the apparel department. It was just stressful, no structure or organization."
good,Buen ambiente laboral . Salario aceptable . Turno nocturno pesado a veces te lo rolan cada 6 meses si se acuerdan de ti . Jefes de depto. Buenos  . Codigo de vestir en decadencia . Gerencia aceptable . Pago de horas extras . Capacitacion constante . Los companeros lo mejor .
good,ok and fast paced and you learn a lot of different things about the company and everything is enjoyable about my job.  Management is very easy to get along with and they really care about your needs.
good,"My review summary while employed at Wal-Mart was pretty decent they were helpful and understanding for the most part. I got along with my coworkers, the customers, and management. As an unloader I received forty hours a week and got decent pay. As a People Greeter my hours was alot more shorter making my pay very low to the point I couldn't pay my rent in full at times."
good,The management there wasn't too great. There were too many managers that would tell you to do different things. Then get mad at each other and the accociate. A lot of miss communications
good,You Dont get appreciation for being good workers afterall we the ones that make them money.with out great employees there would be no walmart.i was the best and hardest worker there. They dont care bout families they only care what you can do for them not you as a person
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, training them, making friends,"
good,"While working with Walmart, I began my day with cleaning my working area, checking out customers and bagging their groceries.  At times it was super busy and hectic but assistance was always available by managers."
good,"Walmart is a company only interested in making money. My store's management cared more about their bottom line than customer service, employee moral, fair compensation for work,  or taking care of their employees. I was routinely asked to do work by myself that was supposed to be done by multiple people and would get in trouble if I went over my set hours. Hours were cut during times when we actually needed more people (like holiday prep). There is a lot of favouritism and ageism; employees that were old enough that Walmart got a tax break from employing them don't get written up or fired for things that a younger employee would."
good,It was an okay experience definitely good for a first job and I’d love to do it again.. I’m ready move on and be able to get another job with no attendance interruptions because my attendance is normally perfect.
good,I wouldn't work there anymore .  Work hard and the pay is not good. The manager there shows a lot of favoritism.   He doesn't know how to talk to his employees.  The manager always has a smart remark.
good,Very stressful to be there management shows favoritism. They are demanding and just overall often slave-like. They only care about their sales and only the sales.
good,you get to talk to a lot of peoples you just have to convince to sign up for a Walmart reward master card. you meet a lot of interesting individuals with crazy excuses.
good,They let you make your own schedule that was good but they fire you even if you’re the best employee and is late one too many times with no second chance
good,Management needs more training and they need to stop sleeping with the employees.  Too many internal affairs going on with married and single employees.
good,"Upper management didn't give these employees enough or any positive feedback, it was always negative. They worked very hard and I learned a lot more than I know now. The CO workers I worked with were great. and some of the mangers were awesome. They are few and far between and Walmart  ninneeds to give these mangers a lot more recognition"
good,"Okay environment to work at, a typical day was to stay on a register and a break after every two hours. nice people, stressful at times, hardest part of the job was the people."
good,"Some of the managers were rude to the employees and treated them badly."
good,Great Place to work if you don't have much to do in life. They require most of your time. You will most likely not a have a set schedule. Management can be great but from my experience that is very rare. Most management does not value the Wal-Mart spirit the company portrays.
good,Empresa que tem tudo para ser uma potência mas precisa mudar a gerência
good,typical workday people breathing down your neck and you have to over proform. Also very few paid days off and if you take them you loose your bonus and such
good,The management does the best they can with the rules held against them. But they hire anybody and most people they hire barely work at all. The ones that do work get all the slack thrown on them.
good,When I started there it was fun. Now after a year and months I promised benefits and can't get benefits. There point system is bull they don't care...
good,Managers are rude and unappreciative of hard working employees. Instead of  disciplining employees for attendance they approve absences to avoid  disciplinary  actions.
good,"It is a fast paced, hard working company. Management is a little discouraging, other than that it is a great place to work. Co-workers are fun and outgoing. Very friendly."
good,A typical day is spent in many different departments due to lack of staff. Most days you just barely get your own work done due to helping out where you are needed. This is a great place to learn how to do things on your own and how to help others without any appreciation.
good,"The pay is decent for the position (and much higher than many retail pharmacy technician locations). I personally enjoy the fast pace environment. However, the managers often employed at WalMart could use a lesson in humbleness and sympathy. Many of the ones I've encountered are manipulative and demeaning. They will verbally abuse you if they don't get their way. You can file a complaint, but they know how to put on an act and appear to be one of the purest people you could ever meet. Work-life balance is also an issue, depending on where you go. I've had to ignore calls to come in so I could focus on my personal life. At one point, my boss even said they ""didn't need me anyways"" after I told them I couldn't come in."
good,It wasnt the worse but also wasnt the best job i ever had. Really nasty Management long hours breaks were never given when they were suppose to be but you did get a good amount of hours.
good,The work was repetitive and consistent retrieving cards from parking lot putting them into Bay making sure the bay is full assisting with carry-outs and returns from the parking lot maintaining a clean and safe parking lot and store entrance.
good,"Pulling people in different directions all day. Impossible to complete a task at high level. No advancement, no pay. No help from managers in training employees or helping them reach higher levels"
good,"It's been an interesting place to work. You meet very little happy employees working for Walmart unless they have been there for a couple of years or more. If they haven't been I have heard from people there, there isn't much room for growth and if there is an you qualify they expect a lot from you with little to no team."
good,"There is a lot of political things that happen. If the managers like you they don't follow policy, if they don't like you, you will get fired. It is not a good place to work."
good,"Terrible job, terrible management. No care for what’s going on in people’s personal lives, they wish bad on you and when you quit they hound you for not letting them know so they can have a replacement ready."
good,"This is a face paced stressful environment.  The customers were rude by always hollering at you, calling you names throwing things and talking down to you."
good,"They didn't respect medical problems. I was let go because of attendance, but my husband has medical issues and I had to take him to doctors appointments and I had to care for him when he couldn't do it himself."
good,Walmart loves to keep things monotonous and very mundane. Since I have been with the company they've changed their attendance policy and the disciplinary process both without a heads up. They're not willing to excuse time if you dont have the ppto or they really like you. The mass of management gets there because of social status rather than hard work.
good,I wouldn’t say it’s the best place to work but it’s a paycheck. Pays more than average. Work life balance is not the best. Poor scheduling. Mangers don’t listen to associates. Overall I wouldn’t do this long term.
good,Great people to work but the management is very rude if apart of they group you gone It need to have under cover boss go over there  I bet a lot be be gone but I miss it
good,"Managers are never on the same page, hored for 1 job and are expected to do the job of 3 with no extra time to do so. Told managemtny I wanted to step down and wasnt allowed to do so until 6 months later when I threatened to quit"
good,"Would not recommended for the easily flustered. High expectations , unnatural time schedules. One of the hardest jobs and you still get paid the same a cashier would."
good,During my employment at Wal-Mart I met a lot of new people whether it was a customer or a fellow employee. I also made a lot of new friends some of whom I still continue to keep in contact with. But that's pretty much all that you can expect to get from working for Wal-Mart because when it comes to going up in the ladder or requesting to become a full time employee its more than likely not going to happen.
good,The customers were rude and inconsiderate. The Management was not to the best it could've been. The only thing I did enjoy while working for WalMart were my coworkers.
good,"Buena empresa, estable, sueldos según el cargo, La parte administrativa, jefatura y gerencia, puede mejorar en general bien"
good,"Job always kept you moving. Outside was where you spent most of your day."
good,"With Walmart being my first job it sucked. No benefits after two years working, hours inconsistent, bad management, and 20 cent pay increases per year."
good,Manager was not organized barely did anything to help his associates and yelled at his employees. Would have the workers cut breaks and lunch to do work he wanted.
good,Over night is not for everybody. The hours seems much longer then just 8 hours. Stocking is really easy and the people you meet are easy-going people. Everybody helps everybody.
good,Alot of favoritism..If your more then qualified for a promotion and another employee isn’t but has it good with management well you guessed it. They will get picked before you
good,"I worked as a photo lab technician, but they also had me working in stationery and electronics. I thought it was a nice place at first. The store manager and the management were very unprofessional. Since we were usually short-staffed my department manager would ask me to cover shifts and I would. I was eventually coached for that reason since I received OT and was treated with a rude attitude during the process. Management really did not care about their employees and only watched their own backs. Even though management was unprofessional, it was an okay experience and I managed to learn quite a lot from there (customer service, cash handling, sales, patience)."
good,"Walmart is fine, the people you work with will make or break you, as will the customers you deal with.  The work isn't typically that difficult. It's not easy to advance very far if you aren't close to those on top. The pay of 11.50 an hour isn't bad either but it's well below a standard living cost. Overall wal-mart is just a fine first job. Unless you're coming from fast food, I wouldn't reccomend it as a second job."
good,"I advice you before you read, I worked at the distribution center in baytown tx like 3 years ago, so things could have changed. "
good,"Starting out Wal-Mart was a nice place to work but overtime as other associate walk out the door management will put pressure on you to do more than what you're job code is and what you're paid to do, so they get the result they want. if you fail to comply with their demands they start to bully you and make the job hard for you."
good,"Muchas veces te entrenan en muchas áreas para que apoyes sin un beneficio extra o motivación, te negaran todo lo que pueden y te botan, tiene demasiada rotación de personal y los que trabajan ahí por más tiempo siempre terminan cubriendo otras áreas por las necesidad de la empresa, se aprende mucho no digo que no pero no valoran tus esfuerzos"
good,working for Walmart was a nice job till they tolled me I hade to go to day shift and from there it went down hill. new managers thot I was not working hared enough so I pooshed my body to hared and tore a muscle in my ribs and they put me on light dote too days a week not fare.
good,"the work wasn't a lot but it was more than enough  people I worked with were cool but a lot of the store was really really lazy and bosses never said anything. I got fired for half an attendance point and my boss didnt want to work with me even though I was one of the best in the department and shes given me team recognizations, thank yous at team huddle and told the store manager how great I am but in the end she fired me to save her own self which was petty but not surprising"
good,When you work at Walmart you are working with any type of person from all walks of life. The breaks you get are good and often (every 2 hours). When you start working they mix up your hours and book you hours you can't work. training is really good (12 hours total).
good,"First experience in Waterloo was amazing, great manager who wanted me to succeed."
good,"if you're just starting out great, but Walmarts getting to the place where they don't want to pay a living wage but they would rather keep all the money at the top and pay workers as low as possible."
good,"As a 7 year associate ,and a well qualified 5 year supervisor, I wasn’t promoted by my store manager to be an assistant for reasons nobody else had to face. It’s a lot of favoritism and brown nosing you have to do to be promoted and if your store manager doesn’t like you they won’t sign off on your promotion. I heard that the assistants were being downsized and to not even go for the position anymore. One interview with Aldi and now I am assistant there. Bye Walmart!"
good,"Working for Walmart has taught me a lot of things. It was also my very first job, because I just been going to school after I graduated from high school. Walmart has taught me customer service, to work in a fast pace, to be on-time and ready to work."
good,"Management was good and bad"
good,ok to work for not great do not pay enough my hours would be all over the places never the same day off they do not care about there works management really does not care about you
good,"I found the majority of the staff very unfriendly.i did learn to be a cashier which was something totally new for me. My csms were awesome. The hardest part was dealing with cranky customers with no patience. Also a manager with very unfair buisiness practices. Nobody should have to put up with that nonsense. My boss was great, he was very understanding and helpful., also very friendly."
good,The work was not that bad thanks to my coworkers. The management was not that great and the scheduling was absolutely awful no life outside of work allowed.
good,"A typical day you go to the back Clock in and Start walking to the front and getting to find out what register you are at exactly, You work fast and Hard and you help when needed so people don't like to go as fast as other push them and this is a requirement they should put on they application"
good,"Basically Walmart is a common job for the young work force, there are complications and sometimes seem a bit out of control but it’s the basis of work in general that tells people what they are getting involved with, the company holds good safety measures but at some instances there are some moments where it would seem almost confusing to follow certain procedures as there is a strong lack of communication within the walls."
good,Working at Walmart did teach me how to deal with all types of people and how to handle certain situations. I learned to be patient and understand the value of money.
good,Overworked and under appreciated at times. Mandatory overnight shifts. Colleagues were great to work with and management was looked up to for the most part.
good,"I was working as a fulfilment associate at walmart."
good,"The management team at Walmart does not focus on helping individuals succeed. They have their own objectives, and if your requests are convenient for them, they will help you, but if not, they won’t go out of their way to help you"
good,I was an electronics associate. My department manager and co workers were cool. Walmart is like highschool so prepare for the drama. Our store manager was extremely lazy whenever he did decide to come in. Upper management flat out disrespects associates as if they never worked in our shoes. They fix your hours to make it 38 hrs a week so they dont have to give you full time benefits and hours.
good,"Management is lazy and doesn't really know who you are or care. Will watch while you struggle. You are rarely credited for doing a good job, but rather, they will point out the minor things you didn't do satisfactory. The customers are rude and rarely pleasant. Your schedule is terrible. Would not recommend. Also, very little training.  PTO takes forever to accumulate. Point system is strict.And be prepared to be there for a minimum of 9 hours a day to compensate for your mandatory hour lunch."
good,I had a good experience just need something new & will give me some vacation time when I request it. I loved Walmart just becoming a little to much & unfair
good,Work environment was parallel to surviving high school. There were times management neglected their employees all due to personal pettiness. I could never work in a place that has little value for its most integral personnel.
good,i start my day at 2:30 pm and work until 1 am. i spend 10 hours a day to try and make production and when you don't make production they're pretty unforgiving. i got written up for making a 97% production rate. the management is gets changed so many times i had 3 managers in 8 months. the hardest part of the job is just being there. the job isn't really enjoyable. the most enjoyable part is the friendship that the crew shares.
good,"I've worked at 2 different locations, and management is always a problem. There is little communication between employees, making tasks harder to complete. The way they do their scheduling is really frustrating as an employee, which is honestly all too common in this industry these days. You will need to change your availability and choose your days off or you will always work 5 days a week, even if they are short shifts each day. Days off are often separate. Scheduling isn't consistent so planning trips and events with friends and family is difficult. The company will keep you just under 40 hours to keep you from benefits you would otherwise receive. The pay is decent if you live in any state other than WA, otherwise you are still making basically minimum. It's retail, so it comes with all the frustration of dealing with the public; as well as slacking employees. Overall not a horrible place to work if you're not looking to develop a career in your job. If you are, however, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
good,Really good place to work at but has its problems with management and can be stressful. But for some there are opportunities to advance was good experience
good,"working at Walmart is nice if you enjoy helping clueless people, don't mind 10 bosses, and being rushed constantly. it's not all bad, perhaps the Show low location was just rough."
good,Not a good life and management treats workers lvery aggressively even though I was.treated ok I watched many not and third shift for so many years just wore me down to not enjoy any life
good,Horrible management. Bad coworkers. Not flexible with hours. Can hardly excuse absences. Not a strick dress code. Had hard time getting my break on time.
good,If you are a hard worker than yes they will love to have you work their. When it comes to hours when you apply you have to have an open availability to work what ever they give you.
good,Retail was very different for me because i was use to working for business type companies and it was a good learning opportunity for me as a individual.
good,"I love what I do at Walmart but, if you enjoy your time with family especially around the holidays then Walmart is not the place for anyone. If I had another job worked out I'd leave Walmart now."
good,it was a good stable job. there where some bad things about working there like when they would put me on a register and close all of them down so I was cashing people out by myself and they were such long lines of people and I had to wait to be relieved.
good,"Spent most of the time doing break out or stocking shelves. Dealing with customers wasn't too bad, I would just refer them to my supervisor if they had any issues."
good,I would have to say Walmart is an okay place to work. But not a place to really make a career. Great first job for a teen or college student. Management plays favorites. No overtime. Not many fulltime people. Hours drastically cut after Christmas until June/July.
good,I work very hard but there is too much to do. They don't appreciate what you do and the company keeps taking away benefits and saying they've improved them.
good,Easy to get hired. Good dependable job. Hours are crazy. No family time. Management is horrible. They pick and choose who gets jobs before or if they even post them. You miss breaks.
good,A very fun work environment. People/associates were fun to be around and a rather very enjoyable place to work at. But the scheduling wasn't that great. You would go weeks and months without being scheduled.
good,"Management team has no leadership skills, managers are promoted based on how well they are liked and not based on skills.  Managers are not given a reason why they were not qualified for a position."
good,The customers were sometimes very rude even when there wasnt a reason for there to be. Some of the management was very disrespectful towards minors for no apparent reason. They dont care for their employees. If you have a family emergency or get sick be prepared to not be able to take time off without getting a point for it. They arent very flexible and even when you request time off you usually wont get it. You will not get weekends or any holidays off no matter the circumstances.
good,"It's Walmart. I applied for part time, somehow I got swindled into working night shifts on stocking duty when I applied for a cashier for daytime hours. Management was constantly changing and there was a high turnover for all employees so there was no garuntee of any friendly staff."
good,"Pay was low for the position i held! Felt like my hands where tied in certain situations that I felt did not deserve to be punished! Especially when it's employees that had been there 10-15-20 even 25 years plus! "
good,"Upon being employed, i found it quite the likable place with a fast pace, and easy to grasp tasks. however i quickly noticed that there seemed to be a rift between the shifts, as well as the managers. communication from one manager to another was lost, and every shift seemed to ridicule the other shifts."
good,My experience working for my local Wal-Mart was one of stress and inconsistencies. I did however learn to work in a demanding and fast pace environment as a team unit more efficiently.
good,"Management has improved, could be a better work place if they really listen to the employees with years of experience. The hardest part of the job is the work shift and schedule."
good,"Before I begin this review, I should mention that I was a college student with strong time demands for homework that were never met by Walmart. I originally signed up to only work 25 hours a week, which worked for about a week, and then I was given more hours each next week until I talked to my manager and he lowered the number of hours for me. My day would usually be, go to class, finish school for the day, have a small snack and then go to work, get back at night, sleep. On the job I worked in the fridge, my coworkers told me that sometimes we're able to go outside the fridge and stock yogurt from the front of the shelves. I'd look forward to that since I was always cold. I asked if I could switch sections but I was denied. If you're going to work at Walmart, just work in an area that you enjoy."
good,Nothing to tell about this job. It’s okay helps pay the bills meet a lot of people not planning on going back that’s really all I have to say about that
good,the company does try to provide a healthy happy work place but many employees take advantage and leave lots of work loads on others to finish. the pay is reasonable.
good,"They treat you well the first couple months then they start to change. It takes really long for them to approve of time off (even up till the day of). Super nice people and mean well, but they could be on top of things better"
good,My department manager was the reason why I lost my job  I was a work horse I was tired. I hurt my back during work. Hours were topsy turvy. But a good place to earn money to pay the bills.
good,The work was easy but it was stressful. Not enough employees so we had to do it all. I had to do 2-3 departments freight in under 5 hours while management was rude and unprofessional about it.
good,The front end management was nice. Never really got to know anyone from other departments. Work was always either boring or stressful especially when we had to do price match. Poor communication about policy updates.
good,"I was part of cap 2 team. We unload the truck and stock grocery. management was not great, but the store stayed busy. I would hav to say the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and the most enjoyable part was my cap 2 team."
good,"Walmart Canada is going through a major transformation at the head office (eg. Store Support Center). While there are cosmetic changes to the workspace and organizational structure, management has yet to embrace a flatter, more collaborative work style. Processes are almost non-existent, and advancement is entirely predicated on being with the ""in"" group of veterans."
good,If you are sick no matter what it is you will get a point even with doctors notes. Most managers don’t treat their employees very well and expect you to overperform but not get raises except yearly.
good,"The general work environment was always so stressful and the management is TERRIBLE!! It may be better at other stores, but the one I worked at was the worst!"
good,Wal-Mart will never be a great employer. They would lose profits trying to So they just do the bare minimum for there employees. However u can make son great friends working there.
good,Too many company changes.  Not an individual. Just a number anymore.   There isn't enough help anymore to handle the work load .  Feels as if we do not matter to the company.  *** THIS IS NOT STORE LEVEL MANAGEMENT.  THIS IS CORPORATE.
good,The Company is outsourcing jobs downsizing people and adding works to the ones left and even bring in robots to unload trucks clean the floors and count outs.
good,This is your typical place to work. Management does their thing and you do whatever you are told. Have to deal with customers so if you’re not a people person don’t even bother
good,Management was all over the place and not well organized; scheduling was a mess. Managers would schedule you on days that you were unavailable and it would be difficult to get in quick contact with them to fix it. Provided great experience with working as a team and problem solving.
good,abastecimento de linha de producao organizacao e limpeza de maquinas
good,"I met some of the best people working in Walmart and some were even over qualified for their position. Management however, is completely indescribable. They gossip about each other to the employees and divide the store. The scheduling is so bad that we usually had about 3 cashiers for the entire day and one person for half the store because management wants their bonus. I worked in customer service and management NEVER backs you up. They go so far as breaking mandatory company policies and make their own."
good,Management was always on us even when it was 90F+ no training other employees taught me the ropes on what I was supposed to do and when. Management didn't care at all about how hot it was out or if a storm rolled threw we always had to be on top of the Carts.
good,They treat their workers poorly and they don’t care about things they pay us decent but not enough for manual labors. They have good job opportunities and can promote people to managers.
good,"As expected by a huge corporation, you are overlooked. They go off a point system, and in your first year you only get three points, they do not accept doctors notes so if you are sick with the flu, and you use up your three points you're gone. "
good,"Co-workers can't be trusted and to survive a new worker has to on their best behavior. Go in with a bad attitude toward the company or your shiftless co-workers and you won't last. Supervisors don't consider you  a human and literally will let you die rather than jeopardize production. Concentrate on getting to the end of your shift and remember you need the money. Remember , all the 11 dollar per hour jobs suck and the jobs that pay less suck more."
good,They are constantly changing your hours the company was a lot better when I first started and treated their employees way better I've been at my store for 13 years and it's never been like this before
good,Worked in the Deli so very busy and extremely stressful.  Customers are impatient and often times rude.  Having to cook and take care of customers was hard to handle at times.
good,"I learned working overnight is not for everyone and is very different than staying home and staying up all night. The work itself was straight forward and some of my coworkers were nice, while others were not."
good,Have a plan to move on and improve yourself. it gets stressful especially when managers don't pay attention or think about the wellbeing of staff......
good,"Not reliable with hours. Constant hour changes and scheduling issues with everyone and very uncooperative with personal life in regards to time off, availability (scheduling outside of availability), and issues brought to management are usually ignored. Pay is good plus bonus but always understaffed and expected to do alot."
good,Always understaffed. Busy with not  enough staff members to do all duites required. Management  rarely kbew the prporr procedures. Staff membrrs left alone to make decisions. Weelends were always understaffed n very busy.
good,"empting the trash cans ouside in parking lot. cleaning the feces off the mens bathroom walls."
good,I have worked for Walmart for 17yrs I always do what I'm told then when I apply for advancement I get told I'm not experienced enough to be a supervisor or department manager even though I know how to do these jobs I am made to do them without the compensation and am expected to cover the entire backroom and help have to help cover when someone isnt there I am constantly covering the cash office because there isnt coverage and I shouldn't be in the cash office because my husband work as a supervisor on the front end.
good,"Very challenging place to work and extremely long hours.  Great associates, management could use some additional training on interaction with their employees."
good,"Company does not give enough hours to maintain a home budget. They will work you 30 hours in one week and then not work you any hours the next week. It's good work, just inconsistent hours."
good,"Coworkers and management are rough- come to work, do your job, go home and youll be fine. Pay is good but raises are few and far between unless you move departments. If attendance is a problem dont bother applying because their policy is not lenient."
good,"As an employee of 4 years here, it is ridiculous how bad the management and favoritism is, its a great place at first but after the years go by you realize just how bad some managers are. Not all Walmarts are bad I loved working here when you have management that knows how to do their job and do it correctly and efficiently."
good,"I don’t really want to say anything, I am sad that I no longer  work for Walmart. But, what happened, happened and there is no going back. So thank and blessed be."
good,"not enough help to get everything done. "
good,The management sucks but pay is good. I met a lot of good people as my co workers.customers were nice sometimes. Fast paced work environment some times
good,I started off liking the job but quickly began feeling stressed because of hours being cut and no matter how many times I asked for a fulltime position I was put off. They play favorites and didn't care about us getting sick in an unclean place and didn't accept doctors notes. Also gave me a really hard time about hours after losing my mother during the holiday season.
good,Wasn’t treated with equality . People have favorites. Lots of drama . Worked with great happy people . Depending on who your manager is it is somewhat fun
good,"The management at my store would always run around super hectic the day before a walk, to get the store in order last minute and would have favorites,"
good,"Management lies. I would get in trouble for things I had nothing to do with, One of the managers would push us around for her amusement,and I really mean pushed us physically. Other than horrible boss's I loved the job. Great work life."
good,They were a good place to work for. But some of the management team were not respectful of my private life. And they very rarely helped when help was needed
good,"Ambiente agradável pra trabalhar, porém cobra muito das pessoas que estão  lá mais tempo ,e deixa de cobrar de outras."
good,"bad management, everyone contradicted each other"
good,The thing about Walmart is this it can be a really really good place to work however if your upper management team acts like children bickering and being jealous of one another you’ll find yourself out the door or wanting to be.
good,"i was lied too by the ceo and management. i didnt like working there youve got management playing favs with certain employees no support to build your career or help growing it,"
good,"Great coworkers semi, great managers who let the title get to their heads. Show up do your job be cordial and leave. Can be promoted depending on your relationship with management."
good,Walmart is a great place to work it’s just the managers that makes it a stressful place to work .. Walmart has great benefits so if you can wirk for walmart they benefit are good . And also you get a paid week vacation after a year working with them .
good,I think they were unfair and could treat employee with more respect and honored hard work and staff could have showed up on time and get more organized
good,"wal mart is a rough place to work, I don't know how much of it is actually the companies fault a lot of it is management and customers, at times they cut hours without notice and don't respect the days you have blocked off"
good,"Empresa médio em quesito de agrado. Até há alguns benefícios, porém, não é o suficiente. A gerencia especialmente, deixa a desejar em alguns aspectos."
good,I will say - I've met some exceptional co-workers/customers and gained many good experiences while working at Wal-Mart. It's neat to be able to grab lunch in-store - plus 1 hour for lunch is wonderful. I guess they know that an hour is sorely needed before going back to work (smile). Wal-Mart has a very sociable environment but I guess that all depends on which department you're in.
good,"my biggest pet peeve is you NEVER had a set schedule no matter what, you never knew any time ahead if you were going to be working the same days or not"
good,"Management doesn't know they are doing sometimes"
good,Low pay job poorly ran and no help. Added by stress of inexperience upper management that's so bad people quite or transfer and refuse to get promoted so has not to deal with management.
good,"Management is disconnected with their employees and do not care about anything but production. Hours are horrible, the only thing keeping me there are my coworkers."
good,Nothing u can really advance and prosper from depending on your management but for me it just puts money in my pocket until i find something better than what I got
good,Fun place to work but only when your managers are fair. they always tell you that you can move up but most likely you always have to transfer in order for that to happen or be up under somebody.
good,The company as a whole may be functional but our current store level management system is overly complex and communication is a barrier  exists between shifts. Management levels and associates
good,"long hours, breaks are usually forgotten about, your hired for a certain job but never work what you was intentionally hired for. This is a job I would not recommend to any of my family or friends"
good,"A typical day at work was long with little breaks and long stances of standing. I did learn how to operate the cash register and worked on my social skills. Management was ok, however, they did not treat the part time employees the same as the full. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people."
good,"Pour avoir travaillé environ 6 semaines et voir un chèque de 303$ pour 35h de travail (2semaines), c'est non. Sa dit temps temps dans leur annonce et une fois engagé sa joue au ping pong avec ton horaire pour finir par faire du temps partiel. Ciao Bye Walmarde ✌🏻🖕🏻"
good,"My time frame working in Walmart was challenging there for there wasn't a steady shift. But it was a good experience, I enjoy working with customer in helping resolve their problems ex; I'm bilingual , I would help the customer in translating any issue with their concerns."
good,"Home Office does not know how their decisions impact their employees and managers in store, that's the worst part about working here. Management tries their best to adapt to the rules that they are given, but oftentimes departments are short handed and this clogs up the workflow of everyone involved in the store, not just certain departments."
good,Needs better flexible hours and opportunities for management does allow any growth except to change your departments and not enough sick time for people with needs
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, if you like fast paced work.  The only reason I quite was that it was too difficult to work two jobs at one time.  The discount was great too."
good,"The last year and a half I worked there I had to be available from the time the store opened to the time it closed, (5am--1am). There was not set schedule. Every 2 weeks it changed. No room for advancement and men were chosen over women for management positions. No benefits. If you wanted insurance you paid for it, not Wal Mart."
good,Working as a temporary seasonal employee this was an opportunity to work and improve my customer service skills and work with a diverse group of people who share different ideas and cultures.
good,"I needed a job to help keep myself afloat at college and did just that. It wouldn't be worth it if I was older, and it definitely wouldn't keep myself afloat if I was on my own out of college. Management was poor except for a few exceptions and work environment was awful. They never did fix the issue properly even after complained to OSHA."
good,"Recomendo sim pous é uma empresa de bons custos benefícios. Porém muito trabalho quem te ter muita disposição. Falo de onde trabalhei pois é uma empresa diversa incluindo a venda em atacado. Mas que dar pra enfrentar. Dependendo do cargo a ser cumprido la dentro. Salário em dias , maus benefícios e outras vantagens além do aprendizado."
good,"Don’t consider it a place for advancement, it’s a big corporation so you kno the store manager likely would never know your name or commend you on doing a good job... still thankful for a stable place to make some alright money"
good,"The hours are extremely flexible and they will work around your schedule, which is great for a college student looking for a job on the side. However, I did not have a great experience with the people I worked with which was extremely stressful. And, the absences you are allowed are very strict which doesn't bode well for someone with chronic illness."
good,It’s okay for a first job or if you like the public. The manager I had sent me home because I wasn’t friendly enough with the other coworkers. They all were cliqued yo and that wasn’t my style.
good,"In my opinion they need to redo store 890 starting with the store manager. He is no help at all. I couldn't even get my old job back, and on my involuntary terminated paperwork it said I was rehirable. The managers there seem to be racist, and it has nothing to do with your job performance on how you get promoted. The only great managers that were their got fired because they were to nice."
good,"Good company to work for, once management changed things changed for the worse. They don't get employee sides when it comes to customer complaints. Its not a company that is for their employees its all about money. No coverage in departments."
good,"Used to be the best place in the world. "
good,It was not a horrible place to work. Just very clicky managment was. And it was like pulling teeth to get help from them if they were arguing with one another. Didnt handle discipling workers very well either. I watched a coupke of occasions where they had berated an employee infront of a customer i stead of explaining what had happened and how to fix it.
good,"Open at 7 close at 7 pm. Continous flow of customers. "
good,"This was a relaxed job compared to others but i would have to say im about neutral on this one, over all it was ok but not great but not horrible either."
good,"very physically demanding. Toxic coworkers, sub-par management. rude, boundary invading, customers...................................................."
good,Management team needs to be committed to customer service and not just committed to getting the  in order. If it weren't for the customers the store would not need to open.
good,"Walmart is an okay  place to work.  There are a handful of people that are suppose to be working but walk around the store doing nothing and management is okay with this.   Pay is not great.  But the benefits are good.  Too much work to do to ever feel good about your job, and Walmart just keeps adding more duties"
good,"Walmart is by no means an ""Employee friendly"" company. You are, from day one, nothing but a number to them and you will spend your entire career at Walmart worried about being fired for some reason or another. However, the recent pay increases at Walmart make it a genuine and respectable place of employment, and you do feel fairly paid for your work. Management at your store could make or break your enjoyment at the job."
good,"Working at Walmart, you will find many opportunities to move up, but also find they will find a wormhole to prevent anyone new from moving up. Good luck."
good,This job was pretty good used to happen since they took the incentives away. Very fast paced job but just kept putting more and more work on you. Did not like I had to work every weekend didn't really get to spend time with my kids
good,"Wal-Mart is a good starting job for those looking to gain experience in the work place. However I wouldn't choose it as a smart career choice. All in all, it's not bad, but not good."
good,"It was ok working at walmart.Had my ups and downs like anyone else.Days were long and fast paced.Needed to work fast all the time.I was working overnight most often in grossery.We unloaded trucks,sorted grosserys according to the isles items went to.Then we stocked shelves and fixed up shelves so they were neat and customers could find what they needed.Of course, aways there to give customers a hand if need be."
good,"The pay was fair for my work."
good,"A typical workday includes a a back breaking job.  You will work yourself until every part of your body hurts."
good,The job it allows you to meet new people and get to know your community and it also allows you the experience of Retail and customer service.  It also determine if you can handle a stressful situation and handle impatient customer and how to be kind and patient with outraged customers. It also will give you the motivation to set goals to be as good as you can be in this field.
good,"Not ideal but will pay the bills, perfect if you have no life. Lots of different departments if you are looking to spread your wings a bit. In all honesty retail just wasn't for me."
good,"My trainer is rude to me without reason, does not instruct me well and leaves out important information that I need to do the job.  Company policies depends on who is telling you them, many different versions out there.  Company expectations for correctness of product on shelf is unattainable and unrealistic to achieve considering the customers are constantly putting items where they don't belong and associates are held responsible for an item in the wrong place or positioned incorrectly in the right space."
good,"The energy in Walmart is great, but supervisors not keeping in contact with other supervisors was a bad habit. I definitely enjoyed my overnight maintenance crew but the overnight supervisors were well under par."
good,walmart was good on working around your school schedule but i had to work during thanksgiving day but the pay was average but they are not good when it comes to begin full time
good,Walmart isnt really the best job you could have you could honestly get a better job with the same job requirements in another company with benefits and more
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and there is always something to be done.  In working at Walmart, I learned customer service skills and how to multitask. The management was very unorganized, but despite the disorganization I was able to go in everyday with a positive  attitude to represent the company and the best way I could. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with customers. This was enjoyable because I was the last face customers saw before leaving the store and small conversations to customers can go a  long way."
good,"Unfortunately, I am very disappointed whenever I got hired back on to this location. I felt as if I was being blown off and often ignored whenever I voiced that I felt I was under-performing and was generally unhappy with what I was doing. I was told I would be worked with regarding position and schedule but never was, I enjoyed how quiet it was during the evening, but not much else. The hardest part of doing this job is the lack of time to get my assigned tasks completed. The management team is very nice and generally very coordinated, but that is about it. As for workplace culture, it's lively, and there's very little drama from what I know, so it's refreshing. I learned that overnight shifts are not for everyone and I have garnered a new respect for those that can do said shifts."
good,"Every manager will tell you different things and at the end of the day you are held accountable for which ever manager you decide to follow. Retaliation is a thing,  even though they speak strongly on how it is not tolerated. Be careful who you trust and do not for any reason use the open door policy unless you want to be unemployed"
good,So many things went wrong never got a raise even tho I worked there for over a year. Lost of bullying and harassment that managers and store manager let slip though.
good,The pay may be good but they will work you hard at first then you have to beg for hours. They won't hire full-time because they don't want to give you benefits.
good,It has been 12 years since I worked at WalMart so I hope in that time they have better expectations for their department managers.  There was preferential treatment of some.  If the management wanted someone to go into the management program they would go.
good,"I hate my job.. I love the people I work with, but the job itself and the management is just horrible. It's mentally draining, and it puts so much stress on you that people have quit because of it. It's gotten so bad that I break down and cry while working. It's not a place I would recommend working."
good,Not a good place to work would not recommend because of the work environment. Mangers dont know what goes on in their on department. No one likes to work well with others.
good,Was not my favorite experience of employment.  In fact I would consider it my worst.I on;y took the job because it was all I could find at the time.  The pay never was enough to pay my bills.
good,"I worked here in the early 90's and again in recent years and it changed tremendously, the fact that I went back a few times lets you know it was a pleasant place to work at one point. However, a lot changed....  everything but the building.Upon my return, there were few people I still recognized thus, management was another story. Just a bunch gossipy people that talked about people while hiring new people, there were disgruntled employees coming in and out, and a lot of people leaving as I was coming in. In additions to that there was a lot of turnover in different departments at this particular place. While working here, scheduling issues, and breaks became a problem, due to the lack of people on shifts. In order to not be penalized for not taking your breaks,(because that is required now) you had to simply TAKE them at times so  to be timed out on the  cash register because no one would come to relieve you. "
good,I just think Walmart is very unorganized and a lot of the management team seem to never know what they were doing. I feel like nobody would ever be working too. I would often see new faces. You feel overworked and unappreciated at times.
good,"Walmart is a good starter job for high school, but not a job to make a living off of unless you are in management, and getting into management is pretty hard since they move managers around as opposed to hiring new."
good,Walmart is a fast-paced work environment. The management team tends to be very unorganized. They do have flexible schedules but you have to be willing to work weekends.
good,The work is great enjoy helping customer handing all receiving of merchandise oversee policies and procedures for the store management in the 13 yrs I been with the company has gone down the hardest part of the job is not  have enough staff to help the customer the most enjoyable part was going to work
good,"The management needs to be improved , then the store will improve . The managers don’t know how to talk to or treat employees. There’s a lot of unnecessary drama"
good,they do not offer consistent hours or advancement.  My hours vary from 4 hours per week to 20 as PT and they refuse to give additional hours or train me for a different position
good,"long days of standing"
good,They don’t work with you at all. Management is always to busy to help you with anything. Time after time I asked to have my schedule redone because I could not work what they were asking me to do.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart with my employees. Always willing to help out when needed. Work was long and repetitive, but my work was solid."
good,Walmart was a excellent position to receive and learn customer service experience and my way around a register and how to manage a fast paced environment along with great communication skills and merchandise layout
good,"Horrible management, great associates. Wouldn't let people change departments. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the customer satisfaction of everyone around me."
good,This would have been the perfect job for anyone but the management was so poor that no one wanted to work anymore. There was so much conflict between the employees and the management. Plus in Walmart there is sooo much drama there.
good,"the work was fine, attendance policy is awful. if you get sick often this is not a place to work. Got sick at work was told id be fired if I left. Didn't go back after that night."
good,"Walmart could treat their workers better, and management could be more supportive and motivational. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with fellow cashiers."
good,"a typical day was busy.  I learned all the ropes of being a cashier.  Management assisted in any way possible.  the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers at times, but it was most enjoyable, too, meeting customers."
good,"Able to cover 7 departments"
good,"Decent place to work decounts, hour vary, confusing at times, management sucks, a lot of miscommunication, training is half assed, no one knows anything always having to ask for management"
good,"I wasn't with the company long enough to form any real opinion, as it was a seasonal job. The hours were definitely inconsistent for a seasonal job. Management was a bit difficult to build any kind of relationship with."
good,"First i worked for Sams Club in the tire center in dover delaware for about a year and six months, it was a pretty fun place to work even though it could get a little chaotic. There I felt like i was part of a team and everyone was friendly and communicated well. The issue there was that managment would try and alter the schedules and not tell the associates about it and it led to no call no shows missed hours and pay and they tried to fire me for it when they promoted a new supervisor and had to fight tooth and nail. Then I transfered to Walmart in Ridgecrest California. The management didnt communicate at all and somehow i got fired and continued to work for an additional pay period before any one realized it, and it was only brought to light because I personally looked into it."
good,"Walmart is not an ideal place to work. Everything is unfair. Rather than managers training their new employees, they get people that have been working there for 2 weeks or less to train the new stock associates. There was extremely poor connection between the associates and managers. Do not recommend working here."
good,"Poor Communication skills, No interaction from management with employees, no training. They often messed up on the schedule and often had very bad attitudes. No one there seems to like helping people."
good,"After working at Walmart for a few months things all started to run together and management wasn't taking proper control of situations, but money is money"
good,I love the employees there is a lot of diversity at Walmart. too many chiefs though and not enough Indians. you are also treated like you are very replaceable you aren't made to feel valued. no job well done when you do great work but 1 mistake and they are will make sure you hear about it and everyone else too.
good,Los jefes se basan en criterios personales o si les agradas personalmente o no. Para ser tranquilos o hacerte la vida imposible
good,"The rate is low and no opportunity to make up by working more hours. And no benefits what so ever. It's a dead end somehow, you have a very small chance to reach your goal over there."
good,I enjoyed the customers and most of the people that I worked with.  There were not enough scheduled hours available and no set days.  Spent a lot of time on the computer doing training courses for spills etc which I found was very repetitive.  Would have liked more hours.  There were a few times that I was only put on the schedule for 5 hours a week which was not worth the travel and gas to go to work.
good,"When I worked here I learned better people skills,Cooperation skills and to push myself harder to achieve goals. I worked nights and learned how to stock and display various products."
good,"No raises or benefits for 1 year if you work part time, Managers blame every thing on the people underneath them, take no responsibility for their mistakes, and in some cases you work in unsafe conditions."
good,They want you to work yourself to death because you are always short handed compared to the workload. NO BREAKS. Always stressed out because you are constantly running around like a chicken with your head cut off.  TERRIBLE place to work.
good,Decent place to work overall..Pay raises would be nice..but they dont come often..management needs improvement..its always busy at Walmart so you are always moving constantly
good,"Before the company lost focus of its own beliefs .This was a great company to make a life long career. But it"
good,Es un empleo que deberias tomar si estas estudiando por la flexibilidad de los horarios
good,"working here, whatever you would say, everyone would hear it. gossip ran like mad, couldn't trust any co-workers with certain matters. I learned to help customers as best I could and to find someone that knew more if I didn't have the answer"
good,I had fun working fir walmart meet some friends there fast pace i didn't mind going to work some days.. I would tell anybody to work for walmart they give you the hours and good pay
good,"Analyze and manage a large territory auditing invoice claims, negotiating costs during desk top audits, while developing good working relationships with Landlord, maintenance companies, city officials."
good,being on prodution they make a lot rules that make your job harder. management gose out of their way to write people up. the turn over rate is over 60%.
good,Management did not conduct there business very well. No team players. Lots of group clicks. This was the store in Las Vegas nv. If I did not relocate from Tx I would have stayed with Wallmart.
good,Doesn’t give you enough family time. No holidays off with family. Working long hours/ management is not fair and store managers have no sympathy towards their other managers lives
good,"Management doesn't listen to you.  They only go by what they want to believe.  There is a quick turnover rate, so they don't mind getting rid of you for any reason.  "
good,"Work here only if you like being scheduled 9 hour days and only getting paid for 8...., the comouter makes yoir schedule so dont bother trying to talk to management about it, you have listening meeting where the store manager is supposed to kisten to everyones ideas but instead you sit there and listen to hers...and dont get me started on the point system they use a 3rd party kne who gives no craps if your children are sick or if an emergency happens"
good,"A typical day at work would be management talking at you not to you. There are many days members of management does not even speak to associates. The store manager and or co manager will walk right past associates and not acknowledge their being."
good,"This job would be great if management would learn to communicate better.  The lack of communication makes it very difficult to effectively do your job as needed.  It would also be nice if we were able to have off holidays to spend with family, at least a couple instead of working every single holiday."
good,"You are another number to walmart...you can give walmart your everything and be there for when they need you, but your on your own if something was to happen."
good,"though the people were great, walmart doesnt give hours. no room for growth, poor people skills. the managers were horrible. not all but about half..."
good,"Poor management, favoritism to those who been there the longest, poor scheduling, but they will work with you for time off/ or scheduling. I left because of the distance, poor management, lack and  of achievement due to favoritism."
good,Management had favorites. If you were not one then they gave you garbage cans to clean when employed in a position that was not associated in the maintenance department.
good,Very fast paste place to work. You must have thick skin and no feelings to work there. If you want to learn different things and meet diverse people then this is the place. Be ready to work HARD
good,Unfulfilling with lack of consistency in management actions. At time age discrimination was apparent. Acceptance of employees not performing to minimum acceptable requirements
good,"It is decent working with fellow stockman but when it comes to other departments they look down on the position, the standards they look for are fairly high to get a chance to advance to a new position inside the store."
good,Wal-mart has changed alot in the past years with recent changes meaning job security being less and less prevalent and feeling like more and more work is being placed on the shoulders of employees while not offering more pay. Management needs to communicate better among themselves instead of bickering all day about the newest gossip.
good,It was fun while it lasted.  The bosses are a pain in the rear.  will never work for them again.  bosses sit on there butt and do nothing for several hours and then go pick on someone.
good,My days consisted of checking in and started cashiering until my first break. After my first break I would do other things around the store such as returns and stocking the shelves until lunch and after lunch to my next break. After my last break I would work the registers again.
good,"As a department manager I had to monitor the associates in the department, plan the product placement and scan out of stock items.  I had to use heavy equipment to move products and work with merchandisers and management to place product."
good,"This place was semi-workable. A lot of times i enjoyed the work i did, and the people I met. along side that I enjoy the customers over all. While the management didn't care about associates the customers did and they made it a point to bright everyone day."
good,Walmart is a job that you have to set your mind up to keep going. The management team is real rude. You just have to keep reminding yourself that you need the money.
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart was a very stressful, and excruciating time. The shifts were long but we're filled with meaningless tasks to just take up the time of your  shifts. The managers were the most tyrannical people you have ever met, and the ones who weren't didn't care about you or their jobs and would just be lazy throughout their entire shifts. The actual big boss was never at the store, and when he was he was just being lazy, and never actually doing anything. Not a great 2 years of my life spent. Then I finally got the axe for something I didn't even do."
good,"It's a great company to work for. The thing that ruined me was that management wasn't very reliable and overworked everyone. They would always stress teamwork and communicating with the other department managers, but the communication amongst themselves was horrible. When I wanted to do things in my department to lower merchandise in the backroom, they always put it off and even told me, that my department was NOT a priority. May I add, I was department manager over Stationary. I was literally going home and crying every night because I felt that I wasn't doing much and I even stayed sick a lot. The last straw was the last day that I worked, I was pulled for a coaching and everything they were ""coaching"" me for, I was telling them constantly and they ignored me all the way up until then and said I wasn't doing those things that I was telling them I was doing. So yeah, I would recommend it, but not the store I was working at. I liked it better being an unloader and not a department manager lol."
good,Walmart was a good working experience. Just wish the company would compensate the associate a  little more for all the very hard work that everyone does. The reason for that is I've worked at Walmart perviously and didn't feel as if I was paid accordingly for what i was enduring.
good,I loved working at Walmart for 15 years them my last store or should I say store manager just killed it for me and nearly drove me over the edge of sanity. She had no ability to manage people or follow company programs. She refused to listen to her management team and just treated them like garbage in the time I was at this store 32 assistant manger came and went. They mostly went to get away from her.
good,close to home with ok pay good fellow employees work was not too hard able to take some breaks but job was being faded out I enjoyed working and learning the job that I was trained for and the short time I was there.
good,No Break coverage and constant hours being slashed by new company wide policy.Constant back stabbing and gossip. no real punishment for being a poor employee.
good,alot of work load not a lot of skills needed to do the job. pretty fast paced can get stressful and times ..you to mange the time the right way. the pay is good
good,Your either getting over worked or not enough hours. The pay is is not worth the work.  Customers are rude and management doesn’t try to help. Management  does not care if you’re missed treated.
good,Awful environment to work in made worse by lazy incompetent employees and managers things are dirty and often not cleaned for months at a time (meat department especially) it's only redeeming quality is the people I worked with were fairly nice.
good,a typical day at work was to stock new freight and do customer service having to work at a fast paste always. the management  was horrible never cared about there employees  they treat them like they weren't not important demanded a lot . poor pay
good,"walmart gives  new hires three abseces, regardless of doctors or hospital notes. It gives them three in six months. After probationary period it is nine in six months, regardless if you have a doctors note or hospital note. They have a notice posted near the time clock that if you are sick, come to work anyway, clock in and talk to your manager. If the manager (who is not a doctor) doesn't believe you are sick, you have to stay. Nevermind if you have a sick child."
good,I didnt enjoy working at walmart because of the hours they offered. They always cut my hours without talking to me. They put me on random shifts knowing i had a kid at home i needed to be with.
good,"Upper management please stop undermining CSMs in front of other employees and customers, it immediately takes away their power and authority to run the front end properly. Their title says manager, so give them the tools and respect to manage the front end.  CSMs are one of most important positions,  we make sure the customers have a great fadt and friendly experience which is extremely important to sales so show them some respect"
good,Job was a fast paced. You were timed on every run with little to no training. Lifting any where from 25000 lbs  and up a shift. Did have great pay and great benefits .
good,"A typical day as a cake decorator would begin by restocking low merchandise and checking orders. Throughout the day decorators are expected to restock, fulfill orders, take down orders, and various other things to help customers."
good,"A typical day would be unloading the truck, and stocking the items for the rest of the day. Theres two 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch. The hardest part about working here is that you work so much and its stressful and kind of depressing after a while."
good,"I work as a Fresh Cap 1 & 2 Associate. I used to love Wal-Mart and all the people, but recently it has changed for the worse. There is no encouragement/praise for anything good you do; all you hear about your performance or the performance of your dept is the negative. It wears on you after awhile. There are unrealistic expectations of our abilities- we are expected to cull (find bad product & dispose of it) 4 depts in 20 min or less. They do not accept doctor’s notes as reasons for having missed work and they are not flexible when it comes to absences."
good,"I enjoyed working with some of my team members. "
good,"Was both fun and tedious work. Binning and picking inventory on the shelves was boring, and we were understaffed and always rushing around, at least at my location. We had at most three backroom employees for our overnight shift and we needed at least that many more to get the job done. Day and night shift had a hard time communicating with each other on what was or needed to be done. But the employees were all friendly and made the environment so much better to work in."
good,This was my second time working here. Politics and Poor Management stired me away the last time. If you are not part of THE crowd at the Elkton Walmart then there will be no career advancement.
good,"While the Store Manager compensation is among the best in the industry, if not the best in the industry, it comes at a huge cost.  You must live everyday for the store and company, and unfortunately, your family must take a back seat."
good,just a place to make money. its okay but if you're looking for a consistent paycheck but if you're looking for a career go elsewhere.the management team doesn't communicate with each other.
good,"I took this job purely because I needed some money quick and I knew they’d hire me on. At first, I didn’t mind working there. But then it seemed as if they were calling me in on my “off” days because they didn’t have the people they needed. When trying to talk to management about it, they set up an appointment to talk later. When I showed up at that time, my manager had already called it a day and was gone. After multiple tries, I eventually said “enough was enough”."
good,"I stocked shelves for the health and beauty area in Wal Mart. "
good,"Personally every Walmart Management is worse that's why every time Associate are complaining and associate and cashier left quickly."
good,Made you work hard with little pay little hours no benifits or a chance of moving up in the company fast paced and stressful especially when dealing with customer service
good,"its a very stressfull place to work, there is no caring for the employee,they might as well have robots in the place.with the right people, the place could be enjoyable more of a team work type of place better way to make customers happy as well as the staff"
good,"The associates (in my store) are mostly all kind and while they may not always work together as much as you would like, they do their best to get the job done. Extremely low accountability, in fact, it's nearly non-existent. Anyone with any sort of condition will be excused for nearly anything in fear of it being taken as discrimination."
good,Hourly employees make walmart. Home office associates tend to lack in caring and standing up against market and regional teams who discriminate against hourly employees.
good,"Working for Walmart is a great opportunity, but being a single parent Walmart isn’t flexible enough with your hours. I was put working late hours, 2pm to 11pm with NO weekend day off. Sadly I am not able to work those hours anymore."
good,"working at Walmart was fun until we got a new store manager. working at Walmart isn't hard, its an easy job. customer services are key, gotta know how to handle all situations."
good,"A empresa em si é boa, só não o suficiente para com seus trabalhadores, poucos investimentos para seus profissionais..."
good,Some of the managers will play favorites. But overall it’s a good place to work. It’s hard work and sometimes they push you to your breaking point but it can also be fun
good,"Well some Walmart's are fun  to work at and are great but most of them have to many managers an supervisors. Others have good managers, I do know working at one in California isn't very good I know from personal experience. I don't mind working at Walmart but it has to have good management."
good,"-The usual work day is fairly long, about 12-14 hours minimum depending on your shift and the work is fun and changes daily. There is always a new task to learn and overcome. Working with your associates can be challenging, but helping them to learn and overcome obstacles is enjoyable."
good,"Generally a decent work place depending on managers, half way through my first year of work the Assistant manager that over looked my department changed for the worse. Often rescheduled you without permission or notice."
good,Es un lugar donde puedes aprender nuevas cosas y satisfacción propia
good,Walmart is a good place to work but our management team is burned out and it affect our store’s morale. Our new store manager is a leader and avoids problems when they arise.
good,"The only person on afternoon shift because everyone else gets off early. At this point I could get frustrated, but what good would come from it. Help who you can with a smile, it's a way to put others before yourself. Even if they seem mean and impatience show respect in the face of disrespect to keep a clear conscious."
good,"It can have its moments, and I've enjoyed some days, but overall I'd say I'm more stressed than not. It's not even the job, it's the people that I work with or the customers."
good,The company used to be for associates and customers.  Now they do not care for the employees at all.  Its about how much money they can save and put back in there pockets.  They have no aspects about associates lives any more its all Walmart or you don't get hours.  You are expected to put them first and not care that your an single parent with little help.  Either you play there way or don't get hours.  I have been an 15 year employee that is actively seeking new employment because they have little regards to anyone but themselves.
good,I started out LOVING working for Walmart but office politics and the way management treated their employees made me change my mind. By the time I left I hated going to work every day!
good,they do not advance from within as much as they say. theyre very unfair when it comes to emergency call offs. over all they do not care about theyre employees
good,I Had a good experience working There although they could Pay Better .for the Work You Do But overall its a Great job For New teens getting into their first career experiences
good,Walmart does not care about the well being of their associates. They expect you to bend over backwards for them but when it comes time for you to ask for help or advice suddenly they do not care. Walmart’s management is terrible they choose between their employees feelings and their own personal favoritism. If you stick up for yourself and hold your ground they won’t like you.
good,"A typical day started with sweeping the store, collecting the trash, cleaning the bathrooms, vacuuming, but could also be crawling under all the aisles in the store, cleaning windows, stocking/zoning or even looking after the electronics section and unpack clothes and help customers when they need to pull you from a whole other department. "
good,"expected to work non stop, limited help while required to cover multiple areas. no chance for advancement unless chose by specific management by favoritsm"
good,"The work environment could be better. Since pay has gone up overall the job could be worth it, and management helped with some problems.but were seemingly too busy to help with any major issues with certain departments."
good,The only thing management cares about is the business. It is not run with employees in mind at all. It is a high turnover environment with a reputation that is well earned by how they treat the staff.
good,They over work you and give you impossible task times. Managers Will even pull you to do things that aren't in your job description and then get mad at you for not getting your own work finished.
good,"They do what they can to make certain you can't purchase the benefits and that's why I went there in the first place.  I worked there for almost 7 months, the last four being full time and then they offered me part-time core hours making the purchase of benefit unavailable."
good,"As a company, its a great company. There are many programs in place to help all associates. On the per store level, its total chaos!! There is no confiditality. Upper management is messy and do not respect privacy. They're almost like a gang..they stick together regardless as to whether they are right or wrong."
good,I worked with nice People But some of the managers not so much. The managers demanded respect but didn’t give any. I’m not saying all Walmart’s are like that but that one Sure was.
good,From market management up the management suck.  They do not have ANY clue what it is like to have to deal with the decisions that they make and what the people that carries out the orders really go through
good,"I wouldnt recommend this job if u don't want to work weekends or have a flexible schedule, they didn't offer benefits, very unorganized and understaffed."
good,"Coworkers never got coached for what they did wrong; they always get away with stuff."
good,"The store was an all around mess, lack of motivation for associates and hourly management, no communication between salary management and hourly management leaving a huge gap in the process messing up the flow and leaving the hourly management to clean up the mess, too much micromanaging and not enough personal help from salary management"
good,I worked as a cashier and customer service desk which I enjoyed very much. However between management and bad work hours. I left to go back to caregiving.
good,"Wal-mart is an ok place but as long as you don""t have kids and things you have to do it would be a good place to work. they give you hours and then they take it away."
good,"Would be there at 4am to start process of bread and donuts. I learned how they do donuts, bread etc. Management was around but didn't help with much. Worked with great people. Making sure got everything done before end of shift."
good,typical work day is busy and you deal with alot of different people with different attitudes. I learned about the retail business. Management was okay. Some managers were just impossible to work with but other were very friendly.
good,"At walmart I enjoyed my co-workers, but the management at the time was horrible. They were not consistent and often did not know what was going on in the store."
good,As long as you do your job and you learn the way the company wants things done your job is secured. It gets tricky when the higher up manager wants things changed that doesn't always help the workflow of the Pharmacy
good,Walmart is horrible for anyone to work at.  You are not guaranteed any room for advancement and when you need help you get laughed at and told to get back to work.
good,"People were very close minded when it comes to expressing oneself. They strictly follow by-the-book & tend to be keen on discipline if anything doesn't meet their standards. Certain associates were favored over others in the most minuscule aspect. They do offer advantages to advance in career, but rarely occurs."
good,Management stayed in cliques in order to have no work to do. Not paid enough and heavily penalized for requesting more hours. Pay was not high enough to live.
good,THe bakery department does a lot of work and the greeters get paid the same for just standing there. Supervisors are always on you for everything. The managers at this location are idiots.
good,"always want more with less help, coverage, etc"
good,"If you don't HAVE to work at Walmart, don't. They care more about the bottom dollar than their employees. "
good,Days went by quick. Always busy doing something. Mainly in the back room or stocking on the sales floor. Half hour lunches.Management was harsh on their workers.
good,"Wal-Mart cut my hours in half after I worked there for a year. In order to get more hours, I ended up having to transfer to another department and take a pay cut. This company screws its employees over to make a profit."
good,management don't care bout the problem they just there for the check . they don't have hand going experience only with tell you what to do and have of the time they are confused their self. i been with the company for many years its not all bad but you have stay strong cause it a lot of favoritism show around
good,In most environments one is asked to do the duties which was intended in your work area. Wal Mart ask to do duties beyond your work area. Wal Mart would have a better rate of keeping employees if Wal Mart would treat the sales associates as equal as Wal Mart treats cashiers
good,"Its the best job to have under 20 years old. I stocked goods overnight while the store was closed and dirty, they did not clean much nor allow us to listen to music while no one was in a closed store."
good,Very nice place to work if different managers. The managers play favorites and dont mind if people they like slack off but if they dont like you theyll give you an awful time
good,I would say Walmart was a stressful job due to customers and management.  Management showed favoritism with employees and the customers were very rude on daily basis. I would say working for Walmart was one of the worst work experiences I’ve had.
good,"Work environment is good . However, was told by supervisor to process food the total opposite way the computer based learning told me to. So when I did it the way the ""boss"" said so, it was wrong and I was thrown under the bus. Management needs to actually be more productive."
good,"Walmart is a large company that does not focus on family rather the revenue. The company is great for an entry level field though they do not value their employees time, work, or commitment. Very hard to establish a career unless you are happy being entry level"
good,If you are a older person and you once worked at Walmart the will not rehire even if you left on good terms do to relocation. Was actually told I did not qualify to be a Sales Associate again or any other jobs I applied there for. I was given a good reference by Walmart also.
good,"It is as crazy as it gets. If your supervisor or manager sees things personal then they are after you. Been denied promotion 20 times. They hired less experienced people who ended up quiting in less than a year."
good,if you really need a job. i guess walmart is your only option. i worked at a pretty bad store. not saying i had issues with the people there. but everyone knew the store couldve been run better and more efficiently. guess i joined up at the wrong time. the store manager ended up getting fired anyway. also everyone around you also hates their job. so its not all bad. you all know you have bills to pay
good,"For the first year everything seems to be great. I think only because its new and you don't know what to expect or what is going on. There is a huge lack of accountability with associates and management. Communication is terrible. Multiple Managers telling you different thing to do . There is no team work. There is so much "" high school drama"". Managers play favoritism. If you don't advance in the first year, you'll have difficulty doing so. You end up doing the work of 4 to 5 people. feel under appreciated, taken advantage of and underpaid."
good,A  typical day at the work place was getting to your shift and having to clean up for the person that worked before you.I learned how to work with customers stock and cook using the tools at walmart.I also learned all the health code guidelines for working in a deli or any food related work place.
good,"The Wal-Mart organization churns managers through stores regularly. Managers are expected to leave when work is done, not when clock says its time to go. They normally burn-out their managers with crazy hours and unrealistic expectations"
good,"Favoritism was a problem. It's very hard to work a second job because of the uncertain hours. If you need a set schedule, your hour's would be cut. Bur overall my experience with my coworkers was great. My customer's became loyal and I grew very fond of them."
good,Working at Walmart was good sometimes there's a lot to do but not enough people my job was very stressful at times and management cared more abut the customer then the employee. the Supervisor was unprofessional. the hardest part of my job was working my department by myself almost everyday in the evenings. the best part of my job was the people.
good,I was only there for seasonal temp. I was not a full time employee there fore I wasn't informed of any benefits unless i became permanent. it definitely opened up a new direction in my working career as far as skills go
good,Great to work at job need more benefits and the salary needs to be more and more hours it’s a slow paced job but it’s a job that helps you turn into a career
good,enjoyed co-workers in my area however cashiering is a fast paced stressful job and indeed requires special people to be able to tolerate all the stress you may be handed by customers
good,"no raises for the past few years, no real opportunity for advancement and management threatens to fire you if you disagree with something.  Can't have a rational conversation and voice your opinion.  The only opinion that matters is the GM's.  The place is terrible to work for anymore!!!!"
good,"providing excellent customer service; stocking and receiving deli items, such as meats and cheeses; maintaining the department's appearance and cleanliness; and following company policies and procedures as well as local and federal laws regarding food safety."
good,Working at Walmart was very stressful. I was basically thrown onto a job with virtually no training. I was also promised things i did not get. For example i was told i would get a higher wage for my experience and did not.  I did learn how to use industrial baking equipment.
good,Depending on your location. I learned a lot about managing a department and how to do inventory and order merchandise. Hardest part of the job was getting everything done on my own with no help and being reprimanded for something I had no control over. Most enjoyable was my customers and co-workers.
good,"I was hired for just the Christmas Holiday.  I was cashier and it was a"
good,"1.	Monitor camera surveillance for suspicious activities and to ensure safety measures are being met."
good,"Walmart is a great place for someone just getting out of high school, however, there is not enough benefits for part-time employees or enough room for advancement."
good,day at work was enjoyable.  learned where items went.  management needed a whole lot of work and how not to discriminate against others.  knowing what I needed to do and getting it done.
good,"Days were busy. Customers were rude, as was management. It was always a mess and STILL IS A MESS. They don't want corporate knowing the store is always a wreck."
good,It was a great job right out of high school and I was able to attend school full time as well. Learn much about customer service and work ethic  as well as working well with others.
good,"typical day at work for me was walking into drama people hating their jobs. Every day wasn't a bad day but the complaining and the drama are not my thing, management also does nothing about this."
good,was always under staff when we unloaded trucks and they wanted it done in 2 hours with 3 or 4 people when the trucks were huge. also some of the mangers were not nice and on power trips
good,"It's ok to work here. The money is ok and it's fast paced. Can be very stressful. The pay is ok and you get paid every 2 weeks. If you have a family, it can be hard to balance both because Wal-Mart can be quite demanding."
good,"The Walmart that I worked at did not allow doctor's excuses for being absent, and they have a double standard when it comes to who is sick. Some people can get the day off to attend a parade, but if you have a stroke, they will write you up and threaten to fire you."
good,"Wal mart was a job I loved, because it gave me the ability to master my craft of cake decorating.  I enjoyed co workers and customers.  I put up stock, organized work area, decorated cakes, cupcake and customized wedding cakes and occasion cakes.  Dedicated to my job but when I desired to transfer my boss would not approve."
good,For being overnights it was ok. I hated the managers though. They didn't earn their positions so they didn't understand what work was involved to complete anything. They all kissed up to their managers to get their positions.
good,Working at Wal Mart can be stressful with the day to day demands of the job. You have to have patience dealing with customer demands as well. Can be fun at times
good,Clocking in and then you get a register assignment and that can change anywhere from every 15 minutes to every 2 and 1/2 hours if you get a break on time. I didn't learn anything from this job and management is either the best or the worst depending in the day and only a few of the managers actually care about you as a person.
good,"only a good place to work if your just starting out or in desperate need. the people you work with are great, but the managers aren't there for you, your just another cog in the wheel."
good,"Overnight Shift is not a ideal thing for someone who works hard and the other employees don't work as a team to get the job done. Its a constant beating against the anvil to be able to get the job done with a ""very limited staff"""
good,"Merchandising, stocking and resets. Enjoyed my role while here with this company. Management at that particular store, at that time was despicable, taunting and just poorly trained."
good,i would love to stay there but they make it hard for single parent with special needs children to work. other then that i enjoy the people and love helping the customers
good,Management is horrible. Its not what you know its who you know. No one is held accountable for what they do. They DO NOT care about their employees!!!
good,empresa poco humana si no es que nada con su personal
good,Walmart as a company squanders growth and does not maintain a high quality of standard for their customers or employees. This made it a very difficult place to work.
good,"walmart is ok as a job for extra money, but I would not work with full time unless showed better residuals. They ask entirely too much of their employees on what they pay. It has been a while since I was employed with them, but they did not pay well. I'm not sure if they pay any better now."
good,Great place to work if you are someone who likes to kowtow to management. Unless you are on someone's good side you won't be advancing in this environment.
good,typical day was stressful and was cuthroat your job feels like it can be taken away at anytime by someone younger that will do it cheaper. everybody is always fired and stressed out because they kept your hours just under enough so u cant get the benefits seniority doesnt mean anything there and the employee is expendable
good,"The job is not difficult, however, management is sub par. I acquired knowledge in retail and customer service. Hardest part of the job was insufficient employees to help out. Was terminated for poor scheduling from the company's part."
good,"Good place to work, however there is a low chance for advancement from within. I am seeking a career - not a job. If you’re looking for a job, this is the place for you to be."
good,Some points were rough due to personal complications medically.  Managers tried to work with me but at some poi ts turned out difficult.  All in all the environment was an ok area to work in.
good,I say if your good at sucking up to management then this is the place to work 
good,would have preferred to have a team of management that knew how to communicate. you are pushed in 10 different directions and it was very frustrating.
good,"Walmart was an ok job for me, until the company start making a lot of unprofessional employees CSM'S. Some days I would have a good day at work, some days I wouldn't. Secondly, it was to many so called bosses telling the employees to do different things which sometimes caused a lot of confusion."
good,"not the greatest treatment of staff, some managers were very encourging others were not. minimum wage, no benefits,and not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"dont count on advancement unless you know a manager. I spent 5 years here and never missed a day, I do the work of a manager with the pay of an associate. Don't be fooled by the ""promote from within lies"" it's a power play to trap you at the same level for as long as possible."
good,"it was okay, they hourly associates were nice but the management was a night mare. they were friendly and all but they just wanted someone to fill a spot, they didn't really seem to care about your well-belling as a person."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with the most. As far as the way the company, the store is ran I can't speak too highly of it. The human resource department needs some work, it's hard to get people to stick around. Most of the management was nice to work with but just chaotic. They didn't have enough people for certain jobs so they pull you out of your department to go somewhere else a lot. I didn't mind helping out other departments at all, that seemed to be fine sometimes but they take others from the department too, it happened a lot, then you don't get stuff done in your department either. Plus if you wanted to be in another position you would have applied for that position. Oh and not too mention all that computer stuff you have to do...I think some of the training is way overkill and just no necessary at all, plus redundant, you get pestered to do it and it takes time out of real work and then you don't get anything in return. Plus having to finish all of your computer training before you got a raise was beyond me that was stupid too because you get so busy on the job to think about going back to do the training."
good,The Walmart.com associates are very rude and offer no help to the customer so I asked to a supervisor. The supervisor started making excuses immediately and like her associate was very rude and offered no help. It seems that whether you call the corporate office or walk in a store in San Antonio Tx CUSTOMERS MEAN NOTHING TO WALMART. I am sending my SAM'S Membership back to them and will find other stores to trade with. Way to go Walmart
good,depending on what your doing and who management is the place is not bad. Pay could be way better. Stocking shelves overnight was the best position I found in the place.
good,"If the company changed back to Sam Walton's way of running the business the employees would be much better off. The management staff in my location is very cut throat and will throw you under the bus to save their skin. I enjoy my staff, they are hard working individuals who value their employment but do not feel secure."
good,"Walmart cross trained you and quick to hire. The most enjoyable thing there was you get know when things come available and working with customers. Also, get discounts."
good,started out a great place to work but changes are not in the employees best interest. hours cut not sure what kind of schedule one might get. not knowing what might be coming next.
good,A typical day at work involves collecting carts and keeping the parking lot clear. During my time there I learned how to move quickly while still getting the job. The management at Walmart were somewhat unorganized. Work culture was very fast paced and very competitive. The hardest part of the job was maintaining through the hot and cold weather. Last but not least the most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you get a break every 2 hours.
good,management was very rude. didn't give people a chance to explain themselves. the people you work with are great and understanding. just bad management
good,Working the customer service counter and the money center counter I experienced associates hiding and blatantly avoiding customers and management no saying a word to them. This made it an uncomfortable work environment knowing that people could have a job and avoid their duties. I did enjoy the customer service aspect and helping solve their problems.
good,"boa, me fez crescer profissionalmente, espero que as outras empresas façam o mesmo."
good,Trying to advance in walmart is not easy no matter how hard you work or how many requests you make or tests you pass it does not matter you could be the one guy who does everything asked of him and more and soon as you ask for a different department or a higher position they find whatever excuse they need to stop you even if the customers appreciate your service and you help make your team function or cover people back. you can show loyalty but dont expect much back in return
good,"I was suppose to be full time on night shift and rarely did I get full time hours weekly. No raise in working there for 1 year. I never did get evaluated on my job,"
good,"Walmart expects my department to get done with two 2,000 piece trucks by 6 and have the of grocery truck done with 8 people. Then there are no benefits."
good,not enough workers for work load. expect constant watch over from support managers. management complain about departments. You have to beg for time off and sometimes that don't work. you will not be able to get over time unless you are management.
good,walmart was ok to work for te work was very hard..u have to make sure that if u get hurt at work is that u report it..also if u do what they ask u it is a great place to wrok
good,"They only hire part time, so no benefits, takes forever to get full time employment through this company if you're lucky enough to get it at all. Not enough cashiers scheduled during busy hours. The few cashiers that are working busy times are overloaded. Hour lunches are a plus though."
good,"unless you are on great terms with the manager because you suck up to them, you aren't going to get anything fixed. you'll be the hardest working person in your department, but they will give the hours to the lazier and slower workers, rather than the faster harder working ones. i get told ""I can't fix your schedule by adding hours, nor can i add shifts for someone else to help you out"" the very next day she adds a person for a 3pm-10pm shift, then creates a 7-4 shift for him, kept editing the cashiers schedules to give them 40 hours, but when i'm full time, i was rarely seeing 33 hours a week since march began. Was told I would be able to transfer to a different department, and keep my full time, but got forgotten about and never got that either."
good,Its a favorite vs non favorite work place. With the wrong  placement of workers. And the wrong placement of departments that are a combination of two or more. For example seasonal with lawn and garden. The in between time (Christmas) makes for a very stressful time. Trying to do two or more jobs completely. And correctly is impossible.
good,not enough hours to make a living for our area.  need higher pay and more hours to make a decent living in the area.  would drive 50 minutes to work four hours and 50 minutes home
good,"Honestly, Walmart is a great place for a young person to get their first ever job and build up experience. They are willing to work with students, and it's a very slow job. However, if you want to make a career out of something, unless you want to be stressed for your entire life Walmart isn't for you."
good,Managers always felt like work was never good enough and was talked down to by upper management. Want managers to get the job done but was not giving the staff to complete the task at hand.
good,should be one with the emplyees because we are the face of the company. I felt like the management crew didn't care about the customers nor the employees.
good,"Typical day at Wal-Mart as a Customer Service Supervisor was stressful. Management breathing down your neck about lines, and parking lot being a mess. Some Manager would help out but a majority would be in the office on cell phones claiming to work on schedules. Managers would stress out and take it out on their employees. Yelling over the radio, poor leadership. Customer Service supervisors would have to coordinate breaks and lunches, maintain parking with their cart pushers, and provide overrides for returns, sales, and financial services. Will be told to follow policy, but when a customer would ask for a manager the manager would sometimes send a support manager who didn't know the policy and have them override a return, or they will come out themselves (rarely happened) and instead of deal with the customer would just make the CSM look like a fool and tell them to take care of it. also have to deal with poor equipment, constantly breaking and waiting for days for Cooperate to approve to fix things."
good,cashier should be able to sit down in chair like audi. it was busy often and you'll be standing in one place for hours. i felt likea true slave working at wal- mart i feel bad for those working there.
good,"Unload Full Shipping Trucks of Boxed Wal-Mart Products and Pallets with products including Dog Food and Holiday Items etc. Customer Service work included helping customers find items in the store, stocking shelves to ensure that inventory is correct and items are available for all customers, and working with other team members to ensure daily goals are met."
good,All i did was ring up customers help them find what they needed if they needed help and clean around my work area. Take a lunch for an hour and go back to work
good,"You may be put in uncomfortable situations and management usually doesn't ""fix"" it. Customers can treat you as they will, do not take threats seriously. However a good job if you have bills to pay with minimal work experience"
good,I did not mind working here however some of their policy's I find are unfair particularly their clocking in and out system and call out policy. Sick days where not excusable for absences nor where family emergency's unless  prior notice was given.
good,"Management is horrible and they are careless about how you feel. The pay is good but the hours are inconsistent and are not enough. There are a few workers that are nice but many of them made the workplace a nightmare, it kind of felt like high school all over again. The best part of the job was the benefits and pay. Also, I loved my customers because most of them made my day a lot better."
good,"Walmart wasn't the best work environment, a lot of the times supervisors were rude. Being a Walmart cashier was very stressful due to the fast pace naguyof the job."
good,Walmart is a good place to start out when entering the  job world . Making a career at Walmart is definitely possible because there’s a good amount of different paths you can take and learn from for future opportunities
good,"Retail into walmart was something interesting, Walmart actually being my first ever job I applied for after first going to college. "
good,"I rather not speak much about the company great company to work for just bad management to work under. No paid vacations, no benefits, no friendly managers who can speak to us with the respect we deserve."
good,"Uma rede enorme, porém na filial não tinha boa gerência"
good,"Management is out to help themselves. They will throw you under the bus even if u had nothing to do with a situation.  Its worse than binging in high school store managers gossip about employees.  Most manaqgers will not even take the time to train you the right way, then they yell at you when you do it wrong.  There are some good managers and associates but for the most part not so much.  I would only go back if I was desperate."
good,"They treat you like a number not a person, nothing that you do will ever be good enough for them. You are replaceable and they make it well known to each employee."
good,"Sorry for the inconvenience but we are unable to display this information at this time. Refresh your browser and try again in a few seconds if the problem persists, close browser."
good,Enjoyed working there when going to school.  Was fortunate to have my school schedule approved by the female manager.  That made everything work for me. I worked there for three years as a cashier.
good,"Walmart wasn't the best place to work. Managers can be extremely rude and privileged; the nice ones typically worked their way there. A woman who I worked with unexpectedly needed a serious surgery, and the store manager gave that woman a hard time over this. Disgusting, if you ask me. Luckily for me, about three months into the job, people who I could relate to started joining my department, so work became more fun due to my coworkers. My manager, the first one, was amazing and hardworking, but the higher ups didn't like her ruggedness. The next manager I saw was very hardworking and a veteran in Walmart baking, yet still very very under appreciated in my view. I learned to stand up for myself against management when being accused of wrong/inaccurate things. The hardest part was maintaining composure. For a short term gig, I would recommend Walmart."
good,"It really depends on the Walmart you work at they are all treated different.  The walmart I used to work at they are ok at showing you around the store if needed but other than that because of the amount of work walmart needs out of their employees they don't have the time to walk around the store."
good,"Higher management talks down to lower levels of management. Barks orders and doesn't listen. Do not promote a ""team"" atmosphere. Lower levels of management opinions or ideas don't count."
good,"i loved going to work everyday ,but as of lately management has taken a nose dive .There""s no real team support and its like walking on eggshells, you're being yelled at for not doing the work of 30 people when your understaffed"
good,I feel as if they need to improve. Half of the employees are rude. Managers just as confused as the other associates. Not consistent on what the motto stand for.
good,"great job overall but management was not all of that, the new system to control schedules sucked, no changing schedules. Some manages treated you like kids and management would always over look you unless you kiss they butt."
good,Walmart can be a great place to pending on the management above you. I held multiple positions and was cross-trained upon my own request. I had desires to move up but was constantly blocked however there were manager that supported my rise and supported my desire to rise. I use many of my previous skills to be a better associate including cashiering which I done Food Service which I done organizational products and services on the floor for great customer service.
good,I was a chashier/sales associate and worked in receiving.  Since I was a college student I wasn't treated the same as the full time associates.  The hardest part of the job was  the schedule being changed a lot. The most enjoyable part was helping customers.
good,"They say if you do not have anything nice to say, don't say anything, and while I do have a few nice things to say about this location, i have far more negative to speak of. That said, however, i have decided that out of respect for the employees who truly try to make it a better place and help (such as the personnel department, and the managers of the front end)  ...i will not insult the store nor speak of the things i have seen that were less then responsible for a multi million dollar company which bases it's entire business philosophy on the proper treatment of people. . A few rotten apples can ruin the batch, but sometimes it was worth it, because when you found a ripe one, it was a truly wonderful experience."
good,"The work environment wholly depends on your co-workers and the manager. This varies from shift to shift. So depending on who is scheduled to work any particular day, both co-workers and manager, directly relates to the kind of day you will have.  I worked in this particular store for 3 years stocking the same items on the same shelves the whole time. It seemed that the only chance at any kind of ""Career"" progression solely depended on your relationship with upper management within the store regardless of an individuals qualifications."
good,"working at walmart can be hard on a social life as there is no set schedule, but you get three weeks at a time, so you can plan somewhat at an advance."
good,"I worked in the back room where the freight was handled. Good team. There is always slack to pick up from other employees that only come for a pay check. Nonetheless poor pay, no real job security because let’s be gone everyone at Walmart is expendable."
good,Store manager does not care about the employees. however lower management cares and tries to work with you however store manager is very rude and talks to people horribly.
good,Management use favoritism and cut hours alot. The majority of the employees dont work but are not coached because of their relations with the management.
good,stock shelves. I learned that I did not want to work in an environment where quantity mattered over quality. management was not ran well. It was diverse. The hardest part of the job was knowing that quick pace was the only thing the management cared about. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the day.
good,"Productive and full of all walks off life, most days were pretty normal  work-pace. The job teaches discipline, patience and most importantly excellent customer service. Management was okay for the most part, some were abusive and very pushy. Many cool and laid back folks, breaks were amusing.  The hardest part about working at Walmart is there will be days when the store is super short staffed and the store is super busy. The most enjoyable part of being a Walmart associate is interacting with people and the opportunity to make tons off friends."
good,Daily stocking of products and customer service at a high level. I learned that there are no slow days. Management was difficult with so many different managers daily with their own way on how to accomplish tasks and prioritize. Usually a happy place. many associates made the days fun and enjoyable. Dealing with the high n umber of managers. The associates
good,my job i didnt mind but i wasnt getting enough hours i was lucky sometimes to get 30 hours in two weeks my pay was fine but  i wasnt getting enough hours to make decent checks
good,"i want to change jobs i do not like accounting all the time, its easy enough just want a managers job to show what i can do, what do you want a manager or some one to run down walmart, well you wont get that from me."
good,"Typical day at work stocking freight, assisting customers, and management thru daily tasks and assignments. Hardest part of the job is not having the appropriate tools to complete assigned tasks."
good,sometimes annoying but worth the pay. management completely unreliable and useless. however the benefits make up for all of the jobs defects  most of the co workers are friendly
good,Walmart's work was easy and had a great environment. The management could use a bit more guidance but with a large corporation its understandable. I learned how to handle negative customer confrontation better. I learned how to leave the customer happier after they are presented with a solution.
good,"Some workers do not work while they are there. Standing around, doing tasks slowly to avoid additional work. Some workers bad mouthing other associates with no repercussions."
good,Its basically a job that allows you to pay your bills. I don't like how they cut some jobs when they are forced to raise the wages of its associates. I also don't like how thye do their advancing processes
good,I trained for a year to become a department manager and the position was taken by someone with no experience. I would never recommend for someone to work here.
good,"with all the previous changes at Walmart dealing with associates, it shows that they dont care about their associates but more about money. too many people have lost their jobs without warning"
good,Walmart was a great company to work for.  I would've went hiring in the company but they eliminated my position as a front end zone manager. I went from a cashier to a zone manager in 9 years.
good,"A typical day at WalMart is usually busy assisting customers, while handling freight and completing daily notes. Management need a drastic change. The hardest part about working at WalMart is having the managers respect you as an employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off."
good,"- a typical day at the register checking out customers and keeping my station clean "
good,"Full of deceiving managers complained about many things never got resolved, management pushed people out if associates performed better then the management, the only enjoyable part of the job were the other associates, management was not trust worthy."
good,"it is a very rewarding job for the soul, but not so much for the bank as the wages are not good, you have very limited movement of the camera, youre expected to produce high end photography but have no mobility."
good,Instead of treating its employees right Walmart would rather get new ones. No sick days and impossible to get transferred. However the work was easy and interesting
good,it is stressful so someone  with patience is a must! the job itself is not that bad the managers make it difficult though and costumers can be brutal.
good,Poor management no flexibility in scheduling. Able to earn lots of PTO and easy enough job. Got along with most coworkers and had hour lunches. Have to know people to advance in company.
good,I was let go due to attendance.  after store manager and manager told me as long as I had notes I was ok.  had to call in a lot due to my wife having complications with her pregnancy.
good,You work your butt off to make sure that all your jobs that is given to you that day is done before you leave. I stock shelves and clean the shelves .And learn how about being a cashier and they put a lot from people and yet they are very kind people and even ask you how you how your day is.
good,"All the workers are miserable and unhappy , I asked almost every worker if they were happy to work at walmart and they said non they made bad life choices and thats the only place that hires almost on the spot."
good,Managers depend on associates to do there managers jobs on a daily. Cap teams don’t follow routine protocol. Check out associate take time instead of checking you out in a timely manner.
good,"Solid communication to help boost sales"
good,"When i first started everything was fine. Once i started doing my job as well as others, i was taken advantage of. I was doing everyone's job while they received special privileges. Other people were given the credit for the work i did. Not fair at all."
good,"Day to day work at Walmart may not always be consistent, however it adds a nice variation versus a monotonous workplace. All associates are very easy to get along and work with."
good,Work there can be interesting and each day brings a lot of variety. Culture there can improve but all starts at market levels and it resonates at the store levels
good,"You are always being pushed to work harder, even if you are doing the very best you can.  There is no job security and only supervision gets full time work, therefore they can get insurance."
good,"i loved my co-workers but management was careless and rude. 1 cashier to ring out customers and watch self checkouts, any extra people for the front end where pulled to work different departments. No extra help was ever sent upfront but we were responsible for customers and front end freight and if it wasnt completed disciplinary actions were taken. We were told favoritism was not tolerated yet it was clear management played favorites extra days off or easier tasks. if we had overtime we were expected to cut it or we would face disciplinary action."
good,"A typical day of work there is a constant routine. You clock in, check your tasks and prepare for the work day or night. While I was working there, I learned about teamwork and how important it is to communicate any concerns or comments to management. Talking about management, it honestly depends on the person it is. Some managers actually showed an interest in learning about how they can make the work day a lot less stressful, and others didn't really care. They were constantly in your face telling you to kill 48 hours of freight in 5 hours. The work hours were also very hectic, one week you worked 40 hours, and the next week you would work only 24. The hardest part of the job was getting past all the constant high school drama that happens in the workplace and securing your position in the workplace. The most enjoyable part though, was meeting your co-workers and establishing a friendship with the right people. Also, the on-the-job training is really good as well. They will help build experience if you're like me and Walmart was your first ever job. They also offer scholarships to those who have been loyal workers and are going back to school."
good,Management could have been better but the benefits were great. I left my job due to an illness in my family that required me to leave abruptly. I enjoyed working there for the most part.
good,I enjoyed working there at first but there were too many trying to be the boss and not working as a team.  They wouldn't put me on days but trained others to work days that were employed after me.
good,"They are never happy, I always gave them 110 % effort in addition to several cases of frostbite to my fingers, caused by extended exposure to 25 below zero, coolers and display cases.  They are similar to Target, in the fact they never schedule enough workers to do the job at hand and expect the people that are scheduled to do the work of 2 people, and never give you compliments for a job well done, no matter how hard you work."
good,They put to much on one person to have all the hba shelfs stocked before your shift is up and if it wasn't done they got a attitude with you and make you stay over they would never give you any help in getting all that done on time
good,Terrible pay when compared to almost every other retailer at a Head Office level. Routes for progression but redundancies every year by the bucket load.
good,I would never recommend this company to anyone. No benefits are offered to part time employees. They don't care if you have a family emergency. Must provide doctors note to call in sick.
good,"The company itself is fine, but the current management of my store is almost untenable.  If the management was changed, my store would be great to work at."
good,Currently do have a a review on Walmart at this time. I still working and learning with the company changing culture. Every day is different and new right now
good,"Despite being hired & assigned an area to work in, you could be put in an unfamiliar part of the store for any time"
good,"For 7 years, it was a fun, fast-paced and challenging place to work. But in the last year, more responsibilities have been placed on each associate as staffing diminished."
good,"My work schedule was from 9pm to 7am, which was hard on my family life but you do what you have to when you have bills to pay. Working at Walmart was basic , it was what i like to call mediocre. Typical work day consisted of stocking shelves and cleaning up after yourself, other employers were friendly but mostly we all kept to our self's considering we had a basic time limit to our area of work. I liked management because they were very understanding even when i had to leave unexpectedly. The hardest part of my job was the fact that I'm short and there were plenty of high places that took extra time to grab a ladder and place stock which would slow me down. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in such an easy going environment, The people were friendly for the most part and the breaks were perfectly timed and timed accordingly. I loved my hour lunch."
good,great place to be if you want to stay busy. managers are never around when you need them. you work unsupervised for long periods of time but theres nothing wrong with that. coworkers aren't dependable and its every man for himself.
good,"Overall good place should make more money an hour for veteran associates,  better communication skills with some management  more pro time  we have to earn it none is given for hard work"
good,"As a Stocker for Walmart you are expected to be very fast paced and aware. "
good,"agradável "
good,Wal mart can be a great place to work as long as your management team is great. I would usually recommend wal mart to anyone because the benefits are good.
good,it was fun to work for but hours cut down to where I wasn't even on the schedule for a week. cant pay bills like that. stressful co workers and some management
good,Although i thought i was to stock shelves in an orderly way which they were always messed up i tried to organize them they said i was taking to much time to do so.
good,"As Fresh supervisor in a Walmart neighborhood market I have no complaints the job is really easy. "
good,A billion dollar company that don't respect the employees or value the work that we do. Their bottom line is money  $$ . That's all that matters ! I use to love walmart .
good,was a stressful job with little to no help . when you have a problem management team does not step up to help you . market team is also of no help. they think everything is a joke. dont accept doctors notes nor light duty restrictions
good,Es un lugar en el que el ambiente de trabajo es muy estresante existe el abuso de autoridad por parte de los jefes de departamento y gerencia demás de que no se paga el tiempo extra de acuerdo a la ley y limitan los permisos de acuerdo a sus políticas.
good,"I worked as a dairy associate at Walmart and enjoyed what I did and did it well, my managers were great up till we got a new store manager who came to conquer and change everything."
good,since I have been working at Walmart I have dealt with verbal abuse from both costumers and management. My managers want us to my robots and always be happy even when we are being yelled at for no reason. I have gotten in trouble many time just because someone didn't like my personality. Workers at Walmart have to strive to make everyone happy even and get in trouble if we don't succeed. I definitely wouldn't recommend working for Walmart.
good,I have been at Walmart for almost 6 years I love the people I work with and most of the managers are fair and will work with you there are some however who play favorites and don't follow policy they say there is open door policy but certain management will retaliate if you report something just do your work and you should be fine I still want to work for walmart just need regular hours and more money
good,leave walmart when you fine something better . the management is really poor which is a mane reason why i left i feel like im better off finding something better
good,Managment is not very professional.  There is a lot more concern for self-betterment than store betterment and lack of comradery at the particular location I was employed at.
good,"Job is okay for those who are in college, elderly, and have no other option to work anywhere else. Walmart is not a place I do not see as a long term goal for me, but somebody else may like it."
good,Personally i felt that Walmart was not mentally challenging enough for me. It is good for someone who does not wish to go further in any career if they are not going to school.
good,"I stood at a cash register for a couple hours a day and had a lot of down time. I learned how to bag groceries effectively and how to make short conversations with people. "
good,"I worked for a couple of months, but I would not recommend working for Walmart unless you like standing on your feet long hour and little pay. They also hire part time only and you have to work for a full year to get ANY benefits. They training is quite good and you get knowledge about safety rules which is great. I wish for better pay and some medical benefits after four to six months. I work at a store that I never shop at, so telling customers where items was located is challenging. Not a great experience for me."
good,"Worked in the shoe department, no complaints.  Enjoyed my time there but hours were too long - daily. Worked full time hours and received no benefits."
good,All depends on the management that each store has there’s always a big turn over with employees. Depends on the job that you are doing and if your manager likes you how long you will stay
good,I liked working at Walmart because you got to meet someone new everyday.  I met people from all over the world and it was truly an amazing experience to witness different cultures.
good,"Working at Walmart was interesting in that you never knew what you were going to end up doing on a day to day basis. It helps if you are easily flexible between knowing how to run the front end cash registers, including self checkout, and also knowing how to run garden center. The only downside is if you don't know how, you are given what could be called a crash course on how to do it and then are left by yourself."
good,"Clock in, get my talk man and headset and head to the startup area, learned how to stack items efficiently on top of each other without breaking or damaging products. The hardest part of the job would of been having to keep up a constant pace for a 10 hour shift due to the trips you were on had to be done in a certain amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people working there with me, everyone was so kind and hardworking and willing to help if you ever needed it."
good,"HR policies are bad with no regard for employees, benefit company only and result in staff turnover. Employees are treated as a liability and are not regarded as a valuable asset"
good,"Came into work, walked off my area to see what errors that need to be corrected. Than head to the office to pull reports to see what my sales are for total store and check my area sales and also I would check OSCA for my area and I would get with my Dept. Manager are relay the info I have collected and hand them their daily notes."
good,"I have no good reviews for Walmart, management is horrible and don't solve problems, take advantage of hard workers, as well as underpay their hard working employees"
good,They don’t make the schedules so they’re every random. You have only 9 sick day for 6 months and it doesn’t matter if you have a doctors note or not. There’s no discounts or benefits unless you are full time.
good,"very stressful due to customers coming in with attitude and very demanding, there some days you get very nice customers that appreciate your service but most the time you get rude impatient customer everyday"
good,"When I started with Walmart several years ago the support was in place to provide a functional customer service experience, since then scheduling cut backs have made this impossible."
good,"Managers seem like they have no training, talk to associates any kind of way, not professional AT ALL and when you report it to another superior you get reprimanded for it."
good,"Seemed that managers played favorites "
good,With this company there is no typical day. In a days time you can be asked to work in several different areas of the store. In some cases asked to work at a different location.
good,"Wal-Mart is very inflexible with scheduling. At first, they get your availability right for the first couple months, but then the computer cuts hours or schedules over or past your availability."
good,"I don't think Walmart employees will exist by the time you read this but the work is very easy but there should be more first person training by managers because fellow ""associates"" sometimes don't understand what it is they are doing. This could save time."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the job and people very much here. However, management has a very high turn over and they have an overall lack of leadership and communication skills."
good,"You will get treated poorly by customers because its Wal-Mart."
good,"I've worked for Walmart almost all my work experience. It's a great job for someone starting out. Because working at the store is one of the most stable jobs you'll ever have. I can say that your co-workers will be some of the best people you'll ever work with. And they come like a second family. If you have work experience with Walmart it's easy to get back on with them if you leave. But I wouldn't suggest transferring to Distribution Center, unless your sadist. Then by all means enjoy yourself you lunatic."
good,Many likes and dislikes come with each position. I suggest learning as much as you can of what each department associates does during their shift. Be fair to your self
good,"I really enjoyed my position in the jewelry department. All my mangers were good to work with except the last one, who did not want to work with me concerning less hours in order to devote sufficient time to school work (working on bachelor's degree). Her way of pressuring me to conform was to use the constructive discharge tactic."
good,"They will have you everywhere especially, when people call out. No matter what your job title is. They do not train you for the job you are covering. They give you a speed run for everything. Quality results, demand quality training"
good,"Working for Walmart has been the most challenging place I've ever worked at.  Depending on the season you may work 6-7 days a week for months on end.  It has been the most stressful job I've ever had pleasing upper management , getting deadlines met each day."
good,If you have ever heard it before you can hear it again.Every job had its picks and chooses. You can work hard s you desire however if someone else floats by you end up tired doing the most.
good,"Tiring and stressful because you have to stand your whole shift, mostly busy all the time. Good place to work. culturally diverse. incentives and awards are rewarded out. Not really great in terms of salary especially for the work being done"
good,Walmart is a job for an upcoming young adult it really didnt provide what i was looking for in a job but i would get carts and do other customer service activities
good,"Depends on which store I worked at.  "
good,"Manager to associate relations are very poor in that particular store. If one was to apply to any Walmart, I would recommend any other store except 3409."
good,"Upon open dooring concerns of bad management; it's taken a year and things are still not resolved, with hours getting cut, hostile work environment and unfilled promises to resolve the situation."
good,"The job itself is fine and seems like a nice, friendly place to work, however, there were too many managers and not enough employees. I have learned how to better help customers and how to communicate better. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing smiles on happy customers and co-workers as well as making new friends."
good,"-stressful "
good,I am not reviewing anything as this is not needed on any level of work so the rest of this is just filler so i can finish uploading my resumes anyways.
good,Grateful to have a job but upset that I am considered a part time employee when I work a full time schedule. The team work has been enjoyable and I've managed to build good relationships.
good,You can learn a lot about the business but you will work to many hours to maintain any type of a family life. You get a rotation  and depending on the store manager you may follow your time on or not. A lot of your day is follow up work and planning meetings.
good,"Staff chose favoritism in the employees, Poor attitudes, Staff was not friendly at all, some cashiers would be missing from registers with long lines leaving the customers unsatisfied."
good,Not a bad place to work just poor management made it difficult to stay. I liked the job it was fast pasted and kept me busy. I don't feel like the management at my store took there job very serious.
good,"- A typical day at work includes zoning, doing freight, and making sure customers don't completely destroy everything. Which they do. You will fold the same shirts and pick up the same toy out of the floor maybe 3-5 times a day. You will find a lot of stolen merchandise. Just take it to claims."
good,they let people get away with things they should have been fired fir to long management didn't care unless uper management was there that when they wanted us to do the right thing
good,its an ok place to work its getting bills paid I did not like all of the managers some of them did as they were supposed to but some didn't they didn't adhere to the rules.
good,"management was bad and they didn't really work around school schedules or family emergencies. customers were ridiculous as well, and the working environment was not good."
good,"If it wasn't for the poor management at the Wal-Mart I worked at, I would have loved it. But, if you weren't a favorite of the management, they not picked and looked for reasons to get rid of you no matter how hard you worked and proved yourself to them while their favorites would idle around, take long breaks and lunches, and didn't do their part at all. It also seems like they are hiring and firing people constantly just to cycle people through and not have to give anyone full time status or benefits."
good,uma empresa agradavel de trabalhar. mas nao recomendo para outros trabalhadores. gestão baixa.desatentos. sem muito o que reclamar.
good,"Was a cashier at Walmart. My duties were to cashier, do carry out, and do carts. My Co-workers are friendly and very supportive, but the managements is poor."
good,I do not desire to write a review for this company. This could cause issues if I needed a reference or other communication with the company......................................................
good,"Walk to the store with store management and address issues that we can work together and fix. Come up with a plan and execute them together. Work with store and construction to fix any issues as they arise. Make sure store is implementing company policies and procedures, and teach and train where necessary to become up to standards."
good,"not a bad job but their management is too cutthroat and into playing favorites.loved the people that i worked with, they were all great and did their jobs well."
good,"It is just a place to work that pays decent. Work environment, conditions, management, is terrible. Very stressful environment. Management treats employees terrible."
good,I worked there for over 2 years. And I have seen people come and go. And if you aren't a good buddy with a manager then you don't get a promotion and they try to get rid of you.
good,"A typical day working at Walmart could be very busy. You defiantly will learn something new everyday, and the management really dont't care. Hardest part could be the rude customers or the upset ones."
good,"Working at Walmart is exhausting. Everyday we are short staffed and loaded with more and more responsibilities. When someone quits they tend to hire no one in their place. Management does not stand up for their employees like other places of business. "
good,"Fast paced work environment, Fun co-workers, and great customers. The management was very poor with communication by getting their instructions and demands out in a negative way."
good,It was a ok place to work at. i didnt let u have much of a life outside of work they tried to work u like all hours of the day with noting left to do. alot of times i never even got  my 15 minute brakes.
good,The management is not very good and we don’t get paid enough for working overnight we don’t get holiday pay and it’s unprofessional they worry about your personal business than doing work
good,"Walmart will work you to death and not be willing to pay you for it. The management is bad and they show favoritism. They expect you to give your life to the company, but get mad when you try to maintain your own life."
good,"Typical days at Walmart as a cashier, are very busy and you have to keep an eye out for any shoplifting whether it's purposely or accidentally. "
good,Managers do not communicate well with each other. I do enjoy working with most of the people. Manager stresses everyone out that things need to be done as fast as they can with minimal staff.
good,I love the environment but the work they have you do on a nightly bases isn't worth the pay you get. I've been wit the company for almost three years and i've only got one raise. They have me do other jobs that isn't my title and they put me in others position too make up for others who don't do or can't get there job done. Which puts my job on the back burner and makes me have too rush too get it done by the end of the week.
good,Very good place to work if you know the people and if the managers care to work with you and actually give you hours and doesnt favor certain associates
good,"Not a great place to work, but it's a job.  I worked in TLE (Tire Lube Express).  Walmart nickles and dimes everyone, including their employees.  As of this writing, ""no overtime"" has been management's catch phrase in the store I work at.  If you work overtime, they make you knock it off on your lunch hour.  Also, they don't pay time and a half on government holidays."
good,"Incredibly poor work-life balance with poor management. Walmart is a company where your quality of life heavily depends on the store you work at and the market you're in. Great corporate ideals and direction, however, the company is so large that the direction and motivation is lost in communication."
good,you may want to do the best of your ability and want to succeed but you cant force anyone including management i always gave 110% in anything and everything that i have done but when it came down to helping customers my supervisors and or managers gave me a difficult time
good,I like it because the job pays very well. But I hate it because there is poor communication between management and the staff like me. They are very inconsiderate. They constantly hound you. They crack the whip on stockers constantly. They don't work with your schedule at all. They yell at you for the tiniest mistakes. They have an open door policy where you can talk and tell them your complaints and trouble and supposed to ne comfortable doing it. But sadly some managers just tell constantly so you can't feel comfortable going to them. I domt recommend working here if you constantly want to be stressed and get yelled at.
good,"Working for Walmart was a good job to get your foot in the door but they required to much for any one employee to handle on his or her own, they also didn't have be enough employees to handle all the work per day."
good,I liked working at Walmart at first but it took me a year and some months just to move from one department. Almost the same amount of time to move again.  They needed the people in a department but the department was never open.
good,"On a typical day(night) I would go pick up grocery returns. Sort the returns all out while waiting on customers and also watching the self-service area.  I had to watch for people stealing things. Later in the night I would take the grocery returns back and put them where they belonged. I would wait on customers getting cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. Also I would zone the area and put up stock when needed."
good,"Company not able to retain store managers.  Managers are not properly trained, some did not know how to deal with customer service or the employees. "
good,"Working as a cashier ringing up customers items, looking for items for customers. Working at customer service returning items answering questions cashing checks"
good,I have no review I checked customer cart. I really don't have time and I really don't too add anything more.  the works where great but management was very bad.
good,"It was my first job, so i didn't expect much. I applied for a position as a Stocker, but that position was full. So, instead, i was employed as a Cart-Pusher. It wasn't too bad of a job, except i was outside in the cold, operating a heavy machine for 8 hours and had to walk to the bus stop because one of the buses i took to get there were local. I eventually fell on black ice and injured my knee while not having a car to make things easier."
good,I worked there for a few months and had to drive from jasper to canton everyday asked for more hours and they wouldent give me any! The manager was really disrespectful and had no time for anyone
good,"Typically a cashier will be worked as much as they can be when the store is short staffed.  I learned that in order to receive the most hours in this position, you must be willing to be used. Most management is only concerned with their bottom line whether breaks are given or not.  The hardest part of the job is pretending to get along with cutthroat associates who try to weed others out to get more hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people from all different walks of life daily."
good,"work at Walmart can be very fast paced and stressful at times, I learned to operate Deep fryers and meat slicers. Management could be very hard to deal with at times, but the customers were the best part of the job."
good,"I have been working at Walmart for almost a year. And I learned a lot of problems have been occurred but never be solved. Even though, we, at Walmart, to be train to do it 1-best-way. But rarely, you would see anyone do it. In order to get promotion to full-time, you have to be quite, and no complains to your supervisor if there is any problems occur. And if you do, you would get retaliated with no chance of promotion. Employees are ""plugging"" that what we call. And the ones are working correctly, never get promote, and cutting hour, and no chance of transferring to another stores. That's the reality, working at this Walmart for me."
good,It a good job but it's like a shopping factory. I wanted a different atmosphere. They hire from within. They like experience over degree for the stores. It a good company but can be trying sometimes.
good,When I first started working for Walmart I enjoyed it. But now after 4 years with the company a newly hired associate will automatically make more money than I make currently. The raises are a joke 2% annually no matter how hard you work.
good,Really enjoyed my time working at Wal-Mart however it wasn't the Company overall it was the managers/supervisors. Seen myself as a great asset to the company just wish the Mangers didn't make it seem as if Wal-Mart was your life only. They would tell us to put in time off for important days we need off and they still deny the time off request. Then they want to penalize you if you come in late or call out on that day.
good,overworked for a very minimal salary and no appreciation shown from the boss or managers. poor working conditions and minimal benefits. unsanitary and too much is expected for a minimum wage salary.
good,Entry level place to work nothing to stay at to long.lack if stabilty and job advancement .managers a unproffesional by showing favoritizim.lack of understanding.
good,"Empresa boa porem horários ruins , horário inflexíveis."
good,"More employees are needed per store. All responsibilities are left to one person which makes everyone's job harder. Management may need some work, but overall not a terrible place."
good,"Enjoy the customer service aspect of the job. If you love a challenge, this job is for you. If you are good at your job, you will do your job, and everyone else's, as well. Management will have you help other departments, but when you need help, it's not important. No communication or follow through in every day experiences. You are told, when hired, that there is opportunity for advancement. That is only true if you are friendly with your management team."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you're in high school but if you are on your own with bills, it isn't the best place to be.  In order to get paid a decent rate, you would have to be a member of management.  If you don't plan on moving up in Walmart, I wouldn't recommend you work there."
good,"dont cross the asst mgrs"
good,Easy going doing none holiday time. Depending what area you work can be chilled. Schedule can be sort of strict sometimes. Graveyard shift is for the birds
good,"I carefully racked shopping carts to return to their holding designated areas. These carts are controlled by a hydrollic type device that if over racking carts, can allow the controller to have carts go out of control. I had one or two occasions where the cart(s) got away and hit a customer's car. Even though there was no damage to the vehicle, I was asked to leave the company after a couple of mishaps. I was very sorry for this error."
good,It's retail but they really don't work with your schedule and just hassle you a lot. They say that they can work with you but they will fight you on certain things
good,"Usually, each day is extremely rushed to the point where with extreme work loads it was almost impossible to achieve every goal. Managers did not send help where needed or understand that due to unruly working behavior displayed by other shifts, our job was made that much harder, not even including the interference of customers."
good,"After hours and hours of mind-numbing training in which they try to convince you that joining a worker's union is directly damaging to yourself and to corporate, you will find yourself thrust into a high-speed job. No one is really happy at Wal-mart, and most of my management got their jobs by being related to higher ups. A teammate failed her duties once and blamed it on me."
good,"The job was easy, the co-workers were great for the most part, but management was very sorry. If you're not a beauty queen then you will be treated as less. If you have a harassment problem and try to file a complaint, the system only tries to find a way to fire you instead of taking care of its employees but that was just at the Walmart in Shelbyville. You can request off, set your schedule/availability, but on Black Friday they do not respect your availability. Doesn't matter if you have another job or kids or a car crash. They will schedule you and fire you if you call out."
good,"boa cultura, porém americanizada demais para os brasileiros, não possui benefício nenhum."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you have a quick paced mindset. You are given multiple tasks a day that would typically take about 3 associates to finish but are expected to do it yourself. The best thing about walmart is that the pay is competitive
good,"I have no negative things to say about Walmart. Just as a student I didn’t like how I was treated by them. I provided my school schedule so that work & school wouldn’t get in the way, but it seems as if they wanted me gone anyway. Example my first class world be at 9 am I would be on scedule at 8."
good,"There is a lot of miscommunication with everyone and the co-workers is  lack of respect for others!! The whole store of employees  need to be watch get rid the ones don""t do there job right"
good,"Wal-Mart could be a better place to work if only they had more understanding managers who cared about the staff and their families.  They schedule you like they don't care if you have a family or not.  No one cares if you cant get a bus or not they just don't care how you get to work everyday you have a different time to attend work even when you tell them you have family obligations. "
good,Great place when you first get there but after you start making to much money they will be out to get rid of you. Room for advancement if you play by their rules and make friends in the right places.
good,"I don’t recommend students work overnight. Pay is well, but as a part time worker your scheduled with full time hours, without benefits. Balancing school and work was stressful, resulting in me leaving."
good,"Too many changes in management, too many managers bring in friends instead of qualified workers, harrassment from customers and bad supervision, the cashiers do the hardest work and are harrassed by customers and other workers need more trained supervisors, too much change over non productive"
good,I didn't mind working at wal mart. The work was steady and fair. Management needs help with how they treat their employees. Wal mart needs to reevaluate their sick days policy.
good,"I worked at walmart in lawn and garden for 2 1/2 years, I saw many employees come and go, management always lacked the knowledge on how to run the garden center efficiently, there was always not enough cashiers in the store, the work load that was given to the employee that did work there was over bearing, There was never enough employees to work in a department at night, the garden center was essentially just a place for customers to check out at because of how the front end was managed, there was dirty/poor working conditions for the employees in the garden center, we would always have to ask for someone from up front to give us a lunch break/breaks, we would have to close the garden center at around 8,because we had to bring the cash register tills up front to be deposited for the night, there were always shoplifters exiting through the garden center and no loss prevention associates any were when you needed them, I could go on and on about how poor things were there at that store."
good,"This kind job will drive you up the wall from the individuals of management being nowhere to be found to Customers poor treatment towards you on a regular basis. I would never recommend working here unless you absolutely needed a job. On average the job is okay at best, the pay is decent to start but it has very little to no possibility for career advancement unless you know someone. if you are just starting out in the workforce it's a decent place to start."
good,"This job is extremely hectic, which would be ok, but I personally need something other than night shift and after nearly 9 months of waiting on action on this request, I do not think there is intent to allow me to move within the company.  I enjoy the constant change, I do not enjoy the other employees who talk, and take actions in attempts to get others in trouble simply to do it.  The management staff is somewhat effective, but is hindered by the rules placed upon them here."
good,"Typical work day consists of stocking, moving stock around, organizing displays or products; nothing too stressful"
good,Typical day is pretty slow paced in my department. The hardest part was working with a bunch of lazy managers through out the store that abused their power as far as they could. everybody was dog eat dog and no room for climbing up in the success ladder. The best part about working there was the employees in my department we formed a family-ship and looked out for each other as much as possible. Not to say that Walmart Is a bad place because I still shop there just not a comfortable place to work especially if you have a family.
good,in riverton managers will yell at associates on the sales floor in front of shoppers. As well as changing the “order” whenever they felt like it with little over sight.
good,walmart is walmart. so be prepared. just something to get caught up with or part time. would be great for part time but you can find A better part time
good,"I worked in the deli and if someone didn't show up, there was no replacement, which left sometimes one person closing. The management team would come do a walk through but would not help the customers."
good,it is very stressful working there and we are under paid with no room for improvement. So much is expected of you without compensating you. holidays are the worse we work so hard but get only a $1 extra on top go what we already earned
good,"As a working student, I keep my hours very open. My availability was 5am to 5 pm everyday except Monday because I have 2 classes. They scheduled me 11am to 8pm on that day which I am not supposed to work and I got pointed for calling out after telling management I can't work thay, please fix it. They said they can't do anything about it."
good,I believe this company would be good for first time workers.  Should offer people chances to go to different departments if there openings. actually give raises at the yearly review.
good,"this job was fun, had a great time working there, pay was awesome and employees are great, management team is always available for you to speak with ."
good,"Not everyday is like the day before, you do different things everyday. The hardest thing I would say about working there is the customers can be hard on you if they don't get there way. The best part of my day would be talking and meeting new people."
good,"A typical day at the walmart I worked at consisted of spending half the day doing one project, just to have the store owner come in and tell us to move it all back. The managers did not want to work with you to help you in any way. I worked there for 8 months and only had two people in management ever willingly help me with anything. The overall workplace culture was that of a high school environment, there were constant spreading of rumors? "
good,walmart is a good company to work for but sometimes theres a lot of favoritism and they give other people hours instead of giving them to you or they hire other people and they don't give you hours. its like they do it on purpose because they want you to quit.
good,"No department managers were doing there jobs, mostly had us cap 1 doing there jobs and everyone elses jobs with our job as well very stressful. Management contradicted themselves a lot."
good,Tu n'as jamais la meme horraire une semaine tu a 12h et l'autre semaine tu en nas 35 ! Le salaire c'est salaire minimum ! Et tu travail sous pressions
good,"went to Wal-Mart hoping to gain career advancement and become better off in my life. Was very disappointed in the outcome of my work experience there. If I could do it all over again, I probably wouldn't."
good,"it was a typical minimum wage job, nothing fantastic about it i didn't feel like there was any room to move up the morale was pretty low and i just waited till i could go to college and get a better job"
good,My working environment was always rushed it seemed like they didn't care about the quantity of the work just about how much we got done. The supervisors treat us like young children and are constantly checking on us every 30 minutes.
good,walmaart picks and chiises who can do what..rules should apply to Everyone not just some individuals..Some people can make up da;ys they called off but others cant.. Some people can work differejt hours than the schedule says and leave others hanging.
good,Run as far away from Walmart as you can if they try and give you a job. Management sucks and will fire you over the smallest thing. DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF!
good,I loved and I miss so much the people that I worked with on a daily basis. The managers were always inconsistent with policies and instructions. I tried for 3 years to move up and was passed over for less qualified persons every time.
good,"typical night work in many areas cause of no coverage"
good,"There is always work to be done whether it’s in your department or not. Days are typically fast paced. However, management isn’t the best. They aren’t even good for that matter."
good,My work area varied from Hardware Associate to Sporting  Associate and Automotive Associate . I learned how to mix paint in Hardware and was qualified to sell ammunition in Sporting department.
good,I love rts envoirment besides they're salary isn't justice for my effort and time into this job.also the people and managers are very kind and reasonable to work with too.I do not recomrecommend this job only if you are desperate enough to apply for and it will be a pain to work wkth.But they will coop with the hours you choose which is a benefit to you.
good,I really didn't enjoy my time here. I couldn't do my work the way it was suppose to go because of unnecessary drama in the workplace. The job always was short staff and short management and the work place was very stressful.
good,I was very thankful for this job it provided me with the opportunity to expand my leadership and management skills. I was able to gain a lot of experience from this company: However the way employees and even other members of management were treated could be very unfair and unjust. This store although not at all times lacked respect for the individual.
good,It's a job. You don't managers breathing down your neck. Pay sucks. But what do you expect from Walmart! Don't be a cashier. Work on the floor. Way better.
good,"Each person is expected to do a lot of work for not enough pay. I currently do the work of three people. However, it is really hard to get fired. There is not a big family/work balance."
good,"I hated working at Walmart. The job was fine, coworkers were great, management sucked. It was almost as if certain managers were miserable so they wanted you to be miserable too. Although I believe they have since left."
good,"Decent place to work. Just doesn't pay enough, super unorganized and unsanitary. Great starting job. Hours suck, no flexibility. Not family orientated"
good,"In my opinion, the immediate management team is not qualified.  They do not provide motivation to the associates below them.  They are degrading in how they talk to you.  My immediate area 1 managers are either sitting in their office or are missing in action.  They have an autocratic style of supervision.  They do not care about the associates' opinions, even though the associates are the ones that are doing the job.  The job itself is not hard but management does not fairly rotate employees.  Standing and walking on cement for 11 and half hours a day is very taxing on the body and even though we have complained about it they do nothing to rectify the problem.  There are some great things about the Optical lab.  They provide quaterly lunches."
good,it honestly a good place to work if you can tolerate the changes that occur without you being notify to the last minute and your hours being cut. Other than that i recommend wal-mart if you looking for growth and a changing environment.
good,"Es una empresa q ofrece crecimento pero cuando les dices siempre te ponen trabas, el ambiente de trabajo es bueno pero el salario no casi es minimo."
good,Fue bueno  de principio pero cada cambio de gerencia es mayor  te tratan mal  te umillan  delante de tus compañeros y clientes
good,"Terrible management who do not care about how you feel or think. The only good thing about working at Walmart is that the pay is good, but the management is absolutely terrible."
good,"Gives a lot of hours. Not an ideal ""career"" choice for myself, however could be a great fit for an entry level job. Pay was ""Ok"" but not something to live comfortably on."
good,I liked working at Walmart. It was unfair at times and I missed out on my kids a lot but it could of all been worked out. I really would like to work there again.
good,Don't work here for long term.  it's very hard to advance and you have to be your many years regardless of your skills I have many skills and yet still have to advance
good,Work better with people that have families. This company doesn't seem to want you to have a personal life. I am no longer there because my children come first.
good,"My review is from Brazilian culture but I think that it happened in other places. They ask for 200% dedication from their employees but they don't pay for this, specially to middle management level."
good,A typical day at work some days would be good... Everything would go smooth until certain management would abuse their roles. And another thing they don't know how to talk to people.
good,We start the work by unloading the truck and after we have to stock items on shelves and at the same time help customers which is important but nor valued by Walmart generally. The management generally is supportive to employees with respect at workplace.the hardest part of the job is unloading the truck which takes approximately 2 hours and the most enjoyable part is  helping customers and organizing shelves to make it more neat and easy for customers to find what they are looking for
good,"Mopped floors, took out the trash, and brought in shopping carts throughout the day and occasionally assisted a customer when necessary with customer service"
good,Walmart only rewards those who they favor and by no means is that hardworkers.  The managers pick who they want to offer chances to change roles and make more money.  This also goes for more hours to work and time off.
good,"During my time working at Walmart, I work with good people.  During a typical day at work, I know what to do each day but those things that come up which make it fun.  I have learned while working there that you may know what is needed to be done but you need to be ready for something to come up and figuring out a way to get it done. Because of this, I feel that I have gotten better at it. Now when it comes to management at Walmart.  They are good at what they do.  When it comes to the workplace culture to hard one but good.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with mad people at work.  Because you never know what is going to happen.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-worker."
good,"Opportunity to learn about Customer Service Skills.  As Store Standards personnel, you have the great opportunity to work with customers on all different levels."
good,"Lo importante que es la prevención en zonas , y la logística"
good,"On average great people to work with. But never sure of work schedule,new employees get more hours than older employees. Favoritism in the deli area but much better with cs team"
good,Walmart is not a good place for older adults. The work is overbearing and breaks are not always given. Also after completion of mandatory assignments I was not given my pay raise as promised
good,"typical day at work is being extremely busy, poor management when it comes to helping employees with breaks and lunches, people quitting all the time, too many customers not enough workers"
good,I learned a lot from my boss and other coworkers. I advanced within the company and was given the tools to receive better employment. I just wish they would of had more hours available
good,"Walmart es una buena empresa, lamentablemente quienes la dirigen dejan mucho que desear, cads vez.el.ambiente de trabajo se vuelve mas pesado"
good,"Constantly cutting staffing while demanding unreasonable results. Poor treatment of salaried managers, and it is showing in the large number of managers stepping down or leaving the company.  This company is failing to adapt to the changing habits of its customer base, and its only answer to all questions is to cut costs and d many more of its retail supervision."
good,Wal-Mart is an I'm job if your retired or in high school. It doesnt support the needs of the average family. Pay isn't fair and neither are some of the managers.
good,"Walmart is a excellent place to work.There is much room for advancement, they always made sure we worked as a team and my coworkers were the best and loved every moment I was there."
good,"Been here for three years now and the company's policies have changed dramatically... very little pay, cut hours all the time and I need a steady income ."
good,No concept of work life balance and the management is extremely unsupportive at the store level. Salaries are poor and the increments over the years are disappointing.
good,Half of Managers are rude and treat employees not like human beings. Need to care health wise about all employees never deny part time insurance. We matter.
good,"Walmart needs to be more curtious to their employees, stop having animals in the shopping carts where people have to place their food, and have more employees working at night instead of during the day when the big bosses are there."
good,"If a person needs a job to help pay the bills, be it for rent or college, then Walmart may be the place to work. However, there will be stressful situations on both ends that a person must be able to deal with in order to do well and meet expectations. Expectations vary between manager to manager and store to store. Therefore, if one stays honest and has a good work ethic, then job security may be a little safer."
good,It was stressful. Some of the management was rude all the time. HR acted like she was better than everyone. Treated people awful which is not appropriate.
good,Just have no time for family. I like the lunch hour and breaks and employees are nice. Clean compared to other walmarts. Not very well organized with some management
good,Overall some of the works move a little too slow to keep up with the many buggies that come through. It would sometimes get fustrating due to the fact that they had checked out slow. I learn to take a deep breath and calm down and be patient
good,My experience working at this job was good and pleasant. It taught me the skills of working in a team and being a good leader in training new team members coming on broad.
good,"Miserable "
good,"Cuenta con un buen ambiente laboral "
good,You can be just a number or stand out at Wal-Mart. I chose to stand out. Always did my work plus some. It was a good job and paid well but the schedule was very rough
good,"did my best I could while at work"
good,There is alot off interaction with people and lunch break are given half hour late. Managers over watch you constantly with short breaks unsatisfied with anything done right
good,"Working at walmart is a good job but however the job conditions are terrible for my position. We are underpaid, understaffed and overworked. Additionally, the management downgrades their associates and are just rude. Walmart keep sending them to management courses but it seems like they still not learning anything."
good,Little chance for growth. Management will disregard years of experience/education and exceptional work ethic/ performance quality if they dislike and answer to interview question that has nothing to do with the job at hand.
good,I worked for WalMart 15 years ago back then it was still a decent place to work and the they still cared about their employees. And had good benfits.  I think the discount was 20% cant remember but it was on everything u bought back then.
good,"Walmart "
good,"Long days required to get the job done, including sometimes having to give up vacations. "
good,"Worked there for many years. There is a lot to be learned by them, but there is a bunch of rough edges. Great people to work with. Can become easy to get overworked."
good,Great benefits and nice people. The problem is with the training and manager. Training course is a waste of time and doesn't prepare you for the actual job.
good,Being a cashier it's more of a part time job rarely did they give out a full-time cashier job. I was told I was going to get a raise after the store had open and did not get it until I was done becoming a fool associate which took me 8 months. Customers are very difficult at times and complain that there's never enough cashiers. Work is what you make of it keep a smile on your face and don't expect management to like you even if you try your hardest
good,"Good if you can live off of part time hours  very understand. Night crew all works full time hours, but aren't hired full time as there isn't a need ..."
good,"I was IMS at first it was okay cause the coworkes were really great to work with but once they quite, we got some slacks and they made our job more difficult then what it was already"
good,"My employment at Walmart could be summed up with the phrase ""That place is a joke."" I on multiple occasions tried to advance in the store and/or move to different departments of the store, but on every occasion they would procrastinate the paperwork or bring in a random person with no experience to tell people who know what their doing what to do."
good,Of course the pay is not fair but the most enjoyable part is the entertaining customers that you encounter. The amount of work does not equal the pay but great way to gain employment history
good,very fast paced and you meet many different people.  You have a chance to climb the corporate ladder.  Happy people and happy place.  Would recommend to anyone
good,Managers only worry about themselves most of the time they just wanna cover their own butt even if it means throwing the lower pwople under the bus....
good,the job its self wasn't bad I loved meeting new people everyday and interacting with them on a daily bases but the management wasn't what a job should be. They wouldn't hire me full time they just hired 10 new people a week and cut the other cashiers hours and wouldn't work with me on weekends because I had another job and church on Sunday.
good,"The best part of my day are the people I work with. Most customers are friendly, and its always busy. But never having a stable schedule makes it hard to plan."
good,no job satification  managers sucked check in then unload trucks unloaded pallets over 6 ft tall  worked in frozen people that were lazy were kept those who worked hard were not appreciated made miserable till quit
good,A typical day at work was very busy. you could never get any assistance from upper management. What I have learned is every man for themselves and people will throw you under the bus to make themselves look good. Some of the managers were ok. The hardest part was trying to keep everything neat because there was no space. The most enjoyable part was being able to help others.
good,"the store managers were such jerks and since there were always so many cake orders I always had to come in even on my days off to help with them. They never wanted to hire extra help and I was not paid well based on the 5+ years of experience I had prior to applying here. You get an hour break and two 15 min breaks if you work full time. That's about the only good thing about working here,"
good,Company has turned into a non work life balance being in management . All holidays are required which is understanding when your in the position for management . Sometimes the goals that they need to is not sustainable. Stress level is very high . Job security feels threatened most of the time
good,"Good company to work for though there are several flaws within the management team that could use some structure. Also, the turnover rate seems to stay at a high percentage."
good,"Deal with customers about 75%, 25% working in position. Long hours typically in the middle of the day. Weekends is usually mandatory. Black Friday sucks."
good,"as long as you came to work and did what you are suppose to do you will not have a problem, I was a cashier so i really only stood in one place all day."
good,"I don't know about other Wal-Mart stores but the one I worked at wanted nothing more than a robot who did nothing but their job. If you have a family emergency or get sick, they don't care. They want you to just go in and work, even if you are sick with a doctor's note working in the food section, no matter what."
good,"loved my job but management is awful and deceitful, will purposely  not review your requests off, won't listen when you have any issues etc etc. I'm 5ft tall 100 pounds and management refused to make anyone help me or hear me when i told them about others not pulling their weight with heavy lifting. When i expressed concern that my back might be getting bad over it no one did anything. it was all about us just getting done, with no concern for how or how it was effecting employees.  I now have continuing back issues even after working there... i loved being on my own being able to pack it was an enjoyable job most days. i had a lot of good employee friends and found much of my job to be good. my biggest issue there is that you are treated like a number rather than a person..."
good,"Enjoyed working there, learned alot - where I was promoted to  management - very hectic enviorment"
good,"Unrealistic time constraints, awful management with zero compassion to their workers, cant leave a job half done but you get in trouble if you do not clock out on time, understaffed and over worked. "
good,The workers got along great.. Management caused issues. I quit due to a manager micro managing and yelling. As well as threatening to fire me if I didn't pick up extra shifts that they could not fill.
good,"Contrary to what a lot of people say, Walmart isn't so bad. Only if you get lucky, and have cool coworkers. I was lucky to have them, and missed them terribly when I left."
good,They need to get their act in order rules constantly changing from day to day without notice and get into trouble for doing the old rules as not being told the new beforehand
good,Clock in on the computer at the front of store. Walk back to data center to check out scanner and printer. Apply security measures for entire facility.
good,I enjoyed the people and the staff members that I worked with. They just expected way too much out of one employee. Associates that worked 20 or more years didnt have health coverage. You were required to do the work of three people for little pay. They wouldnt allow anyone to be hired on full time so no one can claim any benefits through the company. They will work you to the bone and hardly give recognition for good customer service. They want me back but I wont go. Its not worth it.
good,Favoritism dominates the landscape at Walmart. Good workers are often over looked for employees who have relationships with management. No accountability unless management wants you out the door
good,"If you're looking for a part time gig while in school, its a alright place to work, otherwise I'd advice you to look elsewhere since getting full time at walmart is like pulling teeth."
good,Great for fast working people that don't mind lifting very heavy products all throughout the day. No air condition continue to stay hydrated throughout the whole day.
good,"I understand the company has to make money, however they will work you until you drop. The wages are as low as they can make them. The mangement style is haphazard and favoritism is rampant."
good,Didn't enjoy the clientele at Walmart. Rude customers and Employees. Management was poor and didn't offer enough initiative. I enjoyed nothing about this job.
good,Difficult department and difficult coworkers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the management and the drama of the deli.  A typical day at work stressed me out and caused me great annoyance.
good,Muy mala administración desde los gerentes hasta los cajeros.
good,"- Stocking shelves, cleaning stock room, assisting customers, cleaning sales floor"
good,"could do multiple jobs in the course of a day, some management comes across wrong in the way they ask for a job to be done or for the next thing to do is"
good,"•I would come in and basically work alone, co-workers always slacking and managers were no help."
good,under paid and under appreciated. no matter how hard you work you get paid the same amount as someone who doesn't carry their own weight. I had little difficulty working at Walmart and almost always finished my work on time. and if I didn't I would always stay later until the job is done.
good,"Working for Walmart gave me a wide array of customer service experience as well as experience working with and for difficult people.  I found out quickly that management has favorite employees that are allowed to get away with harassing other associates without repercussions.  Discovered that when personal and physical assaults were initiated by the favored employee and reported by the associate, it was not kept confidential.  There were fears of retaliation if the situation was reported to corporate based off of past experiences of former associates."
good,"I started out as a cashier, was promoted to Customer Service Manager, after a couple of years, I went to work in the pharmacy as a med tech later on I left for another job full time"
good,Honestly it depends on which Walmart you work at. I liked the people I worked with a lot but management never stood up for any of their workers. If you can't handle the literal worst people coming through and disrespecting you then this job isn't for you.
good,There is never a time when there isn't something to do.  The day usually goes by and it's time to go home. It can be very intense but management is very supportive and lots of open communication. It's a great place to learn the retail experience with ongoing and updated training.
good,managers and employees lazy and unwilling to do the best work they can they never have enough people on registers to help customers workers were mean to customers
good,its pretty good except the fact that it can be unorganized and its unsafe at times because we have a lot of traffic coming in and out of the store and not enough security.
good,walmart needs to pay their employess better for the stressful work that they do its not fair to have your new employees starting off part-time and then after 3 mos not hire them on fulltime that really needs to change and should have been changed by now
good,Walmart is just a large corporation that doesn’t seem to care about its employees at lower levels. So many employees there’s not much interaction with.
good,"Management rude. Say ""hello"" they won't respond back & if you tell them about a issue they come later acting surprised when another manager tells them or that you didn't tell them at all. I enjoy working there but some days it's too much."
good,"This job is okay if you just need a job, not really worth it if you have another better job. It all depends on the people that you work with that makes the job okay."
good,this was maybe the worst job i ever had in my life.  it was a struggle to go in and fight to get the proper equipment to do your job daily.  then started up a tagging system to rate your work and set it so high 70% of people couldn't hit it daily.
good,"I would not recommend working at Walmart. Holidays away from family, no advancement unless you are good '' friendly'' terms with management. I also would to have more diversity in management."
good,"The management is awful, we're horribly understaffed due largely to the fact that during your first six months of employment, you can only miss work three times. The fourth time, you're fired. No one can guarantee that something won't happen to prevent you from working. I, personally, am at my limit of absences because I have become quite ill recently. Now, if I get sick again between now and September, (it's currently June,) I'll lose my job. Other than all of that, the job is just ridiculous and way too stressful for being a store."
good,"I learned that Kmart was so much better to work for at that time.There was no Kmart in South Hill,VA. This Walmart store was very cutthroat.The manager made promises that he didn't keep.Some of the asst. managers wanted to know how Kmart was to work for.The store had very bad vibes among employees.I don't like changing jobs,but I was so happy leaving that one."
good,"The only good part about my experience was the fact that if i showed up every day, i had job security. Management was sub-par, and there was never enough employee coverage for requesting days off."
good,Use to be a good place to work. This place has gone to he'll. They disrespect employees and try to control your life. Your shift changes daily. They can change your schedule with out your permission and it's ok as l9ng as they give you 24 hrs. Smh.
good,Very busy place to work management was good and I learn how to solve customers problems and be responsible as a person the hardest part of the job was helping customers that's already frustrated
good,"Store #7347 was a drama filled store that has Assistant Managers steal employees overtime and HR is doing nothing about it. Walmart would be a better place if HR listened to the employees instead of trying to hide the corruption that Management has going on. Proof means nothing to this company, and lies, denial and theft of employees time are all allowed from the company."
good,While there are plenty of great people to work with at Southridge Wal-Mart. The customers make it a very unenjoyably place to work along with some of the management.
good,Not a bad place to work. You come in do your job then go home. 1 raise per year. Hour lunch break. Two 15 minute rest breaks. A lot of walking. A typical job
good,"Job was very easy, the customers were Walmart.com customers some had attitudes and some were nice, The management team makes you sign papers to cover up for unemployment benefits not to be paid if laid off. Has a great lunch room area, with a nice food stand."
good,"Walmart could use different management. It seems like the management does not really care about the employees or helping the people, they just want money and nothing else."
good,"Greet my co-workers and get to work"
good,"There are production goals that have to be met that are unrealistic.  In order to make the goals, hourly associates are sent home and salaried associates have to finish.  You get PTO, but have to come in on your days off to cover other areas when they're short on management (due to high turnover) with nothing in return. Sr. Management does not care about work/home balance. Meetings are scheduled at the last minute and you have to come in an extra day when you don't make your goal, (which is every week because training is not an excuse to not make goal) so you can't even make plans on your ""days off"".  Hours are extremely long and administrative expectations on top of everything else is completely ridiculous.  Pay for associates that move up in company is extremely lower than those that come in from outside.  Tenure is not rewarded."
good,"This job is good for short term employment. The pay is not enough for the amount of work you do and for the amount of hours you work. If you are seeking a part time job where you can enjoy every shift, this is not the job for you."
good,"As an experienced Manager in the food and retail industries, it is very important to follow company guidelines and procedures,  to be able to succeed."
good,Walmart hires great people but they are not loyal to those people. There is supposed to be respect for the individual but that sometimes does not happen.
good,Not really much to say just filling this out so I can look for a better job with benefits...but it's a good work place for younger kids.......thanks...
good,"Online is a high stress department with hard deadlines, fast pace little to no supervisions, few great management but store manager left something to be desired played favorites and didn't like to someone who questions directions, working at a Walmart is like going back to High school, if you don't get along with key management it's impossible to move ahead. There are some great employees who do welcome and help but they are few far and in-between."
good,Customer service dealing with other people's attitudes dealing with people not one's weight dealing with people trying to steal and also dealing with your co-workers at the same time
good,wal-mart changed  if you have little children or sick relatives this is not for you  wal-mart dont care about family  its a selfish company and it use to be groups like high school kids what one person can do the other better not try it
good,Good Place to gain experience.   Lots of diversity at all levels.  They will promote anyone one who shows a little effort. Management has terrible hours and unrealistic expectations.
good,to be a overnight stocker i mostly finished my aisle first and went out to help other coworkers to finish their  before a time limit and stock shelfs.
good,A typical day is me trying to do my job where a bunch of the employees and management are lazy and don't do anything. I am not respected or feel that my work is valued in Walmart which is why i wish to leave the establishment.
good,Wal-Mart is an ok job for people without a college degree. Pay is decent but not a job that I personally would want to stay at for forever! They give you 3 breaks which is nice two of them are paid for.
good,el ambiente no es muy grato debido a los gerentes que hacen lo que quieren con tal no los controlan salvo visitaspara evaluar su desempeñopero como personas dejan mucho que desear
good,All employees work together as a team. Management could use more focusing on and needs to improve.  When I was an employee there they would give last minute shedule changes . I left due to high risk pregnancy.
good,its ok to work there until you need help with something the employees are great and we all work together. management is not the best there but thats life.
good,"Not much to say, varying hours from week to week unless you have limited availability. No benefits unless you are full-time and the ratio of full-time to part-time is usually kept low."
good,The company culture has changed.  Management has too much power over other people's lives.  The company promises a lot by relocating them to the area and delivers very little by providing them information on the lay-offs and disrupting their lives..
good,management talks to you like you are a child or that you are not as intelligent as they are. It makes you feel looked down upon. Employees are decent. A lot of coworkers feel the same way of management. Could use some serious improvements.
good,"They will work you right off the bat. You have to deal with up top overall rude, angry customers. Which I believe people tend to go to release their anger since they can get away with it at walmart. Teaches you patience is virtue. If you do not have patience it is not a place for you."
good,"I loved being a customer service representative. The store that I worked at was just managed very poorly. I never had a set schedule, and I always had problems moving up to better positions. I was also denied any benefits."
good,They company is not good for families  If you need your always have a fuss. I would not want to work at Walmart again ever. It might good for other people though. Alot of people work there and like it.  It was not for me.
good,"Pace Yourself. You can move up if you want to.  You must have Patience with Customers, because many just want your job when they are unhappy. Management will over-ride any decision you perform as a company policy.  Food Department pays more, however there were no uniforms when I was there. Now you must wear a Walmart vest and Blue Polo and Khaki Pants."
good,"Too many bosses telling you to do too many jobs at the same time then getting angry when you didn't get them all done. I did the best I could do but had some health issues that they were not willing to accomodate."
good,"Day starts by punching in and getting to register beforehand and starting right away without setting up properly. Customer service managers are not efficient enough to be able to handle staff. Management not helpful, and are not easily accessible."
good,I did enjoy the time that i worked for walmart but they did not give you nearly enough hours. Did not allow you to do your job requirements(pathways). However the employees were great to work with and very helpful to new employees.
good,The company will  not  give you work a stable work schedule. It need  to hire people that want to work and not have a point system. Also look at getting out of PTO time. Offer a regular vacation after a year.
good,"They are very inflexible about hours, they management does not communicate so you often found yourself with contradictory orders from different bosses, and you can only do one, but you get in trouble for failing either."
good,was a ok job management never seemed to care about workers opinions or worker satisfaction. spent 2 stressful years on register constantly applying to new positions never getting to leave finally just walked out one day
good,"It's a job. You will be worked hard by five different managers and they expect it all to get done that day. Customers are awful. To themselves, other customers, and most especially you. If you have kids you will barely get to see them and if they are sick, don't expect management to care. You can move up if you know what you are doing and if you're a good Brown noser or make friends with a higher up. Continously saw a fellow employee not get promoted because she would not kiss butt."
good,"I'm sure not all Walmart locations are bad to work for, but this particular location doesn't give employees the pay and benefits that they deserve for the work that they do, and the management team are always undermining what the others have to say."
good,It's typically a busy day in the bakery. From icing cakes and cupcakes to writing on cakes or taking cake orders. I learned how to decorate cakes which I had no experience in at all. The management is fairly they concerns is not on the workers but on the production of the company. The hardest part of the job is trying to balance out what to do in the amount of time you work. The most enjoyable would be my coworkers we all get along very well cause we all hate our jobs.
good,"Management can be very disrespectful with the associates. "
good,Working at Walmart can be very stressful. There's so much drama and management can be horrible at times. Overall it's an easy job and a fun environment when you have co-workers who want to actually do their job and not just sit in the break room for half their shift.
good,management could do better in the way they deal with staff and certain situations professional and personal. treat every one equally with the same matter of importance
good,Working for Walmart is a job for high school students looking for experience before actually working a well paying job.  You receive the training but in order to move up you would really have to know the managers.
good,The job is more like a high school with terrible teachers. Most stores are understaffed and always under a hiring freeze. Customers are familiar with terrible service but still take it out ob the employees that are clocked in. Management will point fingers instead of assist.
good,My coworkers didn't show up for their shifts a lot and management was insufficient. Training was more throw you in the fire and watch you burn rather than training.
good,Good place to work just not enough money  the employees are good to work with everyone is friendly very hard to get overtime and they can cut your hours at any given time
good,I did not mind working at Walmart the pay was well rounded. However they favored men and would advance them more then women and would advance people they liked more then the people who deserved it. There was lots of drama in the work place that I did not enjoy because I would rather just do my job well then get involved with he said she said stuff.
good,"Walmart is a busy place to work, We have customers get merchandise that they need, and we stock a lot of shales, We also have a lot of  merchandise that we have to put up in a timely matter. Management  they help a lot  they are very professional.  The hard part about the job is getting all the freight done  sometimes we get help sometimes we be by ourselves.  The enjoyable part about the job is helping the customers because they come first.  What I learned at the job is always work your hardest and fastest."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of you continuously being called out of your department away from your responsibilities of the day. Also, the managers do not want to work with you or help you with conflicts in your schedule."
good,Never get to be in my own department. Management hire up does not teach you thing you would like to know or need to know. Over all it's not a bad place
good,"Pretty much what is to be expected, the lows of working with the public. Pay is not ideal but matches the job field. Hours are long, at least it was during the holidays. Ok job for a single person or student."
good,"My day starts by coming in to greet the morning crew. I gain new information on any changes or updates to our stocks and services. Planning out what I need to do to adapt to the changes and perform for my customers. Often due to my afternoons, I have to quickly jump on the center stage to start taking customers. Allowing my morning crew to attend to other matters that they see fit. Managers are often very busy and elusive. Unless a customer requests one right away, plan your time according to locate one. Adapting and being quick will assist you well. In the end you will make new friends and a new outlook on life."
good,"An okay place to work, but not for the career oriented. Your job is not very secure here, I saw people get fired for rediculous reasons. Management gives thinks away for a discount price all the time, the complains that our sales revenue is down."
good,"I did Lear a lot while working at Walmart   From being a cashier to working in the Jewelry dept , photo lab and being a toy dept manager. Most of your training is hands on   I did enjoy the people that I worked with"
good,If Management improves the whole store would improve. There isn't any momentum for the employees to strive for the best in themselves and display their satisfaction to the customers with smiles and greetings
good,"Great job as in I get to deal with people all day long. "
good,"They push overnight stockers like slavedrivers at the Tooele walmart, with little to none training you will be flooded in freight and not leaving until hours past your shift with no help from management of fellow associates"
good,No advancements unless you're there for 5+ years or you know someone in management really well. The hours they promise you when you're hired never stick. Messed up schedules and not enough staffed stocked daily for unloading.
good,"I couldnt believe how bad this place was dont work here if you value yourself, treated like by the management, and coworkers were morons. I had to write this"
good,i cant say i enjoyed working at Walmart. Walmart is a very unprofessional job and they don't care about their employees or their customers and its a very unprofessional work place.
good,"i worked there for a long time, since I was young. I like the company and the workers but it can use new managers. overall its not bad place to work.."
good,I have worked for Wal-Mart twice. While the job wasn't hard I found management to be horrible mostly. Horrible to employees and uncaring of certain things. Most of the time I felt like I was back in high school mixed in with drama from all sides.
good,"Walmart is a diversity environment. The management is horrible some mangers let that power go to their head , and they're very rude. I learned to be patient with my peers cause some can be very frustrating."
good,"They want you to work like your fully staffed but ur maybe 1/4 staffed and they expect you to do it as you had a full staff. Management are always treating your job, and they humilate the ones that have medical issues in front of other associates. To make there point across."
good,Walmart seems fun at times but not necessarily all the time. They not to big on the safety of their employees. Self-Check is the worst job at Walmart.
good,go to work have a ton of hours to do a week get rushed to do the mods and to do other work on top of that. Plus balance the backroom and doing my mods on top of that
good,Management  is the only issue and they don't know how to treat there employees the right way that is why the could not keep cashiers and customers were very upset
good,"Not all managers treat anxiety attacks the way they should be, resulted in loss of job. Very difficult to work when having an anxiety attack in the meat freezer and the department manager forces you to stay in it and it turns into a full blown panic attack. Puked on freezer floor and still was not allowed to go home."
good,Your told you're part time if your a sales associate but they give you hours like your full time. A typical work day is 8 hours and every now and then a 4.5 day. On average you receive 32 hours a week only if the store isn't packed you'll receive lesser than that which is rare. Good luck  getting  closed availability which is asking to work from a certain time and staying to a certain time for school or personnel obligations. Sometimes you might get closed availability then a manager will override it and make you start earlier or stay later than what you can. Expect long days and overtime for inventory. Can get short staffed a lot and expect fellow coworkers to take long breaks or call in a lot without any repercussions. And having to work elsewhere besides your department.  Be prepared to work all holidays.
good,Management was poor they were never on the same page horrible communication between employees and management. Overall experience was nice to learn in a fast paced environment but management ruined it for me.
good,"This location was full of unpleasant work experiences. Management was always stepping on each others toes, causing lots of daily task confusion. Coworkers picked and choose what tasks they'd complete leaving more work for the next shift. Customers were extremely rude and the store was known for theft. Had a previous job for this company in another location with a much more pleasant experience."
good,Loved my job than they went from 22 people on over nights to 11 and expectations the same.  Pushed people that were already giving 100 percent to do more but said nothing to the loafers.
good,"Wal-Mart was a great place to work for just starting out. Managers were kinda horrible with working around schedules and always hard to find. The CSM's I had when I worked there were bad, some weren't but main reason for people not doing their job good is because of the boss's you work for. Tahlequah Wal-Mart needs some help."
good,Working at Walmart was great. There's a lot to do everyday we have to maintain the dept clean and make sure everything is stock and price correctly. I learn how to perform great customer service move fast but at the same time getting the job done right and professionally. Some of the managers are very helpful they train you on things you may not know very well. I love the way they don't switch up things. They keep there work environment the same which is more easier on  the associate. The hardest part of working at Walmart is would be keep the customers please. Every person have different ways so the associates have to try different ways to please them. I enjoy working there all the employee are friendly and will help you if you need help.
good,This job is awesome for a young kid in college or straight out of high school. The weekday schedules are 4 days off 3 days. That is always a plus.. Pay is great as well.
good,"No se cuenta con una buena administración, las jornadas laborales exceden lo establecido por ley y las horas extra no son remuneradas, pésimo ambiente de trabajo propiciado por parte de los superiores."
good,Not the best place to work but it's a job that can get you by for the time needed I won't go back unless I have to not my first choice but I will go back to work for tbem
good,"The only great thing about this job is the ppl you work with, Management is poor (assistant managers)"
good,wasnt fond of being there. walmart is not a company that i would for  again nor would i recommend anyone to work for them. the system that the run is not fair.
good,"Walmart is a very busy enviorment. Greeting and helping  people from different enviorments and backrounds. There is always something to do, clean, improve so it makes the time fly by."
good,"If your not in managements little click dont expect to move up the chain to better positions. Busted my butt for minimum wage, recieved to raises. When minimum wage was raised to 11 dollars my pay went to 11 dollars. So i now make the same amount of pay as the brand new hires, with 4 years under my belt."
good,Working for Walmart as a customer service manager enhanced my customer service skills. The store where I worked encountered a lot od issues with customers and store policy
good,It was a great experience. The company is great very clean. However their is some downfalls such as ALOT of favoritism. Plus you need to be a manager favorite in order to move up in the company.
good,just as out of the loop as customers are in Walmart so are the employees. the are very unorganized most of the time and that's embarrassing to say the least. they want your life to revolve around their company. you have no life working for Walmart.
good,"It was by far the worst work inviorment I have ever worked in and sam wal.would be ashamed of what his corperation has become. It eats small businesses, creates an inviormint promoting higherarkey"
good,I got the flu but Walmart doesn't take doctors notes and I was fired for calling out those day I was sick. They claim to have moral values but it was probably the most racist company I have worked at.
good,While Walmart may hire you it is not the best company to work for. There is a lot of favoritism with upper management. You will be worked very hard for little pay.
good,rude and not welcoming the management doesn't try to work with you and your schedule. parking is always hard to find management is not helpful at all hard to communicate
good,They have you break your back tell you how great of a job you are doing. Then when raise time comes they give the lazy co worker in your dept. the same raise as you.
good,"Walmart is an interesting place to work, they have a lot of different jobs, and have great time flexibility. It's 24 hours so you can work there at a time that is good for you."
good,"Typical day was stocking and assisting customers."
good,"There are ups and downs while working at any job. The staff are very supportive and will help you with anything you need.If you have the right attitude, you can go as far as you like. With so many different departments I was able to transfer when I needed a change."
good,"Fun, Interesting place to work, meet great people of all backgrounds,  staff come and go a lot, placement isn't likely to change, not much room for growth,"
good,A typical work day was go in at 2pm make sure the selves were up to par and products were where they needed to be. the hardest part of this job was dealing with the other employees there where some who acted as if they ran things and didnt.. and then some managers who didnt listen to complants and let things slide...
good,If you are looking for work for the time being as far as being a student then this is a good place to work. If you are a older person needed somewhere to work to stay busy this will be the place to be.
good,Cada vez son más prepotentes y hacen que el ambiente de trabajo sea cada vez peor
good,I worked at walmart for 2 and a half years and was somewhat okay with what I accomplished there. Wouldve been nice to be acknowledged more by management and not be taken advantage of. For example training me in different areas and not offer me a positon once fully trained and ready.
good,"they don't help when you with problems they always come up with nochilaught answers."
good,"I enjoyed meeting customers and assisting them at Walmart.I considered it a challenge to try to straighten stock as well as several other tasks."
good,The company's management system is not the best system. Management is rude and are not there to help. They want the employees to do there jobs for them.
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart, wasn't difficult, It was actually pretty easy once you got everything down. All you really had to do was talk with a customer for about 5 mins, scan, bag, and at some points, stock and keep your area clear. However, management was terrible. From the fact that there were days, where I would get off at midnight,  just to go back to work at 5 am (this Walmart wasn't 24 hours) because they couldn't schedule was stupid. I had managers talking bad about other cashiers, and also the fact they couldn't keep cashiers there long enough so we were always running low. Plus, this Walmart was usually slow, and they wouldn't even allow us to bag for other cashiers, it was just stupid how this Walmart was run."
good,Management is crazy people are crazy and not helpful at all. It seems like they hire anybody and place anybody in any position. If they would get management in that care the company will do a whole lot better.
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart. Most of my coworkers were good, some were lazy. A lot of weird hours so not much time for a life. Only part-time because they don't like paying for benefits. Cheap company for how much money they make! Horrible cashier manager. She's rude, lazy and sarcastic."
good,"Management is not that good, learned a lot because I had the desire to move up."
good,Wal-mart can be a great or terrible place to work. It depends on store management and your market. Some stores have great care and concern for your personal life. Others think once you are salary you have sold your soul to wal-mart and you should spend every waking moment there.
good,"i can only speak for my store, that it sucks to work under that management team. They don't schedule properly and the manager is very indecisive. Also im disappointed in the number of people who have quit, it should've been a  red flag from the start."
good,I liked Walmart when I first started working there 5 years ago. Many things have changed since that first year. Many company changes. And working on that concrete floor has caused physical problems to worsen over time so that I can no longer work there.
good,"A typical day at work, could be on a scale from very busy you don't have time to breathe to yourself to just down right boring because nobody is here. I learned a lot working here especially how to balance school, social life and work. Walmart doesn't give you much of balance so you have to find that balance on your own time. There was a lot of favoritism at the establishment I worked at that really started to turn me off from wanting to work there as a whole. But other than that, every time I came to work, I tired to make the best of it and please my customers."
good,"Walmart, where to start? Walmart is complicated to explain because the employees get such an undeserving bad wrap. In my opinion, the company it's self has expanded to the point it is very hard to live up to the mission ""The customer is always right"" and still hold up the company policy. Walmart has the right idea in customer service, it just has not found the perfect way to uphold it. Walmart is a work place where you can find life long friends and retire a millionaire if you creatively make it a career move."
good,"Walmart is a okay place to work, management was bad. I think working here could be better if the supervisors actually was more involved and took care of their roles instead of lecturing workers about their jobs."
good,Ok if you like it ..needs improving to be great place to work especialy with management except for maybe 1 or 2 people in management...cant name any names.
good,The cake decorating was fun I loved working in the bakery some of the cakes where super cool I really liked some of the people I worked with and I had fun learning to bake the bread and rolls
good,"Hard workers are not appreciated and overlooked for promotions. Walmart exploits their workers and are not properly compensated for the amount of work and ""politics"" that goes around the company."
good,Night work wasn't to bad but you are on a tight time limit to get your work done and had to make sure not to leave anything undone had to get along with other employees
good,walmart is the worst place ever to work! you are not going to go anywhere with the company unless you plan on being a mindless robot.
good,"Working for the company can be very stressful theirs a lot of things that you are required to do for your shift. I  had to stock shelves, rotate stock and remove all expired goods from the shelves. Deal with very difficult customers."
good,it was cool to work for but the management is not good and they let you go even do you in up in the hospital. They have their favorites there. I wouldn't let none of my families or friends work for them. when you have people buying the alcohol and their a group you have see all their ID but there one cms that tell you dont have see all their ID it does matter
good,"In orientation you are told that the culture of the company is geared to its associates and customers to make their life easier. This is not the case. The job alienates its coworkers by pitting them against one another for pay and recognition for their work. Schedules are changed on the spur of the moment, doctor's excuses or medical excuses are not excepted, and full time employment is unreachable by 99 percent of the employees no matter how long they have worked for the company. The point system is virtually impossible to maintain especially for single parents. After the first week of working there I was already mentally exhausted from the retalliation that goes on by the management and the employees."
good,"the work environment with other workers isn't so bad, its like one big family however, if you decide to think on your own or go against what the management sees as correct you will be punished with either low hours or just general mistreatment during your work day all in hopes you will quit"
good,"Working at Walmart was difficult, management was not easy to get along with. A typical day was face passed working consistently. The culture around Walmart was separated everyone kept to themselves. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management."
good,"Good people , good hours, friendly work environment , although the careless management will have more job scared than comfortable in your work area . It is what you make of it"
good,I really have no opinion I would like to give at this time. It can be a good place to work and the customers are understanding. the work enviroment is not like it shows on the internet
good,Typical day of helping customers find what they need and I learned working there how wax floors. Management was busy a lot so they really don't have much to say to you but the hardest part of the job was getting a new store manager every 6 moths because they all did things very different and I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is meet over great Walmart associates.
good,"Decent place to work with great food. Most of the employees were high school students. Some were College. Almost everything was made from scratch, at least the flavors and condiments."
good,"Working as a Cashier at the Brownsville Walmart there was a major turnover rate. Poor supervisors with lack of compassion. Also, strict policy on calling off. Great when it comes to breaks you get two 15 mins and 1 hr on a full shift."
good,Just like in life there are good and bad people.  Depending on your manager you can grow or get caught up in the shuffle.  Work ethic does not warrant promotions.
good,"Not the best, but not the worst. I worked in maintenance. Its a tough and dirty job. But that's just the job anywhere. Worked 40 hours a week. Didn't have a problem"
good,"Wal-Mart was cool place to work at. I met some beautiful people working there, It was only one manager that had a bad attitude. Everybody else on staff were great people."
good,I don't have a great review for Walmart . They don't accept doctors excuses. It's hard to have a social life while working there
good,I worker with labor finders here and they where nice and clean but dnr's are granted due to one persons behavior and not yours in specific would not recommend this job to anyone
good,The store I worked at was understaffed and was not big enough for the amount of customer traffic coming through on a daily basis. Customers seemed to think they could always be aggressive and rude no matter the hour of the day. No backup from management.
good,"If you put your availability to work 35 hours you will get 35 hours. No matter what. The call off system is horrible, night shift never does their job right (not that its their fault, they give them an unreasonable amount of work to do) and then you're expected to fix their mistakes and do your work on top of it."
good,"Fun workers bi- polar managers that keep workers on toes.liked the challenge of putting stock up,but it had to be done by rules"
good,Walmart is a good starter job but nothing to make a career out of.. Mnagement is horrible and definitely has some favortisim.
good,Management needs work. It feels like they do not appreciate their employees. You are very expendable at this Walmart. Some policies regarding doctors notes are very ridiculous.
good,"Management is not fair in how they handle there employees, they have their favorites and are not ashamed to admit or show it. The job it self is not hard, can be overwhelming to start if you don't know where everything is located on the shelf. But once you are there for a while you just kind of get the hand of things. only real complaint is that the attendance policy is not enforced as it should be, some employees are late consistently with out any warnings or occurrences appearing on there account."
good,"Not a bad place to start but go in with a lot of patience. Make sure to asert yourself to your supervisors because they will walk all over you, and expect things that are impossible standards."
good,"I learned a lot at this job in many different ways. I learned how to do customer service in the right way, and how to please customers and resolve concerns. It stretched me in ways I never thought possible. I learned from hands on experience that by making mistakes it made me a stronger individual and helped me gain confidence."
good,Something is always going on at Walmart from not having the stuff to do your job to having to through stuff away that is need for your job.
good,I had an amazing time working as a customer service and a cashier making their experience fun and most importantly having them come back to Walmart. I would recommend other associates coming to work for this company.
good,I enjoyed working with my team within Walmarts TLE department. Never a dull day when you have several people to interact with and work beside.
good,All levels of management can use improvement. Middle managemnt needs a severe course in ethics. They are not fair when it comes to allocating work loads and pay. I find is unfair that someone half my age was making more than me.
good,"working as a stockers is hard work with even harder managers. even if workers dont show up for work you are still forced to pick up the slack with forced work, no break or bath room breaks."
good,I loved my job because of my customers. I would recommend better training and engagement of management. As a cashier I took on the role of my managers when they were not available to do it. Help associates when there was not a manager to do so.
good,met some great people and had a lot of fun. experienced a lot of different people with different issues and helped to resolve problems as they occurred.
good,All Walmart employees do put in a lot of hard work to get there shelfs stocked and It is very clean. Employees do try and make things fast and easy for the customers.
good,"My work here was short as a summer positions between semesters. I had little to no problem with the work, but the general store manager was infamous among the employees for having both unreasonable expectations and clearing out the former and effective management and providing inadequate replacement. This view is true to a point, but it remains largely egocentric and ignores the issues confronted by management. For instance, one of the chronic issues faced by management was having scheduled employees fail to show up on Friday and especially Saturday nights. However, on one such instance (isolated and abnormal for absentees), one more elderly individual than myself, had their spouse terribly sick in hospital and this individual was fired for wanting to be with their spouse. This was a case of no good option, but I believe that this was an extenuating circumstance that should have been worked through on both sides. On the other hand, I had many circumstances where my official training was told to be ignored and instead, new rules were created. For instance, during the remodel and inventory that followed shortly there after, heavy nights came an it was expected that if completion was not expected, breaks were to be skipped and lunches were to be shortened. Some of this was my own, internal need to complete the assignment I was given, but at others, it was stated by management. Efficiency goals are admirable, but not at the expense of the worker. In short, the employee is an afterthought for Walmart, but as long as you have that expectation, coping is possible."
good,"Walmart is not all its cracked up to be. They claim they are family oriented, but they're really not. I did enjoy working with the crew we had. Hours are horrible, and they make you sing a paper stating you will only be a part-time employee working no more than 34 hours but yet you always work 40+ hours a week, and they wont make you full-time."
good,"You don't get enough credit for the job you do, there's no recompensation for it. Also you don't get enough days off or PTO time. We should get all holidays off."
good,Walmart is one of the better places to work when it comes to the large retail companies. My coworkers have always been a blast to work with and understand the highs and lows of customer service.
good,A typical day of work consist of me clocking in the morning and going to the stocking area to prepare items to be placed on shelves. I learned how to display items that made customers more likely to buy the product. I also learned the importance of customer service and how it can make customers want to come back and purchase at your store.
good,A typical day at work meant you were running around everywhere. Management was very unlikable. My co-workers were pretty great. The hardest part of my job were the managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was break.
good,"The job is easy, but management is the problem. Some employees get special treatment and are allowed to get away with things that they should be reprimanded for."
good,This is an unhealthy work environment. The management is unwilling to co-operate help the employees. Compensation is terrible as are the benefits.
good,"Working at Walmart isn't like working at any other retail store. I personally think its harder. The managers want so much from you but your just one person. They wont approve overtime, they tell you to do one thing and then make you do another. If they tell you to stay an hour later past your end shift time they expect you to cut it the next day on lunch. I don't like Walmart personally but I have to work there to keep my bills paid until I find another job."
good,"days include cleaning, restocking, assisting customers. not a bad job and the pay is decent for what it is. only went here because i couldnt find any other job."
good,"While I did learn a lot about the Deli, the management was very disorganized. But my fellow co-workers were easy to work with, fun to be around and I enjoyed what I did."
good,I found my location to be ok. The people whom i worked with were great but the management was subpar at best. Advancement was not likely as they would bring in from outside before promoting within.  Benefits were bare minimum at best.
good,I dont know if this is for all walmarts but I put in my availability because I go to school and they approved it but still were scheduling be on school days on school hours.
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for the last 5 years, Overall while I was there it was a great experience and I had many opportunities. After I was hospitalized for several days they made it difficult to secure my position and my job."
good,"I actually caught on really fast on learning the daily routines and got promoted along the way. The negative part is the management is a never the same, the holiday season you  cant have off, and the benefits change every year."
good,I had a good time working at Wal-Mart because the people I worked with get along well with each other. I learned new things every day in how to put merchandise away quickly. The management could be worked on a little bit more and not so un-enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is getting all the merchandise done on time. What i do like about the job was helping out customers look for what they need or wanted.
good,It's a good place to work. Very busy and productive. The associates are all very nice and a lot of fun to work with. The managers don't go by people's availability and don't really talk to them and don't help when people are by them selfs.
good,I worked overnight at the waffle House. It was pretty alright the money was good but my body couldn't take being up all night 7 days a week on top of trying to keep up my social life. At one point I was working both waffle House and Wendys. Then I quite Wendys after I was rehired there because of the assault situation. I worked just waffle House then i got a job at Wal-Mart. I quite waffle House then i came back because I was trying to get a car. I worked overnight at the waffle House and during the day at Wal-Mart. I'm a workaholic I am.
good,Most of my coworkers were cool and fun to get along with.  Too many cliques there.  Management was definitely an issue.  They want you to bow down to them and kiss their butts...if you didn't you were considered a black sheep and got treated differently.
good,They would come up excuses for their lack of productivity on an already short handed skeleton crew and didn't approve my maternity  leave
good,If you like to be on your feet and moving around all day and helping coustomers find things in the stores and putting away things this job for u..if you stay working the time goes by fast
good,"working at Walmart was very stressful, between the customers and the workers everyday wasn't always good. The management team is not as professional as they should be. Overall this location can do a lot better. The most enjoyable part of this job is the interaction with new pleasant people, you never know who you'll run into."
good,Spent a lot of long nights with this company and it was taking away from my family. The pay was bad for in coming employees and the results showed that to be true.
good,"Good place to work. It's just the staff I feel if they let go of some of them that ""half work"" it will DEFINITELY be a better place. Besides the benefits it offers it's a great place to work."
good,its a very easy and fast pace job nothing too hard only thing is everyone isnt helpful and family like so if you have questions they just get an attitude and are sometimes rude
good,the job was okay but the management did not know there jobs or treat the employees with respect. and the benefits sucked.  the people of some of the places were really not very friendly or even know what they were doing most of the time. being trained for another position sucked also.
good,Good paying job! No a job security they let you work hard giving your all but you never know if they were gonna keep you or let you go. Most of the management would walk pass you if u had long lines and needed help as a deli associate that was the worst job I've ever worked and it wasn't because you stayed busy but because you had no team work your coworkers were untrained and would run off and leave you alone to run both sides. My last day working their I was left to close the entire deli alone 8-11 and the deli was open for business til nine.
good,"The job itself is nice, but the overall experience depends on your coworkers.  My dept. was super understaffed and we stayed late 6/7 days to get our work done. Often times we would be stranded alone with no help and tons of customers. Basically, if anyone ever called in or it was a moderately busy day, you could expect to stay at least an hour or two late. I personally applied for 30 hours a week, but ended up working 40+."
good,"Walmart was a job not a career, I wouldn't work at Walmart again; I didn't care for working for Walmart. Work their people to like crazy with low pay; pay women less than men even if the same job is done. I have no more to say."
good,The company used to be all about their employees but that has changed drastically over the years. They push you to do more work in other areas of the store or other departments then get mad and try to reprimand you when your own area isnt up to par. Lack of understanding from the management team.
good,I was a over night stoker. Sometime we didn't get our breaks. Everyone was constantly getting yelled at for not unloading boxes fast enough. We always had everything done when it needed to be done. People kept Quieting because of the harsh management meaning everyone had to do their work plus whoever had walked out before our shift was up.
good,"A empresa e um lugar agradavel de se trabalhar ,mas deveria dar mais oportunidades de crescimento aos funcionarios ,pois tem muita rotatividade de pessoas"
good,"i worked at walmart for a little over a month or so . I had  problems getting ahold of management and that complicated how much i was actually capable i was to do the job it was easy , but when i needed help even mentioned i needed help and my supervisor just left me and went to lunch."
good,"The management manipulates everything. I have management experience and when I first started I totally wanted to advance and now there is no way i would consider it. Everything is our fault. I could be standing in the deli do my job and the ceiling could fall in on me and they would find a way to blame me and my co-workers. If you just shut up and agree to everything that is thrown your way, you will do fine. If you have an opinion as I do and speak your mind and question things, then well Wal-mart may not be the place for you"
good,"Great place to work for part time, if you're looking for fast cash for the holidays. You will be trained in all departments so you will know everything."
good,very good place to work as far as being able to provide for your self and family. Not far in all dealing but you can get by for you're among the favored
good,"not so great management. it is what you make it. i say just go to work , keep a pleasant attitude, its ok to socialize but you know how that can turn out at times.The staff was miserable and felt very slaved. they dont start you off with much."
good,"My biggest problem with Walmart is the managment. It's alot of miscommunication and are normally not on the same page. It affects the way the associates work because different instructions are being given and its from different managers, which causes alot of confusion."
good,"here in the west coast its not that great. Management knows you need more hours,so they do favoritism, due to too many people available for work."
good,Was a great work place when first starting management was fair an would listen to employees after a change in leadership not so much the managers are more pushy an don't care what anyone says or brings to their attention.
good,"Decent place to work with average pay"
good,"My over all opinion about working at Walmart was terrible. The over night management was a nightmare. They were constantly scatter brained and always seemed to busy for their employees. There is a manager that was getting touchy feely with the female staff and instead of doing something about it they have ignored it. When it came to advancement they would advance someone who wasn't working no where near as hard as others. They would treat you as though you didn't matter. There was just so much about the Palatka, Fl walmart that is wrong. To be honest the management staff there needs to be completely replaced."
good,Didn't really talk to many people but always short staffed and left out with no help while being rushed to have a task done by a certain time. Speaking for my unloaders
good,Walmart has a lot of potential with room to grow within the company.I have worked many different positions at this locations. I started as a customer service manager and have since held 4 other positions.
good,Me gusto trabajar para la empresa ya que me gusto la a atención a clientes y trabajar en bodegas e inventarios.
good,"If you love retail then this is the job for you. As for me it is just a stepping stone until I graduate college. You are asked to do more work for less pay, what you do is not appreciated. If you want to advance with in the company, well I have been with them off and on for 23 years and I am still just a sales associate."
good,"There was a culture in this store that management did not care about its employees.  I moved to Washington with my husband on a military PCS orders, and I had been working for the company for awhile.  This particular store gave me a very bad view of the company.  Of course I let the store manager know how I felt."
good,"Customer services help customer especially Senior people "
good,"Je suis un peu déçu de l'entreprise Walmart."
good,"Walmart is a Well rounded company, Hours are long and very up and down. Must be drug free for employment which is very good. You must have the ability to preform multiple job titles, at times all at the same time."
good,I didnt have a good job experience at Wal-Mart. The hourly pay of $8.40 wasn't nearly enough to help me feed my family or even pay my bills.
good,"productive, growing atmosphere were I began as a cashier. I began to move up the later pretty fast. using the training  and knowledge I gain from my coworkers"
good,It was an alright place to work definately not my favorite thats for sure but it helped pay the bills. I was only at this job for a month because i got it just before moving out of state. I had a couple nice managers that were great to work with and i met some very interesting people.
good,Its an okay thing to do if you are use to working in your own section alone. The hours maybe long to some people but as long as you keep your mind on doing what you have to get done by the end of the shift time flies
good,"Fun coworkers but, there's little room for advancement. They like to outsource their management and then have current workers train them without adequate compensation. Managers were usually flexible with the hours especially if you had to take public transportation to get to work. Descent place to work."
good,The job itself was fine. It was more the crew that made it a bad experience. One particular office personnel is not to friendly. It was a hassle trying to go from night shift to day shift.
good,"Management treats associates like dirt. Their policy is to hire low wage people that will not stay for long. Salary was what you would expect from a part time retail position, but there was no chance to advance."
good,The people I worked with were cool but the managers are corrupt and untrustable. They like to throw a huge workload on top of your normal duties and then get mad when everything is not done.
good,"I worked here for four years in multiple positions including lower management so I won't detail everything."
good,Training was short then I was put on the floor to cashier.I was not told about the Company Training Software until I had not completed my levels with the correct amount of time. Then I could not Leave the floor enough to get my Training classes completed. Then after a few months my hours were cut..
good,This job was only part time. I was only here for a short period of time. I learned I needed full time which is where Calsonic came in. This review is a waste of time
good,Its not a bad place to work if you are either younger or if you want to stay and make a career out of it. There is a lack of communication with management to associates.
good,I actually enjoyed working at Walmart the employees were great and they actually worked as a team but i personally would like to have seen some changes with in management.
good,"At Wal-Mart on a typical day, I was a cashier and I had to not only deal with rood customers but also rude management. Wal-Mart has no compassion for the things going on outside Wal-Mart, weather death in the family or if its simply you are ill. They also don't acknowledge hard workers, basically if you don't know anyone in management personally you're confined to that one position. I have worked at two different Wal-Marts and it was two different stores but both are alike."
good,"Good starter job with interchanging hours. A typical work day includes helping customers, working freight and using the SMART system to bin and order products."
good,"Good company to work for when the store manger is a intelligent proactive hard worker. The Assistant mangers also play a key role in the success of the store and work environment. Bad attitudes and poor work ethics effects everyone. The stock is decent. Schedules are usually not solid, so flexibility is a must but your position and departments are a factor. Some stores are pleasant as a employee or shopper and others are completely opposite. Overall i would recommend someone to work at Walmart if they needed a job."
good,"I had a blast working at walmart, talking to different people, seeing all different items go throw the line, and helping others has always been my weakness."
good,it was okay working but i got fired while i was sick and i even had an excuse so i feel like they can do better in that department
good,had difficulty with scheduling my online scheduling wasnt the same as management more than often. Short changed me a dollar per hr for 4 months and had to wait another 4 /5 to get the owed amount. working my shift on injuries multiple times even had drs notes. fired me due to attendence then put on my discharge papers that it was voluntary and i was un able to collect unemployement.
good,"Hours were decent, but they often would change schedules and not let you know, which was obviously stressful. Some managers were unfriendly, more then one employee quit out of rage while I worked there. Not all though, it was ok for hours."
good,"It is a good starting job. It prepares you for the real world and what you will tolerate. Further down the line,  the favorism will show, and people trying to fire you versus other workers who are in the managers' pockets. It was a very stressful job. However it gave me the experience needed to proceed in my career."
good,"I worked for Walmart for 6 months.  On average I would decorate cakes, for the night time I would prepare the bread for the baker(came in the morning), and clean.  The only thing dissatisfying about the job was management was very unprofessional.  Some co-workers would not complete their job and would be left to me."
good,Working at Walmart did teach me a lot its a good place to start working when you have no experience. They keep you working part time hours so you wont become full time. they work you like a slave. The employees are like high school kids with so much drama.
good,"Working at Walmart was an okay experience. There wasn't a whole lot making it a stand out place to work, I went in day in and day out to do my job of serving customers. That was about it."
good,"I did like working here for the most part. On my third day I was placed in the toy department by myself (during the summer) to stock. One manager tried to coerce me to quit when I asked for assistance. Other than that, I liked working there and would again."
good,I learned to work through adversity in the work place and not take things personally. A typical work day consisted of doing my basic duties and anything else that was asked of me. Management support was basically non existent. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management and coworkers who were there only for a paycheck and did not want to actually earn it. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and interacting with new people and learning new things.
good,"My over all experience at walmart was great I would go back if they need me."
good,"Great place to work if you like working wit the public, bagging groceris wasnt bad at all an being able to communicate an making some ones day was great"
good,"Working for walmart was a good experience.  I enjoyed working for the company. It was definitely a different experience for me, because I had never worked in this line of work before."
good,Your opinions do not matter to them unless you are in a position to make around 50k a year. Upper management defends themselves rather than those beneath them.
good,"clocking in the back then start zoning "
good,"I have heard that Walmart is a good company to work for, I needed"
good,"bake bread, stock shelves. I have learned more about retail and customer service.  The hardest part is working with distractions and finding time to complete tasks. The most enjoyable part is helping customers."
good,As a deli clerk at Walmart I opened the deli and prepared food in the morning before we had opened and stocked our items on the sales floor. I greeted our customers with a friendly smile and helped out in any way I could. I followed the health codes and sanitation codes as well.
good,I don't know if every Walmart was like the one I worked at but the one in Waterloo Iowa was very unprofessional with very rude CSMs I would work at another Walmart because it's easy work but I would never work at the one in Waterloo Iowa
good,"Days were very busy, learned a lot in each position. Most co-workers were pleasant. Management had little experience managing large groups of people which often ended in conflicts among the team members and that created higher turn-over rates for different departments"
good,While working with this employer I was not getting justly compensated for work and performance delivered daily. Over all employee moods were negative and concerning. A typical day was full of negative reactions and comments both from customers and employees. Most enjoyable part of the job were the people you work with. Hardest part was working for a company that honestly didn't care. And management that was useless. Poor communication between management\employees as well as management/ management. Store cleanliness lacking.
good,"the management upper to middle class treats you like you're not important, only three managers are about the employees and the job. Management is never on the same team...you try to talk to them if you have a situation in your life that affects your work life they don't accommodate you if you have restriction to move to another area that you already know you can do or they force you to resign or quit. this location in Randallstown cant never keep the people who do the job good they always keep the ones who don't want to work. I wouldn't recommend this location unless management changes in the work place in about 3yrs."
good,"My job experience with Wal-Mart was fun, but I had little training in both positions I had and got laid off because I was actually doing my job."
good,"Co-workers were decent, did not interact with many."
good,"Being the door greeter was a great fit for me "
good,My co-workers are great and sufficient with it comes to duties. I have daily goals to meet every-time I work a shift. I have excellent communication and listening concerns with my customers. The most I enjoy is that I can help customers with the practice skills of learning electronics from a professional view.
good,"A typical night working with Walmart starts with a meeting when you clock in, then it's off to work. You have to pray that the equipment you need is readily available, which it rarely is. You then have to hope that the equipment you found, works properly, which it rarely does. Co-workers often have the mentality of ""its not my problem, why should I care"". Morale is low all around, especially when the management that you work for is poorly organized, misinformed, and downright rude. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a less than agreeable standard of work ethic for nearly every employee, on top of being taken advantage of and being underappreciated. The few things I enjoy about my job are, some of the employees actually take pride in their work, and doing my job well."
good,"It was a challenge working at Walmart I felt the management didn't care about the employees and didn't take the time to help with work related issues or training. I really enjoyed working with the other employees I learned a lot more about team work, how we can help each other out and get more stuff done if we work together. The hardest part was training because we didn't have any, We were just thrown out on the floor expected to know what we are suppose to do."
good,enjoy working with people.  enjoy interfacing with people.   Have great customer service skills.  I am very friendly.  Typical day at work tends to be busy.
good,Its a job for someone who is maybe not a college student and has less traveling distance to go throughout the day that's it.
good,not the best place to work. all management was non understanding of what needed to be done and what customers were asking for
good,The management is unprofessional and you cant talk to anyone higher up because it will still come around back to you. The management doesn't do their best to present their employees with the best of situations. Then complain when you cant work under the situation(s) given.
good,The co-workers were great but management was a beast. It was a fun environment but the managers made each day a horrible experience.
good,"Puts disabled or visually impaired people in positions where they can easily find a reason to get rid of them. Management needs further training on how to professionally and politely accommodate those who deserve to be working, just as those who do not have a visual impairment of disability. Not impressed with how they run things at Walmart. Not professional!"
good,Hated working here. Managers scheduled the worse times for workers and employees weren't motivated enough to work. The lack of benefits do not help either.
good,"This is a ok company to work for.  They only down fall about this job is that they will work you to the extreme and will always wants you to come in on your day off.  They barely gives you a personal life."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart for me is, helping customers, operating the registers. I would also be required to operate both the sit down forklift and scissor lift. I used the forklift to load and unload freight from flat bed trucks, and used the scissor lift to manage top stock on the floor and in receiving. "
good,a typical day of work consisted of being pulled around by different mangers and doing task other then what you've signed up for then being screamed at for doing your original task. Management is unorganized & your personal life is the epitome of their laughter. The hardest part was having to deal with managers
good,"Overnights at Wal-Mart your job is to stock the store and have it ready for the next work day. My duties there varied from stocking shelves to doing inventory checks, as well as unloading any trucks that arrived during my shift. I was licensed on our walkie-stacker which was used to unload pallets of freight as well as binned them on the top racks that couldn't be reached by ladder."
good,"Working at Walmart is a experience of its own from the associates all the way to Store Manager. If you can manage to get on the Assistant Managers, Co-Managers, And Store Managers favorite list you have nothing to worry about. But if you are on the wrong list it can be very hard."
good,"walmart is a bad place to work, they treat their empoyees badly and cut their pay, i dont want to see anyone go through that."
good,"Not sure about other Walmart stores, but the one in Greenwood at least is one of the worst, for working at and at one point, shopping at. Let me start with the fact that the AC in the building was not working, at all. It was alright during winter, but during the summer it was terrible, with customers and staff alike feeling faint and nauseous. Walmart apparently refused to fix it saying it was someone else responsibility while they said it was Walmart's. Meanwhile Walmart did nothing, though it did get fixed, but not for a long time. Moving on from there, the management repeatedly dropped the ball, conflicted scheduling from different trainers, paperwork they never got me to sign that I was apparently supposed to and even what seems to be a big chunk of training they just never got around to giving me while I was there. While there some of managers were nice, but most just weren't. A large number are rude and uncaring and don't even communicate well with each other. When another manger got on my case about BB guns not being in the cabinet where there just wasn't room for them and showed no understanding of the department it was concerning to say the least. Harsh, strict and some EXTREMELY rude managers that don't care for their staff in the slightest kills it. Speed requirement is extremely high as well. If you can, I would try other places, if not...well, you never know, it doesn't work for most, but it just might for you. Just be careful, if they tell you they are gonna be letting you go they seem to lose all interest in your well being."
good,"I started off at the Walmart in Cumming, GA, and it was a new store with all new management. I LOVED the people here, they were amazing, which made my job as a bakery associate fun!"
good,The Pay is real low compared to the work expected of the associates. The health insurances doesn't pay very well. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I clocked out and went home.
good,Would've been a great job if the department wasn't severely understaffed and run and incompetent supervisor. Nepotism is big within the store so make sure you pucker up to get promoted. Work the hardest I've ever have and it was never appreciated by management. I came on as part-time but worked full-time hours and  they really only cared and pay attention if you are working overtime.
good,"The job isnt hard at all but unless you want to be a suck up youll never get anywhere within the company. They have no sympathy for home life issues regarding children or family members missing work for doctors appointments, or emergency room visits isnt tolerated and they will terminate you for it. With or without the note."
good,The only thing i didn't like about working here was not being able to work 40 hours a week. Everyone had to work under 40 hours so they didn't have to pay overtime. The only time anyone got 40 hours a week was during the holidays.
good,"Good place to start a career, family oriented "
good,Asst. Management screams Anger publically in front of store and customers..Hourly Supervisors were all the blunt between Management and Sales Assoc..
good,"a lot of micro managing even when you are a hard worker"
good,"Unfair pay and management team. Benefits were not the best,complete lack of communication between associates and the management team."
good,"As a cashier, I enjoyed meeting the public and talking with everyone.  My co-workers were pleasant to be around.  I only had two difficult customers the short time I worked there."
good,"I hate it, worker dont get paid enoug, and the hardest part about the job is that they will have you working the whole store but not your departmen"
good,I am a group oriented person and this is not a group oriented environment. I hated it. also had me working three different positions without proper compensation.
good,"Not the worst job I've ever had, but far from the best. The hours were decent and very flexible. The main thing I learned from Walmart is how managers should NOT treat their employees."
good,Can be a great place to work if you like working with customers. Most co-workers will help you out if asked.  The management team is okay.  I like my job but looking for something new.  There are chances to advance within the company.  The hardest part of the job is all of the micro-managing that the company does.  The best and most enjoyable part of the job is all of the people I meet and the friends I have made since I have been there.
good,clock in. unload.do anything neccesary to make sure the store is running properly. check in with my manager. clock out.
good,"You work hard putting merchandise on the floor and helping customers"
good,"Good fellow workers, everyone tried hard.  Learned proper cleaning and sanitizing skills, the on shift manager at first was great, then management changed and it became a nightmare."
good,"It's a fast paced, fun at times place with a lot of diversity in customers. The downside is that the company/stores are so large and so many managers within that most do not know what the other is doing. This creates issues and lots of miscommunication. The general management type within Walmart also could stand to treat their associates a bit better. The pay balanced against your specific job duties is too low and their training methods could use a lot of work."
good,"It is a good steady job that has good pay and benefits. It can be a overwhelming job when its not enough cashiers/help. You really have to have a lot of patience to work with customers, but other than that its okay."
good,"Associates are stressed out.  The management doesn't care about anybody, Many positions in the store are combined so that one associate is required to do 2-3 jobs at the time."
good,"Not happy with rate of transfer when I relocated, it never happened, no cooperation, not full time, no health benefits, low wages, the job itself was enjoyable, some of the customers were not so nice, co-workers very supportive and helpful. the job is not hard, it would have been nice if everyone as a team kept their areas neat, clean and organized like myself so I wouldn't have to do it for them. the most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers friendly and helpful, very supportive. management was not very helpful  scheduling around my college hours and drive time/gas and location for work."
good,"It was okay to begin with but not ideal, no training, cut hours at random times throughout the months of me working there, would schedule me and unschedule at the last minute with no warning."
good,"During my unfortunately fairly short time working at Walmart, I must say the unprofessionalism of this particular store was outrageous! While orientation videos and tests gave you the basic breakdown of your daily tasks, and they would feed you a basic tutorial on the floor, they also left notes with employees names where customers could see them and would not train beyond the basics and even then would tell you that you are doing it wrong after following exact orders. I found that one of my co-workers even seemed to sabotage my work at every chance they got. A typical day at work would start pulling out boxes on rocket carts, putting out merchandise, pulling back the overstock to have it sorted for later and then moved on to rolling racks with hanging clothes, zoning everything by size, number, color and group type. Then came tiding everything up again, or ""zoning"" in specific areas given on the chart. Your co-workers were not allowed to help you, even with a big task as it was ""frowned-upon"" even though ""teamwork"" was supposedly the big thing for Walmart. I learned to better organize, how to establish great customer service, how to use a multi-line phone and transfer, and how to build my own professionalism due to lack of theirs. Many people quit from this store within the same time-span as I did, and I cannot blame them for doing so in the least bit!"
good,The most enjoyable times is when I got see and talk to my fellow associate. I enjoyed a sense of accomplishment when my areas was neat and presentable for the customers. You work hard but when the customers gives you a compliment for your hard work it is worth it. I had a lot of goods times while I was there and also some very trying times. But if there is anything I can say positive about my experience there. I got to meet a lot of interesting people young and older.
good,The company is ok to work for but the opportunity for full time employment is minimal.  Great co-workers and a fun environment.
good,"every day is different theirs never a day that is the same "
good,"Enjoys serving and meeting different people"
good,Working with customers was sometimes hard.   Co-workers were great.  Has several managers who were friendly and kind but there were also some that weren't so nice.
good,"Good Customer Service, Making sure all task gets done, along with team work. The enjoyable part of my job is to be able to help someone."
good,"working at the Houlton Wal-mart, the management at the time didnt seem to be on the same page, and no matter how many time I followed the rules for requesting time off to get my children i was met with opposition, they claim to be family orientated but from my experience it didnt seem to be the case, however if you can put up with the favoritism it can be a decent place to work"
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers, and other associates find what they were looking for. The hardest part of the job was, Helping customers who didnt know exactly what they were looking for."
good,"The retail business is very demanding.  In Lawn and Gardening I deal with people each and everyday. Each day put up stock, answer the phone help customers."
good,"The average day at Walmart consist of pushing carts, stocking the dairy ails and anywhere that need help."
good,"meet and build great relationships with tenure associates"
good,"Pull freight to floor, sort through the freight, push to stock by deadlines and return overstock to backroom. Clean floor. Management could be better, refuses to give full time to associates but works them 40 hours a week."
good,"Job is fun, lots of experience to get. Management needs an overhaul  and there is a lot of politics. But for the most part amazing associates."
good,"Walmart is an acquired taste both as a customer and an employee. The work is not very hard but the management staff are rude. as far as hours and money they are pretty good about getting you the hours you desire, but that is the only real upside to the job."
good,"Understand that it varies from store to store on how management acts towards associates. There are some great people in management that will try to work with you while still getting business from customers; on the other hand, there are a few people in management that you can not please. "
good,Don't work here. Its an okay job for someone in high school and wants to make more than minimum wage but its a dead end job for the most part and its no career. No way.
good,A company who has good employees that gets no credit. They should do a better job in choosing the better all around people to become managers. the managers for the most part treats us employees as if we are not important to the company. I like working there though.
good,"A typical day at work is filling approximately 400-500 prescriptions a day.Except sat. & sun. we do less.we input prescriptions into computer ,deal with insurance issues,troubleshoot a little,answer phones,stock shelves order prescriptions,deal with out dates bag up prescriptions.talk to customers ablout there prescriptions if needed.anything we cant answer we ask pharmacist.i started in the pharmacy not knowing anything about it but I now have my license and have been in the pharmacy for atleast 7 years and love the pharmacy and people a lot.i think the hardest part is in retail I don't feel they want or know the pharmacy enough to know that the patients should come first not little stuff like where things are placed in the pharmacy or what else needs done besides getting patients presciptions done in a timely manner."
good,"i changed tires and did oil changes for customers,i also worked in the store in the automotive section and helped customers"
good,"-Cleaning"
good,"My days at Wal-Mart were pretty normal. I loved my job until they switch around our managers. I started barely having any days listed on the schedule and when I tried to bring this to someone attention(over and over) all I got was attitude and was told that's just how things are. After awhile I just got tired of barely working , so I left ."
good,"Definitely potential to be an enjoyable job. The lack of leadership skills in certain individuals needed to be addressed and corrected. Co-Workers were fabulous to work along side, very friendly. The management was great, very agreeable and open with their employees on a professional level. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of untrained employees, myself included, being given sections of the store to watch over, then being told by others to go work on something unassigned to us. Thus, by lunch we had only one section done, four bosses angry at us, and a full store with customers nearly as confused as we are as to where items are. "
good,"Go to work, do your job, go home. Management is typical, never content with anything, cannot get up in the business. Co-workers were decent to work with though!"
good,"It's a job if needing to make money to support family. Management isn't very nice. When interviewing and training, you aren't given 100% of duties you're actually expected to do. If you get hurt on the clock, management treats you worse in front of other associates."
good,"My typical work day was taking care of the trash, putting shopping carts back, cleaning the parking lot. As well as cleaning the restrooms, the floors, and taking care of any spills. I learned how to clean better. Management was unfair, and overall not very good. There were a few good co-workers, the rest were slackers. The hardest part of the job was that everything fell onto me to get done and I was to blame when it didn't, despite there being two others who had the same job as me. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see friends."
good,"Never in my life have I experienced two different worlds with a title change, until I got a promotion with Wal-Mart. they have unrealistic expectations.  Harassment to be witness daily. They treat their dept. managers like garbage. Force people to accept ridiculous ""coaching"" which all they do is tear you down. If you decide to work for them I would recommend to never become a dept. manager."
good,"busy, focus, multi-tasks i enjoyed working with others and also answered customers questions. hardest part of the job: when the store is closing for the night. 30 minutes fixing"
good,"La empresa tiene buenas bases, pero no sirven de mucho si los lideres no las respetan y no las ponen en practica, mas ética."
good,"When you are a great worker, the manager's at Walmart want you to do more and more meanwhile other associates get their proper breaks and lunches. You get more work and you cant take all your breaks or a full lunch because the Manager's gave you more to do. You are working and other associates are on their cellphones or sitting on the floor taking their time, meanwhile you have triple the work."
good,"Work hours were long or short, it just depended on what you got. I worked 5 - 8 hours regularly. Sometimes I would a week without a day off, but most had two days off put in the week somehow. "
good,"Management: is not on the same page. They are scattered and on different levels of standards, lack communication skills, and aren't the same on disciplinary views. Not very kind."
good,My time working for wal mart was well. Fellow employees are helpful and are good workers. Wal Mart is a good company for those who want to advance their career.
good,"Cargo: Gerente Nutricionista – Refeitório e Restaurante."
good,"Good job if you still in college, helping customers would be the most typical work of the day. I have learned more about the technology products and how they work. Its a good way to practice your soft skills too."
good,"a typical day for me would be balancing CSM drawer, taking care of customers, answer questions for cashier monitoring breaks lunches and availability of staff. "
good,"working with people that just need a job to survive, clean and stock shelf and operate forklift and power equip. recycle plastic"
good,There was not a very typical day. Everyday was a different routine. I learned how to use a pallet jack and how to scan inventory. Management was very biased and seemed to play favorites as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the enormous amount of work load done in such a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hour lunch break.
good,"Clock in, then off to my manager to see what register to work. I learned how to use a cash register and scan items. Management was ok, when they felt like working. The hardest part of the job was price-matching and the most enjoyable part was watching the customers walk away happy with their purchase(s). I was given 2 breaks then finished my shift, clocked out and went home."
good,The jobs were basic but the training for the jobs were lacking questions unanswered very rushed to do things with minimal guidance the bosses were in their own little worlds half the time everyone had a buddy system and management had a pick your favorite kind of attitude.
good,hours change too much. only 20-25 hrs week. very inconsistant. low pay. cant pay rent on 20 hrs/ week. sometimes you work till 11 pm.
good,Managers should not be allowed to treat their employees like children and talk to them like they're ignorant and incapable of doing their job.
good,"I did not like how management treated their employees, including myself. However, I loved my position and my coworkers. My hours were cut from 32-40 to 16-23, I cannot make a living with that."
good,I liked the manager of my department. I was not happy. they cut our hours. Then cut the the extra $1.00 for working on Sunday for all new employees.
good,"They train you for other positions, but do not compensate your pay accordingly.  I worked there for a year. Hired as a cashier. I was trained to work in the pharmacy, customer service desk area, lay away department, and assisted with management duties. But while in those positions, I was still making the wages of a cashier."
good,I worked in the dairy department. Soooo boring but it was valuable because now I know what to look for when I go to shop. The shift before mine was always leaving colossal messes like spilled milk everywhere and of course customers got snippy over goats milk or something silly like I am management and have control over everything there. My co-worker was the sweetest lady and she was the best part of my job. Its alot of rotating inventory cleaning messes  and mopping. Also I didnt work many hrs but I had a young child at the time and was always scheduled to work holidays.
good,"Schedule and confirm appointments.  Verify insurance eligibility and gather information about copays for billing.  Pretest patients, get charts out and ready for appointments. Verify glasses and contacts prescriptions and call to let patients know materials arrived and are ready for pick up."
good,"On a typical day I would help customers with everything from returns,sells,bill payments to questions on products carried on the floor."
good,"Walmart is only as strong as the community who runs it. Employees must work together to ensure happy customers."
good,I worked for Walmart on and off for four years. I had some good days and bad days.I learned how to deal with people and the job made me more of an out going person. I had more bad managers then good.I can say that most of my managers don't care which kinda made the job difficult at times.They lacked a lot of leadership skills and it was like a kind of disconnect between the employees and them. Most of the time I got along with my co-workers.The hardest part of the job was to keep my composer when a customer is being disrespectful and or co-worker and when I had to do 5 hours of work with in 2 hours.The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help a customer.
good,Fast paced environment with situations changing on a moments notice. Work closely with the public and address many concerns and issues. Allows you the freedom to be creative with problem solving skills to please the customer while maintaining protocol. Close relationship with management so lots of room for personal growth and constructive criticism to improve leadership skills.
good,"la premiere journee walmart vous donne une tes belle impression ,mais lorsque tu commence a tintegrer dans la compagnie on se rend tres vite compte que les gerant du walmart son tres demandant envers leurs employer mais ne veulent jamais combler les poste manquant pour economiser de largent. donc leurs employer ce retrouve toujours a effectuer le travail de deux ou trois personne la fois ."
good,Great unloading team to work with. The management team was not very good though. No room for advancement in the company. No communication skills from the management staff.
good,For the amount of work you are required to do you do not get compensated enough. It seems like you're working in a factory.
good,Wal-Mart isn't a horrible place to work per say but sometimes management forgets you have a life outside of walmart. The benefits and pay are pretty good. Department managers have a lot of daily duties but as long as you communicate
good,"The are never satisfied. The people that work the hardest are the ones treated the worst. They pay more than anywhere else, but no one would do it for less."
good,"I worked in the deli, so I sliced meat for customers, handed out flyers, made meal plates, and made sandwiches. I liked working the other employees, and liked most of the customers, but there was no full time options available."
good,"Aprende más sobre el trato al cliente, un dia normal era surtir mecancia, atencion a clientes, acomodar mercancia, limpiar."
good,"I arrive at work clock in and started remodeling. I would take out large pieces of steel and metal by hand to the dumpster."
good,Its Cool... but id like to get full time hours instead of close to 40... for some reason they say you are a full time associate but cut the hours so you can't get the full time associate benifits.
good,The management there doesn't really care about what's going on with associates. The associates are good though usually.
good,"they expect you to work 8-10 hrs of feight along with running register,cutting fabric,mixing oaint,cut keys and print hunting/fishing license in the 7-7 1/2 hrs of actual floor time all stores are different but the store that left me go but made me rehireable was not such a great store"
good,The people are nice but overall you get treated like bull. No benefits. No nothing and horrible pay. If you're going to do something and have no life I'd suggest being an IMS other wise you won't make any money.
good,"Management will fire you regardless of any unique situations.  It is all about the numbers of write ups.  As far as the management's concern, if no write ups are generated, the managers are not doing their jobs.  The policy rules are rigid and the employees become fearful and frustrated.  You either stay and not put up a fight against the middle management or quit."
good,"I first started with the intention of finding new friends and making it as comfortable aws possible, unfortunately the outcome wasnt what i expected none the less I actually made new friends and i did learn new things so in a nut shell I can appreciate the experience and thank those who came to my rescue when i needed them."
good,The people were nice to work with until it came down to actually doing work. They don't give warnings before writing you up and they only have to hear one time that you did or didn't do something before you get written up.  You have to work there for 90 days before you get any benefits.  Working at Wal-mart takes patience
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart in the beginning but when things started changing at corp. level it was not a fun place to work anymore.  Not a family friendly company like they say, not anymore that is. Now all they care about is $$$"
good,"working at Sams Club was a great thing starting but you see that its a broken company, all they care about is if you can sell cash rewards. In the GM's words, ""if they can not sell cash rewards, they are of no use to me."""
good,it not the best but it is work. The manger are okay some work with the employes but others give attiude. the superviser are not the best lack team work.
good,I started working at Wal-mart for seasonal help and as a second job.  I became a permanent employee after 3 months. The hours were long. During the holidays the store was always packed
good,Not enough hours. The job position was great but at the location i was working at the management was not fair  such as discrimination towards one another.
good,"This particular store's management did not train their personnel for the areas that the employee's would need to be placed. Even though the store was one of the busiest Wal-Marts, and I enjoyed my co-workers and some of the management; I was hard-pressed when an incident happened and was released of my position without Warning!"
good,"work was fine and it work right along with my life, when it came to things i had to do with my son and sister... but i worked at night and we had a night stalker at work, he would follow me around saying very scary things to me."
good,Walmart is a good transition or in between job.  Definitely not worth a career.  Management can use some work.  Employees seem to be oppressed and not valued.  Morale appears to be very low.
good,A typical day at work is maintaining patience with bad customers and bad co-workers. I learned a lot about how retail works and I learned a lot about other departments other than electronics. The management team is not a productive one. They only create problems instead of solving them. They're setting up the store to fail. Most of my co-workers are not hard working. They are more concerned with goofing off and chatting on their smartphones and with each other rather than actually getting work done. The hardest part of my job is maintaining my cool in a bad workplace. The most enjoyable part of my job is an hour long lunch break.
good,"Walmart was a rather busy place to work at, considering I was a cashier, I had to interact with the customer at all times, and that wasn't bad at all. There wasn't much supervising which resulted in less than decent results. But price wise, Walmart is a thriving and huge business."
good,I feel that the store I worked for was not a good one can not blame the company how ever with the favoritism that is going that store will always have problems which in return gives the company a bad name the store I worked for pushed us to do more than usual and they would hold others to different standards
good,Customer Service. Customers are always right even when their wrong. Management was lackluster. It was difficult to talk with a manager if you needed anything.
good,"I learned many things including how to interact with people from different backgrounds and nationalities. I was performing many tasks depending on circumstances; however, the job environment and crowdiness in certain days make the job very difficult to be accomplished."
good,I very well enjoyed working here. I learned a lot for the short time that I was there. I loved working at customer service and assisting customers. My co workers were good to work with. everyone had positive attitudes.
good,"Fun coworkers and very unsupportive and very grumpy management. Overall, you learn a lot of people skills, and a lot about retail."
good,"I always thought that hard work would get me far but this company proved me wrong. I didn't mind the starting pay and the work, the rewards would come in time. I was sadly mistaken. work hard even going above and beyond you still get treated like your less than human by your management team. Walmart needs to reevaluate how they treat their workers."
good,Scan customers purchases and help them with payments for credit cards and price matching.   Management never was involved with our tasks unless a customer became irate.  I loved the job as a cashier and would proudly do it again.  The CSM's were the best.  They helped with all problems and were there to assist when we needed them.
good,"It was fun at first, until i got moved to the backroom and was around management all the time. The management there is HORRIBLE. It feels like they don't even care about there employees, just themselves"
good,"I found my overall job satisfaction at Walmart to be less than positive. I found management to be very much less than competent and often far to overbearing. However, fellow employees were generally caring and when management was  not around the work environment was very friendly and congenial. I was very happy with my job in the photolab."
good,"Basically I was helping other customers, and was not in my department. My assistant manager was trying to contact me. She yelled at me for not being there. So, basically I guess if a customer needs help outside your department they are out of luck.. pathetic."
good,overall I loved working for Walmart I loved working with and seeing  different people. didn't really approve of some of the ways the store was ran but it was fun while it lasted
good,"During the past year that I have been at Walmart, I have experienced some major problems within the management at my store. Poor communication, poor decision making, and just overall poor  execution by them. I believe their needs to be more training involved for management and then maybe it will provide a better experience not only for the associates but the customers as well."
good,"I would take out the merchandise that was empty, made bales, and would stock if needed. It was a very stressful work area."
good,"management does not care about how you feel or your schedule. co workers were fun and easy to talk to. some were difficult to work with. i learned how to count money quickly, but efficiently. hardest part of this job was lifting heavy items and dealing with mean customers. best part about this job is the freedom you get and nice customers."
good,"Baking, customer service, janitorial."
good,"I enjoyed the job and the customer service experience and learning a new job. "
good,"The hardest part of this job was dealing with employee attitudes. I think if Walmart increased their pay rates, employees will have a better attitude."
good,"Great entry level job, however management was not very supportive and the entire store seemed very unorganized. Communication between employees was nearly nonexistent and there was never a sense of job security."
good,"A good start with no experience required. However, there is no real room for advancement within the company. Due to the amount of customers that come through it a great way to build patience and learn how to work with people as well. Biggest downsides were lack of holidays and long hours with small pay and bonus."
good,I learned a lot about the basics of landscaping as well as protecting your assets. Details are a top priority in maintaining a business. Self preservation and team work.
good,I enjoyed my job and was happy to learn different management aspects of a big company. I was not very happy about how I was expected to treat the employees working under me. I chose to treat them with dignity and respect. Hardest part of the job was I worked between 12-18/hrs a day and sometimes more. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a diverse group of people and learning a variety of new skills in different departments and fields.
good,"most days were always busy, I learned how to treat customers, management had too many different opinions, co-workers became life long friends, hardest part of the job was dealing with hateful people, most enjoyable part was working with people"
good,"Although the job was very easy to do at a high level with ease, I did not feel as if the management fully appreciated my new ideas or innovation ideas. I would like to at least have my suggestions heard if possible."
good,"Working for Walmart is exactly what you would expect it to be, very corporate, very much involved with specific policies and standard operating procedures, everything is systematic and integrated into a computer database, pretty good if you want to stay at an entry-level position"
good,A tipical day begin with verifing your task and prepare with the necesary tools or equipment. I learn many things specially to be multytask like stocking merchandise being carefull with empty boxes plastics spills etc to prevent accident either for me coworkers and customers and dealing with customers all that at the same time plus my first days i had no training at all learning everything by myselft. My experience with coworkers its awesome obviusly everybody had something in common a hard working day so everyone always tries to make it happiest as possible .This job required a lot of streng and hability i got to take care of pull out my pallets to the floor break the pallet to work merchandise sometimes over 10 pallets by myself clean prepare overstocks pallets and clear the floor before my shift finish and all task must be complited at time too.
good,with all I have to do for  my job its ok u just have to deal with it the co workers are all good to work with I try to learn more about my job daily
good,"Walmart touts family, as long as it does not interfere with their goals. There is a strong move to prevent 'associates' from being recognized individually for their good project outcomes, but on down the line, the managers get credit for the successes."
good,I was a customer service associate on the front end of store. Also my job responsibility was to stock and block our candy products.
good,"come in and complete task that's assigned to you "
good,"Management does not work very hard. They don't pay enough attention and when they do it is usually only for negative things. They do not hire enough people so I was constantly doing the work of 2 or 3 people. It was just too stressful and distracting from my schoolwork, and it was not a great job overall."
good,Very repetitive work but little downtime.  Hours typically went by quickly and most customers were glad to chat while I bagged their groceries.  Too many guidelines and conflicting instructions were a headache and you're often treated as a cog more than an individual.  Very little opportunity for getting to know coworkers.
good,"same as before in first Walmart review , since I worked there ,"
good,"Working at walmart was okay, it's kind of better to be a customer than an employee because certain CSMs are nice and the scheduling isn't the best."
good,"This job is still kind of one of my favorite jobs. I loved working in the deli at Wal-Mart. I had about 2 or 3 co-workers that were really nice and we were like a family. Other than that, anyone who's ever been to Wal-Mart already knows what kind of atmosphere it is. The job, especially working in the Deli, can be very stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the cooking. The hardest part of my job was dealing with their management staff."
good,"Working with so many people is very difficult sometime, especially if no one wants to compromise. typical day, i come in clean whatever mess morning shift leaves for me, while trying to take returns and tend to customers."
good,A typical work day at wal-mart starts off with cleaning up after employees. A lot of the co-workers are rude and lazy. The hardest part of my job was actually going.
good,i worked third shift took care of produce. did a detail clean every night picked out the bad fruit. helped out in the store when needed.
good,Walmart was my first job that gave me real experience with a cash register. Being a cashier at this job had its ups and downs. my managers here were not very understanding and did not care about anyone but themselves and there customers.
good,"Just another job. Wasn't difficult at base value, but under certain individuals would the task become more tedious than necessary. Hardest part of the job is doing the heavy work load alone with no assistance."
good,The managers that worked in the front area where all the cashiers were located were all awesome but all head managers and store manager could really use some working on. I learned to deal and handle difficult customers and that was also the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting all different types of people that went you met everyday. You had your regulars which was great because some of them would go wait in your line just to be able to talk to you. Being able to talk to some of them and making their day or putting a smile on their face when they weren't having the best days was the most rewarding thing for me while working there.
good,"Walmart doesn't train their managers to respect their employees. The management style is like an avalanche, its starts from higher management and rolls downhill."
good,"Responsável por Reabastecimento / Compras de Mercadorias da Rede, tratando direto com os Fornecedores( atendimento à Fornecedores)."
good,"Its a great job just a really huge company and always busy. Managers will work will schedule, coworkers are easy to talk to. I think the company is huge enough to have rotating weekends."
good,"The place itself was okay, but the management that was in charge were horrible. They didn't know their jobs or anything about the store."
good,"pay was not good considering how big of a company has become, in my opinion workers should be able to move up based on  senority and not favoritism."
good,"The employees were all hard workers, it was managements lack of communication that failed. This caused lost of productivity, confusion and wrong product placement."
good,"With my time at Walmart (1.5yrs) I was offered management three times. I was denied every time because I was ""too immature"" or they thought I was ""unprepared"". What it came down to was I was fully qualified but 19 years old. Management at Walmart only promotes those they want to or they like personally. They discriminate against people based on age which should not be said of any company."
good,Management does not help and is way too pushy. They put everything on the associates and does not take responsibility. If you really want to know more please feel free to ask me in person on how I really feel about this company. I have worked for them on and off for ten years and each one that I have been to has been worse than the next! I will never work for walmart again.
good,must be used to being hands-on crossed trained if working overnights (may be moved to work different department that one is not trained in).
good,walmart was the worst job for me they were always short on staff so employees such as my self were always taken out of our departments to go other places to work and they made it mandatory that we finished our work along with new work we were assigned
good,They had us working long hours and didnt always get our scheduled breaks and barely gave us any days off. Customers and co workers were rude and so was management. The only joy about the job was being able to go home.
good,Customer service is not what Sam Walton wanted it to be so I would not like to work for this company again. This company does not have the family economy type environment that they say they have and to me is false advertisement in my personal experience.
good,estava em duvida do que eu queria mais agora descidi quero crescer na area da eólica.
good,A little too impersonal at times. Lay offs at a whim. But I did work with some wonderful people. And most of the management was understanding of situations.
good,"At Walmart we would strive to reach our goals by putting in a team effort.  Not all associates worked in a team effort, so i learned all i can do is try my best to get what needed to be done and guarantee customer satisfaction.  The co-workers were okay for the most part.  Although I did not get along or like everybody, I still stayed cordial and respected the work place enough not to be disrespectful and rude to anyone.  The hardest part about the job was not being able to take off and be there for my son every time my son was in the hospital.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that i was able meet new people and make new friends."
good,"good experience"
good,The place in clean and neat the other people i work with at my level are nice. As you head up into management everyone looks down on you and never cares about your progression or what you want done.
good,"Cleaned the restrooms, took out all the trash, and made sure i got to spill calls, and practiced safety procedures. I learned deeper about safety procedures. co workers were very helpful."
good,"Being an overnight stocker at Walmart is not a hard job at all. Pay was average and I could put up with it. "
good,I enjoyed that this job was so easy it just wasnt enjoyable to be around rude management and also rude people. They think just because you work at walmart you must be stupid which isnt the case most of us are in college and have this job to get by.
good,"mi dia laboral era llegar, registrar entrada, entrar a caja a prestar servicio al cliente, tomar mi hora de comida, y al finalizar el dia recoger el checado y corte final de caja. Aprendi a trabajar sola y como se trabaja en empresas que son grande, mis compañeros de trabajo eran personas muy amables, la parte mas dificil del dia era cuando te realizaban corte y lo que mas me gusto era convivir con mis compañeros de trabajo y que el cliente se fuera satisfecho con su compra"
good,Wal-Mart was a good job but I wish they would of gave me notice instead of waiting till I got done with my shift for them to let me go because of me being a seasonal worker.
good,On any typical I would manage my department. I would compare my sales with other stores. Check the daily inventory tracking report. I also my help support other departments if they are short handed. The hardest part of my job would be helping upset customers. The most enjoyable part of my job would be find a solution to customer complaints.
good,"I worked in the garden center at Walmart. Helping customers load rocks, flowers, patio furniture,grills, mowers,etc. I would also put together patio furniture, grills, bikes, sheds,etc."
good,I have worked as the meat dept manager for almost a year and I would not recommend it . I start my day putting plans together to get my shelves stocked and filled. I order product and do price changes. much of my day is spent trying to meet company expectations. I feel the problem is the people setting the expectations do not take real in store experience into account. The best part of my job is my customers and co workers.
good,all the co-works are mad at u and they don't know how to to talk to u and the management is the same way and the hardest part about the job is when they want the truck to be done at 6 clock
good,learned a lot of things from this place and i am glad i was able to learn so much.i learned a lot in clothes and jewelry. the hardest part of working there is how hard you work and the managers don't care. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people that work as hard as i do. some managers there are so unfair and don't respect their workers.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working for Walmart.  The people I worked with on the sales floor were always friendly and helpful. Management however was another story.  I worked my butt off whenever I was on shift, but no matter how much I accomplished there was always someone who would ask why did I not finish the rest of it."
good,was not a bad place to work but tended to expect more than was possable to complete in the amount of time given for each task
good,Management has no respect for associates and enjoy making examples of the employees. Many employees contain themselves in social circles that are very similar to cliques in a high school.
good,"Trabalhar no Wall  marte   foi uma experiencia boa para aprender a desenvolver minhas  habilidades , aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, a gerencia era boa  não tenho do que reclamar,meus colegas ótimos, a parte mais difícil era a inconstância nos horários que quase sempre variavam. A parte mais agradável era o espaço de descanso que tínhamos dava para relaxar bem em 1 hora."
good,aprendi que se trabalhando em grupo tudo fica mais fácil e também sempre ouvindo os seu superiores e eles também te ouvindo como qualquer pessoa.
good,"Trouble shoot wireless devices, set up new plans, and assist customers when help was needed. As well as finalizing store transactions and main a clean work environment."
good,"My experience working for Walmart for the past 5 years has taught me so much. I've learned patience, and respect for the individual goes a long way. Ive met some fascinating people while employed their.. even made lifetime friends. My management staff wasn't the greatest but most of them understood how hard it was to work when your constantly being scrutinized by other managers and rude customers. I would recommend Walmart as a great job for teens looking for their first job, but Not someone trying to make a career."
good,I worked around great people. I enjoyed interacting with the customers which gave me good people skills. The hardest part was I never had a set work schedule. It was hard being a single parent and waiting on the weekly schedule to be done. I enjoyed working around the people in my community.
good,"I enjoyed being with some of my co workers, they were fun and exciting they treated me great.But some of the management was not that great. They was horrbile on treating people and the workers. Some never cared for us.I learned a lot cause of them. They taught me how to cashier, stock shelves, and clean."
good,"Bom local para se trabalhar, porém exige muito dos funcionários, gerência ""fraca"", pouco se importavam com os funcionários."
good,"Hired for the Christmas Holidays, laid off on Dec. 23...disappointed, when they were short on employees, I worked when they needed me.  They wanted me to come back to work as temp, then pt; I need stability in employment and long term employment."
good,"Excellent for individuals at various work levels. Flexible scheduling, Great co-workers, competitive salaries, and an overall positive environment (most of the time)."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for short-term or during school. They offer a flexible schedule and reasonable pay, so it is easy to work with the company in college. Long-term I feel it the company isn't as great. There are little benefits and the compensation for the work an associate puts in are unbalanced. I learned a lot about customer service while working here and about big companies like Walmart."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart because of all the benefits that come along with the job, and you can do all of your shopping in one place if needed."
good,"If you are looking to advance, you have to be likeable, but not too good at your job. If you are too good at your job you won't be able to move up. "
good,A typical day was walking in and lines are backed up and barely any registers open. You will also have at the very least 1 rude person a day. I learned to just hold your tongue and be patient. Management was complete garbage and rarely helped - when they did it was with attitude as if helping you was a waste of time. Co-workers are what kept me even going back to work. Hardest part - dealing with management. Most enjoyable part would be the laughs that can happen.
good,i was working there as a temp and i was pregnant by the time i quit i was 8 months pregnant and i was having alot of issues with my pregnancy. i would ask to be sent to do something else so i could make it through the day and none of them could understand the issues i was having. nor did they care enough to talk to me about it. upon getting hired i was told if needed less hours just to let someone know and i did and i didn't end up with any less and i was always in alot of pain. i mean there was some good people there who did try to help but my manager at the time was not one of them.
good,"Bad pay, ridiculous 30 minute lunch, and downright abyssmal management."
good,"I enjoyed my brief time at Walmart due to the people I worked with. However, after just getting out of the Navy, it just wasn't for me."
good,"I would have liked working there, but when I asked for a transfer to a different facility I was denied because I had strikes against me for being late... yet thats why I was trying to transfer my only transportation was the public busline, which was always missing the connecting buses. I ended up getting fired because I was late"
good,"A typical day:"
good,"A typical day of work was coming together and seeing what needed to be done and everybody doing their part and helping others if you were to finish stocking your department, also helping customers find the products they need."
good,"Fun place to work just not completely honest hiring managers. I loved meeting new people and the work that i done. I operated register, took payment and gave correct change"
good,this was a good job only the pay is terrible and I found out others who just started got paid more than me.  Was it an age issue?  I don't know all I know is I got paid less than the younger people.
good,"Working in produce is hard enough to begin with but having managers breath down your neck doesn't make it easier. They are constantly out of produce that they NEED on the sales floor to fill out empty spaces and because those spaces aren't filled management isn't happy and they begin to pile on the pressure for you fill what you cannot. It required a lot of heavy lifting, pushing, and unloading incredibly heavy pallets full of produce merchandise. every 3 to 6 hours you would have to throw away about 200 to 400 pounds of rotten or bad produce and that was the worst. The produce job pay grade is at about 8 to almost 10 dollars depending on experience, but they ALWAYS start you at minimum wage."
good,If you are in a good market wal-mart can be a great company to work for. if you are in a bad market then it can be a night mare. It is a good company with great policies in place but not to many people follow those policies
good,I would not recommend this job only has a last resort.working overnight could take up your life if you let it.some coworkers are eay to work with and some is not
good,Walmart was always very busy no matter what shift you worked. The management team was ok.  Some of the management was bias and it showed.  The hardest part of the job was not really hard as much as it was frustrating and that was having to use 2-4 different registers in one shift not knowing who was on the register before you so you could be held accountable for someone who was dishonest. I love to work with people that was the best part of the job for me.
good,I start my work day at ten o clock at night. Pick product out of the back room that can go on the shelves. Unload the dairy an frozen truck an stock the product. Averages about 15 to 20 hours a night of work that has to be done by seven in the morning. So its 3 to 4 other workers an I who manages the fasts way to get the job done. Once product was finished being stocked I then bin it into the backroom bins which is Walmart's Inventory System. Keeps track of what we already have in store so the system knows to order what were missing. I've learned to articulate my thoughts to get my point across with multiple types of people an personalities. Even some that clash with my own but has to be put aside to finish the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the way your treated within that company. The most enjoyable part is getting a hard works day done an exceeding what they expected of you.
good,"In enjoyed my job duties and performed them well.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I kept and stayed busy, although I did not really enjoyed the over night shift, which was the hardest part of my job."
good,"I enjoyed working with co-workers, and performing my job duties.  I gained valuable experience in grocery pricing  inventory and stocking"
good,"I enjoy the collegues and the understanding we have with each other.  The hours and the expectations of the job have been challenging."
good,"Open and ready shop for day, opportunity to lean other departments operations, Close prepare shop for next business day."
good,"I worked for H&R Block for two seasons, and was witness to inexperienced tax preparers assisting people they should not have. I was astonished with one of the employees that was hired."
good,"great job with the right co workers"
good,"Walmart never wants to give out full-time hours. Most of the employee's get around 12-15 hours a week. They promise the employees that they have a hiring freeze, that all the current employees will get the hours. I know of three occassions that Walmart said this, and they went on to hire 15-20 employees each time."
good,"Wal Mart is a good place to work if you fit into there click. It's all about who likes you there one person can turn your world upside down. The best part about this job was going home .co workers were messy. hardest part of job,was unloading the trucks.Managment had little or no concern for us as people. Had a supervisor get all up in my face. A very unprofessional place to work.What I learned was,just cause someone has a title. Doesn't mean they will treat you right as a human being. One supervisor addressed us minorities,as you people.  Lost a lot of respect for wal mart after that."
good,"Work was amazing. My coworkers were very helpful and always there when you needed them. Management was hardly ever to be found. Hardest part of the job was seeing people steal, and not being able to say or do anything about it. But I enjoyed stocking, zoning, cleaning, meeting new people, and helping others."
good,At Walmart Pharmacy we deal with many customers on a daily basis which make it a very fast paced work environment. This requires knowledge of many tasks and ability to multitask with efficiency
good,"I did enjoy working for this company but they don't exactly treat people fairly, the managers have lack of communication between each other. Everyone is super friendly but the managers sometimes try to overdue the amount of work they want done in so little time. The hardest part about the job was communicating sometimes with the managers a lot of times they showed favortism between co workers and only gave credit to those workers forgetting about the rest of the team that put in just as much work."
good,"I worked as a cashier for a while then I moved to the bakery and Deli to work overnights. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them with their needs, The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, there was no communication and the pay was less then ideal for the amount of work you would give them."
good,"Retail is a lot of fun. Enjoyed the job and customers. A lot of hard work. I worked really hard for the whole time I was there. Raises were good and benefits. Communication with management is poor, they are unfair to associates and play favoritism. Try to hold you back regardless of hard work. You are hand picked for promotions based on favoritism. Hard to get your breaks. Management will lie to you and tell lies on you to cover up for mistakes they have made and for faults in the equipment. They put on a big front to let people think they really care. But they care more about their bonuses and themselves. Customers are always frustrated and never happy because they don't want to listen to them either and you are constantly explaining why they don't correct things and why the equipment doesn't work every minute of the day."
good,"I enjoyed working for wal mart for about 2 months. My primary job was inventory mangement. We started at 7 and ended at 3. I learned how to use RF scan guns , load trucks and cashier. Management at Wal Mart is hectic! There are so many giving so many directions. I loved my co workers! Hardest part of my job? There wasnt one .. It was a very easy job. I enjoyed working from 7-3."
good,We just stalk during the night. I was responsible for stocking numerous of aisles and getting everything put on the shelves.
good,"This company management is dysfunctional. Schedules change without being notified, and then they tell you to stick to your schedule regardless of change, but then cite you for that day the system registered you to work and not them. Being sick isn't an option they don't care about your well being, they will terminate you even if you have proof of the incidents. They pull resources from departments to cover-up the shortage they refuse to hire.  -"
good,You do way more than you actually get paid for. You hardly get to take your breaks and get punished if you do not get your break with in a certain amount of time. Which is not your fault. That's why they can't keep people and there are never any lanes open. It was a fun place to talk to people all the time. That's about it.
good,"I worked in the distribution center loading trailers, not the position I wanted but was told I can transfer after 6 months and the only way to get in with the company was taking their ""entry"" level position loading trailers and 1 1/2 year later NO transfer granted. I even had a knee injury and would had been more beneficial for all to place me in a position I'm more capable of doing. The knee injury took place while working in the shipping docks loading trailers and it was actually my knee kissing the dock plate; so to speak. I had to go through physical therapy and even hired an attorney due to the fact that I had to fight to get any medical attention. The only thing ever granted to me was physical therapy. Multiple MRI requests got denied, roughly 5 requests total. Wal-mart wanted to place me in a store making $10 less on the hour due to the restrictions from my leg injury but there are plenty of positions within the warehouse one with restrictions such as myself can comfortably manage. Once my physical therapy was completed and I was clear to return to work (without restrictions) the workers compensation claim was settled and just 3 weeks after this settlement I was terminated! It was determined by the state after multiple appeals and a court hearings that termination was ""without just cause in connection with work""! Fired after 1 1/2 years and was told it was for poor attendance. My attendance was the result of physical therapy appointments for my WORK related injury. This was a battle that I wish was not something I had to endure and in the end a lesson learned,  I would"
good,"- Even though I was on a cash I got to do multiple jobs throughout the store and increased my knowledge and skills"
good,When I first started for Wal-Mart everyone warned me about how poorly they treated their employees and I disregarded it. For the first 6 months or so I felt comfortable in my position and I did not understand what the stigma was. After the company started advancing/promoting me and giving me more duties I quickly saw how the dynamics changed as employees moved higher up on the occupational ladder.
good,"The staff are the best part of working at walmart, they can make you feel like part of a family if you do your job well.  Management has been going downhill for last 4 years with no end in sight. Most of the reasons or benefits of working there are being taken away.  I woudln't go back again, not even for the staff."
good,"Clock in at 10:50pm  and head straight to receiving to haul merchandise onto the floor. Deconstruct pallet and work contents of pallet into their appointed locations on the shelves. When a truck arrives for receiving, we unload the truck and move that merchandise to the floor. Rinse repeat all night. I learned to operate a few different types of fork lifts  and how to keep logs while developing some warehouse style organization skills along with the value of teamwork."
good,"management does not treat you very fair there, most co-workers were very nice."
good,"A typical day consisted of me covering my department which was the garden, price checking, zoning, cleaning, customer service, site to store carry outs. I also closed and covered other departments a lot like the auto department and stationary being that they were close to my department."
good,"Its a good job other then the management. they don't listen to anybody if there not management. I love working retail jobs, but that store as a big management problem. my co-workers were not a problem. I learned to work hard an not let nothing stop you from doing your work."
good,"Was chaotic, employers were not reasonable when it came to the complications during pregnancy, scheduling me in areas that were restricted with drs orders."
good,"A typical day includes stocking shelves, assisting customers needs, completing inventory and loading and unloading trucks."
good,"Daily  job requires you to place cashiers where  needed, to accommodate breaks, and  lunches for associates.  Handle questions asked by cashiers and customers.  Do daily register audits, and cash handling."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work when I started 8+ years ago. Now, not so much."
good,I liked my job but i was only able to work 4 hours at a time due to child labor laws being very strict. It taught me how the public can be and that they arent always nice and you stil have to tough it out.
good,"Provide quality customer service to our customers in the frozen food, ice cream, eggs, milk and dairy areas.

good,Cool care free place to work. Management was easy to get along with. Hardest part about the job was deciding whether or not your were being conned with the price match
good,"There is a lot of stuff to deal with from management, they are always head hunting and you are just a number.  everything is about that bottom line and there is never any money in the budget. They are always watching you there. I am not just another mad employee I have worked there for many years and I am treated like a punk that just started. Now that's my walmart"
good,"the work environment at Walmart is a lot different from almost all other jobs. Walmart mostly care about productive, meaning lets get the job done."
good,"I love the job because I like working with the public and meeting new people. but, the way Wal-Mart handle their employees, I would not work there again."
good,"a typical day would be coming in and checking the display case for empty holes. i would then fill those empty holes with cakes created by me, any way i liked. i had to base ice and then decorate the cakes as well as fill orders for customers. The hardest part was being the only cake decorator and the best part was gaining more culinary experience!"
good,Management weren't so great. and at times it can be very stressful.  Not the job but managers and supervisors.
good,It has been so long since I worked for Wal-Mart that I don't remember. I'm sorry. I remember very little from when I worked there. Memories not good nor bad. The little that I do remember.
good,"Although it is very quick paced and mainly customer based. I get bounced around the store in a ping pong ball, often get put wherever I am needed and don't accomplish many things in my own department. I also feel that the amount of work you do is worth more than we are paid, just above minimum wage. In this company you are not assured benefits unless working more than a year, over 30 hrs a week and there a year. although the full time workers can get it.; management is nice and know you personally although they care less than you think for your well being."
good,"Management was horrible, only worried about themself an not us as workers under them."
good,"working at walmart helped me advance myself as a sales associate but overall walmart wasn't was I expected it to be. I was denied health care, my checks were being cut due to them not adding all of my hours, and we lacked security and had poor management. However I did enjoy getting in new products and learning about them and sharing what I leaned with customers to sell the products and also helping customers find the product brand that best fits their wants and needs."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart mainly becasue I had the chance to meet a lot of different individuals. Management isn't the best but a job is a job.
good,Hated it no advancement always talked down to like a lesser being. No advancement pay was low
good,"Management wasn't very helpful, I revised little to no training. "
good,benefits are good if you get them. Management is all over the place like chickens with their heads cut off....
good,I worked as a part-time cashier for a little over three years. Customers were almost always plesant and a joy to see but the management was not so great.
good,The pay wasn't worth the job. We worked third shift and had to put up with alot of unecessary stuff just to make minimum wage of 7.25. and then the managers felt like they could just talk and treat the employee as they wanted to.
good,"I thought after a year or two that I could become a full time associate, but no. I have been with this company for four years now. I need something that is full time not part time.  I would not recommend working with this company unless you only need something part time."
good,"Gave me the opportunity to work in a ware house setting, as well as provided 32 - 40 hours on a weekly basis."
good,"This job is a good job for students, also has flexible hours."
good,"I enjoyed my job with Wal-Mart. On a typical day I would Merchandise product and restock, Customer service was my primary role. Help People find items or answer concerns. Did price changes and gave front-end cash support. "
good,Came in at 5 am and started prepping breads. Pulled dated items off shelves and discounted. Stocked shelves and stacked off daily inventory in freezer. Order inventory and cleaned bakery.
good,Hours are not the greatest. Management is never there to help. Management keeps changing every other month. Pay is not the best.
good,They are good with working around other work and school schedules. The pay wasn't very good though.
good,Wal-mart is a very nice place to work and its different from what in used.
good,"It's a great company for starters, I enjoyed the times that I've spent  there and all the new people that I got to meet was great."
good,"My actual job was ok, but we were severely understaffed at my store. Our benefits were a joke!! we were lucky to have at least one manager on duty for overnight shifts. "
good,Really needs to treat there workers better and give them better pay and not fire them after they have a baby and are on leave.
good,"management  sucks a this place, it is fine with them  if some people  stand around and not do anything all day. But for the either worker they have to work twin as work to get the days work done."
good,"This is a good place to get your start as a pharmacy technician however, the wages aren't comparable to other local competitors and the benefits seem to get worse every year."
good,The work is tough and when there is low staff you have to do everything yourself. Management expects you to have everything done even if there are not enough people to get the job done.
good,I liked working for Wal-Mart but I felt it needed more leaders that can take care of issues such as making sure there are people scheduled when needed and to take care problems that surface.
good,"Lots of customer service, even more working freight, and dealing with a ton of different managers. "
good,Great place to work; great experience. I enjoyed my time with Walmart Realty.  The peers and co-workers are the reason why I liked my job. I hope I will have another team experience like this in the future.
good,I was looking for something I could commit to. Walmart is not that if you have a 1/2 of brain !!!
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a group every single day.
good,working for wal-mart was a great work experience and taught me a lot about myself and how to understand customers better. working there taught me self control and how to manage difficult customers.
good,The job starts out fun and rewarding but you quickly get thrown into the deep of it. Most managers are out for themselves and will throw you under the bus the first chance they get in order to avoid getting in trouble. They stress teamwork but punish the ones who help others. As for the good almost all Wal-Mart associates are fun loving people who are great to work with. The job comes with a lot of power and even though you are there a lot its sometimes a fun place to be.
good,Infelizmente me decepcionei com a hierarquia e as maneira das promoções
good,Working at Walmart taught me customer service. A typical day at work would be being on my feet behind a register. I would work in customer service and other departments as well but i was mostly up front as a cashier. Management was horrible. They would not work with me or others. They would down talk me. They had no respect for the employees myself included. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the different types of people that would come in. Dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part was talking to each customer and helping them when they would get frustrated. I also enjoyed being a big help to a lot of the people and the store.
good,"Is retail work, requires initiative and creativity from employees to improve sales.  I will say that management is not good, not prepare to help their employees.  As in every work there are team workers and others that aren't but it relies more in their management than in a specific person."
good,"A typical day at work i would cashier and you'd have to stay at your register all day if no one is near a register to cover you. They would make u walk to an invisible line and ask people are they ready to check out. You have to scan items at a certain speed or they will complain to you about it in meetings but ,weeks earlier tell you it doesn't matter how fast u scan and bag items. The management didn't really do much to help out. I actually stopped going to my managers because 2 csms (customer service managers) had favoritism and things most cashiers did that weren't allowed they got away with but, little things like my hair or being 2 minutes late they would try and write me up. So when i would go to my managers they would try and talk me into working it out even though some things weren't fair. So i actually got fired because i told my supervisor i would call the EEOC because i felt harassed but they said i was excepting tips which was outrageous because every cashier would have been fired if that was the true case. Some of my peers were great people and i met a lot of people i'm actually friends with now. The hardest part of Walmart would be if you have to work overnight (i worked in a 24hr one) so it would be like 1 other cashier on register 16(the smoke counter) and the lines would get really long until the overnight people would come. Hours were good. Every week i could work about 36 hours unless a coworker would ask to switch schedules with me and most of the time supervisors would call you in to work more if it was a busy day or if some one would call out. Also dealing"
good,Busy Always On Call. Etc Too Much Work Poor Management. Wal-Mart is the worst company to work for. In order to get promoted you have to be screwing management or hang out with management outside of work. I think Wal-Mart is a joke they always say they hire from within they like to promote from within but I have seen on numerous occasions they have brought outside people in as management and expect the people who has been doing the job to train them. REALLY... why would I wanna train my boss.
good,overall its not a satisfactory job. plenty of complaints and racism. walmart loves to cut corners and under compensate. the most satisfied employee there would be a young and dumb person. otherwise you know better.
good,"I go to work and look at all the cake orders for the current and next days and then complete as many of those orders as I can. All while I fill the cake case, answer phones, clean, and customer service."
good,"It would be a good place to start as far as starting in customer service, you'll deal with a wide range of customers and learn better how to communicate and deal with people. A typical day at walmart will be constantly dealing with customers, no matter your position. The hardest part about working in walmart will be dealing with management, your co-workers and the workload for the pay. It's an unhealthy environment, can be very stressful for the weak hearted. You'll often be advised by other associates to stay to yourself  when in a healthy environment you're encouraged to branch out and be out-going."
good,"Great job, but hard to get advanced in company.  Stable but can be cut it seems at any time. No loyalty in the company like there used to be."
good,Management has poor communications with each other. Management pushes and expects way to much from it's associates.
good,I have to say that this place is worse than the casino.  The management has no idea how to treat people to keep them.
good,"it was fun working there, i learned alot about cashier, electronic, produce, house and hard ware."
good,"Although management is aware that the overnight crew is terribly understaffed, they neglect to hire on an appropriate amount of workers. I and one other worker are in charge of stocking merchandise for all infants and apparel departments. Due to different schedules; Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I am in alone in departments 23-31, 33-36, and 79. Management is in charge of designating which workers work in certain areas of the store by using the computer task manager. This system also calculates how long each department should take and many workers are given far more than eight hours of work and given attitude when they can't finish. "
good,"They are a big company, so working for them you become just another number."
good,a lot of the same customers tend to visit the store so you become very familiar with the customers easily and nice moderate place to work at
good,"Worked night stock store. Favoritism ."
good,"Wal-Mart did not pay enough money, had constrictive rules, less than 40 hrs was considered part-time no benefits"
good,Its an Ok place to work part time wouldn't recommend full time . Company doesn't teach you any good values.
good,"When I first started there in 2005 it was wonderful. Everything was clean and new and we were provided encouragement and proper staffing.  As time went by the corporate office kept cutting our hours and cutting staffing. When someone left they were never replaced.  I worked in the Electronics dept, ( the busiest area of the store) and at times there was one associate that had to oversee and serve customers in Electronics, The Photo Dept, Site to store internet pickup , pets stationary and crafts. You were given impossible tasks to be accomplished with no regard for providing quality customer service. It was sad to see what I considered MY STORE go downhill just to save money for mgt to get bigger bonus's.  I had been there 9 years and had to take FMLA leave to have a total knee replacement ; I had many complications and ended up taking an extended medical leave without income. When the surgeon released me I met with the store mgr to discuss asking for special accomidations ( use of my cane) and asked to be put at the fitting room to answer phone calls. I was terminated because I could no longer do the job that I had been in.  I was sad to leave my great co-workers and loyal customers."
good,"A typical day at work was unloading and stocking product in the dairy and frozen foods section.  I have learned about organization, as well as safety when handling the heavier items.  Management seemed to not care when there were issues.  Most of the co-workers were okay, some were great team workers, others would slack and do their 8 and they were gone.  Hardest part of the job was being placed in unfamiliar departments without training."
good,Long hours not helpful for someone who have small children.
good,"I've worked at other Walmarts before and they were really good. This one in Woodstock GA sucked. The management team was horrible. I got hurt at work and was doing the workers comp for my dr appts I felt like I was always having to run around to find anyone. Noone in managment want to talk to me for any reason after i got hurt. They would give me dirty looks all the time and talk poorly about me behind my back. When the Dr gave me a note of things I could and couldn't do, they basically just laughed and made me do those things anyways. Tehy were in no way willinng to help me at all. When I contacted the ethics hotline about the situation no one ever got back to me on it. So I quit. Everyone deserves to be treated better than that."
good,"The pay is usually higher than minimum wage and you are able to advance within the store. However, management is very negative when it comes to taking a day off. At customer service they do not follow the policies and you are left holding the stick. Great starter job for high school students."
good,The work was fun because you got to deal with all the customers but when there really wasn't any customers then it was pretty boring. Just walking around making sure the store was clean and dealing with customers.
good,Come and take out of dates product off shelves . Refill old products with new products . Some have to made or unpacked. In the mean time help customers with items that they need to find or answer question they may have . I've learned that in retail the customers are always right . Management was okay and were okay about working with associates. Coworker were good to work with; I got along with all of them. The hardest part of the job was taking care of everyone needs.
good,"Since I worked overnight at Wal-Mart we would have a meeting everyday discussing what was need to be done for that day, after that then we would go to the areas that was assign to us the work was easy but the store I worked at was unorganized a lot of the times I would have a pallet of items that I had to stock didn't even belong to me I would have to walk all over the store just to take the items where they belong and that would cause me to spend less time with what I am supposed to do"
good,"Walmart sucks because you all ways have rule managers, out of 4 of my managers including senor-manager there was one manager that treat me right. When I injure my self because they needed the truck done in 25 minutes. they health care/ benefits is very poor"
good,This job was not bad because I like working with people.  The biggest problem I had was the lack of consistency with my schedule and lack of constant hours per week.
good,Falsely accusing of stealing something i never did of a Religious Candle which cost 1.25 and they falsing accused me of taking it because i braught college books with me in a college bag everyday. Typical Day was Cleaning the Bathrooms after making bails and cleaning the Bone Yard and cleaning the backroom and cleaning the entire store but did not pay anything and you got no respect from upper level management
good,I was a part time worker with no benefits who worked full time hours and double shifts. management was very poor and did not work very well with floor associates. the store was under staffed and over worked the associated it did have. I felt under paid and used I was pushed to my limit mentally by my manager and had to quit because of the mental state I was at while pregnant. my co workers were very nice and would help even if told not to because a pregnant woman should not be lifting 50 pound crates or unloading trucks.
good,If you know the right people you will do just fine if not you have no hope
good,"New opportunities, a typical day at work"
good,"I worked daily with the other cashiers and ran transactions for the customers.  It was an enjoyable atmosphere with friendly coworkers but it was an non-fulfilling job.  It was very repetitive and did not offer a lot of room for growth within the organization.  The management team seemed less involved and invested with their employees and more focused on profit.  However, the quarterly bonuses were significant if the store was profitable."
good,"When I started at Wal-Mart through a temp agency I was quickly hired for being a hard worker, not a day went by that I didn't go in an do what was required of me and moving on to tasks that were not asked of me. After a month of being hired through Wal-Mart, it took me about a month to skip over my probationary period and moved into a high stress position in the IMS team, Over the next 10 months I was scolded or ""talked"" to about how things I was trying to accomplish were not a part of my job description. Even things that I was trained by other associates to do. Management is not very approachable and does not communicate with one another."
good,"Enjoyed working with and meeting new people."
good,It was a experience that I didn't mind next time I would want to work int he back
good,I didn't enjoy working for Wal Mart. The store I worked for was badly managed and understaffed. I stuck it out there for 5 years. I did enjoy the benefits they provided and my co workers.
good,"I would assist customers with finding items they were looking for. I learned how to bin and pick goods. I stocked shelves and built trains and endcaps. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the crazy hours. If it were just days or just evenings it would have been easier to keep a babysitter."
good,love it there very productive good customer reviews good photo skills for employees reasonable skills to use photo machine
good,To much work not enough pay for what one person have to do walmart has a very rude management team they stick by each other no matter if one is wrong or right
good,"A typical day as a cart pusher at my Walmart was dreadful, our Cart Machine was always broken, and i was usually the only one scheduled. The hardest pat of my job though was lunch time, usually right after i just got the carts full id have to leave knowing they'd be empty when i got back, management would blame me, and i would have to run to get carts in until i was exhausted and it repeated day after day. Management could have fixed the cart machine or scheduled one more worker and everything would have been better. i worked my hardest everyday though"
good,muito bom ter feito parte da equipe walmart meus pagamentos eram certos refeiçao no local segurança para trabalhar otimo ambiente de trabalho
good,"it is stressful co-workers like a bunch children, management change from day to day and person to person there is not one set of rules, the hardest part is not knowing what mood management is in, lack of communication, most enjoyable is my customers especially when they return cause of me"
good,I have worked there for three years.  I love the environment and the people that I work with every day.  I have learned how to deal with customers in an efficient way.  Management is not my favorite part of the job you cannot always rely on them for things.  The hardest part of the job is getting pushed and pulled everywhere.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making people smile and see that me helping is making a difference.
good,I did the donuts in the bakery. the people I worked with I enjoyed but management was a different story. They don't care to much about the well-being of their employees.
good,"Our breakroom has cable, a small library and even a couch, therefore not too bad by some's standards."
good,"Let's just say it was not the best job I have ever had. Management didn't really care what employees did. All I did was stock shelves, I wasn't trained properly."
good,They hired me to do a job but then had me switching to different jobs during the day. I didn't get their higher pay either.
good,"Day to day here never was the same, you were the one who either made the customer happy or you got the blunt end of what their problem was.  I learned to be more patient when standing in line waiting to check out.  The management is not great, being a cashier i feel like they are on the bottom of the totem pole and are treated horribly."
good,"Every co-worker I had was extremely unhappy with the place. Management treated employees very poorly, the hours were very sporadic and very inconsistent. People were just overall very unhappy. The hardest part was dealing with angry/unhappy coworkers who would flat out refuse to do their job but the enjoyable part was the few who would work and help get projects done and would help you when you took on other tasks that weren't assigned to you."
good,"Basically I would clean-up, customer service, cash handling, etc. I learned how to adjust watch bands, and batteries, place jewelry orders, etc.  The management depended on who was scheduled easier days with easier going Asst. Managers, harder days with more difficult Asst. Managers.  My co-workers were very easy to get along with.  The hardest part of my job wasn't being put in my department and being short handed.  Interacting with the customers."
good,Working at walmart has not been a very happy experience for me. I am a full time college student and I feel a sif my school schedule is not respected. I have often talked to my supervisors and I feel as if they honestly don't care as long as they get paid. I am currently looking for another job and I hope it comes soon.
good,Tough to get ahead if your not management and not willing to relocate.
good,"A typical day at work was going to the nightly meeting, then doing the unloders job, tehn starting my job, about an hour behind, then getting told to do completely opposite things from the two managers on duty. by the end of the night, I was lucky to have 75% of my work done."
good,"The hardest part of the job was all the changes in management. I am a very flexible and adaptable person, and the management at walmart was unpredictable and expectations and rules differed between each manager and each shift. As with most of my jobs I mostly enjoy the customer service side of it. Being able to help others no matter what the situation is has always been a big part of me."
good,management doesn't really know which way is up. Not really much to tell it' Wal-Mart.
good,"On a day to day basis I was responsible for assisting the Pharmacist on various tasks.  I would take in new prescriptions and insurance informations from patients, fill the prescription, and use the resister to process payment from the patient.  I was also responsible for maintaing inventory levels, and replenishing the inventory using multiple vendors.  Another task as to process stock that was recalled or expired and send it back to our vendors for credit.  I learned a great deal at a quick rate as the previously mentions tasks were all new to me.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work flow as the pharmacy was short staffed.  The best part of my job was helping the patients."
good,I stocked the shelves with fresh freight. Learned to build end caps. Management wasn't appreciative enough. Co-workers was just like all other work places. Hardest thing was getting 18hrs. worth of freight done in just a 7hr. span. The most enjoyable part was getting to learn something new even if it wasn't for me.
good,"The current management at my store is inefficient and puts more stress and more work the employees than they are able to handle.  Management wants more work and not willing to pay anymore for it."
good,Great environment you meet and deal with numerous customers on a daily basis you interact with alot of people
good,"tudo q sei devo a ela,gostei de trabalhar la,conheci pessoas legais ,tive muitas experiencias boas"
good,Empresa multi-nacional onde as oportunidades são desperdiçadas devido ao fato de darem mais oportunidade para os que tem mais amizade e não os que trabalham de forma correta
good,I was typically the opener and used pilot jacks on regular basis. things learned were how to deal with all type of people and smile through anything.
good,too many management changes since 2012 and managers trying to learn their jobs instead of being able to help us do our jobs.  way over picky on some of the small stuff
good,"Very competitive work environment, some peers were very willing to assist, others not so.  First level managers would yell at cashiers in front of customers."
good,"I was grateful for Wal-Mart's expedience in hiring process, yet training left something to be desired. As a corporation, Wal-Mart appears to care about its associates, but on the ground I did not see that to be the case. The manager's often had unrealistic expectations, the communication between associates and managers waxed and waned by individual management team member. I found associates were often disgruntled with established protocols and procedures. "
good,"The top says it all. Walmart is a good starter job for most, a good job  if you can work your way up to management. But for most or all that have worked there 99% will say that the store managers are just not good at what they do. Either they have a click going on or have ""favorites"" they get into first no matter if you work the hardest or been there 15 years. Its sad that this still goes on. II went from Produce to photo lab in 6 months but had to take a 25 cent pay cut? Why? Stocking shelves compared to selling cameras and using complicated equipment that's just non sense. Since it was a small area i worked in and i was the new guy on the black i can understand  people don't want to teach you anything or be helpful till you can ""prove yourself"" in the job your at. Well So i did but when i was picking up things faster than some, the people that have been working in the photo department were to say the least ""upset"" cause i was able to pick up the job very quick. I had to due to the fact they had only giving me a week and a day to get off training and be prepared to be alone with dozens of customers who are all anxious to receive their product. I enjoyed my job even though nobody liked me in my department and even though i would help electronics when they needed it. That is where i wanted to go in the first place but again due to management they had their favorites and i wasn't able to  get that sales position for whatever reason. Overall it was good experience for me to deal with the public and learn customer service. But for most people i recommend that either make friends"
good,This company has a hard time dealing with the balance of work and family life. Just really not a great place to work for people with families.
good,The job culture wasn't fun. I hated going into work and also they were very organized with scheduling.
good,"The hardest part about working at Walmart is never knowing if your managers are going to ""have your back."" There's no trust or respect between managers and their associates."
good,"I was employee #116, I averaged over 115% on order filling, enjoyed the fast pace, but not the Nonpersonal atomsphere. hired for 40 hours a week, but averaged 25-30, commute was over an hour, got laid off in summer months due to lack of shipments leaving distribution center."
good,Hard job to have and keep. Very demanding. Management in some cases need more people skills and training. I am glad just to have a job at this point.
good,a good day at work is doing your daily job. managers are nice when there are not under stress but when they are in trouble they come after you and make it all your fault. my co workers were great i miss them and keep in contact. the hardest part of the job was honestly dealing with the managers.
good,"I walk to the back and clock in. Then I walk to my register, flip on the light and get to work. I work take my required and much needed breaks then I clock out and go home."
good,would be lots of work to do with only one person in on that shift then l would also help on front cash and that ment nothing would be getting done in my department.l learned about stress & frustration & disapointment & biggest of all how the management didn't care about me at all.Some co-workers where good to work with some where just backstabbing . hardest part was all of the STRESS & FRUSTRATION    the best part of my job was going home . I lost my house due to WalMart I told them & ask them for more hours because on the hours I was going to loose my home but they never came up with any more hours for so I lost my home because I could not make ends meet on 12hrs a week .
good,"I was a temporary cashier during the season, thus, I was always scheduled on the busiest days (specifically Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays) at the local Walmart. My typical day was always helping customers with their transactions because I always had a shift between 1pm and 11pm. I hardly had time to stop and clean in between. The co-workers I got to know were pretty cool, willing to joke around, and easy to talk to. What I learned was to improve on my customer service skills. The management were usually on my case about what I was doing on company's time as if they had eyes like a hawk. What management (the managers that were on top of my immediate supervisors) had to offer me was criticism and not the constructive kind. My immediate supervisors were a little kinder, had a little more understanding, and were willing to compromise. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with rude customers or customers giving me a hard time without getting myself in trouble by being kind."
good,A typical at work usually went by fast due to me working the after school schedule.
good,regular day at work working the cook station making sure people orders is right. Management wasn't good with giving people breaks wanting people to do other people job while they take breaks.
good,I was a cashier and a CSM. I was in charge of 15 employees in the front part of the store.
good,"On a typical work day I was in charge of running a register, training new cashiers, running service desk, performing returns and exchanges, filing money grams and money orders, layaway, site to store, covering breaks and lunches for fabrics, jewelry, and automotive, nightly closing of service desk and assisting the CSM with nightly closing of front end and registers. My coworkers were great and I loved the people I worked with. The managers were not so great. They would tell you to follow policies the way they were written but then they would override transaction in the register we were not allowed to do just so they wouldn't have to talk to a customer. The pay is terrible for everything you end up having to do. I was job coded as a cashier but was at service desk everyday. I asked to be coded as a service desk associate and was denied so they wouldn't have to pay me anymore then a cashier salary."
good,Not much of an advancement opportunity and it takes years to get to where you want to be.
good,good place to work and learn new things but look for full time work.
good,"Walmart cares about one thing and one thing only, money. There are few in management that have shown me any kind of real respect. Bottom line is its a mixed bag, some managers are respectful some aren't this isn't even my issue with Walmart, my issue is that even with hard work and respect it is next to impossible  to get a full time position."
good,"Working as a stockman was back-breaking labor and the pay was terrible.  Management was not very good either, with constant staffing shortages and lack of good shift coverage."
good,"walmart was a good start off for me in my career path, but it was not a forever job. some of my managers were willing to understand some of the situations and help me out on learning from them. they also would listen to any problems i was having and help me out on solving them. the people i worked with became like my family. the hardest part of the job was having to deal with some of the worst customers but the enjoyable part was having some customers that i made happy."
good,I come in clock in usually there on time go outside make sure my area is OK if there need to be a swept i do it cart need to be push do it then eventually they cal me inside to help so first i go to help out the cashier and jump on a line or do put backs (Returns from customer. Also if they need some shelf restocked or product put on the for i try to accomplish that also basically anything they need me to do i am able to do it.
good,"I was a cashier, working with customers ringing up their items they wanted to purchase. I learned different ways to help the customers, coworkers were awesome to work with, but the management was not. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet all day. the enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"A typical day at work would be managers not knowing the basic skills or necessities that a sales associate knows. Co-workers were irresponsible, and not team players. I enjoyed learning various skills for different departments within the store. The scheduling for work was not lenient to my schooling needs."
good,"constant pace of work, very straining, and great place to meet new people."
good,Wal-Mart has changed so much over the years ten years ago it was fun and liked to go to work but now people are disliking it
good,"Muita correria não é para todas as pessoas,indico para jovens que procuram o primeiro emprego,e que sejam solteiros pois devido as atividades, não terá tempo para família ou relacionamentos sérios,não terá vida social fora da empresa."
good,No ahi sueldos atrativos es estable  pues depende mucho de los que dirijan la tienda para crear un trabajo agradable existen favoritismos
good,"I have learned to work safely in a warehouse area, and data entry, the hardest part of the job is with the strange hours they give you for your task times along with other tasks to do during your main task (taking time away from actual work), the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers. And Management varies. Some management is awesome and they're easy to get along with versus others who bring those to feel like they are two feet tall and leave the associates with their head hanging low."
good,glad i worked there; learned a little about everything around the store. co workers were kind and helpful.
good,"fun to work here, learned alot of diiferent and new ways to sale merchandise."
good,"management....confusing and inconsistant,questionable integrity.with day to day conflicts among mangers and supervisors with the outcome falling beneath their job status....an unfair and demeaning atmosphere"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart I work in 4 service areas by myself. I have learned many things by working in so many areas. I mix paint, customer service, stock shelves, sell guns and call in background checks, do hunting and fishing licenses, cut fabric, and run register. My management team is somewhat helpful but not always willing to help. The hardest part of the job is working on an entire side of a store by yourself. My co-workers are helpful and enjoyable to work with. I like that I get to meet so many different people on a day to day basis."
good,Was Ok when the day got started I learned how do drive A forklift there Co workers was fun to be around being the only one to load 30 trucks by myself
good,long and boring. co workers were established and did not welcome new hires
good,"Started in receiving and stocking, was moved to cleaning staff with no  notice.  Exposure to cleaning chemicals caused issues with pregnancy, and then was moved Men's department."
good,"Management made everything harder on me after finding out that I was pregnant. They put me in areas that I would have to lift far more than usual, and even yelled at me for asking for help from another working to lift a bunk bed. The co workers were great though."
good,"Working harder than any other associate for less hours and less pay is very depressing. The job could be extremely stressful, especially when shorthanded and the management WOULD not help. The best thing I learned was time management and efficiency at whatever I did; which was not limited to my specified job. The only job I didn't do was be a manager."
good,"I enjoyed seeing what goes on in a pharmacy. Everything is very fast paced when it comes to filling orders and keeping customers happy and healthy. One thing I didn't like about the time I worked here was the typical Walmart ""drama"". Everyone always had something to say about anothers way of working or lack of."
good,Over worked and under paid.  You are asked to do too many task in the time allotted.
good,"Very stressful, not because of the workload but due to the lack of Mangement Support. Managment did not work as a whole, they let employees do as they pleased with no reprecutions,  constantly having to pick up the slack of others (including managment duties),  didnt work to resolve outstanding issues,  even after using their Open Door Policy.  The hardest part was coming in and the best part was going home."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was just a job. You barely get paid for your time, and you work really hard for awful customers. The customers are worse than the management, some of the Assistant Managers are good, but most of them are a big pain, but they do work long, long awful hours."
good,I don't miss this place but I do miss my co-workers. I initially started working at Wal-Mart and enjoying myself but it seemed that every other month there was a new manager because the previous one had gotten fired so it was hard to keep up with everything and all of the adjustments. I worked there for almost 3 years and the one time that I needed to take a leave of absence to finish out my final year of volleyball and enter the nursing school; I was denied the right to take a leave of absence. I even followed the procedures of writing a letter to headquarters and pleading with them. They denied my request without consideration of my loyalty to the company. I hate that I had to make a decision but I was not going to mess up my chance of getting into a nursing school.
good,"I was mostly on the express lane and sometimes on belt, I learned the produce codes and my most favorite part about being a cashier at Walmart is the scanning the items into the system"
good,The job was hard but I made it through it. Pay wasn't that great but it helped on the bills.
good,Come in every day and help customers with car and/or tire issues.
good,It was ok but I wouldn't reccommend it for anyone. Long work hours but low pay. Barely willing to work with my schedule.
good,"At a certain location, their management skills is bad; and they fratinize with one another and don't get in trouble because they are managers and supervisors."
good,It's not the worst place i have every worked but i never get to see my baby and i was told im full time and came to find out when it was time to put in for insurance that they have me as part time so i now do not qualify and so now my little one has no insurance. also they will not work with me so i can work opposite shft from my fiance because can not afford childcare at the amount we make currently
good,we where trained to put the customer first well for management customer was not first on 3ed shift other then that it was a great place to work i met and help alot of good people
good,"Cash office where cash is handled daily, chekes, wic, etc.. Bookeeping"
good,"Supervise Department Managers on their daily task, to ensure they are completed I a timely manner"
good,"Working for walmart has its ups and down, The managers are some what understanding and can be hard to talk to. co workers are great and very understanding and caring."
good,"Management of Wal-Mart is so backwards when it comes to how they interact with associates. They don't work well together, inconsistent in their communication, extreme favoritism, and not to mention the low pay."
good,alot to say .. no hours ..you barley get a raise of ten cent a year
good,customers would call in about their cable problems and we would fix them or send someone out to fix the problem
good,"worked hard, but no advancement, unless you favored (sexually)mgmt."
good,"I worked the customer service desk, there was constant business. The hardest thing to deal with was how most of the customers complained about things that were out of my control."
good,My supervisor was a jerk. I felt like I was under the thumb of the gustapo.
good,Its way too many hours and too much is expected of one person.
good,Management needs to improve. Not a very stable environment.
good,"ive been there 2 years no benefits."
good,The only good thing were the customers you were able to interact with each day.
good,It's anoik place to shop but not to work. It just seems like there are favorites there.
good,"It was very challenging due to the fact we only had 3 to 4 people scheduled to work daily. I've learned that a job is truly what you make it. Sadly, I hated their management bc they acted if they didn't care about their employees. I loved everyone of my co-workers they made me keep going for the seven or eight mos. I was there. The hardest part about the job was closing by myself which was difficult to do in three hours and successfully close in Wal Mart standards. I enjoyed the customers the most, they made me feel appreciated everyday."
good,management not very well trained. no real chance for promotion. it was a steady 40 hours and you sometimes received a bonus.
good,The business just started but its an okay place of business as of now the workers are mostly nice.
good,"A typical day at wal-mart consisted of cashiering and zoneing, zone leaders and co-workers were awsome teachers and taught me alot about how to run a sales floor, and haveing the wier computers to communicate whare you wanted to go in the company, it is really exciteing. "
good,I worked about 25 hours a week and that was not enough at the time. The hardest part of my job was receiving such low pay and low hours.
good,I think that this company needs to give the employees that work hard for them compensation for their efforts.
good,It was an okay job.  I enjoyed greeting customers that came in and most of my co workers were great people.
good,"The current Walmart I work at hashorrible management, therefore it makes the lives of the workers a little rough."
good,"Boa empresa, mais desorganizada e com excesso de cargos de liderança. Cultura ótima"
good,I liked the co workers but it was hard to advance and you were limited to shifts
good,Nice people to work with.  Higher management very disorganized.  Learned a lot about how to deal with people.  How to work with little or no support.  How to work when you are very understaffed.
good,"Walmart has changed over the years. The management doesn`t seem to care about the employees. They want the work done but morale is very low there. You don`t know how many hours or days you will get or if your last day is tomorrow. "
good,"while walmart did try to work with my schedule due to college there were several occasions when they did not take me off the schedule when i was told they would for college, this resulted in me getting in trouble, many management does not understand associates needs."
good,"long nights, learned lots from working at walmart. co-workers were really good people. hardest part was working 3rd shift. most enjoyable part was receiving bonus checks."
good,The hardest part of my job was watering the garden center and not closing a sale.
good,Start the day scanning out merchandise to send to sales floor to get worked.  Organized the back room while making sure all merchandise was scanned in correctly.  Learned how to manage a group of 4 associates in the back room and helping my manager in any other duties. The hardest part of the position was making sure things didn't get out of control at the end of the day.  I enjoyed coming in to work and working with the associates night and day.
good,walmart had wonderful customers and a great lower management team as well. A typical day included scheduling your cashiers and where you wnat them placed. Going through the day doing daily audits on draws. Customer Service was a must non stop interaction with customers each day majority upset.
good,"I try really hard to just get my work done. But managers are not around when I need one. We call managers the take a long time to come, customers complain but nothing changes."
good,This company is hard to work for if you have a family. Family is not first in their eyes.
good,"Enjoyed working with customers and interacting and meeting new people"
good,"A tpical day at work would involve me clocking in, going to my assigned register, checking out customers. Going on my break & lunch, returning to work & either going back to my register, customer service or doing shop backs."
good,"The training I received was inequate, you were expected to check out customers with scales that kept breaking done, belts to bring purchases down to where you could reach the merchandise that wouldn't work, and not worry about chemicals contamenating food products or spills on the other purchases.  Whenever you asked for extra training in a certain area you never received the training you asked for.  My co-workers were great yet weren,t allowed to talk to you about things you need help with while on break.  The best part of my job was taking care of my costumers.  I actually hated to take a break."
good,Ok place to start out. There are lots of different positions to try out.
good,It could be a good place to work but they treated me bad while i was pregnant. I was barely pregnant when I was hired so i didn't know I was. When I told them I could no longer lift heavy stuff they treated me bad.
good,It is a okay job to start out with. I didn't like it for me because of management.
good,They make accusations and dismiss good people from their employ for/with false claims just to hire new staff.
good,"I worked the front desk (customer service desk) most of the time, learned more about how to treat customers and help them achieve a better service with us, management was pretty good understand helpful, co workers were fun and easy to get along with and helpful. the hardest part was when you couldn't help the customer even though tried. when you helped a customer and they were so happy ."
good,"work was fast pace and fun "
good,"fast pace"
good,Walmart needs to appreciate the employees who go out f their way to meet the needs of their customers and go beyond their duties. I had to quit my job with Walmart and start all over after being with the company for 5 years and also serving as safety team leader for 2 of those years. Its very upsetting that I don't even get that work credit.
good,"Pay wasn't that good, neither was benefits. Not really enough hours. Enjoyed getting a paycheck every week"
good,"Rules are all laid out when you start. You can come in 15 minutes late and not get in trouble. Most enjoyable part is the co-workers I met and became friends with. I learned everything about how to work in a deli here. Very clean, management comes and makes sure things are cleaned and held up to standard. K-chemical who Walmart buys cleaning supplies from comes and checks the store, also the health department."
good,"I had gotten a job there as a cashier when I was 12 weeks pregnant. When I hit 20 weeks, I started to have complications during my pregnancy that my doctor told me could cause me to lose my child. My doctor wrote me a note saying that I needed a stool to continue to work. My supervisor told me they don't ""provide"" cashiers with stools and denied me one and instead cut my hours to 4 hours a day. I still continued to struggle and I missed work because of being in pain from my complications, and due to that I lost my job. I've even talked to other employees at other Walmart locations and they didn't understand why I was denied a stool when it's VERY common for cashiers to get stools for complications that disable them from standing for long. I felt cheated and degraded because I needed help that my employer did not provide for me. I will not be seeking employment from this Walmart location again."
good,The job was not a bad job but as far as the managements lack of planning and trying to sabotage eachother to make themselves look better it a extremely difficult place to work for alot of people. most of the associates get terminated for personal issues with management or theft usually. The coworkers for the most part get along with eachother. The job was fairly easy once you get into the routine of things. The most enjoyable part was finally reaching payday after the two excruciating weeks your waiting too be paid each pay period.
good,"Walk the area to ensure safety, water the plants inside and outside, customer service on the phone and on the floor. Cashiering, putting merchandise on the shelves, claims tags, helping in other areas of the store. I learned that by volunteering in other area of the store I could be more knowledgeable of where items were to better assist the customers. My co-workers were always kind and helpful. "
good,"short handed"
good,"A typical day at work is to complete any/all notes given by the Store Manager and to follow Daily Routines per SOP's. Each day is different and based on freight flow, number of associates, holidays-just basically anything the entire store needs-be ready to do it. Must be versatile and able to change directions at any given moment. I have learned to 'turn on a dime', the hardest part of the job for me was lack of planning for upcoming events and scheduling which I adapted to the Wal-mart way as they operate although the hardest part of the job is knowing that I could make a difference with the planning skills I have. I could and would love to make a difference by incorporating a structured training program which would give associates more information to do their jobs with les frustration as well as set them up for success as well as lower the turnover rate and increas customer satisfaction and instock conditions."
good,Great work experience however the management was two face and lies all the time.
good,"Walmart has lost its way in the corporate culture by allowing regional managers to bully and beat their store management into submission on issue after issue. The morale at almost any Walmart you go to stinks, and that is because they have quit adhering to the core values that made Sam Walton so successful. They have let the bottom line become everything and the customer is left out. Worse than that, if you think they treat customers poorly, you need to see the way they treat the average associate -- it's very bad. Everybody has to remind themselves daily: ""I am lucky to have a job,"" otherwise the urge to quit would become overwhelming. But that only goes so far and after the 1000th customer complaint, that you are powerless to fix, something breaks inside you. Certainly not the company that I would ever consider working for again."
good,"I will never work there again, long hours, short breaks, hardly any managers around to help, training wasn't worth the time because the trainers didn't teach"
good,"This is a great starter job, but I wouldn't make this a career. There isn't very much opportunities to advance."
good,I couldn't stand to work for people who are not qualified or able to do the job they were given.
good,"typical day at work was gathering for the meeting."
good,"you had to be in the click with management or you didn't have a chance to advance. "
good,Wal-Mart is a pleasant work place and does have benefits available to full time employees
good,you would clock in stock merchandise look for more products in other location of the store . Never able to finish up due to stock was never in the rite place. Managers never know what we all had to go through with customers and why we took so long and they yelled at us for goofing off when we were help customers. 
good,"Must have patience in dealing with elderly needs and financial requirements.  Spending six hours a day with one customer in that entire time becomes very arduous.  The responsibilities grow with the trust and friendship.  The management was very poor.  The demands were too high for little pay.  Nothing compares to the friendships you earn, however, this job is a dead end.  "
good,"I would clock in and there would be a mad rush of people without enough registers open, naturally."
good,"Very unorganized"
good,"Walmart is a company, but it doesn't value their employees knowledge to become better workers."
good,"It's a retail position. They really don't have much work/ life balance anymore and are pretty strict on emergencies. If you wanted a day off, 3 weeks in advance to put it in, but it wasn't guaranteed that you'd get it off. I might have stayed a little longer if they paid me better and gave more hours and had better management."
good,"Depends on who you work with, if u dont have fun people with you, itll be boring"
good,Walmart was not good with management.Plus they  were not  good  with schedules for  students.
good,"First off the employees they hire most of the time cheat on drug tests because they still use the old urine test so there are multiple employees that sit in the parking lot at break and do drugs in their cars, obviously this causes accidents and hostile work environments. Most of the managers were promoted based alot on favoritism and thus have no management skills, this led to further favoritism and just  an all around poorly ran store,"
good,easy going day coworkers were good and the middle of the day was the best
good,"During my work at Wal-Mart I noticed that there was little to no communication going on between the managers, problems were not being addressed correctly and there was no effort to change what was wrong."
good,Full time was consider 21 hours. So when it was slow your hours got cut.
good,"there was quite  difficulty with  overt racism against each other,  favoritism  between mangement , some staff.  If the person being   spoken about or against, said anything,  they got a religious lecture, amongst other things.  What church someone went to and their race counted a lot more than  dong a good job a lot of times.   I'm still friends with folks who work there still. altho most are pretty much gone."
good,"Everyday product pack and artwork development with Merchandisers. Learned about the infant/toddler business. Demanding managers in an intense work environment. Enjoyed working with all departments including Womenswear, Menswear, Plussize, Accessories and Outerwear."
good,"We are expected to 60hours worth of work done in 40 or less. You are always in fear of losing your job, because every little thing can be a reason for a coaching offense or even termination. Your reminded of this everyday by management. You have Assistant Managers that are rude, degrade people, and create low moral. The worse part of that is upper management know of the problems and yet they allow it to go on. Not family friendly, Wal-Mart makes it difficult for you to have to take time off if your child is sick. Since there are a lot of single parents that work there and a lot of them will lose there job because of to many absences, even when they have a doctors note. Or you have the ones that rely on daycare and if your child is ill and daycare wont take them you have to take the day off, and again even if the daycare writes a note stating that if the child is sick they are not allowed at daycare (or even some schools) until they are no longer sick. Like I said just not very family friendly."
good,The only thing this company has going for it is 10% discount on non food items and the insurance available for part-time employees. They are not flexible with time off; they do not accept doctor's notes for excused absences. 
good,"Everything is fine at first, but after a bit, you find that the values they talk to you about in orientation are not really believed in anymore.  The management stabs each other in the back to try to make themselves look good, and sacrifice associates that work hard to roles that take less responsibility when they persue management opportunities."
good,fun place to work when you first start working there you will get closing shifts everyday
good,A typical day at work is managing cashiers and solving problems that may occur with customers. What I learned from working at Walmart is how to set planograms for other departments as well as for the front end. I managed at least 20 poeple at one time. My co-workers loved when I came to work because I worked with them to make sure that all task were completed in a timely manner. The hardest of my job was too many bosses..One boss tells you to do one thing one way then another boss tells you to do it another way . Communication was always off at this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people.
good,"Restocking products as delivered on a daily bases."
good,"I liked working for Walmart, enjoyed the cart pushing and helping people. But the Walmart I worked at lacked in management.no training in unloading they just pushed you out there, and no teamwork or team lift."
good,"I stocked the floor, tables, hooks, displays,coolers, freezers with merchandise on a nightly basis. It can be very physically exhausting work, I had to work over time almost every night and not get paid for it, unless it was christmas time."
good,"I was hired on with the option to move to the department I requeted, I worked night shift, with the belief that I could transfer to electronics within 2 weeks for that spot to open up, but was denied"
good,"The particular Wal Mart I worked at was a good store. Management was on top of things, knew what was going on at all times. As employees, we could openly discuss any digressions and work on actively coming up with solutions in order to make sure the store ran smoothly.  "
good,it was pretty basic management sucked and the co workers were good.
good,"I just go to work do my Job and go Home."
good,Deli was horrible. Always short staffed. Management could never keep anyone in the Deli for more than 3 months or so before they quit. Drama among co-workers. Customers were mean a lot of the time and not understanding. Management expected you to do all of this work. Terrible. Just go to college.
good,"It is okay if you don't have anything else like school or another job that you have to have to supplement income.  A typical day you will be told to do one thing 10 different ways by 5 different people, but the coworkers are okay.  "
good,I enjoyed my co-workers they were plesant to work with. I enjoyed checking customers out and helping them find things. More so the interaction with people was great. I learned alot about money transactions and how customer care should be.
good,"I would help people print pictures, I would develop film, sell cameras, run the register, and help people. I learned that people can be nice to you if you are nice to them, and rude to you if you are rude, I also learned there are a lot of chemicals that are necessary to develop film. Upper management was great, the department heads had a little abuse of power complexes. The co-workers were great people that had no problem switching a shift with you if something came up. The hardest part of the job is when you are in a photo lab sometimes it can be two extremes where there is no one and then there are 20 people all at once. I liked doing the weekly maintenance on the printer with the intricate cleaning of the components."
good,Typically everything runs smoothly. I do have some good days and bad days. I've learned to adapt to different personalities and situations.  Some of management are very helpful and would make sure you have and understand everything there is to do.  Then there are some in management that don't deserve to be there.  The hardest part of my job is having an unsatisfied customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers troubleshoot and solve their issues with products and services we have at Walmart.
good,they kept piling things on me that i felt was not my job to do. I had a schedule that was set and they wanted me to add more and more on the list.
good,A typical day at walmart is not in your section that you were hired for. Unless you're a Cashier or work in a Specific place. I've learned a lot at Walmart from getting pulled to ALL departments. Some co-workers were nice. Others not so much. The hardest part of the job is when you're assigned to do something and you can not complete it because management is dragging you everywhere else! The most enojoyable part of the job was being able to take 1 hour lunch breaks.
good,"Walmart is a busy working place, so there isn't any dull moments. However employees are not always thought of or considered and are typically used more than appreciated and valued. It was a good working experience because one can learn how to multitask, gain customer service experience, and learn how to maintain composure in pressing situations. "
good,Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. Advancement is very easy if you work hard. Management could definitely be better and so could the scheduling. However they do give a fair amount of hours. There was nothing hard about this job. During my employment with Wal-Mart I learned how to deal with customers in all capacities. 
good,A day at work was very similar to that of any cashiering job. However communication between management and employees was sub par. 
good,"*Busy"
good,"I work 8 a.m. - 5: p.m.  My day begins with restocking and organizing shelves, binning the overstock, waiting on customers, zoning and problem solving."
good,"I found that no matter the effort put in, only the favorites had a chance to advance"
good,"The typical day at work was go to a 30 min meeting then according to a set time schedule replenish product like cans of soup, cereal boxes and many other item's on the shelving. Along with greeting and assisting customers with finding product around the store. The management are wonderful people. But was stressed many times. I loved working with my coworkers, many of them enjoyed me being around. I guess that I brought that you belong here feeling to many of them. I cared for them very much. I always loved listening to them when they had a complication and I was always eager to help and assist them."
good,"Every day is different.Sometimes you may have a lot of freight.There are times when you work back stock only. I""v learned a great deal about customer service..Management  look for leaders.someone that can work  on their own.you have to learn to multitask.meeting people and helping them find what they need when they need it ,Productive,advancements makes it all worth it."
good,"Walmart thrives on offering convenient opportunities to its customers through its well organized facilities. In addition to its product, Walmart offers convenient services such as Tire and Lube, walk-in medical clinics and money centers."
good,"Nice place to work but manegement does not employee friendly."
good,"The management at Walmart is poor. They don't really care about the customers, just the amount of money they make during the course of the day. The customers are, for the most part, pleasant and your co-workers are fun and help the day go by with ease. "
good,"A typical day at work could be anything from a very quiet day of putting away stock and having minimal amount of customers to a very busy day with many customers.  This all depends on the day of the week and what calender day it is.  Management for the most part pitches in and helps out, but sometimes it can get crazy.  The hardest part of the job is when you have difficult customers and even though you try your hardest you can't help them.  I do enjoy talking to the customers and doing my best to help them find things in the store."
good,I've learned how to operate a cash registar. I've improved my customer service greatly. I've managed great relationships with my co worker. The hardest part of the job is not getting my money rounds on time it makes it very difficult to work. but it also helped to still make the customer happy while waiting. 
good,"A typical day at work includes picking products, packing, and preparing customer orders to be shipped. I have learned a lot about packing and shipping regulations, as well as how to manage large important orders for customers. The hardest part of the job is finding products that need to be shipped out that are not in the right location in the store. There is a lot of time spent on trying to find products because on hand counts are off. I love working with my co-workers because we all get along and work as a team to get the job done. However, management is very tough. There is a lot of negativity from the managers and almost no praise for doing a good job. We always have the negatives brought to our attention and rarely do we get praise for a hard days work or even if we perform above and beyond what is expected of us. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge of finding the products customers order. I always strive for excellence and 100% on my scores. The customer is the most important part of what I do, and making the customer 110% happy is my goal everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is challenging myself to do more everyday. I love being able to look at my numbers at the end of the day and seeing i have made so many people, that can't shop themselves, happy and fulfilled."
good,Its not a safe workplace because if someone gets injured they don't provide benefits.
good,"I was assigned a handheld scanner, which I used to scan multiple bins. these bins were filled with merchandise the floor could be replenished with. I was also responsible for daily audits and counts for the entire backroom."
good,When I first got the job I thought it was going to be great. Until I realize they are the worst company you can work for. They have you doing everything in the store that is not in your job description.
good,"Very hardworking locations. Sometimes felt like the staff would expect a little to much when they wouldn't give 100% of their best effort. Would I work there again, sure, night stocker, no. Took to much time from life & school."
good,"working the night shift, there was proabably more pressure than any employee would receieve during the day. Store manager held his nose high. The rest of the management showed off to eachother. The workers, well, we were nothing to them. the best part of this job was not the pay. it sure wasnt the treatment. It mustve been when we werent there. the most enjoyable part? an hr lunch break to get away"
good,I like working at wal-mart was not that bad of a job i learned working as a team was great.i like my co-workers but the management was not so great .the hardest part was too many management people and not so many people working.
good,"A Typical day at work is come in at 4pm and cleanup behind first shift meaning weather its from trash or moving pallets around with no room having to work with. I Learned that you should listen to your workers, their your best ideas generating. As far as management goes its to many chiefs and not enough Indians. The hardest part of the job is dealing with coworkers who don't care about weather the job gets done gets done or not. The most enjoyable part of the job is laughing with a couple of coworkers."
good,"I did love working there on some nights depending on the manager, A typical night at work was hectic at times especially on a holiday. Some of the managers where nice to work with but then you have the ones that forget your only human. The co-workers were very helpful to others and nice, The hardest part about my job was being switched from floor to cashier whenever they wanted. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet and work with new people and of course the sweet customers from time to time."
good,A typical day at work was very hetic. i learned patience and how to deal with management that really didnt work with their employee's. I loved my co-workers they made my day so much better and i think the hardest part of the job was not having enough hours. the most enjoyable part was being with my co-workers.
good,i would put up the prescription and helpm the customers when i got in there then if there was anything else to do i would go out around the area and help stock and strenghen.I liked working with the people around me they were very helpful when i just started. The job wasnt really hard when i learned the computer but when i could find the prescriptions that would be the hardest part. I enjoyed this job because i love meeting and working with new people
good,disrespectful management personnel...missing hours...no overtime..constant threat of not having a job...only good thing working there was the people i meet.
good,"Honestly: I learned to lie, while using a cashier and helping customers."
good,A typical day would be unloading two trucks and pulling merchandise to the sales floor.
good,Overnight stocker makes the most money. Entry-level management makes considerably less. High pressure production with no work/life balance. Advancement is hard to come by and may have to take a pay cut to get it.
good,I worked there for almost three years when they fired me in june 2009
good,"My typical day at work was i opened the jewelry dept. which consist on zoning my area ( putting items back on the shelves, pegs, and in showcases, putting away returns , wipes the glass in the showcases sweeping etc) helping the early morning shoppers,( checking them out when lines are long for the front end,) fix customer watches, replace bands and batteries, returns on jewelry, place orders that customer placed the day before, ship out ring sizing or claims that was processed the the day before, do price changes and counts on jewelry and some times other departments. When some one comes in at ten, i go to the shoe dept. and start work there,because the cut the employee down in our area. There i process shoes ( taking boxes off a palate that located in the backroom, opening them, taking the boxes of shoes and placing them on shevles or pegs.) zone the area (pick up things lying area and sweeping the floor), stock the shevles and pegs. Some times Im called to help other managers in there area if they are short handed. Though out my day im called to go back to jewelry to give breaks, lunches, and handle customer complaints or help with customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers that i have meet though my journey at Walmart. They were alway in the store and they came in to just say hi when they didnt need help in jewelry just want to check on me to see how everything was going. To me that showed me that i had did a great job on helping them and helped enjoyed their shopping exeprience at Wal-mart. I also enjoyed my dept manager. She understood siturations and"
good,walmart is all right it good company no move up in company i need a better job
good,Wal-Mart DOESN'T care about family. They work you super hard. management doesn't say any type of respect.
good,"A typical day at work for me.is usually crazy, There is a lot of getting pulled in many directions. And while that is to be expected in a retail environment, it seems to be more frequent because we are always understaffed."
good,Handle customers in ways that would provide excellent customer service! How to deal with managers that do not care about thier employees. Not enough hours!
good,WM is not as bad as people say it is. you just have to go into it knowing that mediocrity rules
good,ok fun at times difficult at others management was difficult to work with associates were great not a good place to be in management at if you have a family.
good,"For the most part it was a nice workplace. If you are kind to the customers MOST with be kind to you. Co-workers are often friendly, and everyone works together. The only issue would be some of the managers. Some are nice, caring, and make great friends, while others may make it harder to cooperate with. Simple put its an acceptable temp. job if your just trying to work somewhere and make a little extra $. But every job has its complications."
good,I got fired because the guy that got me in to wal mart told off the store manager. The guy that got me in got fired and so did I.
good,Long and boring
good,There is always a lack of employees on duty which causes one employee to cover multiple departments while management is all cozy in their office.
good,"my review I'm sure will be different then others, I enjoyed working as a cashier I got to be the last person customers saw before leaving the store. So i always made an impression to ensure they would return."
good,Nice place to work the pay was ok and the other enpolyees were easy to get along with
good,"minimum wage,poor managment, no full time work, nobody seems to know what they are doing customer service is terrible most associates walk the other way when they see a customer overall not a very rewarding job"
good,"A typical day is there isn't one. Everyday there's something different they give you do. If you worked retail before, Wal-Mart really does not teach you anything new. A good attribute about Wal-Mart is the customer comes first. The thing I disliked most about Wal-Mart is they throw you into tasks you aren't familiar with without giving you much explanation."
good,was not the best or the worst company to be employed by....cannot say it was all bad. the good was far and few....
good,Seasonal work unloading trucks. Lots of work with the hoiliday seasons and I loved being busy. Loss of hours due to holidays ending.
good,"Eu aprendi muita coisa de limpeza,bater o cartão de entrada e saida gostei muito de trabalhar no wall mart supermercado só que eu tinha que ficar trocando de horário a noite toda um mês e um mês de manhã só folga só na semana e um domingo por mês mais as pessoa que trabalhou comigo muito legal agora não tem mais ninguém trabalhando lá na minha época forão todos mandado em bora. Eu mesmo pedi a minha demissão por eu estava muito cansada de trabalhar direto por quando folga um domingo não tem direito de folgar na semana tem que trabalhar o sete dia pra ter folga na outra semana por isso que eu sai dessa empresa dois anos."
good,"its a pay check, depending on your location every walmart can bring you a diferent vibe"
good,"Management never on the same page, co-worker can be sometimes lazy. Always working holidays."
good,A challenging job which could have been made alot better with abit of understanding in terms of schedule given
good,"use to be water plants outside , help customers, learned to mix paint, make keys , sell firearms ,fishing and hunting license , .have alot of good co-workers , hardest part of job is different management , have good ones now , but have had to deal with the couple of bad ones . most enjoyable part of this job is the customers , i am a people person and can get along with anyone ! this is my part-time evening job and i do enjoy it ."
good,I love how fast my shift flys by but i do not appreciate how management doesn't even know who you are! They don't know your name and they don't give you any credit for how hard you work.
good,"Overall I enjoy the retail environment and love working to help customers. I have only been with the company for a short time but with the other retail companies I have worked for, I am not impressed with WalMart. I'm not the best but I do take a lot of pride in myself and my capabilities to do my job but this company revolves through employees so fast that they don't seem to notice talent or care about the way their employees are treated or how the store looks to the customer. As a consumer myself I will not go down an aisle or finish shopping in a store that is disorganized and understaffed. They claim they are flexible with hours but I have not had any manager interested in working with me on my scheduling. They really, in my opinion, need to work on keeping employees that are retail and customer oriented and take care of those employees."
good,I been at Walmart now over 6 little short of a year and my thoughs are the pay doesnt match the work put out but I am blessed to be working and thankful for this oppurtunity
good,"Walmart is supposed to be one of the largest retail company in the work. But you might ask why do the have so much of a turn over problem? 1. Lack of any true training for the associate, they just throw you out there and hope you get it right. If your not its your fault. 2. The Management is incompetent and self centered I don't know how anything ever gets done. 3. Finely, they make a billion dollars or so profit every year so why don't they pay their employees better? It all boils down to they just don't care."
good,"To be quite honest working at my establishment was not one I ever came close to enjoy, The employees I worked with would gossip and had little to no respect. I myself was spoken about for no necessary reason just a week or so of being employed.with all do respect I believe my location needs MUCH improvement."
good,A typical day at work was making sure our customers were happy and giving great customer service. I learned that everyone is different in their work ethic and personality plays a huge role in how people are treated and want to be treated. The hardest part of this job was trying to communicate with non-English speaking customers. The most enjoyable was when I helped a customer out and they are grateful.
good,e uma empreza que se prioza muito nao viza os fucionarios .dia tipico de trabalho as vezes os ficais esquecem que vc ainda nao almoco ou jantou.a gerencia nunca ta disponivel para os funcionarios.tudos que trabalharam comigo erao pessoas maravilhosas.quando aparecia um cliente querendo nos acredir.quando passamos clientes com muita tranguilidade e de bem com a vida.
good,"It's a great job for young people, but anyone trying to support a family or save up some money will be disappointed."
good,"Had a lot to do in 8 hour shift,keep milk and eggs full,kept orders up so there would be no outs,helped customers everything that need to be done was done"
good,"Decent Job, decent pay, friendly customers.Job was a litle stressful but I enjoyed it. Left work feeling a sense of accomplishment."
good,"Worked alone in there cash office daily,"
good,"Labor jobs are never easy,but this one took the cake! Never before have I had to redo certain things so many times because the bosses didn't have the communication skills amongst themselves to get on the same page of planning.I learned that it's no wonder why there's so much angst in some workplaces,But despite the managements inability to get on the same page,the laborers tried to do their jobs to the best of their abilities.The hardest part was making heads or tails out of the bosses plans,and the best part was being able to rise above the misguidance and finish the job ahead of schedule anyways!"
good,I think Walmart is a good place to work if you are a student or young person. But one who needs more income to support family this may not be the best job. One needs to work for a full year before getting onto the Medical benefits which is awful.
good,Managers doesn't listen to employee at all. Stay on cell phones more than anything.
good,"the customers and the other employees were great to work with, however there was favoritism and lack of discipline on the end of management."
good,"I started out as a cashier but soon applied for the dept manager position since it was open. I was responsible for replenishing merchandise, making sure everything in my department was right"
good,I worked in two stores and the first store was very nice. I worked with every level of managmet and was treated well. My second store was the oposite.
good,Management was not supportive. There answer to issues' is get it done in the time I give you to do it'. Other employee back stabbing was terrible. Never think you have a friend at walmart. They are trying to get info out of you that you might have done something wrong.
good,a typical day at work
good,"while working at the Washington Courthouse wal-mart i perforrm many task that are essential to the everyday inventory of the store. myself and the team i am apartv of do all the backroom and back stock inventory as well as camparing those numbers to the items on the sales florr to determine what to order, and how much of each item to order."
good,"Pay was only increased .60 over the course of two years, and management was not helpful/progressive"
good,"Management has a bad attitude towards employees with the thoughts that they don't care if they loose employees and demand too much in so little time or make employees choose work over family, cause as they say there is plenty of other people needing a job."
good,"Hard work, you have to maintain a percentage everyday. Benefits Excellent, management poor."
good,"You work hard doing your job. They don't train you for the job. You are expected to know what the job entails and just do it. The only training you will receive is on the cash register. Management expects you to be to work on time and start in doing your job. If you are sick, you better be sick or just come into work. If you are easy going and enjoy to work, your co-workers will sense that and talk with you. If you show up with an attitude and a know it all, the co-workers will ignore you."
good,Pros – (Small) employee discount.
good,"aprendi a manejar la caja, trato con la gente , lo que mas m gusto es poder tratar con la gente."
good,I worked customer service desk. the holidays were the hardest part of my job. I got along with my co-workers. I didnt really enjoy my job as i delt with angry customers half my day.
good,worked in breakpack dept where we shipped daily all over united states. The hardest part of job working in environment with no air condition. The most enjoyable part of the job was able to work weekends and go to college full time.
good,busy most of the time mixed paint and lots of customer service
good,Would go in and get ready to unload trucks to be distributed around the store to be put up on the shelves for sale. To be safety conscious for all customers and other workers.They manager was an excellent manager and was verypolite and fair minded. My co-workers were all very nice.The hardest part of the job was when we would get stuff in that was very heavy on top of other stuff. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you got to help other customers to get something that they needed from a shelf that they couldn't reach.
good,Overall good company to work for as a part-timer. Employees arent paid enough for the work being done. Hardest part of the job would be acting professionally in difficult situatuons.
good,"En realidad la empresa es buena lo que les falta es control sobre la Gerencia que se basan la mayoría de ellos en sentimientos propios y no valoran lo que los empleados en realidad hacen a diario en cuestión laboral, pero también admiro a la empresa por su sistema que llevan es muy avanzado y rápido y reconozco que aprendí como administrar un negocio, mercadear, controlar un inventario."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart with my co workers. We worked as ateam with very good understanding of each other, the job and how to get it done."
good,Assisted in the toys department down stock and helped customers find items
good,"Came in every morning and ran left over freight if there was any to be ran. Picks, counts, and audits started right at 9AM. Counting the correct bin locations, picking the merchandise out of the current bin location, put them on a cart for an associate from that department to come and pick up to be ran and stocked. The management team wasn't very helpful. We were clueless about 70% of the time as to what needed to be ran and worked and what was overstock and what wasn't overstock. It was a very fast paced enviroment, which I loved and worked my hardest in. It involved a lot of walking and lifting. The most enjoyable part was to see all of us working hard together as a team to get the tasks and items out of the system right at 4PM to go home."
good,its a long work day everyday but the other employees keep it fun.
good,"I was harassed daily by fellow coworkers, while management stood by and said nothing. I was barely trained, and when I asked to be taught things, they tended to do them for me instead of showing me. I learned almost nothing in my short time there. Also, on one particular occasion, I began choking in the break room (without about 20 fellow associates in there as well). I ended up vomiting after struggling to breathe for a couple minutes, and not a single person said a word to me, they simply ignored me. The company overall doesn't seem to value people at all in any way, only profit. It's good pay, but beware that you're selling your soul to get it."
good,"This is essentially just a job if you need one. I was on my feet the entire time, it was hard to ask for any time off. What they pay is horrifying. They go by cost of living which is ridiculous, because it would never pay for someone's cost of living. They made you fear that you would lose your job everyday you came in for one reason or another."
good,"Store management at this company needs to do more than order more. The management team needs to get realistically involved behind deli/bakery/meat/&product counters where it demands more direct customer service, to see how many customers truly behave at times with employees & how they treat them. This company has no employee considerations nor honest priorities whatsoever in critical medical sick leave necessities for employees or their immidiate families. Company & management Over work their employees with tons of different duties at the same time in any given shift, but offer very low hourly pay rate. Scheduling could be better condensed to save drive time for employees and yet be more productive to the company in less condensed time and dates if better complied dates vs scattered off days. Employee discount is truly embarrassing and should be increased to make a real saving difference for their employees whom are also customers at their store. Current discount is embarrasing and should be revised or removed out of embarrassedment."
good,Working in a fast paced job. Lots of people either mad or upset. Worked long hours for not a lot of pay.
good,Not good if you have kids and need set hours in benefits .i like never see my kids my son complain about me work.i hate never had a 40 hour check.
good,"Working at the Vision Center was the best opportunity I had, though there was no room for advancement and once I left the company I was at max for compensation for the area."
good,frentear mercancia
good,They worked me like a dog. I felt as if I was doing 3 to 4 peoples jobs. and it seemed as if they didnt care.
good,Wal mart is a company where people can't grow. The company is filled with phony people.
good,I learn different thing daily. No day is the same. Management isn't very good. Co-workers aren't friendy and very clicky. Sometimes the hardest part of my day is getting thru it with the girl drama. The most enjoyable part is working and learning from certain others that I work with.
good,Easy to secure a job. Management could use help and business doesn't run as smoothly as it should.
good,"You don't know what to expect because your responsibilities for the day get changed at the last minute. I basically learned how to run a register, stock, and to help others. The moral in the management is very low and the communication is not very good. I feel that there is a lot of favoritism and that if you're not part of the click then you won't get anywhere. Some of my co workers are very friendly and will help you when needed, whether it's make your day feel better, to talk to when needed, or just to help out if you're short handed. The hardest part of the job is to avoid confrontation when someone's in a bad mood and to be able to stay positive at times when you're not appreciated for the work you do. The best part of the job was meeting new people, making some friends, learning how to work with the public and to help them when needed."
good,overnight stocking of the meat department. The hardest part was coming to work at 10 pm.
good,Never missed a day of work and received part time employment after the temporary assignment was over. Worked c=hard everyday but some female supervisors are very catty and to worried about looks than work performance.
good,The Mangement was pretty good. Long day at this job sometimes doing inventory. I learned how to do inventory. The co workers was good to work with. The hardest thing about this job is nothing. I enjoyed working as a team to get things done on time.
good,dealing with different people is a typical day at work
good,I would punch in and have 5 minutes to get to my register. I would wait on customers and ring up their bills. Customers were great it was the company. They promised me time off with my kids then denied me. My boss hollered at me in front of customers and called me blondie instead of my name. I was told someone complained about my work and then had a friend who overheard the whole conversation say it was compliments not complaints. So I quit. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Management stinks and so does the head of cashiers
good,They were ok but not a great company to work for although the money did help me out at that time in my life i'll be thankful to them for that always.
good,"had to write up claims, get re-shop/ returns from customer service, answer calls from customers. Management was extremely hard to deal with and understand. Assignments were not assigned according to Job title."
good,"You have to like or be able to tolerate ALL types of people. Not only are the customers extremely diverse, so are the co-workers."
good,"Management has little to no control over their employees, All employees complain or are angry with their manager, It's hard to find motivation to go into Walmart and work."
good,llegar y sacar toda la mercancia apiso de ventas y checar agotados de la mercancia que se descarga a diario y separarla reacomodo en la bodega de mercancia este trabajo era todos los dias ademas que no tenianos gente para realizar todo el trabajo eramos tres
good,"I helped customers with all their photo needs which included finding cameras and camera accessories. I developed film, cleaned and maintained the machines."
good,they like to give over time and at the end of the week they sen you home they say you got over time that is a regular thing for management
good,"If you are educated, and you can tolerate the sudden changes, this isn't a bad first job. The pay is substandard, but how do you expect they keep their prices low? Management are human, which is a good breath of fresh air. You can post internally to move between positions quite easily. Your co-workers will keep you happy, but that is about it. The hardest part of the job is knowing that your work will never be done. The easiest part of the job is the same thing."
good,I am ready to get off the night shifts!
good,Worked from 4pm to 1am
good,Favortism is a big factor in this company. Most of the time people are very lazy. Advancement is very rare for the truly workers who work hard for it.
good,it was a good customers service experice My duties as a Courtesy Associate include providing customer assistance and maintaining the organization of the premises and assisting with projects.
good,The associates are some of the best people I have ever known
good,Its always great to stock and be part of the garden center team. I really enjoyed this are because of the ever changing seasons we did. I was disapppointed in how they handle thier point system. weather its court or doctors orders they will count it against you.
good,"I left walmart because i couldnt take working with managers who sit there and txt all day while i worked half the store to myself AND pushed carts, I didnt mind the extensive work variety but that was not the point, the store was lacking a large number of employees and a few managers. On top of that we were forced to work with faulty/broken equipment and the trucks NEVER got unloaded and brought to the floor on time."
good,"I learned that I work better with a team not just I being the total work force or just a few people who work while the others lack in effectiveness and urgency. Also, in this economy we need more money for the work that is expected from every employee."
good,everday we had 2 or 3 trucks to unload.i learned a lot about team work and how to change my work speed.i did not like the way the management was and the way they ran the place.co-workers were good to work with.the hardest part of the job unloadin the trucks in time.the most enjoyable part of the job is takin the stuff to the sales floor.
good,Decent pay but benefits are costly. Environment isn't professional.
good,"Uma trabalho ótimo para quem gosta de se relacionar com o público diretamente,excelente parceiros de trabalho,porém sem chance de termos muito contato uns com os outros."
good,"A typical day at work was usually going in and picking up other peoples slack. The work place was very unorganized and counter productive for 3 1/2 years which was my entire stay there. Although it was a terrible place to work I did learn a lot. I think that may be one of the best things about the job. I gained a lot of experience and knowledge. Most of Management was very unorganized and were very disrespectful to their employees. That was tolerable however that on top of unsanitary work conditions, clutter, short staff, associates not working etc was no good. I can't really think of anything good about the Walmart I was at. I can't say all Walmart's are bad but mine was dreadful. I had great co-workers and I had a lot that weren't so great. The ones that were good for doing their share I thank but the rest didn't make life any easier especially when management came down on your for them not doing their job. The most difficult part o the Job was moving up. The harder you worked the more they wanted to keep you down and where you were at. They didn't want to lose anyone who was good at what they did so they held you in the same position even if that meant getting coached. The most enjoyable part was getting my paycheck because working there was a awful experience and the money I earned was the only thing I could look forward too. I wish there was more good I could think of than bad but it was that ""Bad"". A lot of people got burned out and couldn't continue and ended up quitting or getting replaced because they just weren't able to muster up the energy anymore. I am surprised"
good,"Loved helping /interacting with the customers. Very good co-workers. Learned a great deal of patience dealing with difficult or upset customers, found their appreciation to be very pleasing to me. We overnight workers worked a very hard rotation of days/hours, very physically and mentally challenging most of the time."
good,Very flexible company in terms of scheduling around school
good,I worked in hardware and housewares. I mixed paint and helped customers find anything they were looking for. I set up displays and worked freight. Price changes and counted merchandise. I really like working at Walmart. I quit to go to college full time and they could not work around my schedule with my position.
good,"Its Walmart. Most of the people working at Walmart are not experts in what they do, say or know. There is a lack of energy while working at (my) Walmart. There are almost no options of advancement unless you've been there for along period of time or get in good with higher up's. Last, no full-time positions unless you're a manager ex: Department Manager, CSM, ZMS, etc. (at least at my Walmart)."
good,"i enjoyed working with my co-workers, but all the manager's were rude and didn't really care about the employes."
good,"Have a contract thru Allied Barton. Not allowed to talk with co-workers., only to stand at post."
good,I like it at first but they were unable to work with me when my schedule changed its like to them that it doesn't matter if I have classes just get here.
good,"a typical day consists of working with customers, unloading freight and putting back returns. Management is ok but training is not so good. Co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is doing all that is expected. Sometimes it is too much. The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting the customers expectations."
good,was promised asst.managers job... didn't get it.... they let a bi-lingual worker jump right in to the position /new hire....
good,"Enjoyed working with people of diverse environment. My day started with a meeting to make plans for the day. Then another meeting with associates to detail the meeting notes. As Wal-Mart started hiring management with educational background, it was easy to work with Co-workers, but was hard to work with Upper management. That was the hardest part of my job as upper management will totally ignore new ideas and try to harass them everyday."
good,The hardest thing I encountered about this job was staying motivated. but I did learn that the value of speed is in the quality of your work
good,i would want to explain in person. the jobs was fun but they couldnt except the fact that i had a sickly child that needed my attention as well
good,"At least an eight hour work day that is busy with work, customers, and stocking. I learned that the customer is always right. Management would help out occasionally if the lines were backed up. Loved all the co-workers we all helped one another to make the workday go by smoothly. The hardest part of the job was not getting a proper break, and it being really hot. The best part is a 40hr work week because lets face it, times are hard."
good,Enjoyed job but management needed to get a grip on the important things and not the trivial things with in the store upper management. Too many double standards for employees and no uniform control oave employees.
good,Walmart gave me a part time job while I was seeking other employment. Thank you for the opportunity to work while seeking employment
good,"My opinion of Wal*Mart is not good. I find that the company does not deliver on promises, Trys to build up their image with false hope. A company full of burned out employees."
good,not great organization not good to work at just a place for a job.
good,"I liked working at this walmart, mostly because of the people I worked with. Working in the electronics dept. has been very learning and as taught me lots of different things. I also Preformed customer service along with multiple sales.Recived payments and running the cash register. Zoning and cleaning department. Set-up new merchandise."
good,"The company offers a great range of products, teamwork is lacking, job security is always in question"
good,Steady work most of the time as a cashier. I wish I could have worked more as a sales floor. They always needed help on the sales floor. I would like the opportunitity to have corporate training there if I was to return.
good,"good hours, nice management, met new people, learned alot about the store, got discount for working there on some products."
good,"Cashiering was very fast paced, I enjoyed meeting lots of new people."
good,Like the title says its wasn't anything special. They was alot of unfair treatment and management wasn't great at all. they lacked leadership skills as well s organizational skill needed for the job. Basically this job was a paycheck nothing more nothing else due tot he fact there was no advancement opportunities.
good,I really did not enjoy working with this company. They did not treat their associates with respect. I just feel they can do better when it comes to repect forr the associate.
good,"The empoylees and managers are very cut-throat looking for any chance to have someone terminated they personally dislike, very rude with no considerations of employees' health or medical problems, and very reluctant when being asked of reason of termination."
good,Everything in this company is computer based. Nothing is said or done face to face. It lacks a personal feel. Very noisy. Lazy associates and managers who gossip and ignore customer's complaints/requests.
good,"I love the fact that I am surrounded by the most innovative, creative and talented people. I have learned so much from day to day skills and the right attitude I need to make things happen fast and efficiently."
good,Walmart was a great company when I started. However recent changes have eliminated many positions including mine. Upper management could stand to be better at their rolls & how they treat their associates.
good,"MY experience with Walmart will obviously differ from most.  That being said; the one I work for could definitely use a lot of help in the areas of Manager / Employee relations, and communications."
good,"best time to apply for job in Walmart is during the busy season. if your manager likes you, they will keep you or they will find any reason to get rid of you. Hard work is always welcome but if you are good at gossiping with your manager then even being lazy won't get you fired."
good,"I've worked in two locations so far the new location is far worse than the other. What really makes the work environment great is communication among everybody. With the new location, management will turn their back on you and other managers causing conflict amongst everyone. Many people within the store will selectively choose who to improve by promising and favoritism. This store will also 'antecedently' mess up peoples availabilities scheduling them when they can't show up and if the associate brings up the issue, they say that they will fix it but won't so it causes people to get occurrences, which is limited and impossible to get rid, again if brought up will be promised to get fix but won't which causes associate to get fired."
good,Only work there if you do not have kids. They are ok but it’s a messy place and unprofessional you have to keep everything that’s going on in ur life private.
good,"Nothing to say , when you get not fair wages and work back breaking job under any conditions, I thought it was not logic to work there anymore, so I quite"
good,"There's never a real team sense, and always more work that needs doing ASAP. Decent pay if you get hours, but favoritism and no real career advancements."
good,"Upper management is often unaware and/or uncaring of the many issues and conflicts occurring within their stores. People are often overworked, overtired, and angry. Walmart NEEDS to unionize"
good,"São muitos exigentes, não toleram atrasos de minutos, muita advertencia desnecessaria"
good,They didn't hold anyone accountable for there actions.They would say one thing and do another. it wasn't fair to half of the employee's that worked there.
good,"Improper equipment,  high stress, low wages, lack of hours, wage cuts, poor scheduling, poor stocking, empty shelves, poor management,  lack of empathy"
good,Terrible place to work. The management is wishy-washy and stress based.  The managers are forced to enforce performance standards that are unrealistic.
good,"Keep to yourself, be a good drone, collect a paycheck . Seriously use this only as a stepping stone. The old adage ""get the job you can get, and then look for the job that you want""..... The perfect use for Walmart jobs. It's not just a McJob anymore folx."
good,At Walmart there are to many chiefs and not enough workers. They can be demanding and seems like they may try to get rude. I got to put away the scooters and get to talk to customers as they walked in and as they left.
good,"Good: I loved the people I got to work with, I loved meeting new people and interacting with the customers and the regulars that came in. I loved the fast pace environment."
good,I lost my job due to my daughter being in the hospital and i got to many points but they dont care about doctors notes. you could be dying and theyd still expect you to show up.
good,I believe Walmart needed a  better job on management it was pretty poor it was hard talking too them they favor other people an it’s hard too switch them hours
good,Empresa multinacional com bastante funcionários fazendo mesma função.
good,It was a bit stressful at times but overall not too difficult as a work environment.  My biggest complaint was the fluctuation of hours. The wage overall was fair.
good,The job itself was fairly good and had its ups and downs but I wouldn't rely on them to compensate for your needs. I found that a bit frustrating and was upset when they gave no justification for them asking me to leave.
good,"You can do everything right , but if you manager don’t like you , you will be out immediately."
good,Management didn't care about their employees or their opinions. The ordering system didn't allow for department managers to be in charge of their own department.
good,Loved helping the customers. co-workers are nice. Long hours and no set schedule. was part-time but worked over 40 hours some weeks. Main supervisor very helpful.
good,Watch out for the managers there they can be very nasty and disrespectful! they say that they care about their employees but they don't they forget the people under them are the wheels on the bus that make the company move
good,"The company has gone down hill fast in the last few years. There's no seniority,  and your left hung out to dry by new employees getting better hours and chances and pay. There walking in the door making more than you after 9 years."
good,It’s alright but the bosses and customers sucks. Most people are complains about the manager. And the manager don’t listen to employees needs. The cashier lady are getting less hours than everyone else
good,Walmart will be a great place to work for if they kept up with the tradition Sam Walton. He was all about family it was all about taking care of the associates so the associates can take care of the customers he really cared. He was all about working together as a team. We show these videos to our new Associates about them teachings but they don't follow through and I think there should be some kind of consequences but there's none
good,Some of the managers were very nice and welcomed me with open arms. They would help me when I made a mistake. They talked to me calmly and respectfully.
good,Work to hard for little pay. Most manages are not qualified for the jobs. The are rude and single out employees in front of customers very rude I would not recommend working here.
good,My experience at this one location was very bad. The managers was very rude. They didn’t care about the workers. They don’t give hours  plus they rudeeee
good,They want you to be a robot without a brain. If you are more of an independent person it won't work out for you. If you have the unfortunate luck of getting hurt or sick at work you're pretty much SCREWED. After you come back they find a way to get rid of you for a different reason including but not limited to creating absences in your file and good luck moving up if you're not a minion.
good,This company was the shizznit back a few years ago and really looked out for their employees. Happy employees make happier customers. No one seems to be happy there now. They even stopped playing Walmart radio. The whole atmosphere sucks.
good,"When I first started working at Walmart they treated you like family. A couple of years ago everything changed . They no longer cared about the associate. Not enough people working, so you would have to do the work of 2-3 people. I was a cake decorator for 6 years .Up to the last 2 years I loved it."
good,I am not happy there because some managers is doing bad behavior and very hard work in the Walmart and paying very law just 13 dollars per hour nobody happy
good,Good place to have a job when needed. Not necessarily a job with security.No need for any further review. Customers are great the politics is the worst of the job.
good,They don’t care much about an individual but it is a good place to work if you want to just go with the flow. Scheduling is bad but can usually be fixed within a month.
good,"The Walmart I worked at in Excelsior Springs, MO, mostly all of the managers is less intelligent than the associates. It's honestly sad to see such a big corporation has such little care in its management. But besides the awful management at Walmart its not that bad of a place to work at."
good,I didn't enjoy my experience working at Walmart i was force to do extra even though  i finish my work that was on my job description. I also didn't enjoy how i couldn't speak management about issue without feeling  pressure
good,"Hired as a temporary, get your foot in the door, hope of a full time job didn't materialize. Training was inadequate and role expanded with out any training."
good,i hate this job. The management team does not care if you have school or if you are sick. They only care about their profit. They do not care at all about their employees
good,"This is a very fast paced environment, with good team players, though communication is lacking. Hours are severally cut back after the Christmas season is over."
good,Work very hard little pay should be at lease 15hrs .the r very stressful .some manger not doing there job..they dont talk to employee in right tone voice it very sad....
good,I like the customers and I like my associates but I felt like the job wasn't going anywhere and the hours jump back and forth nothing consistent not for me
good,I have worked for Walmart for about 12 years now and until recently I loved working for them. It's just this one location of obviously many but this store has recently got a few new managers that seem to just want very young people employed there. Most locations are probably great.
good,Disorganized and picks and chooses when to do job requirements. Management is lacking in experience. Those with any experience have not adapted to the new routines unless company is in the area.
good,"Should be more considerate of employees. Strict policies are overwhelming. Pay is equivalent to the cost of living. Reorganize there strategy, offer better benefits."
good,"Working at Walmart, you either put on a fake smile or fall for the facade of being treated like a human. Depending on the store or the managers, everyone's experience may vary, but the consensus is management do what they please to see the store succeed, not the associate. For a company who's mantra is to treat each other like family and help one another, the reality is you have to be a model associate and fall in line with the standards of being a robot told to do everything by the end of the shift. With being short staffed constantly, the workload triples for an individual and makes it difficult to accomplish much in an eight hour span."
good,"The other employees/ management and supervisors are great, the work is intense,  the starting hours are great, the days can be very long and are hard to manage with children.  The work is good and demanding but the pay just isn’t enough."
good,They don’t appreciate the work that you do and they also think that they can talk to you however they want and when you want to move up in the store they take they time moving you up and management also discriminates to people
good,Unfortunately the policies and processes are not like they once were and the company is going downhill as a whole. I wish I could advance and become someone of importance.
good,I worked very hard for 26years. Never had many points. Always put customer and others first. Then out of nowhere I was terminated within a couple months.
good,"It's typical retail. There are nice customers and rude customers. They say that there's room for advancement, but it's really hard. A perk though is they will pay for you to go back to school."
good,You would not like what I would like to say. You would only dismiss it as a disgruntled employee so why bother . My supervisor was not a very nice person. She barks/ yells at you in front of other people which is humiliating. If  there's a problem talk about it in private. Could be better organized.
good,"Inconsistent training "
good,"Starting off as a cashier at walmart was very hard on me. Not because of the concept of cashiering, or even the customers.. But simply the fact the management chose favorites and used to always treat me different from every other associate. Being up at the front end was fun, but being taunted by the management on a daily basis was too much, causing me to switch departments. After switching departments, I was able to shop for customers along with dispensing their packages. I was able to catch on very quickly and before I knew it, I was shopping for customer’s groceries by myself. After quite sometime, I actually became one of the few people who were able to train new associates coming into the department. Walmart is an amazing company to work for, it has it’s ups and downs, but it’s a great place to get started on experiencing life in the work environment. But there comes times where I need a bigger and better job that reflects the major I choose to study in because this is only a temporary, college job."
good,This job is basically for teenagers or young adults. If you want to work for a job that after five years you are only getting under 15/hrs for working there for about 8 years then this is the place for you.
good,I was on cap 2 Job wasnt to bad but depending on your position in the store you may have a different opinion and the management makes the job completely unbearable and often times makes your job harder since they give you tasks that are not a priority that take a decent bit of time but still expect your priority tasks to be done before you can leave
good,Still work there. No comment. Stressful environment to work in. High level of efficiency and commitment expected. Not a job for the faint of heart. It can seem like your a professional baby sitter at times.
good,"Es una empresa que te exije mucho y no te paga lo que debería ser, después de trabajar en Walmart encontré empresas que si valoran tu trabajo y te pagan bien t"
good,"Pretty bottom-of-the-barrel work atmosphere, but Walmart pays more than more ""upscale"" retailers like mall boutiques. Depending on the position you enter, you can be paid a few dollars above minimum wage without having to deal with customers quite so much. Look for personal shopper/online grocery pickup positions. These are the highest paying entry level positions in the store. "
good,No stability in scheduling. Store discontinued 24 hour status. Younger people promoted first despite interviewing for a position before another associate the position reopened and I was passed up even though previous interview I was told I would be reconsidered.
good,"Management is always changing we've gone through four mangers in one year and every time they bring different changes and most of the time they don't know what they they're doing and make thing worst then before.  You have to at least save about two weeks of PTO for peak season a year or your screwed management will not work with you if you have school or kids with limited daycare if do you needs days of for any of that with no PTO pretty much after missing four days any time in the peak season and your gone. The Management are number hungry even if the work is slow they will set unrealistic goal and expect you the hit them."
good,"It depends on the store and overall management team and style. If you do your job fully, less likely you are to be micromanaged or undermined as an individual."
good,"If you don’t mind working in a stressful environment where the workers are not appreciated then this is a job for you, I would like to stress that this may not be the case in all stores across the uk but it is in the one I work in! All depends on the GRM you have ..... this is only my opinion so please don’t let this put you off."
good,"I was unexpectedly fired for a ""racist slur"" that I never made.  Big disappointment, because I was learning and making progress, getting good feedback.  The Customer Availability Process (planogram) is interesting and challenging, and the new robotics coming in are fascinating.  Sorry to be missing the holidays there too.  Give Walmart a try, I do recommend it even despite all that happened for me."
good,"Very little work life balance  "
good,I worked in the deli.. I would wait on counter customers and made sandwiches...cooked food for hot case. Dishes. I could open the deli some days and some days close it so I had the closing jobs ....clean slicers. Trash clean all machined.
good,My experience working with Walmart has been a good one. I enjoy meeting and helping the customer. The store is mostly organized and easy to help the customer find products.
good,Overall its just another retail job. Associates are replaceable and if you arent willing to kiss up to the right people you wont get very far. (At least at most of the stores I have worked at) They does really seem to worry about if you get to see your kids on holidays or birthdays but that is to be expected i guess. Associates are just tools to get work done and push product out nothing more.
good,Harassment and favors were a standard for successful promotion. Yearly progression reviews were rigged to keep employees from getting their raises a nually.
good,Si quieres aprender es el lugar ideal. Aunque debes estar consiente de que te van a explotar.
good,"I enjoy my time there I’m just not growing from what I was. I’ve been there for almost a year and do a lot for the job but haven’t went anywhere. I still make the same pay and have applied in several higher positions, but have not been asked or talk to about any of it."
good,Overall decent job. It pays the bills but it can be better. EVERYTHING is done by computer including call outs so if u NOT dead its NOT excused ONLY corporate and management has PTO
good,"Overall the job isn't hard, I personally don't have any issues with the job itself, my concern is with the people I work with and the ones in charge. I recently requested a transfer and have been basically retaliated against through my work assignments because of it like they are trying to force me out. In my time so far there, I have had my life threatened by associates and verbally abused and berated by my current managers. If you are not in the circle, then you won't work out. I have been blamed for everything someone else will do including things that happens on my days off. The associates in other departments are nice but i do not recommend trying to go to fresh cap."
good,everything was very unprofessional and was a lot of pressure. expected to get things done on time even short staff. and managrs breathing down your neck.
good,"It was a great place to work and grow "
good,It was a great job until some of the managers started playing favorites with other associates Other than that it was really great working for the company especially in the field that I was in
good,"It was a good job but i felt limited in regaurds to financial growth and it effected my mood in a bad way. Money stayed the same regaurdless of how hard I worked, which was hard. Management and Supervisors alike seemed unaware of most things happening within the store. Just got old after a couple years and couldnt deal with it anymore. If you want a steady pay and full time, take the job."
good,"I enjoyed this job but it was not in my degree neither and I was looking for something that payed more money and went along with my degree. Third shift was the backbone of the company and everyone worked as a team, but management was lacking in aspects due to inappropriate contact towards other associates. Associates are not trustworthy and will gossip about personal information any chance they get along with management. Management picks and chooses who they like and who they don't and treats the rest of the team members horribly."
good,"It was all about the company and your store(4262)."
good,"My manager is lazy, turns a blind eye to issues of, promotions of employees of another race , the pay can go from, it's ok for what I do, all the way up to, it's great I just walk around and talk on my phone and bother others who are working, The ASM's pick and choose who to pick on about what the policy is ,such as , headwear , pants (sagging) , du rags , when they don't even follow policy,policymanagement"
good,"Most days you would go in, clock in, do your job and leave. I was a cashier here for a few years. When i first started the people were nice and they seemed to care about how i was feeling and how comfortable with my job. But as time went on, they stopped caring about me and only cared about what I was trained to do. I learned a lot about how to deal with angry customers because there were a lot of them, and I also learned about financial services and how to cash checks and send money out of the country. I would say they hardest part of the job would either be dealing with the angry, frustrated customers or career advancement. Its not very to move up in this line of work unless you're friends with the management. They managers, for the most part are super nice, at least at my store, but if you work part-time, which is what they hire mostly, its really hard to get benefits like health insurance. The most enjoyable part was making some friends that understood what you were going through and you could talk to."
good,Worked shorthanded with fewer hours  but duties the same. Shifts often back to back example 2-10 pm then back at 6am to 2pm. Coworkers best part of job
good,Always giving me tasks to do always there when I needed them and they also had some holidays off when u request them and always there to help when need
good,El sistema de simpre 6 meses y después nuevos empleados
good,"Working at Walmart was nice because of the amazing benefits you can receive, and the pay was nothing to complain about, but the management of the store was very poor. Most of the managers didn't work as hard as they should, and put most of the work load on the associates, including the responsibilities that were meant for the managers. There were a few exceptions, but overall very poor management."
good,"Good starting point for A/P & A/R, constantly changing, no job security, training was fast or non existent, management could care less about employees, in spite of awesome job performance reviews constant insecurity regarding job security."
good,It was a very okay job. It was good pay for a job that requires little experience. I did not enjoy the job though. They did not work with my schedule very well.
good,"Mal pagado y mucho trabajo, mala comunicación de jefes y hay cosas buenas pero son muy pocas"
good,"When I was employed with Walmart, I was excited to be there. As it was my first job, and I was thrilled to work for the first time. I gained great customer service experience, along with working under stressful conditions. It pushed me greatly but overall my experience with Walmart went well."
good,"Its a simple job get in make a few thousand dollars then find a new job."
good,"Got put down because surgeries went bad . When I went back felt like they ,upper management didn't want me there. Dept managers  and down were all glad I was back. Others acted like they couldn't wait for me to leave."
good,Wal-mart is not a terrible place to work. most of the duties and responsibilities are relatively easy to achieve. management is slightly lacking to employee needs.
good,They require a great deal of you to get everything done to standards. When you are a sales associate you do not stay in one place you will move from area to area. It is a good job to have if you are part-time but not full-time.
good,"I worked in the stationary, party, and fabric area. I was always a hard worker but their was always some ugly managers who would find ways to keep trouble going."
good,"Management is kinda poor they don't care about the associates. They expect as to do everything with only 1 or 2 people. We always do our best to do our job, but we can't finished everything if we don't have enough workers."
good,"Walmart is a very unorganized workplace. It is very fast paced, having little time to complete difficult tasks. Other employees are disrespectful, showing little concern of your well being."
good,Left after i put in pto a month before my wife was due to have surgery ... had more than enough to cover the time off ... it was not given to me ... it was not a weekend or holiday either ... so as they felt my family not important .. figured time to leave
good,Falta de puntualizacion em procedimientos y trato con el personal
good,"Once you get past all the customers that walk in,  its a pretty enjoyable place to work and is easy to learn.  There is a bit of pressure put on you from the managers but usually everything is pretty steady paced."
good,Not the greatest place to work. If you have family or want a life outside of work do not work here. They will consume all the hours of your day. Management does not work well with you either. You also will need to have every single holiday open to work.
good,"Fast paced work environment. Must be able to multi-task and work efficiently. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers however, the job is easy."
good,During my employment at Walmart the hiring manager was very inconsiderate. When I asked for help to find the appropriate computer program she was very nasty with her reply. She was reluctant to assist me.
good,"The customer flow is nice, makes the day go by fast. There's always something to do or someone to help. The managment are supportive and friendly. All of the associates and coworkers definitely help eachother out."
good,"Didn't like management, there were not enough people to complete the work, good benefits, good hours, but could improve in giving more raises to their long term workers."
good,"Muy estresante y mal pagado, horarios estresantes con un día de descanso"
good,Vert exciting place to work I really enjoy myself but I had to leave the position because I was sick at the time and now I am much better and looking for work.
good,"At Walmart, and in the management position I earned, I experienced quite a bit more freedom, better wiggle-room to work with. In my experience, I enjoyed coming to work more often than not, and it was because of the people I worked with, as well as our environment. It became easy to be friendly with everyone, because, while the work was always tough, we were all in it together, as a team—and no one wanted to be left behind."
good,it was the worst manager at my time there because of that I  left the company. I had a family emergency so i filed for leave of absence and I was told to apply as new employee when I came back so I left.
good,"everything started out okay, but as time progressed management made terrible decisions. most of which involved letting many people go without reason.."
good,I cashiered all day. Standing got a little rough when doing it for many hours and not getting breaks often. Management was nice and had things under control. Meeting others and seeing people i knew was the funnest part of working as a cashier at Walmart.
good,"the store owner was very kind and caring, but my manager was rather rude and i would hear her mocking me to her husband from the other end of the isle, i received little training and didnt know procedures"
good,It's a fast paced job that is not give enough help.   They expect everything done but with little pay. The yearly raise is not very much the people that just started almost make as much as the people who have been there for a long time.   Loyalty in the company means nothing special they don't care about the people only money.
good,"it Is really fast paced, you are always busy. The there was definitely room for improvement, like more employees needed so it wasn’t so stressful at time doing a lot of work and not enough people"
good,"It's retail. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Customers can be great or they can be awful. Most of them will be in between. Whether you have an overall decent experience or if you have a soul-sucking one comes down a lot to what management is like. I've had managers that you know have your back, and I've had managers that clearly don't care and just expect you to get things done even if it kills you."
good,"It's not the worst place I have ever worked, but it's not great either. The management could not be more incompetent. The turnover rate is incredibly high. You will always be short-staffed in your department while at the same time being pulled to cover for other under-staffed departments. The pay is decent, but not great. The hours are all over the place for part-time, and sometimes even full-time."
good,"Walmart is an okay company to work do, as a cashier it it is a bit stressful at times. The work is high paced and consistent, and the pay is okay. This company is very flexible with hours."
good,Ive worked here close to two years and in that time i havent really received a raise. Yet I have to train new people and have to go outside and collect shopping carts even though thats not my job title. And yet they promote a guy whose been here a few months. Management here only cares about you if your there friend.
good,"Its really stressful and expect to much with little pay.  I am amazed how many family members work together, for instance in my neighborhood walmart i work at their are 4 sets of family members. If you are well liked by management you can DO ANYTHING and NOT get fired!!!"
good,Over 70 people was hired for the remodeling of this store at the end of the project there was about 25-30 people left. They only hired all but about 4. They hired the favorites and the people that goofed off like talking on their phones. The ones that were not hired was told to request a transfer but that was not approved until the last day. Now you can't request the actual transfer unless you're on the clock.
good,"Co-workers are good people.  Management was all-over the place.  My store had the highest turn over rate.  Corporate does nothing unless you have Evidence & Are willing to take legal action."
good,"I really liked working at Wal-Mart and I would love to go back of I can , I liked my morning schedule and pay I just didn't like how they all like to gossip and they are judgemental and my supervisor was very rude and mean and she called a LOT of people ride names for no reason."
good,"Being in the loading dock at the Walmart DC was a very sexist environment, which made me uncomfortable and when I reported to my mangers the brushed off the issue."
good,"as long as you are fast, this place a decent one to work at. if you need something done such as a day off or something you must remind the managers or they wont remember."
good,I have experience different work since work there for 2n half years. I feel like it’s too much drama n favoritism in that store. I did my best chance to keep up with my work.
good,The place overall needs an improvement. More so on the managerial side of the store. I think expectations are a little too high at times. I kind of feel like it’s hard to move up in the company.
good,"In the years I was  there not once was I praised or given a ok for doing my job.Althogh I did the worked I was told to do,I was not trained for it.And was told that the door was opened to talk,never was I told to come in when I wanted to talk to them.Always told to wait they were to busy at that time.They gave the scan to others,not enough for me at the moment,use my phone they would say  which was often,my battery would run down.They were training others for better work,even if you graduate from pathways,and was up on global,I did not miss a day,was early at all times and on time for my work."
good,"Walmart is not a career, it is a retail job you work to help pay the bills. Management is awful and has unrealistic expectations of their workers and information from the managers is never passed on to the associates."
good,"It was fun. Would not recommend if you like getting your hours cut. Makes it hard to finance. And pay bills, I guess if you are a college student or in highschool you still make decent $$$"
good,Very fast paced environment... You have to always be busy... If you enjoy edge of your seat action at low pay... Have at it people.  Honest work just the pay needs to improve.
good,"Working at Walmart is not all bad, it sometimes can be a great place to work, but there are some days we are so understaffed that I personally end up doing my job and the job of others to help with the day."
good,I enjoy my job. But the moral has gone down hill the past 3 years. They need a third party to do interviews within warehouse due to them hand picking who they want where.
good,Walmart is an intense retail business and its always evolving rather good or bad. Structure of the store’s culture begins with management and falls onto associates throughout the store. You have to have a good management team in order to have positive working associates in this high stress job. The hardest part of the job is not meeting the customers expectations. The enjoyable part is connect and making the customers happy.
good,"I dunno about other locations, but the Walmart I work for has horrible management that does not care for their associates. They drive away the good workers and reward the ones who do not work."
good,It's been alright since i started. Just kinda got worse and worse. It got better. Then it got worse.. Either way walmart is a good starting job for young teens that need experience
good,"I didnt mind working here the only thing is you never get days off , they dont work with your schedule if you need to take a day off and most of your shifts are 12 hrs for like 5 days straight."
good,"It was an okay place to work but we always had to work the closing shift, never had weekends or holidays off. Management would forget to help us out with our schedules for school and had their favorites."
good,"There isn’t a lot growth at Walmart as you would think , not enough hours no holiday pay which I don’t understand. They could pay more for the way treat their employees"
good,"I was hired as a Full-Time Personal Shopper for Walmart's Online Grocery Pickup service, however I never received full time hours or benefits. As a personal shopper your typical day starts with setting up your handheld scanner and loading customer orders. After locating all items on each order it is necessary to organize orders to be distributed. Maintaining a clean workspace is done throughout the day. "
good,I enjoyed talking to people so I liked working as a cashier at Walmart for the most part. They would work you  to almost full time hours but cut you short before you get there. Managers change constantly and every manager has a different way of doing things. No paid time off and no paid sick time. They will work you morning one day night the next and somewhere in the middle the next. It's hard to have a life to plan out side of work.
good,"everything in my area had to be clean and it was very frustrating because everything you clean would get un clean in literally 2 seconds because of a customer, and then management breathed down your neck about it. Worked at the busiest Walmart so that's probably why. Communication was poor and expectations of their employees unrealistic. Could not well assist a customer, because management would keep track of it and keep it against you."
good,I put in  for my vacation time in March for May and it was dyned because of lack of  staff  now you tell me how Walmart can say in March that in May there won't be enough staff for someone to go on vacation
good,"El ambiente laboral en la empresa es estresante, en algunas áreas los lideres te piden apoyo sin ser retroactivo, la comunicación efectiva es muy cerrada, sus políticas las representan interpretativas hacia los lideres.En mi área teníamos muchas indecisiones, robo de ideas, poca dispocision  a escuchar ideas."
good,"Walmart is great place to gain new skills and learn about retail. Every day is something new: wether it's maintaining your department neat, helping out customers across the store, or putting up seasonal merchandise."
good,"Its alright i guess, Some co-workers are nice and enjoyable and some are not.I like how nobody is treated like an individual, everyone is treated like a teammate and we get celebrations every month or 2 if we all work good, I hate how managers sometimes expect so much work done from you in a small amount of time and they make you work in areas that you aren't even in charge of and they tell you to go do stuff when you're in the middle of working on something else. Overall its a fast paced environment to work in and requires you to have good feet and lots of energy. Its only a good place to work for a teenagers first job to save up to go to college or whatever. I could never see working here as a career."
good,It is very fast paced you are on your feet all the time except 2 15 minute breaks and lunch. Customers can be rude as so can the Management. Walmart uses to be a nice place to work it is no longer so!
good,"Every store is probably not as bad as the one I worked at but the management is not up to par, they don’t care about their associates, there are little to no benefits left for working at Walmart"
good,"My experience at Walmart was one of favoritism. I worked at the same store for two and a half years and did outstanding work by my own standards. I sought out advancement, but it seems that you have to be one of the management ""favorites"" to get chosen. Once I transferred stores I tested this theory by cozying up to a few managers and was promoted less than a month later. I then learned of the snarky attitudes and sarcasm that comes with the territory. Why train someone when you can sarcastically poke at them until they figure it out on their own? That's the management experience at Walmart."
good,Meh. I have nothing left to say but apparently I have to come up with something so. Yeah it was a job my manager was great but some of the others were donkeys.
good,"At walmart the customers are nice & friendly . Its always busy & well stocked . There is always work to do no lacking . Also , Everything must be done in a quickly manner ."
good,"Walmart is a busy business that makes excellent money. Most of the people seem quite nice. It seems as if not a lot of people are actually working, even though there was always multiple people there."
good,"Managed retail store and supervised employees."
good,Overall of my 6 Years of experience at Walmart instead of terminating me they could of moved me to a different position within the company because i only made a typo mistake and i had never a a report that i was unprofessional or rude with my customers got along with everyone was well liked within the staff there was a lot of favoritism  going on at the job at 1250 sw erie st and i still believe it is still going on there
good,"I would be working there some nights until midnight and come back the next morning. Never had a weekend day off while working there. Not enough work to do, slow paced when I was used to working fast"
good,"After working there for 2 years as a sales associate in the beginning and a cashier nearing the end of my employment there, I’ve found many flaws and some unmet needs and expectations that management did not fill for me as an associate working at their company."
good,Walmart was a good place to work but management was not the best and I was a C.A.P 2 associated I love my team mates. Management is the best but team is why I came to work every day to see them.
good,A typical day for me would be to work in other departments beside the one I was actually hired for. I learned how to use certain tools in a warehouse. Some managers were nice others were hard to work with. Workplace culture was sometimes stressful because of deadlines. The hardest part was trying to learn all the new skills required to do the job correctly. The most enjoyable is talking with my co-workers.
good,"Usually every night i was chosen to sweep the floors. There are several jobs for night shift but the sweeping almost always fell to me. and usually the first hour of my route through the store i stop to help at least one customer, usually in electronics where we start. That's usually the calmest of the night though sweeping through areas that are being stocked is almost counter productive if there are pallets involved though I've always finished a full route through the store and sometimes have enough time to backtrack through areas that aren't wet from the scrubber. I've learned how to operate cleaning equipment and proper techniques for spills, as well as customer support. There were good members of management and some that weren't as good. And some were inappropriate at times. The people around me were mostly separated by when you would go to lunch, the older people were always nice and friendly, though a group of stalkers would love to talk bad about someone if it were on their minds. The hardest part was trying to catch up if you were pulled off to do something, though usually the last in the floor line would be pulled before the other two. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to all the other associates if time allowed made the job less drone focused and was great"
good,The hardest part of the job was having to pull 50 plus pounds of meat of a shelf and carry it down a ladder. It was very cold in the meat geezer and you had to stay in the freezer 90% of your shift.
good,It was a very stressful fast paced job. Always on your heels. Always on your heels. unloaded a truck everyday and the hardest part of the job was trying to unload trucks on time
good,On a daily basis management would be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. None of management could work together or even get along. There was maybe two front end managers that would actually try to do there job. It didn’t help much because the rest of the management team didn’t care enough to do there jobs.
good,"The management would personally target me for any wrongdoings, or slight mistakes. They oversee other employees and would add points to my record for frequently made mistakes of other employees."
good,Walmart was a okay job i was there the summer after I graduated. The job there did help me become better with people. The hours where not the best to have that why i didn't like the job
good,"The more you get paid the more stress they put on you. So far as management goes at my store it was terrible they are not trained at all to do an hourly job."
good,"Not as much fun as it used to be. Much less friendly than in the past. Not as flexible with scheduling, or anything else, than they used to be."
good,"I worked in the Bakery, and it was not fun at all! The management was horrible, lazy co-workers, and nothing was ever taken care of. If you had a problem, nobody ever took care of it."
good,a typical day at work would consist of me constantly having late breaks and thats after me nagging for a long time and some of my coworkers would even get locked out of their registers because management took so long to get their breaks. The hardest part was probably dealing with managements incompetence in the same issues every single day.
good,Customer and cleanliness are the guidelines. Must be on time. Present yourself with respect. Customer is always right. Be the best person you are capable.
good,"I had all the experience needed for management, however they never worked with you on moving forward. In turn that was the deal breaker. Unfortunately for the pay the job was not worth having for the hours I worked."
good,"I was a 17 plus yrs associate.  No night differential pay, No Sun $1 xtra/hr, unpaid Holidays, closed only on Xmas,  attendance policy went from  9 to 5 pts. Not enough help, micro managed. 2%standard pay raise or non at all. Call in on a holiday it's 3points. No open door policy unless you wanna be black balled. Not family oriented"
good,"At Walmart they will spread you too thin, have you working in areas you have no clue also sometimes without no knowledge. They don’t give constructive criticism and employees are sometimes treated unfairly. I liked being good st my job because I applied myself and it thought me how to multitask and because a team leader."
good,"High Management is slow and lazy, all they wanna do is write up for the littlest things. Good people work there but lots of young kids. Nothing gets done on time."
good,"Managerial staff are rude, while working in different locations there are not enough staff and everything usually falls on one person. The associates are tasked with running an entire department by themselves without help or assistance and are threatened to be reprimanded if not completed."
good,"Thought it would be a chance for advancement and career growth "
good,"it was alright working here. not the best job but good to get work experience. workers are cool, customers can be difficult. its not as bad as I thought it would be."
good,A typical day started by greeting customers and servicing their needs. I learned how to operate the register and count drawers. I don't think the job was hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was being able to put a smile on the customers' faces.
good,"The management team at my recent store constantly contriducted one another, and seemed as if employees were retaliated against for informing higher ups about any disagreements or concerns within the store."
good,"Basically you already do work of 3 ppl, and thats ok. I like working  fast paced and staying busy. However, certain associates that are well known or ""in the clique get treated with more respect and do not accumulate exception points like others. Some get to choose their days off and the shifts they work. Assistant managers are not consistent with theie expectations and rules. ."
good,Venice store is the pits. It used to be great but quickly going downhill.  From what I hear many of the stores are not great. Management is getting worse and worse with time. Alot of people are not happy
good,"Overall co-workers weren't bad, management was all about favoritism, good at your job? good luck trying to get out of that position as ""we need you as this since you're so good at it"", Communication as a whole was just middle of the road if you had issues with something or needed something done depending on the manager could take 10 minutes to 2 weeks of waiting. This is what I dealt with whilst I was working there"
good,This job has taught me a lot about how a photo lab operates. It was a difficult job when it used chemicals. The job became easier once it became chemical free.
good,Need to treat workers with respect no room to grow  pay never enough give you a bonus and then cut your hours give you a raise and cut your hours do the work of four people and they want more
good,"The management wasn’t that great, people who did their job ended up getting solely relied on while slackers still slacked off. There was favorites. It could have changed since I’ve been there it’s been awhile, so I don’t want to judge t lo harshly, it had its moments. Good way to meet people, but sometimes it makes you annoyed with the people you do meet."
good,"If you want to work at Walmart, be prepared to listen to customers tell corny jokes, at best. Typically they'll just yell at you about long lines or high prices, which neither one you can control. Be prepared to tolerate actual crackheads and thieves. Oh, and I can't forget to mention the managers, who don't listen to what you have to say and don't want to work with you at all. Don't expect weekends off unless you've been there for 30 years already. I asked off for ONE Saturday for my ACT test and got rejected because we're understaffed. And yes, I requested it six months in advance."
good,Its time to do something different. I enjoyed the work when i first started but I don't like the working there anymore. The customers are fun to get to know them and so are some of the employees too.
good,A typical  day varied for me based on what I did that because i floated  thru departments. I would be in layaway then hardware then be a csm then be in sporting good then in electronics etc.
good,Worked at the distribution center great place to work.  The management was terrible very laxed .   the employees were bullies and had their own agenda
good,Wal-Mart can and does over ride their own rules when terminating an associate. One can be accused of something without proof.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
good,Working as a Customer Experience Salesfloor Associate at Walmart is a good part time job for people who need the money. Limited flexibility with shift changes and vacation.
good,Managers are not very helpful they try to bring you down more then help you. Long time standing no one wants to give you a break some customers are very rude just because you doing your job
good,"You manage yourself, the managers do not have your back with any decisions you are forced to make. They never help, they dont lead by example. It is full of childish people"
good,"At least at this walmart, the zero communication between management and employees makes for a difficult work environment. The cliques and backstabbing is just as bad. There is room for advancement however with Walmart more focused on online than brick and mortar stores may become smaller and staff size reduced."
good,Very fast paced environment with little to no relief.  Supervisor was not professional but did treat everyone the same-not nice.  There was a lack of communication between upper management and workers.
good,They don't except Dr excuses or allow you any room for being absent due to emergencies. I have 3 small children 2 in daycare and 1 in school when they are sick they can't go to school or daycare but my points are still added against me even with medical excuses and on police report 😠 very. This should be illegal as everyone has emergencies and a family Ife outside of work.
good,There an okay place to work. You meet some good and bad people. Management was good until then got new management. Hours are decent and pay is decent but they should work with you more.
good,It wasn't the greatest place to work because you always had customers complaining and not enough cashiers always getting yelled at by people including management with no support. If you ask for help they just kind of ignore you. your voice is never really hard there. A lot of Petty drama!
good,I started as a cashier and switched departments for a full-time position in AP Customer Host. But some management only cares about themselves. The store I worked in wasn't good because of it. Management doesn't care.
good,"Enjoyed cashiering for walmart.  Met a lot of different people. I love helping people.  Fast paced, always something to do.  Hardest part of job was standing all day.  Career advancement always encouraged."
good,"I worked as a deli associate. I made almost 13/HR. I loved my co workers and really enjoyed how fast-paced and how much multi tasking was needed. I would recommend this job to certain people you would enjoy that kind of enviroment. As far as long term I would recommend.. Low wages, strict rules and such a big company complaints fall on deaf ears. Long term employess had unkindly things to say . short term worth it, though."
good,"I would not recommend taking a service manger job , the way they have thing set up your bad employee no madder if your by the book or if your not. you will lose your staff if you are , if your not managment will find any excuse to get rid of you , had the feeling my store hated the service manger position especially if you were trained in Bentonville Ak , and what a joke about calling them if thier an issue they never answer the phone .."
good,"started working as a cashier about a year ago. in the beginning i had good set of hours every 3 weeks around the holidays my hours increase ( Halloween, Thanksgiving, & x-mas) after the holidays around the beginning of jan. they cut my hours around to one 1 day a week.  I asked to pick up more shifts . there response was "" we cutting hours we hired to many people"". i am a student in college. so at first i didn't stress it i just forced on school. then around March my hours went back and it keeps going good for one week and less hours the next. Walmart is good around college students just don't give you hours"
good,"I work there almost 2 years only called off one time. I was pretty much loyal to the company, then I started getting so many changes it felt like every other week. this is one of the reasons I end up getting over my points,because it was lack of communication I was putting in the wrong PTO time but management never told me. Only response I was gettin was,they expect you to read it then I'm going to tell you nothing about it like I never heard that from any job that I've worked at"
good,Very high turn over with employees and Management. You have to do your job and everyone else’s. Lack of management support or help when needed. Fire and rehire the same people that don’t do work.
good,"Management complain nothing gets done, all they do is sit in their office relax in a ac room while the employee work very hard in a place that doesn’t have ac, they work and sweat no ac on"
good,"I did enjoy working there, met alot of new people and got to learn about different cultures while interacting with customers. The only only downside about my time there was the unfairness of some of the members of management. They displayed alot of favoritism to many other associates often letting them get away with more then should have."
good,"associates are not promoted on their abilities they are promoted by how much they are liked by management, so it doesn't matter how good a worker you are if you are not popular with management."
good,Working for Walmart was great. The Point system takes getting used to. The managers were great and so were most of the co-workers. The environment was fast paced sometimes when it was busy it could be a little stressful.
good,This is a good beginner job for any high school students or graduates...definitely dont recommend for long term...cashiering is easy and quick to learn
good,"Being the only game in town as far as Walmarts go made this store crazy to work at sometimes.  Many people came and went, both as regular employees and as managers."
good,"be prepared for some awful members of management with minimal training half the time and repetitive online training if any. you will literally do the same exact thing every single day, the only enjoyable part is the coworkers."
good,"A common day at work is understocked, over worked and to have the managers favorites to get perks before work ethic. Hard workers tend to be over worked and not able to make plans, they forget to make schedules. Those who play around and dont really work tend to move up faster then those who work everyday"
good,"Steady work, but management a lot of times does not follow its own policy, or will enforce policy on one person while letting another get away with violations. Some people can damage equipment and nothing said because they put up good production numbers, Then others are written up or suspended for the same violations."
good,"They WILL NOT give full time hours even though, in writting by corporite because they dont like giving, benifits.. "
good,It was a bitter sweet expirence. Some times i look back on fondly and other not so much. My biggest grievance with walmart is how my tenure ended but besides that it was fine
good,j'étais simplement en formation chez eux je ne suis pas rester suffisament longtemps pour faire un review complet mais  pour le peut de temps ou je suis rester c'étais relativement correcte
good,I had a lot of issues with employees and management. I had troubles trying to find management 99% of the time. They worked with you on court dates but not with family illness or family related issues.
good,"When I got to work we would clock in & management or our supervisor would let us know how many trucks we have on our GM side & also the grocery side, I learned right much at Walmart mostly leaned how to work their equipment.... The hardest part of the job was actually trying to work because Walmart stayed crowed. The most enjoyable part was they gave me 40 hours"
good,"Love what I do, but management doesn't work with you. Be ready to be talked down to as well as not know if your 1 day away of not having a job. also, don't be a person that is late for work or no shows a lot."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working there. Management can be a pain. Customers are rude. "
good,Ok issues with an injury benefits managers are not good with communication pay is good hours are good the atmosphere is nice to work in customers are friendly exspecially the regulars the remodel is coming along nice
good,"Positions being eliminated all the time.  Seems that they are pushing out long time associates to bring in lower paid associates.  Upper management is not involved in the day to day realities of customer service.  Policies are introduced only to be eliminated a year later when they realize the old policies worked better. I was a long time dedicated associate only to have my position eliminated and deemed unnecessary.   The positions offered to me were at a significant pay cut.  That position has since been brought back with a new title, and a much lower pay grade."
good,"It was okay at the start but the front end was poorly managed and some workers were treated not as equals. For example, I am technically still a minor because I'm still in high school and they were denying me my lunch and I only had one break for 6 hour shifts nearly every day I worked."
good,Company boast about respect but does not give it. They only believe in finding out where associates fail and never look into finding out what they do well causing a bad relationship between associates and management.make associates take on mandatory overtime when the issue is upper management not looking at the big picture and taking steps to avoid it.when work gets slow they make associates take days and weeks off without compensation not caring about the employees wellbeing.
good,Walmart is not a bad place to work. I would say it’s more of a problem with the managers not making sure everyone is getting the job done equally.Overall the pay is fine.
good,"Walmart can be a great place to work. But they tend to hire people to be managers and supervisors that are too overzealous. And they are not fair in divvying out the workload. They have their own clicks, and their little work pets. That they choose over other workers. I think their point system sucks sucks. However best place I ever worked with in West Virginia. The staff was amazing!"
good,"I worked at Walmart well I was in college."
good,It's not a bad job. But they don't offer a lot of hours you start as part time and when you work to try getting full time they cut your hours to prevent it.
good,No recognition. Management not trained. Too much favoritism. Overworked. Treated poorly by management and customers. To many changes within company with no benefits to the associate
good,"Is an ok job to have, they offer opportunities to grow that’s what they say but if it not good for them they will not offer you nothing no matter how hard you work."
good,"It was a great first job. There wasn't much risk in it, you weren't expected to be the best. Not very many chances to move up. If I had to give Walmart a rating, I'd give it a 3/5"
good,As an AM work life balance is non existent. Learned however to manage people in both trying times as well as the easiest down time. Upcoming changes the company has planned is going to cost them however.
good,"Good place to start when you’re fresh out of high school and just want a part time gig to get you through college. Depending on which store you go, it can either be relaxed or bad to the point where the managers act inappropriately and cover up for those who do the same. Not a place I would make a career out of."
good,"I enjoy working there at Walmart, it was a friendly staff, the management I think needs a bit of work. Fast paced but at times it was slow. I was always busy in the Sporting Goods department where I was assigned to work."
good,"Management was okay they were a little unreliable, i really liked the people i worked with, it was fairly easy job as long as you tried your hardest. The scheduling was a little unreliable and would have to constantly check"
good,Working there is ok. Just can be overwhelming at some points. There point system for call outs is ok.. however being part time it's really hard to earn any PTO or vacation time.
good,I would not recommend this job to anyone I was treated like a slave that worked full time hours but had a part time position so they didn’t have to pay me benefits
good,I have been with Wal-Mart for 3 years. My coworkers have become like family to me.. a HUGE CON is I am literally only making a quarter more than the new hires make as soon as they start! Though I have been told several times over the years that I would be a manager if I had an open availability!
good,"When I first began working at Walmart I was somewhat excited to be working in the automotive department. And I enjoyed learning what I did, but after a couple of weeks I noticed I wasn’t getting the hours I was promised so I barely made enough t get by."
good,"I worked in Walmart St. John's for months. My co cashiers were friendly and the front end department too. It's just frustrates me because I don't get weekends off. And there's this store assistant manager who doesnt know how to run a register and is loud. If the store gets busy, they call the floor associates or anyone even the management to run the registers."
good,I did not like working there at all it was an ok job it was just the people that I worked with were very rude and I was not in a good mood every when I was on the clock.
good,It was okay to work there. The location had a hard time keeping staff and it was a bit stressful because of it. I was doing other duties besides my intended duties that I was hired for.
good,my job at Walmart was fun. but scheduling was bad. they were understaffed. the store manager was in adequate at doing his job because he was running the store as a super center but it was a small store. the benefits were ok but could have been better.
good,Walmart was a great place to work for a few years ago now they are going through a lot of changes structurally and I am not liking the direction they are headed
good,"Here's the problem:no real advancement, they intice you with a decent starting pay and don't tell you that after 2 years youll never get another raise."
good,Good place to meet people. Learning is a must. So many different jobs to choice from. Good for High School students for a first job. Use this as an opportunity for the future. Stepping stone.
good,While working at Walmart you develop relationships with complete strangers that you will never forget. Friendly work environment and shifts go by fast.
good,They need to teach their managers to appreciate the employees even if it’s just saying good job or say something positive all they do is find something wrong instead of finding something right
good,"Started out as a cart pusher Drove me nuts working on Minimum wage, was glad to work as an unloader but still not enough to earn a living, Management kept Hounding us to improve when we were Working our Butts off and always Complaining!"
good,"Wal-Mart is like trying figure out where you wannabe"
good,"Management can be summed up as follows: The right hand doesn’t have a clue what the left hand is doing."
good,"Working for Walmart can be a difficult task, specially with all its high standards. The company has done well to provide for myself and my family and provide hours when needed. The management at my store could use a little tweaking with everyone being such people pleaser, but there are a few who work hard to keep the associates happy. Over all working there is fine."
good,"Management doesn't tell you what's expected of you, and it changes all the time...go through store managers frequently...i was expected to do fitting room plus price and answer phones all at the same time...."
good,"Walmart started out ok, but they dont care about employees,  they expect alot out of an employee in an 8 hr shift. Not enough employees in the fresh side, and I was hurt due to not having a proper amount of empoyees"
good,"It’s an overall great place to start working if you’re in school. The management is poor though, so there are some days where things become stressful."
good,"Me ah sido util  laborar para Walmart, ya que te dan la oportunidad de un crecimiento a corto plazo y dia a dia con las exigencias de la operacion de cada tienda logras tener la capacidad de solucionar problemas trabajar con sentido de urgencia y cuentas  con la capacitacion requerida para cada una de las actividades que se te soliciten a diario ."
good,"Muy malas experiencias desde los sugerentes, el gerente, personal de RH, y hasta los mismos compañeros."
good,"Had a management meeting at 9 am  about attendance, call off, what needed to be done that day and for the rest of the week. Then a meeting with the DM to past on information,"
good,Everyone was out for themselves no one was very helpful. I needed different hours which were discussed in my initial interview and then when I went to work it was a different story.
good,"Working for Walmart was extremely stressful,  they do not work with you as far as scheduling, time off request are often denied even for legal and medical purposes overall not a company I would work for again."
good,I loved working for walmart.I got to interact with new people everyday .Walmart is a good place to work if you are looking for a set job somewhere you can move up
good,"The scheduling on night shift was impossible to get used to. You may work 3 nights straight and be off for 2 nights, then work 1, off one. And the next week you may be off 4 days straight followed by 2 on, 1off, 1 on. No consistency at all. The management was young and did more horse playing with the younger employees rather than work"
good,"The salary managers at Walmart do not treat the associates very well. They like to talk down to associates. They always focus on the bad and never encourage associates to do better. They never commend you for a job well done unless you are one of their favorites. They do not like to tell you what you are doing wrong in your job. Instead, they tell you to figure out what you are doing wrong and fix it. If I knew what process I was doing wrong, I could correct it. Their schedule has been revamped and not very flexible for students/family life. They do not like to give associates time off during holidays. They like to shove a lot of work on you that would normally take 2 to 3 people to finish."
good,My department manager was extremely rude to me and yelled at me in front of customers. My main manager never had the time to talk to me so I could fix my schedule.
good,Management was always willing to step in to help with your job if needed. Just like any job there was some drama. Overall I would recommend Logan Walmart as a place of employment.
good,"Really hard please or work at the all they care about is your numbers!! "
good,The management or lack there of was atrocious. It was like working with little kids that don’t know what they are doing and the management had favorites.
good,"A place to get initial experience, however it is not a highly qualified place to give enough credit to hard working employees. there needs to be more managerial improvements."
good,It's okay if they have a very good management team. I really enjoyed working at Walmart l really miss here and my kid's love this place. I just wish the scheduling was better and the management.
good,"Unload the truck,  managed schedule reprice,stocked,  tag and ship items out "
good,"Fasted paced with a lot of drama in the departments, especially if you were not on really good terms with store managers. "
good,"Walmart policies are designed to help management and the customers. Everyone else is pushed aside and put in difficult situations. Scheduling is terrible if you’re not open availability; and if you are, you’re not going to be off very much. Good for people who don’t have anything else to do or too many bills to pay."
good,"Sucks depend on the store well the people sometimes good sometimes bad but most management sucks......................................"
good,"The place sucked and walmart should be sued for false advertising showing happy workers.  Benefits suck, the manager was riding a broom.  H.R. Was a joke, the discounts was half assed, the customers were not very nice especially on sundays on their way to church."
good,My biggest issue with this place besides being absolutely disgusting was the Management. They were rude and disrespectful. You had co workers banging employees. It was horrifying.
good,No one listens and hr can only do so much. unless you are in their clique you dont advance. Co workers were amazing and I miss them and the atmosphere
good,"Advancement is made by favoring someone close to management,  should be done by who is qualified for the job. Alot of people get passed by in return crates a bad environment."
good,"*Fast place to work"
good,The job is easy. It’s the management that’s super aggravating. Poor communication. They over work you and then write you up for not finishing. Bonuses aren’t much if anything needs to be replaced or fixed it comes out of the associates bonus. For every day you miss it comes out of your bonus.
good,"My job title was for tech, but i did all roles, my manager was always extra appreciative of it, so i didn't mind. I made some really good friends working there and i enjoyed my time there"
good,The work environment was very strict with little room for error. There was very little patience and understanding for hourly workers. I started out getting the hard part of the job and it got worse the 3 years I was there.
good,Nice part time job. Not easy to move up in the company. Coworkers are friendly and you meet interesting customers. Con is your not valued by management.
good,"It was just a bad experience for me. I didn't get enough hours that I needed. Some of the management was temperamental, others were kind but the rude ones out weighed those. Not good as a first job."
good,"Bonus compensation not paid out when told it would be. No recognition for doing a good job. Management and supervisors did not have good communication, did not respect employees or listen to concerns."
good,Managers I had always argued with one another and sometimes got the employees involved in said arguments. The pay was fine but the stigma of being a wal-mart employee wasn't worth it.
good,"Good place to work but not long term, enjoyed helping customers and coworkers. Will continue to shop there and reapply when I am able to. Was let go but approved for rehire in 90 days."
good,"Walmart is a great company  to work for as long as you have a management  team that stands behind you and helps you when asked. Walmart goes through  a lot of changes and policy  changes, you have to keep up with everything."
good,"They make the rules at that time to separate you and the company.  If not they will make up something to call you in to be separate you and if you have proof that they are in the wrong that is not in your favor, they will make reasons for what ever they to make separation to happen in other words your going to lose. Sorry about that but that's what happens, been there and done that. I was not terminated, been there on the front lines of discussion in these situations. I told them its your company do as you see fit. Thank and have a good day."
good,Only training you get is in the back not with a live person. Back when iworked there they did price matching never explained the right way to do that on toys etc. Neither on wic you basically get on a register and learn yourself right or wrong. Had questions managers took for ever to get there.
good,"Working at Walmart is not my best choice. I feel like I am losin myself with the work. The mangers do answer your qustion. I work full time but i get pat time hours. I do not mine working in other department, but I do not work in the place they hired me to do. I do but only one day a week."
good,You can be doing you job and have management come and change what you have to do numerous times in one night. but the work is ok. I liked doing the work it was no problem. It was just management and the people i worked with.
good,"Walmart is, well, Walmart. There is a consistent lack of cashiers, rather it be due to a scheduling error or call-outs. They don’t accept doctors notes, which is terrible, because I had bronchitis for two weeks and could barely speak and I was working. The management is iffy, some are very polite, others are rude."
good,Paid well but the management was bad (at least with my experience) Very competitive and the managers liked to play favorites. You pretty much were like a robot.
good,"Never enough staff to do the job, no consistency with staff expectations.  Some staff didn't have  to do all job  requirements leaving more work for other staff. Wage low not enough to live on comfortably."
good,"Walmart is a job for students and working moms looking for extra income. You can have a career there, but it really does depend on your store and the management there. Some stores promote based of of merit. For the most part, it's who you know and how you know them. It's retail and not rocket science, and they have the worst customers in the business."
good,"Walmart is a standard retail juggernaut, management will break policy to appease customers while workers would be reprimanded for the same. The way management ran at my store was awful but not every Walmart is the same yet the toxic corporate culture in a store level is dreadful at every store."
good,"Get exactly what's on the tin, a starter job to keep while trying to find another one.  Management is hit and miss, customers are as well, ranging from decent to downright rude."
good,"it would be ok if you had good mangers. they blow you off it wasnt even a hand full that you could go to about a problem, and they hours  they gave you wasn't enough"
good,"Your experience will depend on the store you work at. I've worked 2 different stores. The first was the best job I've ever had. Love the management, they cared about employees. Good pay and work performance based raises. The second one was the polar opposite! It was a nightmare.so ask the current employees how they like the job, tell them your looking to start."
good,Management is rude and unorganized you have to know someone to get days off or put in a fair work environment favoritism is showed a lot peers lack team work breaks were not given properly or lunches
good,Don’t get use to this job because they will let you go just as fast as u got hired.managers be tripping hours aren’t guaranteed and they constantly switch your position
good,"A typical day of work was stressful, there was always too much expected of staff and not enough time to do what was needed. As a department manager, i was always helping my associates to complete their tasks."
good,"Worked at several departments over a period of 3 years. Got promoted 3 times and moved up levels until I moved to a steady department. "
good,They do not care of people come to work or not.  There is no advantage for work performance  employees make the same wage no matter how good or how long they have done the job.
good,Depending on the management working at Walmart can be a joyful or draining experience. The section I worked in was like not the best so I had to do a majority of the work alone for hours on end.
good,I got fired because I was in ICU in the hospital for a week. Other that that I didn’t really have and other concerns about working there. I didn’t understand why they feel it’s ok to do that.
good,Work from moment you clock in till the time you clock out in various departments performing various tasks. Communication is very important for the list of tasks to be completed.
good,"Was a very good, and fun job for the first 6 to 7 months until new managers came in and made going to work miserable. Went against policy and was always very disrespectful towards employees"
good,"Limited opportunities for growth. High turnover rate in management and associate positions at my location.  Because it is retail, you are required to work all holidays and scheduling time off was difficult to gain approvals.  The management style at this location did not allow sufficient time to complete one task before you were given additional tasks."
good,No le gusto el manejo de gerencia hacia el personal externo
good,Its nice to work at Walmart because they follow the rules a lot however sometimes the environment can become exhausting because of customers. The management is understanding and professional.
good,The job was poor management and every time we slowed down for like some water or something like that they would threaten our job and if you think I’m over exaggerating think again they did this with pretty much any employee.
good,Management needs to be retrained they let power get to their heads. But felt like a family overall all the employees were nice I loved interacting with customers
good,"There are usually no pay raised except MAYBE once a year. Even then, it's only a 2% pay raise. The bonuses are extremely inconsistent. You don't get a set amount of vacation or sick time. You earn it through PTO, which that whole system is a massive cluster f*ck of stupidity. There is no respect for the associate. Most managers sit around and let problems continue. They don't care as long as they get their $48k a year plus their $10k bonus. The company is not worth working for."
good,"Been with rhe compnay 13yrs. Its a seniority based company. Top out is currently a little over $20/hr. When I started it was hard work bit paid good and was a fun place. That's not rhe case anymore. Now it's all about the numbers. Insurance gets worse every year. Sick time can only be used for your family members. Recently lowered our vacation time. It's not the place it used to be. Ive watched 20+ yr associates walk out the door because of the place it has become. They constantly give people errors for things they can't control. It's just not the same company it used to be. "
good,"Benefits are great, work is easy enough but it all depends on management. Typically poorly trained and demotivating. Also cutting positions and hours year to year."
good,"Hardly able to do your job because team members don’t do theirs correctly. Also, hard to do your own tasks because you are always told to pick up someone else’s task."
good,"Poor attitude is a reflection of poor leadership. This is echoed throughout the organization. Better training is needed from top down,many of the managers manage but don't lead."
good,"I have been a 21 year associate for this company.  My position was an AP ASM, unfortunatey upper management would not allow me to do asset protection.  Each day was demanding operations.  Upper management  gave me 2 coaching within two weeks, when I have never been coached in all of my years of employment.  The coachings did not reflect the actual events that occurred and were untrue.  As a salary paid employee I would stay many hours on my own personal time to make sure that tasks were completed."
good,To start you are set to do one assignment and then get pulled by a lazy department manager to do all of their tasks.  Truly tough to keep up with so managers pulling you from one department to another.  Very cliquey and some have very bad attitudes.
good,I got to learn a lot on merchandise and sales. Working in different store departments made me have a diverse knowledge of the different daily activities and customer interaction. I am confident I will be able to run my own business well in the near future.
good,It was a good job at first but slowly because worse and worse as managers got fired or quit. Associates stopped caring and stopped coming in. Now the Walmart I worked at isn't so great. Currently there's only one associate for the electronics department. And he lives with me.
good,"Tiene su lado bueno, te incentivan a querer más, pero mi área era pesada, mis compañeros no hacían bien su trabajo y mi jefa de departamento era alguien imposible de tratar, estuve de tiempo completo pero era nefasta la paga."
good,La actitud de los lideres de departamentos es  intimidante y hostil
good,They picked favorites. There was only one manager who cared about the workers. One cashier was praised for something the another cashier does the same thing and they get fired for it. It is an unfair workplace overall.
good,Very stressful job as a stocker. It was a good job for starting out but didn't like working hard and only being told to work harder when others were not held accountable.
good,As a cashier for Walmart you get most of the bad things told to you from around the store. If we were out of something the customer wanted you hear about it.
good,"Walmart was interesting to say the least. There was a lot of people who would come in and then leave because of management, other works, unfair hours and inconsiderate customers."
good,"When I worked there I started as a door greeter then spent a lot of time in the registers but pay was never chsnged."
good,Didn't like it as much. You get in trouble for everything. Including if you get close to having over time. I did not like management. Would yell at you in front of customers.
good,"You generally start your day by finishing the work the previous shifts did not complete. And then you spend the rest the day getting hassled by management for not completing your tasks on time. Once you move into salaried management Walmart has you on a hook. They can let you go at the drop of a hat. As a result salary management is often very unreasonable, sets ridiculous expectations, and treats their hourly associates poorly. Obviously there are exceptions to these examples but they are few and far between because of the pressure put on assistant managers and store managers by their superiors. On the plus side the friendships you make in difficult situations and in difficult jobs are often friendships that last a very long time."
good,"Poor work environment, Not the better places of work, poor management and leadership examples, median pay, wal-mart only cares about themselves and not the employees."
good,"Use to be ok, but not anymore. They took away alot of bonuses and perks. Have to work every holiday with no extra pay. Took away Sunday incentive. Thank you"
good,There isn't much to say about the workplace besides some of the managers don't know how to run the place. I got left alone in my area a lot even before I was fully trained. I pretty much trained myself.
good,No good managers. No one cares about customers. Attitudes all the time. Special privileges to certain associates when everyone should be treated fairly.
good,"Don't apply if you can't stand for long periods of time..have a bad back..or good supportive shoes.  A lot of bending, leaning, walking, lifting,  etc."
good,"my day would be to unload daily truck sort into departments, during my shift we are allowed 2  fiftteen minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch.  Stock in designated area by shift or support manager. I enjoyed working with my associates and keeping busy."
good,"VERY poor management!!!"
good,Managers wanted to be more like store managers no communication with team members wasn’t respectful golf customers overall it’s a good place to work if you want to be disrespected
good,"Clock in, label cases, and ensure that they make it all the way to shipping. "
good,"With relatively low pay, competitive hours, strenuous, work environment and poor management, Walmart is a tough place to work. I felt like my managers didn’t care about me or the other employees and it was hard to maintain a personal life outside of work because of  poor scheduling. Also, I was promised a 2% raise but never saw an extra penny 2 months after when said pay raise would go into effect. It’s fast paced, and the majority of customers treat you poorly however there is room for advancement and  benefits if you are full-time"
good,"Walmart wants you to give them the moon and the stars but don't want to pay you what you are really worth. They will have you doing everything, some things that you are not even trained for but don't want to pay you. Some of the managers should not even be managers because they are just as clueless as the new employees."
good,"Walmart is is place that constantly changes its policy from the management level, as a result, the lower level employees are left to suffer the consequences."
good,"Been working for Walmart for 6 years and have been promoted twice with raises on all six years and only make 15 an hour. That amount of work you do as a supervisor and the amount your paid is not worth it. Management has a “Just get it done” attitude. Even when you have no people to do the work, making for very overworked and poorly paid people. Hard workers get worked to the ground while poor workers stick around and do nothing. You’ll get sick and tired of putting 120% and getting no where while people putting 30% get to to stay that way and barely ever get held accountable. You’ll always be stuck with bad workers when your a supervisor and whenever you do get a good one they end up quitting or become influenced by the poor workers. Management will promise you the world if you keep doing things for them and never deliver. Drama is rampant, can’t say one thing without it being all over the store in a day."
good,There were low standards but id you showed up and did your job then you kept your job. Whether you were efficient at it or not. The possibility for advancement was few and far between.
good,"It’s very poor scheduling of shifts in every department. I don’t understand why you would not have some personnel working in each department on the weekends! Then you only have a opener and closer at the service desk. If you complain, then it’s turned around against you! Basically you work your job, plus that as security, and janitorial!"
good,"No typical day, varies a lot; learned to watch my back and who could be trusted; Some managers were GREAT, others didn't really care about anything but their bonuses; Most of the other associates were good people, friendly and helpful; Hardest part is learning who you can trust and who you can't; most customers were great."
good,The company is a good company to work for. They have lost of benefits and companies they partner with that you can get discounts with as well. There is money within the company but the stress level increases as the pay goes up. In certain positions the pay isn't tha best but the job role is important.
good,The management is very poor. They do pretty much nothing to help there staff unless they have been there for a long time and when t comes to new staff having any concerns with older staff it doesn’t get handled and basically pushed under the rug. Very horrible time scheduling for new staff!
good,"Constant pressure to sell master cards and make customers donate, it is u real how much stress CSM put on u while they go on theirs phone and gossip. Most people working here are older and they very unhappy and negative to be around(coworkers). Also costumers treat u (throw their items on the belt, very rude and demanding) and think u are trying to spy on them while u wait for them to pay also think they are better then u constantly."
good,"The Fredericksburg walmart is very lacklustre in it's appreciation of it's employees. They make you cut overtime hut having u take longer lunchs or go home earlier than normal. If you refuse to cut they threaten with write ups. The overall experience is toxic and petty. Most of the management behaves like children on a power trip. They yell at employees, refuse to hear the employee out, and spread rumors behind that employees back. Some have gone on to say to others employed there that they want to fire those they don't like personally."
good,"To get ya feet in the door of adulting as a first job , this was an experience. The hours were pretty flexible and the work wasn’t bad. The management was all over the place causing ruckus."
good,"Walmart was a different type of surrounding for me, people are low staffed so I was told to cover three counters and fitting room by myself and was in trouble bc I couldn’t get tables folded. I’ve never been more stressed in my life."
good,"Made some okay friends, but the management,drama, and favoritism, ruins it for the most part. and discount of 10% isn't much either,doesn't include food either, unless holidays."
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work as long as you are a hard worker and work at a good pace. Managers are cool until the store manager are stressed taking it out on employees.
good,"Fast paced, high stress but great if you enjoy the job. Must be able to work fast and be accurate with a smile on your face. The associates who work in this department usually stay for a long period of time. They usually know more about policy and procedures than management."
good,I liked the job when i first got it but they were changing to the brand new system of how to do things and honestly no one knows what they’re doing anymore. The managers try to do what they think is best but there’s so many different managers they all think something different is better so when getting trained it was so confusing and then you would get in trouble for doing stuff wrong but you got trained to do it that way! it’s stressful and they need to get on the same page in upper management so it doesn’t trickle down on the employees.
good,"The actual work I performed regularly was good, I enjoyed it for the most part, but the politics involved were atrocious. I could work all day easily if not for the interruptions of people higher up the chain with ridiculous behaviors, not to mention the incredible lack of support from ""supportive"" staff. It's quite possible that they would not re-hire me due to me giving my opinion before leaving."
good,"The constant turnover makes it hard to get a good team"
good,"I worked as a Fresh Cap 2 associate and I will never do it again. Management never had anything good to say and were always quick to criticize and complain. No matter how hard you tried or how hard you worked, you still were yelled at. In my case, I worked the produce department by myself 75% of the time and could never get anything done because it is a 3 to 4 person job and I always got yelled at for never having anything done. Every time I asked Management to have someone help me, I was ignored. Every night I made sure I left that place clean even though I never left on time. I would always leave 2 to 3 hours after I was scheduled to leave. I did not enjoy any part of the job because I was always pulled to work other departments jobs; for example: deli, bakery and meat, and could never get my own job done. I was always told to do one thing and then would immediately be yelled at for doing it. The hardest part of the job was the entire thing and dealing with management."
good,I work hard when I was there and I never got benefits when I was a part timer I didn't work hard at the Walmart I was at and I had benefits I put a transferring I like to have vacation sunday's off holiday pay sick time is sick time and vacation holiday pay and up to at least 15 bucks an hour or or I will not come back
good,The relationships between the employees are great but the communication between management and personel is definitely in need of improvement. If there was a better channel for a small town complaints the whole chain of command is a trap.
good,"High volume store and limited staff"
good,"I like walmart just need more hours."
good,"I would wake up each morning and be at work by 4 am. The CAP Team was responsible for auditing inventory in the back room, product placement, and customer service. The workload was often overwhelming for the expected pace and management at the higher levels seldom acknowledged this. Lots of heavy lifting, pulling, pushing, and climbing ladders. The training modules never seemed to end and severely cut into working hours (not to mention the 2-decades-outdated terminals that would often crash half way through the programs). But, the work was consistent."
good,"Walmart itself is a great company with great opportunities.  Unfortunately, the leadership teams at store and market level do not follow the same beliefs as the company itself.  It is all in who you know.  People getting promoted off friendships and family relationships, not on quality or ability to do the job. "
good,"The managers I worked with didn't evaluate/ talk to you to fix what you were doing wrong, they would only criticize and try to degrade you. They never offered up tips on how you could improve, they only talked about how fast they could've gotten the job done."
good,Ramsey street Walmart could be better to many managers backstabbing very stressful never know when they are going to let you go for no reason laying off
good,"If you don’t mind flexible scheduling or time away from your family, this would be the perfect job. Would only recommend this employer if you can deal with rude customers."
good,"Expect to work long hours as management. There are too many managers over a given area, making it so you often find your associate pulled to do something in another given area."
good,"As a single mother, the company provided me with benefits to care for my daughters and advancement opportunity slowly. Great job for many who are starting out in your career."
good,"They pay pretty ok however they never had any hours to compensate the rate of pay. By the end of the pay period you have less than  20 hours, which is hardly nothing."
good,It's a job that requires to constantly adapt to the lack of hours given to associates to put more effort into making sure the customer is satisfied with their store experience. It puts a lot of pressure on management to be successful in a high-demand work environment.
good,Management is the major reason to not work at Walmart they are always changing the task to do and that just goes down the chain of command and it’s just a mess.
good,"The daily work assignments were chaotic and subject to last-minute changes. I learned that lower-level management personnel there tend to be very protective of their positions, not their employees. I actually enjoyed interacting with customers but sometimes management's demands were counterintuitive to actually performing the loss prevention part of my job. The hardest part of my job was adjusting to random hours on random days. The most enjoyable part of my job was my friendships with some very nice co-workers."
good,"If you ever work in a Walmart,  it can be a good place,  as long as managers never play favorites and follow protocols for advancement.  Promotion of friends is a common practice,  but they don't tend to cross the line on conflict of interest. "
good,This company has made some of the worst changes possible in 2018-2019. The worker no longer has a feeling of accomplishment nor do you feel valued by management. Lack of readily available schedules from home/phone have led to no call no shows due to employees not being informed in a timely manner. Scheduling outside an employees availability and then holding it against them with the new point system has led to firing long time associates. I do not recommend working at Walmart at this time unless it is temporary.
good,La empresa es buena pero actualmente hay una gerente que es demasiado déspota y he recibido discriminación de su parte
good,not bad. very few things to do. but not very good management. do not recommend. it is good for part time job. not a permanent job. gets by when you need money.
good,They try everything they can do to  keep associates but they are so uptight and strict that people do not want to work there. Last I heard they had changed what they wear and how much they pay minimum wage associates. That's great but its more than just what they wear and how much the associates get paid. They do not show respect or dignity. They don't  listen to their  associates.
good,"Although they paid decently, Walmart is not the place to work at if you wanted to be treated fairly and with respect. They no longer accept a doctors note if you get sick and will only allow 4 missed days before they let you go. So better not get sick and no one else either"
good,"Management was very poor. If you ask them a question they shrug it off. Expect more out of certain people, while others get away with taking extra breaks."
good,"It was always crowded there was never a day when the lines were backed up. Management was poor, they were times when they genuinely didn't care about customers or other employees."
good,"As a cashier, a typical day was coming in, clocking in and being assigned a cash register. It was the same, boring and mundane things, every day. Occasionally you got a nice customer but most of the time it was rude and mean people. I frequently got yelled at by customers for prices not coming up right, or items being too expensive or if their cards got declined or didn't cover all the items being bought."
good,"The rules were ridiculously strict in some areas. My manager thought that, even though I was unhappy with my job, that somehow I would see the benefits of working that same job if I stayed another year. I did not. I would have rather changed jobs, because I was unhappy with the one I had and unhappy with the environment and team I was working with. Not once was a serious meeting had to determine what would have made me happy."
good,"I had some decent managers during my time there and some not so good. Way too few people to do the (complex) job then doubled our work load by combining two jobs into one and people are overworked and stressed out.  "
good,They wanted so many cases an hr to be put on the shelves in grocery that was next to impossible to do. Since you had to straight up your Isle and puts items back in there spot 1st Before you even could start unpacking cases.
good,"Work the associates that work hard the hardest,missed breaks,unfair managers don't hold everyone accountable only ones who work the hardest.not beneficial to long term employees people coming in to start make as much as people who have been very there for years."
good,"Walmart is great for advancements and learning opportunities, some management members are just impossible.  they don't listen it's what they say and that's it Walmart needs a union customers are not always right"
good,I started out in pharmacy as a prescription bagger and was able to advance in the company to learn the system as a cashier for pharmacy and then advance into becoming a pharmacy Technician
good,I liked Walmart when I first got there  but then  towards holiday season is when it starts to pick up gets more busy all unloaders have to wait till after certain time to start pulling merchandise to the floor
good,"The summary said it all. Not into long winded reviews but to be frank, I knew going in to retail that it could ad would be stressful. Walmart takes the cake or at least the one I worked at. If you are in need of a job or down on your luck I say take it but by no means do you attempt to make that place a career and when you get settled in be sure to put your goals and personal life FIRST! If you don't you'll find yourself looking older than what you are and the days will go by where all you do is go to work and go home stressed out not wanting to deal with anything or anyone including your own children. I'm not there anymore and I feel free as a bird!!! I sometimes go shopping there and when I see some of my old co-workers they look miserable. But again this isn't to slander the place because again that is going to be the going rate for many retail stores so I say go in with a temporary mindset and get your ducks in a row while you are there because that place will attempt to hold job security over your head."
good,"The work was exhausting, always had employees arguing and the supervisor wouldn't do anything about it.You didn't know if you would be offered a full time position when the remodeling ended or not."
good,"I have worked here for 3 years and the CSS’s are always changing. They never schedule enough cashiers, and that makes it super stressful. The CSS’s on the night shift have WAY too much to handle, leaving them off of the front end and hard to reach when the customer service and cashier associates need them. And some of the CSS’s are rude. And it’s hard to request off lately and actually get it off, they say “not enough coverage”, like so schedule more people that day. That’s why we request off in advance, so there’s time to find coverage."
good,"They kept trying to schedule me in days I specifically couldn't be there. At first they only gave me less than ten hours a week, despite being told upon being hired that I would get thirty. Eventually it was a complete shift and now I work full time hours with part time benefits because they're ""not hiring any full timers right now"". I'm supposed to have a locker, but I don't, and I'm not allowed to carry my bag with my wallet, keys, and lunch with me."
good,"Horrible management. Expected to get food prepared for sale without all ingredients. Most management will not help. Its a darned if you do and darned if you dont type of environment!! Lots of room for advancement, but I would never want to advance!"
good,"It was a good job, until it wasn't I was basically forced out of the company after a worker's compensation accident in the deli. The pay was good but the hours weren't enough to survive on."
good,I worked hard in the deli. We would be penalized if we worked even a few minutes over our shift even in the middle of finishing with my customer. We would be written up.
good,Baseline pay is 11-12$ to start. It’s a really good first job for people to get into working. But otherwise it’s very stressful and poorly managed. Management usually has a “holier than thou” attitude.
good,what was good at wally world is all taken away and all incentives are gone.management is controlling and looks down on its associates and will not help you with any schedule that u need.
good,They tried to keep the momentum going with everyone. you always had to be their security and watch for suspicious stuff. the hardest was trying to get ahold of a manager when needed. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,well working with this company has been a challenge poor management lack of communication within shifts associates does not support one another always busy but poor customer service
good,Dont get paid enough for everything that we have to do por management! Make u do extra work not enough help for everything that they ask of one single person
good,Not enough people to cover shifts so the employees would work double. Employees would be pulled from all departments to the front of the store due to under scheduling to save the company money.
good,"precisa melhorar muitas coisas, gestão, plano de carreira"
good,"The only good thing is that you get to meet new people everyday."
good,"the flexibility for the hour you work are great for those who go to school full or part time. i don't however miss the customers there, since they were super upset if i didn't hear them walk up to me while im focused on my task."
good,"If you're trying to get into the working world, Walmart isn't a horrible company to work for. The issues lie in the different managers and how the particular store works. You may have some stores that practically encourage backstabbing, and others that encourage working together to get jobs done. I wouldn't recommend it, not would I refrain from recommending it. If you're willing to put in the work, you can go far in the company. Just do your research to find out how."
good,"I did enjoy my job, although due to poor management I was no longer able to stay working there. I believe if there was a different manager I would still be working with them today."
good,"Walmart is good place to work just do your job and always do what your told you will b ok working at walmart. The people are ok to work with and the environment isnt bad at all if your into meeting new people walmart is a good job for you, if you love the fast paced action then walmart is definitely for you."
good,The guy in HR was wonderful. The online training was good. I worked in the pharmacy. The manger treated the techs like they were beneath her. She talked non stop about her lavish lifestyle and expected us to listen then got upset if anyone fell behind. She was a lazy drill sergeant. Her manager never acknowledged the techs. It was like we were dogs to him. Techs couldn't even drink water in pharmacy but the pharmacist could have a five course meal if they wanted bc they were always catered too by the company. Anyone could be a tech for Walmart bc they assume non of us had a brain anyway.
good,"I was working as a department manager in 2010, when a managerless department for over 6 months needed price changes and floor plans had dropped, which weren't done, meaning that the prices that I had changed were not where they should have been and was let go for a compliance issue that was already in effect before I had performed the price changes."
good,"Got to speak with different people working as cashier. Workplace was alright. If you need a part-time job, not a bad job. Nothing hard about the job. Nothing further to review."
good,I worked at wal-mart foe10 and finally made manager until this new manager came to the store and wanted someone else back there and he plotted and lied to people and final gotme from back there and then tried to fire me without cause and coach me three time in one month and one was from 2016 which was suppose to been off in 2017 and they got me in September and let me go but put down for rehire
good,I loved working for this place because just about everyone there was fun to work with. The management was a totally different story. We were constantly told we weren't working fast enough when we were not fully staffed.
good,"job was stressful with very little help from management, the only upside of the job was a set schedule week to week unless they cut hours back for some reason."
good,Don't hold people accountable. Worked all over the store and traveled to a different state to help out and get overtime. Cleaned up after customers in my area
good,"Down stock, stock designated area, cleanup, restock pallet with overstock to be returned to the backroom. I learned how to audit, and inventory products. Management always overlooking your work. Relaxed, and busy. Finishing, your area and attempting to complete task. Lunch and breaks enjoyable."
good,"Most of the coworkers are fun to work with but not all. Management is all about favoritism. "
good,"Walmart as a company isnt terrible,just the Derry location,Walmart in general gives you alot of chances to go up,I just have a very negative experience at the Derry walmart after being there for 2 years,they dont value the hard work of their employees."
good,"Management sucks. Tenure trumps all. As long as you've been there a while, you're not going anywhere regardless of what you do, or don't do. No room for advancement as promised. OT was promised but you have to travel. Travel pay wasn't paid out half the time. No work/life balance. Give an inch, they take a mile."
good,"I haven't been getting any hours due to management misreading my schedule, and since it takes three weeks for schedules to update, I'm getting a seven hour paycheck when I have bills to pay."
good,Management left much to be desired in terms of respect for employees and cooperation. Did not feel like part of a team. Little care for the average employee.
good,Management is bad and their isn’t enough team members to get things done. Everyday I come in there is leftover freight that overnight leaves for us to do they work and I feel that I’m not getting anything done at all.
good,"My time spent at Walmart was great in terms of my coworkers, but the managers create a very high stress community and don't provide us with the resources we need to be successful."
good,a tpical work day was to make sure everything on the shelf was set and ready for the next work day for the other employees everybody was cool there we never had any prolems
good,"I have worked for the company during its rise, and now during its transformation, and honestly, its not what it should be, I hope it can get its old fire back. Management has lost its ability to inspire the associates, lack of competent leadership, or leadership in general."
good,I liked the pay and my coworkers were kind. The management team seemed to think they could speak anyway they wanted to to lower ranked employees in my opinion but multiple others would agree. I like that I always got my hours though.
good,"It's hard to work for somebody who won't give you anything but a paycheck.No benefits, no raises,no full time(even after saying he would make you FT),just a paycheck. I loved my co workers and some customers, but not upper management."
good,"I was apart of Walmart inventory team, our job was very critical to company success. We went through and made sure everything in our stock room was accounted for and that our counts were accurate, we maintained product flow to she sales floor to keep up customer satisfaction."
good,"I felt there were plenty of opportunities for Walmart to better as a company however, I do  not believe it is the company for me. While a typical day at My location was steady most days, there are days it would seem to drag on or be gone in an instant."
good,I love to work at walmart. Since they have started  cutting hours I am concerned that I will loose my benefits. I have had 32 hours as long as I have been with walmart for 4 years. They have cut my hours to 23 for the past month I am having to use my vacation time to keep my bills paid. I may not have any other choice but to leave walmart. I have to survive and I am a hard worker and very dependable. I put my all in my job. Management is making it hard for me to keep working there. They may want me to leave I know that is the tactic i have seem before. In the one year that I have been at this store we have had over 6 night supervisors. Just never know what to expect.
good,The managers are very unprofessional half of the time they dont even do anything when its time to.help customrrs they just talk and laugh amongst themselves as the customers sit there watching them.
good,Management only car about themselves. If you have 8 or 9 hours of work scheduled they want you to finish or you’re being held accountable which means a write-up
good,Management is the only reason you will dislike your job. If they don’t look down their nose at you like you’re less important. Some managers can get pretty full of themselves and pick and choose favorite people to promote even if said person isn’t qualified or deserving. Very unfair working environment.
good,"Working here is nothing more than you would expect. The management team can be a little rough on you depending on where you work. Days can be slow and boring, or they can be fast and always moving."
good,"Availability was often ignored, whenever any employees would try to talk to management they were unprofessional stating it'll be discussed tomorrow each time. From my experience there were even lies being told."
good,"Very fast paced job. Easy to have a lot of drama if you get to know your coworkers too well. Management isn’t the best. They don’t like to hire people if they’re understaffed and will cut your hours. Good job for part time, bad job for full time."
good,Working at Walmart is enjoyable for the most part. The people are great. The scheduling needs to be changed. And the pay needs to be increased to cost of living standards and be based on experience and performance.
good,Work hard it's not enougth for walmart n there management it's poor will be better with good training n better understandin what management it s about
good,well structured for untrained people.The company will hire anyone willing to show up for work.I was unemployed with a more experience than needed.in the 8 years I have worked there.I have worked in three stores.Moving within the company usually means you will lose money.
good,"Its starts off as a good company and then things start changing, you notice a lot of favoritism, the discounts should be for all employees and not just certain stores."
good,Started as a cashier and loved it but then when I a Customer Service Manager it was good but then the management had showed their true colors and became very rude and condescending.
good,"A fast paced optical dept.,not enough time to service the patient, or helped them with their eye needs."
good,It really was a high stress level working there. Upper level managers weren't teaching and training to help develop people to help set them up for next level.
good,Not as good as it was when I started it was a nice place where I felt like a team but it went down hill when they started hiring anyone who could pass a background check and didn’t bother with drug tests
good,Was a fun place to work. There has been to many changes and cut backs on associate level. I really used to enjoy it at Walmart but it is not a place to have a good work life balance
good,"You'll meet and work with a lot of interesting people. You will be given a large work load, but will have minimal training or supervision in most cases. If you need to go to upper management, they are very hard to find and don't seem to care very much about hourly associates"
good,Upper management does not care about middle management they will step on anyone to get ahead and throw you under the bus.  Salary members work about 60 hours a week with no recognition.
good,Enjoy work so hard and focus ..  Well I feeling little not comfortable with company. Well I am deaf and try share communication them. but seem ignore.  no matter I want focus work hard. I like Walmart and fair.
good,My manager was a racist and  sexiest male. He would be doing work in the electronics section and the produce section but you could never find him when it came to asking for assistance. He would be a big hypocrite when the managers came around.
good,"Management is sometimes unfair, they have their favorites. They need to have a stricter dress code. Very unorganized. It is an easy job. Anyone can get hired under any circumstance, they don't care much about the persons work ethic. They don't listen to workers requirements"
good,Ok place for part time work. Though not much chance on full time. No benefits no paid time off They are very fast paced. They work you different hours.
good,some or most of the managers care about you and your well being. there are some dep. that are harder to work in than others because of the management but you just have to find what dep and what job path is right for you.
good,Terrible management. A typical day at work was enjoyable due to customers. I learned to better communicate and work with a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers throughout the day.
good,"Esta accesible, sin estres, solo que tienes que tener mucho cuidado si eres cajero, ya que no tienes que tener faltantes"
good,Employees were great to work with  management sucked alot of favouritism the biggest problem with this store is that they dnt value there employees and it almost seemed as if they left you out to dry especially when u needed help with long lines definitely not a place you would make a career of.
good,"I wouldn't work here if the manager offered to suck me every day.They are so bad that I almost killed myself, I would only recommend this place if you want to drink nightly."
good,"This job is not for everybody. At the store I work at,  I would come into work and run around to find a manger to tell me where to go or what to do. Most of the CSM's were immature and disrespectful, the only reason they become mangers is become of favoritism. With that said the customers were the most enjoyable part of my day but the lack of professionalism and good mangers was the reason behind me leaving. They tell you to smile and greet the customers but they make it hard to be happy when mangers walk around and say negative things to employees and treat younger employees like little children."
good,I worked as a production associate and they yelled at me for not doing fresh cap 2's job when I still had not completed my own job. I was written up for that and not taking down trash that was not mine. I then transferred to cake decorating to be away from that environment but I am still pulled to finish fresh productions job and a daily basis. I was written up for wearing a hoodie for 30 mins after my lunch because I was cold. I had seen multiple people the same day wearing hoodies and not one of them were written up. I felt that I was not treated fairly. I was paid the same amount that a new associate was paid and I have been there for over a year.
good,"Typically, my day was boring. You stand in one area, checking receipts, being a visual theft deterrent. It is boring, very boring. You have sore feet and back. You will be called names and get angry customers yelling at you."
good,"They micro manage to the extent of being counterproductive. They work salary to the extreme, overworked and set up to fail. Expectations are way to high for anyone to ever accomplish. Working retail is hard enough and they make it much worse by not having management schedules done so you can plan around your work or they do not give you alternative time off for your family to spend together during holiday seasons. They do have good perks and benefits. I think it is more of an ideal position for someone who doesn't have children."
good,Associates were great but Company is more concerned about productivity more than anything else.  You get written up for everything no matter what it is and who's fault it was including accidents on the job even ones outside the job that you cannot control.
good,"Three going on four years working here and every year policies would change and some for the worse. Inconsistent and decreased hours at first of the year, not allowed overtime, poor management team, favoritism, and politics negated the good times I've had working here."
good,"Bad management kills all the good things about it. It was a fun job at first, but eventually the good managers left, and it just went down hill. I enjoyed my time there otherwise."
good,management is extreamly short and rude no matter how hard you work you will get fired. also because of the salary increased you have to clock in no more/no less than 5mins before schedule time good luck with other employees at the time clock before you or if a customer stops you you'll get written up
good,"Not the same as it was when i started working there. Employees are taken advantage of, very stressful, always changing proceedures and always short staffed"
good,anyone and everyone know how this place is and how they treat their associates. your just another body there and they could careless about you when your there or not
good,"What i learned at Walmart is that management says one thing but does the exact opposite. It was a really a place to work,but if they don't like you, your in trouble."
good,Liked some management however for no questions asked working holiday they need to rethink compensation.  As many hours as put in by department management not much is thought of for family time during holudays.
good,"It is a typical retail brick and mortar store."
good,They make it hard for you when you want to change your availability. They take away hours to the point that they don't have to pay for benefits. If you want to advance they choose who they want  not the ones that are more qualified.
good,"I enjoyed my employment with this company, in fact I miss my job. The work load for the demand for customer service wasn't met. The ratio was like 1 associate to every 40 customers, when there's only 2 associates and 120 customers. The balance wasn't there, thus made employees over worked and under paid, which in turn made unhappy employees."
good,"The enjoyment of your time at Walmart relies almost solely on the people you work with for the first half of my employment it was very fun but in my experience a slight change in supervision made a drastic change the the point where I was overworked and my attendance started slipping, I asked for time off on multiple occasions and never received it. The trend continued to the point of my termination."
good,"kept busy but when you needed assistance for a customer, like grocery carry out, there wasn't always an answer to the call. 2 different answers from front end CSM's on a customer related issue which caused problems later."
good,Me myself  had some bad experience with management and that is why I left but gave proper notice  and also stayed on for 3 more week's  after. Found better paying job.
good,Not a lot of roles for advancements unless you already come to company with degree or advance experience.  better than working fast food but not by much.
good,the manger made work hard and stressful  when it was easy and they dont like it when you take a stand when you felt that you was wrong and they show favoritism to people they liked and they had their own lil groups
good,Management treats you poorly. A lot of employees took a longer break than provided. Can't stay late unless asked to. Task times are almost always either to short or to long no inbetween.
good,"Lots of work. Expectations can be difficult. Benefits and pay a plus! The company is changing quickly, which is very fun to see. But the work/life balance is very tough."
good,"while I have enjoyed my time at Walmart , and the work experiences it has provided. I am looking for something that will allow me to work from home at a more agreeable time frame."
good,"In 2007 when I first got to Walmart, it was the best. they treated you like I was a real worker. in 2014, thing started to change and I didn't like it. but because jobs wasn't hiring I stuck with them"
good,"Es una empresa lider, donde lo malo son sus colaboradores de puestos altos."
good,As I said it was super stressful and no matter how hard I worked it was never enough. I felt like I didn't belong or was wanted there. My Dad died around the time I started working there. They were understanding for the most part. I found it incredibly awkward to do pickup. I felt like I was trained very little and had to figure out things for myself.  I kept trying pick the orders faster as much as I can and it never seemed to be enough.
good,Started off as a place to maybe have a career but the constant changes from management and corporate with little to no job security and less hours every year
good,"The worst part is the lack of experience with the CM's. "
good,I felt that with all the experience that I have they never offered any advancement within the company that I chose to pursue. Any good employees that wanted to pursue better opportunities within were really overlooked for those with less experience.
good,"None of the managers communicate so consistently redoing the same job over and over again. "
good,"It's a good first job but don't plan to stay here for more than 2 years if you want to have sleep or no back pain. The management is also terrible because we are not allowed to page our managers over the speaker to call toward our cashier, we use action codes which they never respond to, they force us to sell credit cards even though we are already doing what we are payed for and often forget our breaks. I went for a 7 hour shift once with no break. Once I pay my College loan I'm leaving."
good,The management did more griping and criticizing than they did showing appreciation. All they cared about was their rates. They showed favoritism towards the Burmese people who out numbered the Americans. 2 times while I was there used condoms were found on the stocking shelves and people would steal your lunch. We did not even get a half hour for lunch. Could not go outside at lunch time.
good,"Walmart en México es una empresa grande y buena para comenzar tus experiencias laborales, pero no da una buena estabilidad económica y la administración en el lugar donde yo estaba dejaba mucho que desear."
good,"Almost at a constant you would receive multiple tasks and were expected to have done at the same time along with providing customer service, not a thankful job so don’t expect much. There’s shift issues daily and not many ways to fix or accommodate to them."
good,The backroom is a unfair work place you are told you will be unloading the truck and light stocking but you spend maybe 2 hours unloading the truck and the rest of your time is spent putting up stock
good,"Busy, fast paced, face to face customer interactions. Managing the personalities of the cashiers in tandem with the customers was a challenge at times. The title says it all."
good,"Fast paced, constantly have to be doing something, breaks are weirdly set up. Have to schedule time off far in advance and wait for approval. Have to be able to do more than one thing at a time."
good,"O dia a dia de trabalho era tranquilo, menos nos finais de semana que era mais movimentado."
good,It's almost impossible to have work life balance. They don't give sick time for mothers and managers and felloe associates are extremely insensitive of mothers having sick children and needing time off.
good,"I felt working for this company was not the worst however the work environment was stressful and the balance between life and the job was not easy if at all possible due to the crazy hours even as a full time employee who asked for a fixed schedule and was told that's what I would get going in. I felt as an ogp and online pickup. Asscocoate at a supercenter the job was a bit much and having more coworkers or one more manager would have been helpful, due to always being short handed. The rules of how things were changed constantly and management was drastically being cut by the weeks due to corporate changes which was very unhelpful to us workers. I just felt the company did not take pride in the workers hired and they felt we were all just another body desperate for a job. And It was a very disconnecting feeling and made me very anxious showing up everyday because the stress placed on individuals was high. They also would work you 8 days in a row if need be and schedule changes were an annoyance to upper management, which in turn made life really difficult for a student and or busy person."
good,Empresa grande com muitos anos na área. Bom acesso.
good,"Good job to get experience, don’t take care of there associates. Manager are pretty poor at teaching and training u to be successful in a very complex environment"
good,Walmart used to be a great company too work for. Walmart has now taken away many benefits that were once offered. Now schedules are produced by a computer and work hours are not really flexible
good,"Good for those in need of a job, but there is little room for advancement. Managers play favorites and that makes it hard to voice issues or injustices."
good,"Schedule was very inconsistent.  Customers are always rude and get their way especially when wrong.  Management is inconsistent. Many of my co-workers hated working there.  I enjoyed my coworkers.  Out of 10 managers, at least 6 were descent, the other 4 were bullies or didn't do their job at all."
good,"It has been some time since I was there, but the biggest problem I ran into was if you're good at your job, and it isn't a desirable position, you'll just be stuck in that position forever. I spent 2 years trying to get out of my department, but I was passed over for less qualified people repeatedly because ""no one can do the job you do,"" at least until I left."
good,"Walmart was nice as a job but most of the management there couldn’t care less about you. The pay kinda sucked and they either overworked or underworked you. I don’t have too much else to say about it since I only worked there like a month but, it wasn’t awful and wasn’t great."
good,"I liked working there, but could'n get promoted. hours were always being cut. Work faster no wage increase. nice people to work with on floor. Bad leadership."
good,learned good customer service skills and how to work well with others. The most enjoyable part of the job were the associates and the regular customers.
good,"Learning in different departments was great  experience , although I didn’t like going outside in the rain to pull in carts when other employers didn’t show up. I didn’t mine helping if I had the  proper clothes  to wear in the rain ."
good,"Walmart for the most part is okay for a job to get you to another job. There are too many managers for a specific department, I'd be told by my dept manager to do a project a certain way and would do it and almost be done, then the district manager of the same dept would come by and ask what I was doing and why. They would then tell me no you need to do it this way and I'd have to start all over again. Then my dept manager would come by and ask why did you do it this way, I'd explain, then my dept manager would get frustrated and walk away. In my opinion, Management at Walmart have very poor communication skills between them. As well as long as I was there I was never offered an opportunity for advancement."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of dealing with customers, cleaning, and taking orders. I learned how to work in a quick paced environment managing my job priorities as well as handling customers in a professional and courteous manner. Management was a bit all over the place, but overall had a generally friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was closing because there were numerous tasks with not enough people. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employee discounts."
good,Good crew members make everything easy .. good team work .. team work make the dream work . And without any help from your crew members will make your job much harder
good,I learned the importance of a friendly accosiate frequently calming down any aggravated coustomers with a fast and effective work style. The hardest part of the job was having an unprofessional management.
good,The day is very fast-paced when it's busy. Though sometimes it makes the day go by faster. Management needs to improve. What I learned is sometimes you have to be 5 people in order to get through somedays and that is not okay.
good,"Pay was okay, could've been a bit better. Management is horrible, they need new people. Store is always low on items or is always messy. Has okay pricing on their items."
good,"Enjoyed working with coworkers, they made the job fun. They are flexible with making sure you have the time you requested off. If they don't approve, you can talk to them and they will see what they can do."
good,I was assigned the H & B section but typically had to do 2 or 3 other sections due to lack of help. It was a hard place to work at.It was not a happy work environment
good,Not good salary as per job requirements. Management expects more than enough from you. Not a good wage at all. Always encountered hard days but managed those days with my mind and knowledge.
good,Management doesn't check on associate progress there is no incentive to coming to work when associate call off they expect associate to do the  work of  two
good,Walmart management overworked employees nonfriendly work environment. Overall the learning experience was beneficial. There are many departments to choose from.
good,If they would have fixed some of the working gear used there and the management treated there employees better it's not just going to guarantee a better working day but faster and more efficient not to mention safer too.
good,It was just seasonal work at the time. I was asked to stay but I had a infant and once my ex-husband had found a job it was so no longer beneficial to work there.
good,"I loved my co workers and the management wasn't the worst but they really lacked communication and leadership, they played favorites a lot and it really shows. I had gotten lazy near the end of my time with Walmart and I really regret it but they also don't have many job advancements without consistently having to move out side of your preferred schedule, which is also another reason you get really bad hours."
good,Wal Mart was a great experience for me and gave me many opportunities to learn new things each day.  My work skills grew with them.  Management was great at the time I worked for them.  I left for personal reasons.
good,"You don’t get your benefits unless you work with them for 90 days and if you miss work more than four times your terminated. Even if you call in sick it still counts as a point against you, four of those and your out."
good,At night time it get packed and it’ll only be like two cashiers so you have to deal with a lot of criticism and management was on you which I understand.
good,"Ok place to work. Does not accept doctors notes, so dont get sick will hold against you. Favoritism unreal. If the csm likes you, you have it made. If you enjoy dealing with people this is the job for you. Also have to listen customers complain alot. Inconsistent with pricing. If a customer complains about the price most csm's will just tell you to override it."
good,Walmart communication is off and it could be better.... but other then that everyone gets a lot and very respectful sometimes things get hard but it’s able to get fixed
good,"Terrible management, no respect, and terrible hours depending on what department you're in. Cashier work is painful and causes many muscular and joint problems."
good,working in Walmart for me was easy going. I got along with most of the staff. I was able to get a flexible schedule due to school hours. best part of working for Walmart is being a cashier
good,"A typical work day tends to be an attempt at getting through the day, regardless of what the customers may put you through or the many disorganized managers, but thankfully your coworkers may make the work slightly more bearable."
good,I always had to work on my days off for fear of getting fired. Got my hour changed by my manager so they did not have to pay me for my full time work. I worked at many different departments not just the meat dept. I was switched from frozen to bakery to deli to meats at any time since I was more experienced then most workers. I did not have many paid vacation days.
good,"Good place to work.  Culture has changed in the last 5 years, and management tactics have changed.  Make sure you negotiate a good base salary, because that's all you may get some years because the bonus is totally subjective to your manager's whim."
good,"If you are looking for something to put a little extra money in your pocket or you enjoy meeting a variety of people, Walmart is the place to be! A positive attitude is a plus!"
good,how fast you gotta work with the task that you supposed to be doing for the job titile you gotta strectch everyday answer question for the customers when they need help on something
good,This Walmart was in a small town located far from anything.  This Walmart would hire just about anyone and not fire the employees that needed to be fired.
good,a typical day at walmart u could usually account for someone calling in.  always stuck covering for short handed anywhere in the store. always long lines to sit in. brealks are short and lunch is too long.
good,"I was here 6 months. No raise, all paid tome off was declined even after HR said it would be approved. Management is not afraid to call you worthless here."
good,"the management is lacking communication , but overall it was a good work atmosphere . i would recommend walmart as a job if communication is not important to you ."
good,the day to day operation was always changing and had to be flexible. would have to work mutiple deartments. communication was never clearand mangement didnt have enough training
good,I feel some Walmarts probably run in a more family oriented manner however the one I work at has a lot of trouble with the job/family balance.  I have had several chances to be a department manager however I value my time with my family too much to accept.
good,"Walmart is a place to work if you really need money, but it is not a long-term type of job in which you would continually feel happy to be there. On paper, it's a great temporary job, but the work environment can be stressful and unsatisfying."
good,"Un trabajo que demanda tiempo, niveles altos de concentración y por tanto estrés. Las prestaciones son buenas,el salario aceptable pero la empresa te esclaviza demasiado y es casi imposible tener vida personal. No aprendes mucho,el trabajo es relativamente sencillo aunque monótono y no me gustaría hacer algo similar otra vez."
good,I worked the night shift sooooo I was pretty much a vampire. It was really easy work but i did this with college to and that was pretty hectic. Would not recommend.
good,"Very clique-ish. Only way to move up and advance is to form alliances. Customer service is almost non-existant. The open door policy is supposed to stay between the parties that have an issue, but everyone in the store ends up knowing what is supposed to remain confidential."
good,"After spending almost 10 years with the company in different positions I can say while it's not the worst company to work for, experiences can really vary store to store. When you have a good management team who works with the employees to meet goals it's usually a great store. Unfortunately in some situations the management team is rarely seen on the floor or they run in ""packs"" spending more time avoiding work than being productive. Good management teams will make or break the store. "
good,"Walmart is a very stressful chaotic place to work, poor communication and often cutthroat. Management is subject to upheaval  and change without notice. Overall they seem like they want to take care of the employees but in the end the would throw you under the bus without second thought. Hardest part is when you come to work everyday you are faced with total chaos and poor direction the enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers"
good,It has been a great experience for me and it's a good place to start out with if going to college.  With my disability with my knees i am unable to stand for long periods of time so need to find something that would allow mr to sit and work as a call center agent or at a bank.  I have made a lot of new friends from the different cultures (associates and customers) and would will miss that part of the job.
good,"Can’t really complaint. Good paying jobs and most members of management always tried helping out when needed."
good,"The management there is pretty rude to their employees, over night associates are treated with less respect than those on the day shifts. The communication is very poor as well."
good,"Walmart maior multinacional no ramo do varejo do mundo, mas perdeu a sua cultura no Brasil, tanto que foi vendida no Rio Grande do Sul, mas se conseguisse permanecer com o tempo sempre será promovido, e por essa questão de ser promovido pelo tempo e não competência, as lideranças são fracas."
good,"The workload was fine and reasonable, the managers being able to change your work perimeters several times a day without collaborating makes the job undesirable.Coworkers and customers were amazing. Management lacked soul."
good,Low low wages. No commissions or bonuses. Hours cut at the drop of a hat. No overtime. Unappreciated by management. Inferior health insurance. Managers try to get rid of long time employees. Not a good place to work.
good,"While it is a great place to earn money; the water gets a little muddy if you try to make a career out of it. While training is available, it's more or less who you know and not what you know."
good,"Its not a bad place to start out at but its not for everyone. The people that work there shouldnt because they complain and whine all the time over the fact that they are worked ""too hard"" which they are not they are just cry babies"
good,When I first started working for the company it was great. I’ve been with the company five years and now the management could be better and fair to all associates.
good,"The company is great, work life in the company is great, compensation were ok, there is no job security, poor knowledge skill in management, and there is coordination with each other in management."
good,It's a place to work if you are older and want something to do after retirement definitely not a career unless you are willing to donate all your free time to working and kissing up to get promotions.
good,They push you to be super human: loading/unloading boxes in a short time frame with one or two people. The workload is too much for the the number of people in a particular section.
good,Walmart was a ok place to work as long as you didn’t have lazy management to work with. It also helps when you aren’t the only cashier open or only two lanes open because it can be very busy.
good,"I learned a lot of things working at Walmart such as how to count a till, putting the correct pricing tags on the shelf to match the items and, learning  that customers privacy & care was the most important thing to us at the store."
good,"Walmart states it's a family oriented business, but when my daughter was sent to the hospital I was almost fired for leaving. When I was injured on the job they tried multiple times to get me fired and tried not to pay workman's comp."
good,"Eh. It’s a job with competitive pay. Their are quarterly bonuses. The schedule it pretty flexible, if you have the right manager. Some managers aren’t very supportive."
good,When it comes to management  you end up doing things twice and a lack of communication and lack of trust. The benefits are really good probably the best thing about Walmart. The pay isn’t enough for living on my own.
good,"A typical day at Walmart could start out being pleasant and turn stressful depending on the situation and customer."
good,"I've worked for Walmart multiple times for over 4 years off and on again, because it's where all my work experience comes from. I tried working my way up into management three times to become a CSM, and once to become a department manager but I never got the promotion. So I'm tried of trying to work my way up, and am now working on getting into the Pharmacy. But if you can stick it out and stay out of the gossip, and show up to work then you are fine! It is a good job to get work experience from for teenagers, because there is so many different areas you can work in."
good,Don’t care about their employees mental well being. Very short staffed and terrible hiring managers. Rude and disrespectful management. Also they are constantly trying to cut corners to meet protocall
good,"As a sales associate, you have no idea how your day starts off. I at one point worked 7 different departments in one day. Management in all stores I worked at does not communicate well."
good,I liked the people I worked with and if you were a cashier you had to learn how to scan items fast because they based some of your raise on that. When you weren't running the cash register you were standing around.
good,I really don't have a anything I would like to say about wal mart within time I was working there. when I was working there the last time I left because of management but if you need a job and don't mind doing stressful work then wal mart is the job for you
good,Walmart has its up and downs just like any other job. I met a few good people. I felt as if some managers weren't fear not only to me but to other works.
good,"Some days are good, some aren't. I learned a lot about cusomer service and how to deal with people. Management were ok sometimes. Just didn't know how to separate personal issues or vendettas from the workplace making it hard to deal with. Overall culture was very pleasant thanks to new found friendships with co workers and customers you get to meet. Mst enjoyable part would have to be the interactions you encouter with co workers and customers."
good,What I've learned from my working experience at Walmart they teach how to clean and organize zoning each grocery aisles and how to use MC 40 Scanner to scan the bins located in the frozen/dairy freezer/cooler backroom stock and check any picks in the system for any food stock freight that needs to be stock on to the store frozen aisles and dairy coolers and they also showed me how to properly assist any customer who is in need of help to find what they are looking for or if they need any help find the locations to the restroom or costumer services. The Cons they have lack of employment not enough associates to help stock Freight and help zone the areas to keep the neat and organize through out the day very extreme poor management  through out the years a lot of downs than ups.
good,I enjoyed where I first started at my first store before I left than once I transferred to a bigger one I felt I wasn’t treated the same.. if you needed anything it was hard to get a manager to help
good,Walmart is and okay place to work but there not much room for advancement in the  maintenance field. Also the scheduling is random so it can conflict with trying to  maintain  A healthy family life. On the bright side you work with some great people and at times it does feel like a family.
good,"When I started at Walmart in 1986 it was a completely different company. It's come a long way in providing benefits for the associates. However, over the last several years not all things have changed for the good. Long term knowledgeable associates are let go to bring in college educated ones that do not have the same knowledge or experience, a degree means more than experience. The associates are not of value, only money is."
good,No matter how hard ya work or go above and beyond ya most likely hardly get recognized for your efforts they just want ya to do more... they took away our paid holidays... management is the absolute worst! No respect for the individual management is poor
good,i wasnt getting paid enough i was being paid 7.25 at the time and all my money went into gas to make it to and from work. now they pay like 11 an hour so im sure its great now
good,Great paying job but  managers treat you like animals. I would not come back to this place at all unless its my last option. Be prepared to work in noisy and extremely hot or extremely cold conditions
good,great job occurences were new did'nt understand that's the reason i'm not there now. Fast paced good pay nice hour.willing to work there again if they are willing to have me.
good,Empresa na época com muitas falhas e processos ruins.
good,"no pay, no morale, upper management had their heads up their rear ends. customers were rude and acted like fools. co workers were cool but the majoritywere lazy clock watachers"
good,"Met alot of new people working here learned new things, hated that hours were all over the place so I really couldnt plan things cause I never knew when I would be working or how long."
good,Walmart wasn’t the best place for me as I am seeking a job that I am comfortable at what I love to do. The fast pace environment was great and the customers made it a great experience for me to do my work
good,"A good temporary step, if you can handle working with the public. Great starting pay, from what I tend to hear about first-jobs. Not something to take much pride in working for, though. It's retail, not too much else to say about it."
good,"Walmart had flexible hours, but did not allow full-time when I was employed there. I enjoyed working with the public and the types of jobs I was doing, but the upper management was hard to work with."
good,"this is not a great place to work, no real benefits, they claim to have health care but for the store associates it is far to expensive to purchase. "
good,"In my experience it was unprofessional. The management was very unfair and unorganized. There is no holiday pay, and I would get my break very late sometimes."
good,I would say Walmart is a place for those that is in school and/or just need a job to pay off some bills. But Walmart can be a great place to work if you have the right team to support you.
good,Fast-paced environment. They are pretty flexible with scheduling your hours. Its a good place to work if you are going to school. The only time it gets stressful is around the holidays.
good,"Very fast paces, stressful day."
good,"Job has a decent pay. Not really suted for people that are going to school for a good career, they tend to not work with your schedule from time to time and prefer people that don’t have future goals with other companies other then them self’s "
good,"Working at Walmart started off good, but gradually went down hill. Didn't see much care from the company towards associates needs and got very strict to where you didn't fell able to do anything."
good,It was ok. But not effort people on night .had alot of call out and no help for our higher up at all . So would help if you need it at all .people say you doing g thing when you not even their on that day
good,Walmart was a very stressful place to be employed with the management was awful I was continuously coach for something that was out of my control I had brought it to management attention on several times but no one at here to my concerns for what we were being coached about they also did not follow my school schedule as discussed when I initially took the job
good,Culture isnt what it used to be.  It is more about how much they can get out of people than doing what is right. Moving more digital and catering to millennial rather than their customer base.  I gained a lot of knowledge over 15 years but sad to see the original culture be damaged by new external hires of executives.
good,Good Job. Decent Benefits. Depend on store if it is a great atmosphere.  You get what you put in.  if you are lazy then you wont advance in the company
good,I you work here you will not have a life outside of work and if you have kids that are sick they don't care. They will expect you to still be at work and not leave early if something happens.
good,it was enjoyable in the beginning but after management change so many time things change. i assist customer by taking prescriptions and filling them. some of the customers make you have a good day. the hardest part about my job is dealing with associates that don't like to share the work load
good,They are too hard on their employees. Its unsafe driving habits. They have good benefits if your willing to put your body threw that. As an older person too physical
good,Customer friendly environment . Learn how to use heavy machinery. And how to Maintain a clean environment for the worker and there customer. But don’t really have nice mangers
good,Walmart is nothing to wright home about. It was a job but there was no shift the same. You would work the night shift one day and the day shift the next day.
good,Would try to be early to each shift. Usually had 2 breaks and lunch was an hour. The hardest part was awkward situations and waiting for CSM's when they were needed. The most fun times were interacting with the customers and their children.
good,It was the worst time working there the supervisor was awful and didn't car about anything was. Rude to people and employees just not for me so I left for a better job
good,Each day is very busy and I able to get the job done even without the correct number of people that I need. The company is aware that more people are needed but they only allow a certain number of people to be hired regardless of how busy the store is.
good,"Good place to shop, but not to work at. Mangerment never have you back at all. If you want to change shift or department good luck with that. Some customers are very rude."
good,depends on what department you work in can be extremely busy ad somewhat stressful.  Not very happy with the management handles different situations.  I have made several friends that are co workers and that I do enjoy and I do enjoy getting to know our regular customers.
good,"Walmart here is an overall good company, they do treat you fairly as a whole, but some buildings are just full of bad managers who are only out to cover for themselves. They have no real care about the business/work until their boss/market/regional is asking them why things are not being done correctly despite all the same questions being asked by some people in the store before hand. "
good,"There is large turn over of employees, so the amount of people who know what to do isn't what it should be. Lots of training new people, without many staying. I've learned how to work alone and take initiative to make sure the work is done by the end of the day. It can be fun if you don't be too serious."
good,"When I worked here, I was not listened to and I had medical problems and was forced to take 3 or more days off when I needed only one. Plus the CSMs and managers were not nice or polite to me. They also wouldn't let me switch positions."
good,"The store manager was an inconsiderate, unsupportive individual.  His main concern was the bottom dollar, without concern for employee life style.  Company would reduce employee's work hours while hiring new employees and scheduling them with more hours than the employees with seniority.  According to assistant managers, all employee work hour schedules were computer generated.  If you specified certain hours on any given day during a week to be scheduled; they could and would reduce your hours/days for the entire week.  They reduced employee hours to the point that, in the evening, one person was responsible for multiple departments.  They were to provide customer service, zone merchandise, cover adjacent department employee's breaks, and even cashier.  "
good,"It was a good time, but as in anyplace having a few bad eggs can ruin the whole lot. the workload wasn't too bad, but having too many chieftains in one place is never an ideal workplace."
good,"Alot has changed from the time I started with Walmart. Some good and some bad. Your hours are changing pre week, depending upon what the manager feels like giving you."
good,Love working with everyone the management doesnt care if you are sick and they favorites and they have some of the stupidest rules like you get coached if you just look at your phone
good,You will work hard with almost nothing to show for what you have done except for a minimum wage paycheck. Management is usually hands off until something bad happens.
good,"I stared off working as a over night, cleaning bathroom scrubbing and buffing floors also waxing floors. Then I moved to a dairy stocker overnight..And they did not give me my pay increase."
good,Managers need better orientation on how to treat people and communication skills. Focus on your people that is the key to be successful in a company and create a good work environment.
good,it was ok just didnt have enough workers to reach the time we had managers would be on you for just about anything they volunteer certain people to leave their area to go do something else
good,Use to care about the associates and their needs. Now its only about money. They use to do fun things for us now it's just go to work and ve treated unfairly unless you are a favorite
good,Slow and horrible. Pays wells but they don’t care about their associates. All the managers are catty and love to gossip about other workers. They do nothing for harassment complaints. Very stressful. They expect one person to do a 5 person job.
good,It was a fun place to work until we got a new store manager who was unrealistic on our workload often had to stay after to finish work and then had to take a long lunch so there would be no overtime
good,You stock shelves and that's basically it.  Don't get used to the people you work with because it changes every week.  Company does not invest anything into you
good,"Fast paced, busy and always changing. All about performance and innovation."
good,People don't get along that well and are very closed minded and very competitive. Management has lack of communication and take out anger on workers (from what i have experienced at my store)
good,"typical work day, come in fill the cake case, read over the following days cake orders. Take the cakes out of the freezer ,let the cakes defrost. Gather all the icing colors needed."
good,There is very little development or training for hourly supervisors. The climate of that store was hostile due in the most part to the management team.
good,Very hard for a person to advance at walmart.Most employees are told to do more work than other employees and terminated for no reason.Walmart Cap 2 supervisors are highly disrespectful to there employees.
good,Walmart was very fun to work with people my age and everyone was very nice. But I didn’t like how you couldn’t take time off that much and long hours.
good,The job wasn't bad but the management wasn't top shape They didn't handle the customer issues properly. When issues arise we would have to solve them ourselves.
good,"10 or hours a day, Workplace Changes everyday, difficult clocking in/out , I liked working on this type of machinery, but would like the ability to earn a little higher salary."
good,"Overall Walmart as an employer offers relatively decent benefits and ability to move up within the company. The issues I have had are that the management team does not get treated well and in turn treats those below them somewhat poorly as well. My time as a supervisor was spent trying to break this mold only to have it negatively affect my mental health. I would also scrutinize the level of expectation from those above you as they tend to contradict themselves in their expectations. Promoting within was also an issue as it seemed that they made poor promotion decisions, and blamed it on the associate(s) rather than themselves. The health insurance options are decent as well, though if you aren't a long time employee or full-time, which they seem to be slowly edging out as a possibility for new hires, you don't qualify for it. There are also no incentives to work harder or faster than other associates because management does not hold poor work from poor associates in account."
good,"Mismanagement to much favoritism, did get my whole 40 hours and some overtime I did my job but most of the workers did not do theirs and the boss would have me do there job to instead of making them actually work and do there job.."
good,"Co workers are the best part of job. Management has issues. Not enough staffing, little training, and lack of trust in leadership tends to make any position more challenging than it needs to be."
good,"Large corporations like Walmart function as a bridge or stepping stone for many entry level workers.  It is not a workplace culture for the faint of heart.  If an employee wants recognition for their work they need to go elsewhere.  If they are unable to do more than their position and are unable to multitask they need to work elsewhere.  If they are unable to take a direct order they need to go elsewhere."
good,I began this job liking it. The shifts in management were not paced well. In the end my new manger for my new position in the same area of the store began to be what pushed a lot of people to look for new work or just leave. His general candor and attitude toward team work or communication was that it was on need to know and delegated to only a select few people and then handed down at some point after a new challenge presented itself.
good,Walmart was a very stressful place. Everything was so unorganized. They put young people as managers over the older women. I didn’t like the way they ran things at all.
good,"Wal-Mart is a excellent work environment, however, there is very little room for mistakes. They are very promte for writing up associates or up to termination if any mishap situations occur."
good,"It was a good place to work at for being my first job, however, the mangers didn't know how to communicate with the employees and they made me work for more hours than what I should have without  paying me for the hours."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart for 8 years.After reading the story of Sam Walton, how Walmart started, his beliefs and desires... I am very sad to say Mr. Walton would be very very disappointed in the direction his dream took and he would especially would be disturbed by how mistreated the associates are. The more you care the less respected you are."
good,Although it had a great start the management started to negate their own promises that attracted me to work for Walmart. I was forced to change positions as they removed my job title and asked me to take a pay cut but work the same responsibilities and more
good,"low pay, but not hard. good training. breaks and lunch were very fair. could be rude customers, but that is how it is working with the public. could be boring at times"
good,A lot of drama happens and everyone is always starting something. Always short staff so the expectations for the work you need to do is extremely high and unrealistic.
good,"When you're working during the heavy holiday hours, I was pretty much alone. Training was at a very minimum. Would only recommend if you're working through college and have a lot of hours to spend."
good,I work as a maintenance associate. I work there for one year. I don't learned nothing there. The managements getting on my nerve. Working alone is hardest part. Ain't nothing enjoyable part job at Walmart.
good,Los pagos van desfasados y al momento de retirarse de la empresa por xs razón el pago no sale como debería
good,"Had a list of what needed to be done that night, of who would clean where and who would do what. These tasks included the following and more: Dust-Mopping of the entire floor(split up depending on how many people worked in one night), wet mopping the wood floor daily in winter to remove Ice-Salt (once a week rest of year or as needed), making use of a riding/walk behind electric scrubber on the flooring. Cleaning of the bathrooms, break room, offices."
good,"Walmart allows me to fix my schedule to where I work only days and will allow me unpaid days off to attend school events for my children.  Often though, when requesting a day off you would receive extra days off on the following week, loosing more hours. Scheduling is very inconsistent. Working at Walmart is fast paced and stressful."
good,A very fast paced job in which you always felt behind. Never a dull moment but also discouraging at times in which you always felt behind as a team. I loved the people I worked with.
good,"The hours were never flexible and it was very hard to get days off, especially with putting in a five weeks notice. It was very hard to get people to understand."
good,Putting frieght on floor then putting it on shelves learned how to be productive very unorganized work place pulling heavy pallets relaxing for lunch with fellow workers
good,They force you to do overtime without 24 hours notice. They also blame you for you getting hurt even if it was entirely out of your control and not your fault.
good,"I was hired as an assembler, but did maintenance, helped cap 2, cart pusher, and welcomer. Rearly did my job and they wondered why I didn't build many bikes. Store manager had me trained on all maintenance equipment and used me alot for it. They let go the day after I spent the hole day outside pushing carts, and couldn't understand why I didn't built any bikes. I was  warned about how they are. Oh I was let go 1 week from my 6 months."
good,Working for Wal-Mart is good for people just starting out. Only problem with my store is it's hard to move up once your in one place and it's hard to make more money and have time for your family.
good,"Management was basically useless and the point system was ridiculous. You are given 4 points for 6 months, meaning if you are absent for a day, you get a point. They refuse to take into consideration of a doctor's note, or emergency."
good,"Stressful, limited job training, poor accountability skills, and not uncaring toward associates.  To me they seem solely concerned with the ""bottom line"" and ""cold"""
good,Walmart is a good company to work for until you find out about the benefits and also then raises. The managers could use more training and get more involved with their co-workers
good,Anytime you clock in there is always something to do especially in the front end. From lines of customers to cart loads of 'go backs' you will not be bored!
good,Miss some of the old mangers. Walmart is not the same like it use to be. A lot has changed. That’s what people tell me when I come to Walmart. They me don’t come back here.
good,Sometimes it was a great place to work and other times you had to practice your best customer service technique because the customers was a lot to deal with
good,"I worked for the Company because I was a single parent and needed to provide for my children as well as needed the insurance."
good,walmart is a good place to work if your in between jobs. many different job opportunities within one company. friendly environment. i would recommend this place to work
good,"A day at work is fast paced and goes quick. learned to work with a group of people. Management is okay. Workplace culture is not great. Hardest part is the odd hours. In 1 week, have 4 different schedules. Most enjoyable is work itself."
good,It’s a okay place. Every store runs differently. This store run poorly because they expect us to get everything and more done or expect us to deal with complaints by ourselves. There is little to no support from the management.
good,learned a couple new things just wasn't a place for advancement was looking to make more money and and more hours. wasn't enough money to be made with he cost of living.
good,"walmart doesn't care that life happens and you have a life outside of walmart where events can occur that are not under your control, Walmart will fire you with no hesitation what so ever. They will shut down your shift leaving you without hours and give them all to another shift. So if you cannot work another shift you will have to look for another job."
good,Please review your point system .  The point system phases out some good employees.  They also don't do rehires in the Prattville store.  I dont know if that is on a store by store basis but I think they should look at their history instead of a blanket no.
good,"help customers find what they need"
good,"During my two years with the company, we went through quite a number of managers for various reasons. It was always frustrating for me to be in that store and I always dreaded going in for my shifts. A typical day would involve CSMs playing favorites and removing people from their positions to cover another that is unfavorable so that that associate could be removed. There was hardly ever anyone covering the registers so there were always customer complaints to be fielded as I worked through the lines. At most, I want to say on a good day at peak hour we would have only approximately four tills open. The management was a joke in my opinion. They never responded to calls on time, and often ignored associate requests, and could often time be found socializing in the back office when sent to search for them. They found it extremely difficult to work with student associates with adjusting their schedules and were condescending towards us whenever they spoke to us."
good,"Long stays at the register. If you need a bathroom break, Supervisors will make you wait for another teller to come from their break, instead of jumping in to help. I learned how to cash W.I.C checks.  Management has favorites, and its not a team player work place. The hardest part of the job was putting up with favoritism. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"avantage: "
good,"Supervisors and Managers throw extra workload on you to make their selves look good, and are rude and uncaring for personal life. My store was supposed to have NO overtime; we were forced to stay over almost every night and then made to take the time off by taking extra time on lunches."
good,Overall my job provided no work life balance. It was challenging and gave employees great upward mobility. Training and safety components are getting better.
good,"The management is terrible at Decatur, they are constantly pulling you and then griping at you when your isle inst over, or your isn't zone, or the truck isnt done in time even thou you dont have enough employees to get done on time but they dont care. They yell at you in front of customers over the littlest thing."
good,I was happy to work for them . It was a great experience while it lasted. Customers kept me busy and Walmart always had work to be done unfortunately was part of the temporary staff and I did not last long it was great job.
good,"While I have had the opportunity to be given a caring and easy-to-work with department manager, as a department, we unfortunately have to answer to higher management which has no care in the world about their employees need and/or desires."
good,"I was employed at the Distribution Center for 4 years and transferred to three different departments.  I was a certified trainer on job duties as well as power equipment.  I also handled the area manager's role while he was off (personal leave and vacation).  I even had three mentors to prepare me for promotion, per Walmart requirements.  After 4 years and 10 attempts for promotion, I was denied every time with the explanation that the company needed me to continue doing the work of three and four people as well as the manager's role while they prepared others for management.  Advancement at Walmart isn't about your qualifications or capabilities, it's more about who knows who and what protected minority class you fall into."
good,"No way to advance, if you work hard;expect to do everyone else's job. Management is lazy and passes off their work to lower ranking associates. They don't treat associates like people, but rather like semi-sapient machines."
good,"When I was working in the bakery it was short staffed and I was closing shift, I was by myself most nights to prep the bread for the next day and clean up the bakery area. I wasn't a cake decorator, but I'd have to take care of the customers when they came to pick up their cakes or had a complaint. It wasn't hard work, just overwhelming when there weren't enough employees to get the job done correctly."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work with decent benefits, however the job structure wasnt exactly clear and the path to promotions s were almost non existent."
good,"Typical day at work wasnt hard at all. I worked stock room. unloading skids, and placing them in the store. the only part that sucked was management..."
good,"Walmart is a reasonably decent place to work if you don't mind the high turnover rate, the working environment itself is very fast paced and more is expected of you can a single person can perform. When short staffed in certain departments the remaining associates in those areas are typically overworked in order to complete tasks given by poor management."
good,The people at walmart are out for themselves. It's like working in highschool. Nobody had your best interests. It's hard to move up when they play favorites
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is not what you think it is when u first start..."
good,"Depending on which walmart you work for, you will have one of two kinds of expereances."
good,working at Walmart is face paced it’s quick you have to be on your toes grocery and general stores are always busy and they need the constant customer service
good,some stores are mean to costumers and employees well they fired people for being sick  and there are nice manners that are good at what they do and i respect that and i like working in grocerys and electronics
good,Stay to yourself don’t get cautious and the drama there I would say this was a type of job for a young person but somebody who wants to provide for a family this ain’t going to cut at all
good,"I enjoyed the people I met, but management had/played favorites. Work Dept Mgr hard with no help, if have a disability and need exception, would use you if and when needed you."
good,"Management wouldn't talk to you about things themselves, they would write complaints and let the owners deal with it, sometimes would give breaks late."
good,"Typical work day consist of providing security at the entrances and exits, checking receipts for unpaid items. I learned to observe and scan for hidden items in carts, personal bags and carriages. Workplace culture is competitive, to see who will accumulate the most ""recoveries"" in a period. Hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for such a long period of time, most enjoyable can be meeting different people and making a slight difference in their day."
good,"Associados sofrem carga excessiva de trabalho,honorários longos e muito pressão psicológica dos superiores."
good,"Good place to work, but Management has no common manner when it come to inter actions with employees. I have never work at place where your management team don't speak or even greet your team."
good,"A typical day at work required a lot of heavy lifting and it was sometimes difficult to get the help I needed. In the beginning my management was very open and understanding, but over time they became more distant and harder to get to. It was a very negative space to work in, but there were a few positives including the store manager who was very nice, and the fact that there was not really uniform made me feel comfortable while I worked. Overall if you need money then Walmart is a great place to go with many different job options, but it is more of a temporary kind of place in my opinion."
good,"Operate lifting assistance tool, Laod skids into transport, Tag boxes as they went down the belt to get scanned, Work on the packing assembly line, and to well organize a trailer."
good,I enjoyed working there starting out. there where good days and bad days. but thats with any job. they do give raises or bonus with my share. the hours arent ideal for a family. but they work with you if they can.
good,Will not stick up for employees that have been there awhile when filling a complant for harrasment against another employee was told to just walk it off
good,"Walmart is a job for someone just to pay bills with. you can't live off a check unless you are single. (living alone) i had fun on my time there almost 3 yrs. management wasn't the greatest but i had cool supervisors who allowed me to work how i wanted,(which is rare) so in return i gave them what they wanted. compromising goes a long way when used correctly. 3rd shift is the hardest because naturally your going against the grain of normality. ppl should rise with the sun, not sleep! i learned that while working there, if someone is stealing and they ask YOU about it, even if YOU don't know, (YOU ARE STEALING TOO and will get arrested. seriously"
good,"Walmart is a company that is very easy to get into when applying. The stores are easy to get your foot in the door, especially if you're looking for a low tier job, such as a Cashier. They promise things such as improvement and personal growth while working there, but all of it is just pretty lackluster. The work environment is draining, with someone always complaining about what you/your department does wrong. A lot of miscommunication is apparent in management and it trickles down, affecting the associates as well. Managers will slack off in their own office, I've seen one sleeping in there before, and they break their own store rules, such as dress code and phone rules. I've seen constant abuse of power, with managers trying to control or take their frustration out on other associates, myself included. They do offer an open door policy to report them, but in the end, it doesn't get rid of the issues. Walmart is an excellent first job, but when you feel as though you need to move on, do it."
good,"We don't have a full staff working. So, it put a lot of work of work on one individual. What I've learned about this job is that people are really rude there. The management is terrible. They don't help us do anything and they are very disrespectful towards some workers. The hardest part about the job is having to unload 5-10 pallets of fruits and vegetables all by your self, and having to do the bending process right afterwards alone. I honestly don't  enjoy my job at all."
good,I like to work with people an help when I can walking to show a customer where the items they are looking for helpful to my team when we unload the truck good team work
good,"the moline store in particular makes some poor choices. they fire managers that inspire and work with their employees, while keeping managers that have poor relations."
good,It's a really good company but management is not the smartest and brightest. The management team always plays favorites and will write up thehard workers and let the slackers get away with everything.
good,"It was a decent job. The mid-level employees were amazing and very hard working. Upper management on the other hand didn't care if you had school, needed to pick your child up for an emergency, or if someone in your family died. They cared about getting their paycheck and filling their pockets."
good,Walmart is a good place to work part time. Management can be hard on their employees. There are good people working there but management dumps on them whenever they get dumped on. I would not want to work there all my life but for short time or people without an education it is a good place.
good,"In electronics you can be expected to clock in, check out keys and TC 70, and gather the security freight to be worked while assisting customers and zoning on the sales floor. The department manager might require you to set modulars depending on the time of the week or do price changes. Any overstock freight has to be taken to the back and binned appropriately. I've worked in three stores now and honestly the workplace culture depends on the store and the individuals hired. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers, some people are trying their best to make you miserable or scam you and steal. At the same time, the most rewarding part of the job can be the customers... some of them are genuinely delightful people that can make you smile just thinking about them days later."
good,"Some management made the job difficult, and they had no regard for personal life. Some of the associates were nice to work with but this job does not allow you to elevate unless you know someone."
good,"On a typical day I am in charge of the register and money in it. that includes the cash vault. I deal with the public using my customer service skills I take phone calls as well. I do the re stocking, and I help place the order for inventory each week. I am also in charge of the cleaning of the pharmacy and making sure the staff has everything they need to have a successful day."
good,"⦁	Provided remarkable customer service."
good,"I'm a reservationist, I work full time in the morning till mid-afternoon. I handle money, check people in, make reservations, do mailouts and refunds, along with key making. I deal with customers, owners, etc. I handle phone calls and paperwork alone. The hardest part about my job is doing mail outs cause they get so*** many. Other than that I love my job and wouldn't trade it."
good,"Out of every manager at walmart 2 managers were the best the first was my manager he was willing to teach the new guys he helped with the jobs we had to do in case wee needed it, The second was a support manager he was really cool too if we needed anything he would be the one to help out with that I was one of his best  he really liked me a lot."
good,"need money then this place is for you"
good,"I like being a cashier at Walmart, had some nice customer, but the management sucks. Some will speaks and the other half of management pass right by you and never once will say Good morning."
good,"unless your supervisors or management you cannot get full time hours. If you aren't full time you aren't able to get the benefits that wal-mart offers so no insurance and hardly any vacation time. Management sucks! they are lazy, rude and show no appreciation no matter what. They expect you to come into work no matter if your sick or anything else. They will not even except a doctors note."
good,"Walk in the door and before you can clock in management in telling you to do something that isn't ever in your job code.  "
good,When I first started are there was raises and bonuses but after they got the tax rate can set the hourly wage at 1 rate they took away all Races and other benefits. they advertise that they were doing this much for the employees in this much for the employees but in fact they really screwed over the employees. They cut people expected more of you for lesser pay and no chance of raises and they should get a promotion and the chances of that are very slim
good,"Working at Walmart gave me the chance to work with many other people on the sales floor. I loved working my shifts with them, they made the shift go by fast and made working there pleasurable."
good,"Managers were never present when you needed them, one of them liked to sleep in the garden center so you could never find him, and when you did he would scream at you, even if there were customers in the area."
good,"Not enough hours for the workers that are good workers. Too many cliques and special treatment for people that kiss up to management. Also, they do not offer holiday pay anymore."
good,It was an easy job to work but the managment sucked. I love the work i did at the walmart gas station.Managers didnt know how to make schedules and they showed favortism.
good,Wal-Mart is a place I would recommend someone else to work. I could not continue my employment at Wal-Mart because I could not learn anything else from that particular career.
good,"typical day at work is hectic. You never know where they are going to need you that day, if you become cross trained in other areas of the store. Workplace culture sucked. Lots of unreported stealing from employees. Most enjoyable part of the job was the discount offered."
good,"I loved my job, but when you're  poorly scheduled daily work becomes stressful. Management tends to be bullies, and rarely followed the rules expected."
good,"Ring shoppers out at registers. Clean work area and organize register and aisle. "
good,Management does work well with associates. Don't consider family needs and schedule shifts without enough help. High demands and no offers to help. Not easily approachable.
good,Walmart is a good job for students that need experience and a job to get by. Walmart is very unfair to their employees. Over worked and under paid. Walmart only recognizes the employees that have been there the longest (seniority). Also if you work overtime they give extra days off so they don't have to pay you overtime.
good,Wal mart is a competitive company!  Their employees are not paid fairly!  The  management is mediocre! The employees are not listened to!   They do not value employees opinions!
good,"It's Wal-mart. The job itself isn't hard, it's the workload and consistency with no help. No appreciation. No advancement. It's bad to say, but you have to learn to try and stay away from certain people... Working 3rds, you're left with scraps... High turnover."
good,to many mangers all having a different way of doing things makes it hard on you. customers can get to you be some are as sweet as it can be if you like new faces everyday then yeah Walmart would work for you.
good,"I would be asked to work literally everywhere, I would be told to do 30 things at once. Managers couldn’t agree on what to have me do. My hours got cut with no explanation. I really enjoyed the job until it started to get shifty, they I wanted to get out because I didn’t want to get dragged down."
good,Typical day at work was to come in clock in and proceed to working the product in my department. Management was ok at times.Hardest part of the day was actually not working
good,"Wouldn't make a career out of it by any means but it's not a bad place to work if you're between a rock and a hard place. Time off requests are pretty flexible but only a certain amount of paid time off is allowed per year, depending on length of employment."
good,"unload trucks, stock grocery, worked 32 to 40 hours a week most enjoyable was other associates.nothing more to say.never be a cashier, little hours there"
good,"no benefit with zero Coulter, work time is not mach with associates life time. no holiday pay off. Walmart was paying six of holidays but no nothing paying."
good,Way too many chiefs. Too much work for one person alone. Setup to fail. Not enough equipment to do your job effectively or even efficiently.  Poor management
good,walmart customers are willllldddddd!!!! hardest part of the job was the anxiety you get when you have a long line. most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out and getting chocolate with my discount card during my break.
good,You have to speak up when it comes to your hours and what you receive in pay. You have to make sure you’re appropriate and that you’re always on time depends on which Walmart you work at
good,Nice company good benefits inconsistent schedule room to grow within company and earn bonuses and raises paid sick days and time and a half on holidays overall good company
good,"Depends on your view. To me the place is great but managers can be harsh. Customers can be worse. And messes are three times that on a daily basis. I'm talking vomit, menstrual blood, woman's water breaking. Never daily but it happens."
good,Good pay can find better but decent management they are nice sometimes but always have a attitude they do not work well with customers and can be over the top
good,"It is an okay place to work. Problem is too many people that do not seem to care, and then management does not make the right people accountable. The ones who do little are not held accountable and the ones that work hard are given more to do. Plus the hard workers are then held accountable for what they could not do, because of the overabundance of work they are given. Lack of training is a big problem, not oonly with management. There are a few of us that will help others to succeed. It seems many are afraid of losing their position or have an insecurity. Also lack of equipment and personnel makees the job harder to perform."
good,I feel that there was very bad management going on in Walmart. There’s was no loyalty amongst the management team to associate team. I felt disrespected at one point in time and no managers came to my aid. I was a good worker who was there over 3 years and got mistreated very bad and no management came to my aid. I’m very upset with the way Walmart has treated me.
good,I was willing to work any day all day and yet it seemed impossible to get hours. the only people that honestly got semi-consistent hours are the tenured and they don't seem to even want to do work.
good,I think management should care more about their associates. Instead of acting like they are better than everyone. We work waaaay to hard for our hours to be constantly cut.
good,Walmart is cutting hour and position in the company it feels like they dont care. If you cant work the hours available then you dont get to work if your a department manager and you dont pass a test you have to choice be to take what they give you or get fired.
good,"Walmart was more stressful than I thought. I worked front end and we were always short handed, the customers were rude, and theft was a major issue. They pay is fine, but the point system is a bit unethical."
good,"This is a cooperate environment , so the thing with that is your expendable. If your late they are not courteous of this. they have no understanding of family or work life balance. Its great for a teenager or just starting out, even for an elderly or maybe retired VET but not a grown adult raising a family. The salary is junk."
good,Needs moral improvement for their associates. Its okay for a while but once you get over worked and not appreciateed you start to hate walking in the building
good,"Walmart Walmart Walmart "
good,"Empresa com cultura de trabalho diferente da brasileira,  onde falta profissionalismo na administração."
good,"As an assistant manager over the last 8 months, I have worked an average of 60 hours a week. I work 10 to 14 hours a day and most weeks 6 days. The real problem is when I was hired I was told that it was a 45 hour a week job. "
good,I was over work and under paid had way to much on my plate not enough help to successfully get all the daily tasks done manangement was a joke and pretty unprofessional
good,The hours are cut anytime something happens that cost the company money.they have good managers and some that are horrible. They are cutting hours back a lot right now
good,"Esta empresa cuenta con un mal ambiente laboral, debido a que la administración del gerente no es muy buena."
good,"Thought customers supposed to be first,but time and time again I was told it was not what I was paid for.that was really frustrating to me.that was frustrating to me because Sam Walton wanted customers to be first no matter what so thank you walmart for pushing me out."
good,"I liked working for Walmart, however they weren't too happy about me wanting to change the hours I worked because I wanted to start college. I had to find a new job and take a pay cut because my manager wouldn't work with the new hours I could work."
good,I would work there again if needed. The management team could have been better but over all it was a good job at the time. I just had to relocate at the time.
good,i work for the  busiest store our market. if it wasn't for corporate demanding us to cut hours and implanting new rules that make us  sell instead of help patients it would be the perfect place to work
good,"A typical day at work includes scanning bins and removing products that pick to take to the floor and stock onto the shelves.  Also, helping customers find products quickly and zoning the products on shelves."
good,"Day at work sucked cause you never knew if you would be off on time. "
good,It was a hard place to work for management dont know how to communicate within each other. Which caused issues in the work place more then anything. Overall it wasn't bad though
good,The work wasn't that bad if you worked as a team. There were a few coworkers that I didn't like because they were lazy and didn't want to do anything.
good,long work weeks over a period of months very poor management was looking to mover forward with my job/career never had the chance to do so mostly did over work poor management
good,I enjoy bring in customer service at Wal-Mart because i love helping people. A lot of issues with management and flexibility with fair schedules and hours..they could be more thoughtful and considerate of their excellent employees who work very hard and deserve recognition.
good,"Very busy with customers at the start of the shift, mods change out every few month's (nothing new to learn), management has no leadership on 3rd shift, people from all walks of life shop & work there, Not getting help to finish the freight or getting overloaded to work 2-3 department's alone with no help, going home is the most enjoyably time everyone is miserable at the end of the shift."
good,"Can't make a plan due to no set of schedule, the schedule is changing every week, No specific type of work,The Customer Service Manager will assigned you a certain work, and another CSM will assigned to another area, with no coordination."
good,very stressful place to work. You have to practically beg to get a break off the registers.  Management is only out for themselves and not their employees. Walmart used to be family oriented. Not any more.
good,I work in dairy frozen and there have been multiple times where we would call or try and find management to take out compost or the milk crates out and they are either not around or when we call for them they say yeah we will be there and then never even show up and then we will get in trouble for not doing it.
good,"Better than other choices but still not the best of jobs, definitely best to stay Oly as long as needed to aquire a better/higher paying job. Not very many opportunities for hard/honest workers to move up to manager positions, especially with moth managers picking favorites."
good,"I started working at Walmart security as entry level into the industry, the first two weeks were amazing and I was enjoying the site and the environment. Things get started weirdy when they started shifting me into different worksites., that was the time I hated the job and asked my supervisor to give me a certain site instead rounding me all Toronto every single weekend."
good,Walmart was a fun fast pace job to work at everyone be minding their own business doing their work I never had a problem.  I had to over come some fears like climbing a ladder but I did it.
good,"The job is not bad it's pretty simple actually and i enjoyed it..good  benefits in terms in heath and 401 k but  in terms of raises annually it's pretty bad, but there's always room for improvement ..if you wanna be a manager you just need to suck up to the big bosses..it""s not about how good you are in terms of promotion!"
good,"Retrieving items from store room and stocking shelves "
good,as a cashier at Walmart I enjoyed meeting and helping people - the work was almost always busy ( I worked 2  pm to 10 pm ) but enjoyable - the difficult part was standing for 8 hours a day.
good,"Overnight gets yelled at by other shifts becuase they only finish their assign work instead of the left over work form other shifts. Also are usually understaff. "
good,Horrible management company wide. No work life balance very cut throat organization. Great place to learn management skills because you will self teach most of the time.
good,"During my 3 year experience with Wal-Mart supercenter on garrisonville Stafford Virginia.  Was an ok  experience for as culture but the filling  was always a over worked under paid experience. We were always short handed and I would always be stuck on the Back wall in paper ,chemicals,help out in pets  and anywhere  else they would need me to be in the time frame of a shift 10pm until 7am. It becomes overwhelming of a consist time frame."
good,"Everyday was the same checklist so I liked how I knew exactly what I had to do. I disliked being timed on isles only because when you get it done in that timing you have a lot of extra time left to find stuff to do. Management wasn't very personal at all, so many managers in and out it was hard to find out who to report to. Over all it was a steady pay check with at least 40 hours a week promised."
good,"long days long shifts lots of ups and downs too many demands without any recognition"
good,I hated it. Don't ever work at walmart. It was a horribly managed place and the associates were horrible to each other and management didn't do anything when you had a problem. Cashiers were treated horrible all the time and treated like dogs and talked to like dogs even when it wasn't our fault..
good,I couldn't keep up with the stress of too many managers telling you conflicting information. I ended up with ulcers. They cleared up within a month of leaving.
good,The management at Easton Walmart is terrible. Only 2-3 of the managers are good. It can be a family work environment but it's also like high school. It's an ok place to make ends meet.
good,"I love working retail. I enjoyed my customers and co-workers. I had the opportunity to cross train and learn several departments. On the other hand... They don't work well around your child care schedule nor do they care. I was told I would be moving departments. I was then fired shortly after. I was told one thing by an assistant and another by the store manager.The asm's and store manager do not communicate well. Most employees even after working there for months, had not met and still didn't know who the store manager was."
good,"They will listen to you then ignore what you have said.,Laugh when you ask for help and demand things be done that are beyond your ability."
good,Very aggressive customers with McDonald's mentality. Everything must be immediate. Most stores have been downsized and they only hire part time when they replace employees.
good,Great environment to work and learn while in school however management has favoritism. Worked for the company and was let go for using manager's code that other coworkers would also use as well. Complete blasphemy.
good,"The only problem is that they don’t fully train you for the position, for most of it I needed to problem solve and figure things out for myself in order to be able to answer questions for customers."
good,"Can be a great place to work at but as a recent graduate of a degree in management it is not managed very well, at least not where I worked. Managers were unskilled in delegating properly and had no idea what was actually going on in any of the departments, making it difficult for associates to actually do their job."
good,"they just opened up the location where i use to work and i has just started high school. they gave me 2 12hr shifts and told me it was by mistake....i got use to a schedule 4pm-11pm and then all of a sudden it changed to 5pm and i made the mistake of coming in at 4pm for my shift and instead of the manager take me in the back prep area to explain that i started my shift an hour early, they instead ganged up on me (3 grown men) in the middle of the produce area where customers could hear and see what was going on.....needless to say i quit shortly after out of embarrassment."
good,The job it self is pretty easy however management makes the job 100x harder than it has to . the associates tend to be very nice . the hardest part of the job is dealing with not having the equipment needed to do your job
good,"A typical day at work was more than stressful. There was always someone trying to bring me down, spreading rumors that I was trying to get people fired. No one worked as a team, as much as I tried to. There was no communication, and that holds a company back."
good,"I had to work evening and weekend shifts and so I had to work every weekend, 8 hour shifts.  That made it hard for my family life.  I felt like it's a good place to work when you need work but you have to have good customer service.  Or you should."
good,"Walmart would be a great place for people with an open schedule. Management is not helpful and they are never around when you really need them. Schedules were always an issue and turn over rate was always high. You get quarterly bonuses only if there were no major accidents and met the quota. How much the bonuses would be is based on how many hours a week actually worked and sometimes, might not even receive one. In the pharmacy, you don't really get breaks and lunch is not very long. The customers can be very demanding and if you do not have strong customer service skills then I strongly recommend finding a different job. Its a good company to get some type of work background but as far as a career, there is not that much opportunity on moving up. Walmart does provide 401k and retirement opportunities as well as reimbursements with traveling. They provide paid training, your badge and smocks. Required attire is out of own pocket."
good,"I didnt have a problem with walmart it paid half of the bills. my check was being garnished when i worked there so i couldnt tak efull advantage of the pay rate while employed,"
good,"Es una buena empresa para los que quieren estudiar y trabajar, pero no es una buena empresa para desarrollarse profesionalmente los salarios son bajos y hay una minima oportunidad de crecimiento esto si le caes bien a los supervisores o gerentes no toman en cuenta la capacidad o el trabajo de los empleados para los ascensos."
good,It was ok working at Wal-Mart it was just the managers and employees who were unprofessional. I really didn't feel comfortable because they didnt give me the hours I needed.
good,Everybody was made to feel like slaves and kept in sheer aggravation feeling like nothing anyone did was ever good enough as such it caused us to become bitter towards customers and each other.
good,"Just do your work and you’ll be fine, it’s not a bad place at all. Store manager is a great man, I would refer people to store 601 in San Angelo Texas."
good,"Overall the people are great but the managers often take advantage of their employees and leave them with little to no respect, other than that its pretty good company to work for."
good,"Management was severely lacking, allot of times i had to work over a few hours without notice or anybody else their do to the next shift calling off. staff was never happy."
good,A lot of dependable people there and do your job. Walmart believe in good customer service and be your best. They like to hired experienced workers and the community there is diversity.
good,"At Walmart it’s survival of the fitted , management don’t care about what is going on in your personal life they do *NOT care about their associates wellbeing they just want the money they will use you until you can’t work no more and then throw you out the door."
good,"Not very hard work, just fast paced."
good,Working at Walmart was one experienced that I learned to understand and get used to the working there. I was surprised as to how many managers were bad at their job. I then later understood that is a cooperate thing. I finally left Walmart because the manager there wrote me up for something that I wasn't supposed to be written up for because I was apart of policy. I notified her manager about it and she then got written up for writing me up for something I should have never had to be deal with in the first place.
good,It was okay to work there but it is hard work and fast paced. I had a hard time getting advancements in my work and the breaks were not always on time.
good,"seems like a friendly place to work but over time you begin to understand why people that work their hate it."
good,Employment ideal for income while in school or living independently. Would not recommend Company as a career base nor would it be recommended for long term employment.
good,"Working here was new for as it was the first overnight job I had.  Upon clocking in I was working, and working hard, to clean and finish my assigned area in the allotted time I had to do so.  The management was not as managing as I would have expected from Wal-Mart.  Most times I was left to stick to my own routine, rather than ask for help or guidance from management."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work...if you do not have children! I was told they would be able to work with my schedule, but when I provided it they then said they couldn't do it. I had to bring my children to work with me several times and have them sit at customer service and wait for their dad or grandma to be off work and able to come pick them up."
good,I enjoyed working here but the management was terrible. Busted hump to get everything done every day but it was never good enough. Not enough co-workers to complete everything on time. Overnight shift got away with doing whatever they want and our shift got blamed for everything.
good,Es una empresa buena pero pues en el salario esta bajo a mi punto de vista
good,"Typical Walmart environment. Really depends who you are working directly with  to determine how your work day goes. Customers trash the place on a daily basis.  General lack of equipment, broken or breaking things are really fixed or take forever before they get fixed."
good,"The one i worked at was okay, Loved the people i worked for just not management/supervisor. They didnt treat everyone fare and i would abuse the power they had."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart is dealing with hundreds of customers, nice and rude, making sure all tasks are done in a short time basis. Keeping work area clean. Making sure our customers are first and given the best customer service."
good,Almost 19 years with the company which I'm overall content with yet have an interest to venture outside my comfort zone. Eager to learn skills unrelated to retail.
good,If you have children you might as well not bother with walmart. They do not accept doctors notes for absences or leaving early. Getting a medical leave through the 3rd party company is a nightmare and that is with it being unpaid. Ended up fired for points after my son was hospitalized for 4 days. Walmart expected me to leave him and come to work.
good,"While Wal-Mart used to be a place where employees could work to enhance their families and grow with the company, this has not been the case in a long time. Wal-Mart is about you, as an employee, serving them at all cost. They rarely work with your schedule, and you have to fight them before they do. Now corporate is making that even harder for associates since they have introduced a completely automated scheduling system that makes it hard for even managers to help you out."
good,The only good thing is the relationships you create with customers and the friendships that occur between you and you're co-workers that according to corporate you're not allowed to talk to.
good,"I personally didn't like the management and the pay wasn't very good . it is very hard to use vacation time when you need it. I didn't take advantage of the insurance benefits, since it costs too much."
good,"Management isn't something I was pleased with, being they have this ""open door policy"" but they don't go by it by no means. If you have an issues with someone and report it, it doesn't say private. They will go and tell the person you have a problem with them and tell them that you reported them and makes it more drama for you in the work place. Nope! I loved my job till that, now whenever i go shopping there they manager i reported always looks at me rudely and always bumps into me...."
good,"This company was a great place in the first 6 months of my employment. It provided me a place to gain experience and move around for flexibility to maintain my hours. Once I was over my probation period, things began to go AWOL. One week I would have 32 to 38 hours and the next, I would have 18 to 22 hours, but that is the way retail is. The management cannot make up their minds with a collective decision and makes it difficult to advance. This gives an employee with 2 months of experience the ability to take a high position which doesn't allow an employee with experience and dedication to go for the job. It seems as though they become invisible. Be careful what you do while you're on the job. You could get the blame for someone else's mistake."
good,"This job was a a good start job for me, but i personally do not plan on making a career out of it. At this job i did learn how much I love working with and helping people. I would prefer a set working schedule such as monday through friday one time to the next time, which is not offered in my position at Wal-Mart."
good,in my experience in the almost two years i worked at this store there was little to no interaction with management and out department was highly neglected.
good,"Worked with Walmart for 1 year, wile working there I worked 3 different shifts. In addition to working customer service I also in charge of handling the ""to-go orders"" throughout Walmart."
good,The hardest part was when it's slow the best as the people you meet and greet on a daily basis some management not so good a lot of back biting the culture was wonderfully diverse it's supposed to be family orientated but sometimes you are either to friendly or not friendly enough confusing
good,"Walmart has its days. I worked overnight, and it was pretty laid-back. My co-workers are really what made the night go by. The managers are always up your rear end. & they write you up over the slightest mishap. So it’s probably best not to get on anyone’s bad side. Because they’ll use it against you."
good,You have to unload three trucks A night By hand Then go help out Stocking theFreight Lots of work Not enough money. It's a fast pace environment If you like working for low wages Walmart is a place for you
good,Walmart is extremely stressful to work for.  There is zero job security.  They watch your every move.  They listen to your conversations.  They capture video of you with reflection of you to see if you are on the telephone.
good,"If you absolutely need a job and no other options then this is a good place to work for. However, if you have other options available then please look elsewhere. I've worked for 2 different stores at this point and each starts out OK but then true colors begin to show. Management seems to get worse with each newly hired one. Some of the management I think would sell out their own mother for something petty if it meant they were able to look good instead of working for a step up and the company allows it. A lot of the management will give preferential treatment, especially if they are friends outside of work with associates. Most of the associates are generally nice and friendly, but as with any work environment you have the ones that you need to be warry of. The company itself just seems to be going down in general. "
good,A typical day at work is stocking making sure everything looks good and countin inventory was a big factor but most importantly the hardest wirk was my favorite. I learned how to work with alelecteomic devices and use pallet jacks. Management was decent not the best but they would help. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the flow and dealing with customers at the same time of trying to get everything else done. The most enjoyable part was a nice day not too busy and able to get everything done.
good,"Wal-Mart gave me a job after being out of work over five yrs. The job allowed me to rebuild my life, however one must be able to ""let it roll off"" and ""just do it""."
good,Your ideas don't count. They treat customers poorly. More and More responsibility with less pay. You get told weekly how replaceable you are. No hope to move up.
good,Walmart can be a stressful environment. Employees don't want to work. Management could really care less if you have a life outside of work. Pay isn't good. Benefits are pretty good.
good,"The daily tasks that are assigned to you while working with Walmart is very easy. The issues with this company comes from within with management and company policies. The design of the company seems to only cater to those at the top, and the hourly associates are not considered.Walmart does not pay associates appropriately for the work load placed on them. They also alter the number of hours given to workers with no forewarning. I enjoyed it while attending college, and while in high school, but for anyone who has a family to raise will more than likely face financial troubles working for this company."
good,"The job was pretty easy, with little or no stress.  The hours were always below 40 with no chance of overtime to help out.  The pay was low, so I had to find other employment"
good,"a typical work day I had no direction of what to do"
good,"Like most corporate companies, they're all about customers. Sure, customers are important for buisiness, but they are also extremely unkind to employees, making it difficult for emloyees to enjoy thier jobs."
good,"The rules always seem to change at this company. As a stocker they push you and push to put out more and more stock, faster and faster. It can be very stressful sometimes. Management frequently changes personnel and policies frequently change. They have a strict attendance policy and once you receive certain number of points you are fired. However, at the particular store I worked at, certain employees seem to abuse this policy and never get fired while others are held to the  attendance rules. It was very frustrating. In addition, management tends to gossip with lower level employees in an inappropriate manner and this causes discord among employees."
good,The company overall was a great company to work for but they didn’t give managers the opportunity to advance in their education. I just wish that I could have had more leniency or give the managers the opportunity to have a set schedule not one that changes daily
good,"managers are more bossy then helpful they are only caring about there career. i had a lot of fun there cause i met some cool people, but some other people were rude and lazy. and some people don't take the job seriously."
good,Workings as an cashier at Walmart wasn’t s good option at all for me because your mangers was very  unprofessional with scheduling with the breaks and lunches because they will forget all about you. They also did go around your set schedule that you already had put in the computer it was as very  unorganize
good,"Exigiam muito das nossas vestimentas. Os dias que o mercado estava vazio fazia a gente repor mercadorias, devolução de produtos entre outras funções."
good,Only work in retail if that's your last option. Go to school and make something of yourself. Retail is and seems to always be peoples last option.  Its a good first job. It will definitely teach you on how to be more kind to others.
good,"I was hired by the ""hiring manager"" not the ""Pharmacist Manager""-- the pharmacy manger did not seem to like me, but also was not keen on hiring anyone during remodeling. I was ignored often and I had to ask people to teach me how to do things instead of ANY TRAINING! Hello?! Not cool."
good,"Essa empresa tem muitas coisas a melhorar a começar pelo salario que e  péssimo e as condições de trabalho em geral também são horríveis."
good,"Wal Mart is a great place for teens who are just starting to work, also for adults who want to advance in soon be in a higher position.I was still in school while working so I worked part time and was able to do overtime"
good,"Scheduling is frustrating. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you have a life outside of Walmart."
good,"Years ago WalMart had a culture of 3 basic beliefs- Respect for the Individual, Customer Service and Strive for Excellence. Having spent over 20 years with this company they have gone farther and farther away from these beliefs. Customer service has lacked since the amount of associates available keeps dwindling from year to year. Respect for the individual by some Managers has disappeared and the only belief that has stayed strong is striving for excellence, which excellence is MONEY!"
good,Working for a large corporation such as Walmart was indeed a challenge within itself. The people are wonderful to work with and the customers always manged to make my day.
good,"Walmart is a fast paced, where only the best survive. the politicking is crazy, but the work is amazing. "
good,"Working as a cashier was easy and fun. Loved talking to new people everyday and making relationships with regulars. Management was terrible, never there when needed. 2 paid 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute -1 hour unpaid lunch."
good,"Walmart is a fast pace hard working environment with chance to grow in the company. As a Walmart associate there is alot of responsibility as in customer service, keeping work area clean,always the strict guidelines ect"
good,Managment was a joke. the entire job was a joke. They acted flexible but weren't. They never really fully trained their employees and people got mad at you way too easily.
good,When I worked here I had a very difficult time to get them to work with my school schedule. I enjoyed working as a cashier and interacting with customer on a daily basis but the money I made here was not enough to cover my expenses and I needed a job that would be flexible with my school accommodation.
good,First thing in the morning I would set up people to they're zoning areas and continue any projects the store manager wanted me to do. Anywhere from Retailtainment to features.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart as long as everyone was held accountable. I really like the profit share provide for employees. certain jobs there are much better than others within the store
good,"Medical insurance takes 1/3 income and does practically nothing. Supposed to have good advancement, but depends on store/location. Favoritism is very common."
good,"No work life balance and highly stressful. This job is definitely not how they make seems, when the hire you. Upper management is not   unrealistic with the task they want done. And will hold you accountable for a lot things,that you cannot control."
good,"Honestly, I didn't work here long enough to get a good feel for it. I just know that it was stressful to me at that point in my life, but there were other things going on so I wouldn't say that it was entirely the job's fault. I would consider going back and working for them again in the future."
good,"One thing that I enjoyed was getting paid somewhat good for the job that I did. Of course, it helped if the manager was fair. I'm glad that I invested in the 401k."
good,"No comment to give. Woke up, went to work, worked my overnight shift. Liked most of the people I worked with. Left in the morning and went home. Not much else to say."
good,I learned how to manage time to take care of my associates properly. I learned what type of manager I never want to become. But I also learned that there are still decent human beings in this world that were raised with great morals.
good,I really would not re-apply I have several reasons.Due to Walmart my mother had a heart attack and me being fired due to absences. I quote my Supervisor told me I have obligations to this company and due to the absences they have to let me go. Basically never seen prior to her having this I was on-time had to stay over several times spent my holidays with the company and not my family and I'm fired. Truly hurt me so I'd never recommend anyone to this company.nor re-apply.
good,They tried to get 2nd shift to do more of the stocking and cut down 3rd shift work load in which caused a change in management and staffing and productivity decreased due to management not understanding the staff.
good,"Accommodate school schedule, fellow employees complain openly even in front of customers about their managers. Some managers were personable such as mine"
good,My typical day at Walmart is to get our drawers and do customer service and to make sure all of our areas are covered and make sure our other associates get breaks and lunches
good,Always  a routine to go to register ring customers out and wait for someone to tell you to go on breaks. Fast paste environment with high traffic area. I have learned to be very patient and don't always relay on management. To me it was overwhelming and very hard to concentrate. Dealing with management with favoritism over other employees and not very nice management. The only thing i enjoyed was that i got vacation time.
good,"demanding customers and stressful atmosphere, Manager over the Deli was hard to get along with at times...but in all I liked being there,just very Stressful and demanding."
good,Walmart is a great work place it’s just the management team sucks . They say they are all for us but they are really not. They talk to the employees however they want and show no type of respect.
good,"There's better stores out there. Walmart was good other than the management. They were lazy and always told you they were busy, then would be sitting around all day doing nothing but talking."
good,"I can only speak on my Walmart. It depend on the manager that night or managers, if you had to ignore the organization skills of others or you can focus and work on what you need to do."
good,I probably will never work for walmart again. walmart treat you as a number or just a body. Was not to please with turn out of working for a worldwide company .
good,"Tratar con personas sin educacion, con puestos de trabajo altos."
good,I started out working at the Walmart in Asheboro NC and transferred to the Neighborhood market in Winston-Salem. The neighborhood market was stressful and the management sucked!
good,"Updated sales information in various departments.  Met sales requirements,  on a yearly schedule.  Supervised employees on a daily basis.   Updated the merchandise ordering and stocking system. Operated and maintained the cash register, and also stocked shelves."
good,Morning meetings before your shift in different depts through out the store is great. Employees need to be recognized even if it's a pat on the back or handshake letting them know they are doing an awesome job. Hardest part was schedule change without being notified. I enjoyed my job when I was able to do displays with a team.
good,"I have enjoy working doing my duties and responsibilities, my supervisor loves me for that their not willing to let go of me when I've trying to go to another location it's take for them more than a month before they let me transferred, I've learned that other employees at Walmart they are mean  they do take advantages to a new employee."
good,At times you will do your job and five others. Management picks favorites and they get ahead and good shifts. Pay is decent although it is 9 hrs on your feet in concrete
good,"Working at Walmart is busy. There's always something that needs to be done.  Walmart has helped me work productively at a fast pace, carry multiple conversations at once, and keep a positive attitude through difficult situations. What I like most about this job is the diversity of people. What I dislike the most and the reason I am leaving the company is that they are not consistent.  One week they give you 40 hours the next you'll get 8, the week after that you'll get 12."
good,"They gave me a job and that i am great-full for however they don't give enough hours out and the management are very rude most of the time. Anyone i know who gets cut from there.. Ends up being very happy and well the place needs a major fix!!! people on the floor always get called up to go on cash and yet they cant give the cashiers hours???? we sales floor workers need to keep the store clean and help our customers.. we cant do that if we are on cash... Walmart is extremely wealthy.. yet they cant afford to give the little people the hours they deserve.. Everyone i know complains about this!!! EVERYONE!! even the full timers are upset,,"
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience. I not only found a family, but I met customers from all over the world who made me very comfortable. It was a serious matter but it was also a place with entertainment."
good,management had poor communication and does not follow up or react to issues. Any attempts to get action taken are met with resistance and dragging of their feet.
good,"The job is pretty easy which is the best part, I had a pretty cool supervisor and manager as well. They did however, never try to solve work issues. I was also scolded by an HR rep after my manager had given me direction. The HR rep was giving me directions that conflicted with what my managers directions. Despite asking 4 times I also never got my direct deposit set up. The HR rep cared more about going home early so he would leave before the time we were supposed to meet. Despite being a new employee, I was left at my station alone 95% of the time with little direction. I would look for other tasks to do when mine were done, and my supervisor would have me just stand in the corner."
good,When you first start you must do pathways. Pathways are a training course you must do on the computer. It’s supposed to take you two months to do but they never gave me time so it took me 6 months to finish.  Until you finish you make a dollar less than everybody else. When I got to work I had to get a cart go to the front and get you returns. You put whatever is in your returns back on the shelves tell the truck is unloaded. When the truck is unloaded you go get freight. In between doing your work customers may ask you for help. You must stop what you’re doing and help them no matter how long it will take. You have a  certain time to get your freight done. After two hours you have to stop and zone your area. Zoning is bringing everything to the front of the shelf so no diamonds are showing. If these tasks don’t all get finished by the end of your shift you may get coached which is the same as a write up. You get one break in a four hour shift. If you work 8 hours though than you get an hour lunch. The hardest part is to get all your tasks done. I worked in toys so zoning it was impossible. Doing freight is hard because Walmart is always understaffed so you must help customers every five seconds. The best part of the job is the people you work with and the customers. I have made many friends that work there. It’s always nice to help a customer and being friendly. It makes their day go better and yours too.
good,"The managers let their title go to their heads a little bit. I wouldn't work there again if it was the very last job the world had to offer. Good place to work, bad people to work with."
good,Most days were very good days to work for Walmart however their inconsistency caused a lot of issues between associates. I genuinely liked my job my biggest issue is not being able to perform my tasks because I was having to fix others jobs on a daily basis due to lack of accountability.
good,It is an alright first job experience. If I had to I would go back now since they have raised the pay of cashiers but they still don't offer full-time or benefits really.
good,"This job was for survival.  The company culture was not to grant full time to anyone but management but shifts were such that you could not have a second job.  Pay was minimum wage.  No benefits.   my typical day was to come in on day shift, answer phones, redirect calls to appropriate departments.  In between answering phones, i maintained the cleanliness of the dressing rooms, folded clothing product tables brought to me and assisted any of the staff as directed. Occasionally i would have to use the pager to page staff over the intercom.  Co-workers were friendly but we were discouraged from talking while working."
good,Productive and fun workplace. The hardest part of the job was having to work every weekend. the most enjoyable part of the job was having many customers and staying busy. Some of the management needs to be schooled on having the right attitude and learning how to talk with employees in a respectful manner.
good,"I have worked on and off for the company for almost 17 years in total. Though it is a place to grow, unless you are willing to devote your whole life to them, things can become less tenable with time. My typical day begins with opening duties including printing and verifying sales reports, calling patients to confirm appointments (on days preceding our doctor coverage) scheduling my associates and setting up the register. I have earned many things during my tenure about customer service as well as gained a vast knowledge of precription eye wear and troubleshooting issues for patients. I believe the stores are only as good as the person at the helm, some of which are inspiring, while others are not. The hardest part of my job is finding the right candidates for positions within the department, but it also can be quite rewarding to find that individual who is just the right fit."
good,"Los supervisores no tienen caracter y tienen preferencia por los que faltan y no hacen productividad,por otro lado sus contratos agencia,pre-planta y planta a mi parecer son perdida de tiempo"
good,"Too many employees in seemingly unnecessary management positions, too few managers in demanding locations. They have their friendship circles and will behave and operate inappropriately towards associates not included. Will allow open bullying by managers/supervisors then blame the associate that is being treated unfair. The entire store management team needs reevaluated and replaced."
good,Constantly on your feet the entire time.  You do receive stock options as well as discounts even if you are working part-time. Good place to work if you are going to school to further your goals due to the flexible hours.
good,"Their too strict, there's too much favoritism, no room for advancement. They just don't care. They aren't understanding. They don't offer second chance"
good,Overall Walmart is a decent place. Management are unsure of making decisions. Some want to wait to hear from the store manager. Outside of that things are ok
good,"Good place to work for, always take care of their associates,  hold management to a higher standard and accountability.  I had a great career that felt short"
good,Helpful place to start working but you are overworked and underpaid.  If any person works there they should be aware that the supervisors are hard task masters who ensure that not one minute of Walmart;s time is wasted
good,"This was a good summer job to have as a student. The hours were lengthy, but was much needed. Management was very organized on how the front end worked and overall workplace culture was decent. If any conflicts between employees or customers arose, it would be quickly and efficiently settled. The personal main issue was that muscles were very strained by frequently lifting heavy items (i.e. crates of water bottles, fruit)."
good,Pretty much typical to any minimum wage job really. Not the worst I had though. Wish they at least had more options for a full time position with benefits.
good,was great in the beginning until i went into management. i was not able to step down to department manager when i could no longer work all the hours .
good,There was a time when I highly recommended walmart to friends and family but over the last few years they have declined in their care of associates. They used to really care.
good,"Typical day scan overstock bins. Work picks. Section work. Displays. Price changes. Customer Service."
good,"The job I had was great, I loved my job, but it was hard working for that company. The management team need more communication  between them, they do not know how to communicate at this company. One manager will tell you to do a whole list of things, then another manager will tell you to do something completely different and then remind you that you also have to follow your routine list of things to do, so now you have 10 times more stuff to do and no help to do it, even when you tell them that you need the help and that you are not able to get all that done in the 8 hours that you work that day."
good,"While the job was not stressful, working with management was. Scheduling was always chaotic alongside a lack of organization from almost everyone in a management position."
good,"l learned a lot about teamwork. Can now put cake decorating on resume... But really, the take away point is, if you don't treat your employees nice, they won't want to be there and it shows through their work."
good,"Management sucks. HR was always clueless. we were always way understaffed and between customers and management it was near impossible to get anything done, i mean, come on, it's walmart."
good,Fridays or saturdays or the beginning of the month is the busiets learned to have a lot of patients management was a little hard to work with.The hardest part of my job was customer service my most enjoyable time is with my co-workers
good,"Lack of training for hourly and management at school level."
good,The people both customer and managers were demanding and difficult to deal with. The whole experience was demanding physically and mentally. Schedules could be difficult to deal with if shifts were close together.
good,"very little pay, very little hours, i made lifelong friends out of my fellow employees but management had no problem cheating, lying, or doing whatever else they needed to do get your compliance. very few people got more than 25 hours, the schedule changed every week, which was chaotic to plan around and didn't allow you to have anything approaching a life. After taxes I took home about $650 a month. I was homeless while I worked there."
good,I appreciate the opportunity to keep my skills current with this company. I had been out of the pharmacy work force for a few years and wanted to get back into my favored profession.
good,There was a serious lack of communication between a lot of the higher-ups. They wanted you to do several jobs at once. The managers often stood around and jumped in to help for five minutes while having all the employees deal with certain issues instead. Unprofessional.
good,it was ok just don't get on the mangers bad side don't befriend anyone and watch your back it is like going to high school and just know your going to work your tail off. and working with mangers who are wanting you to work beyond what you can do i was made to do toys by myself with 13 pallets and once was told i had to do HBA all by myself with 7 pallets and go help do pharmacy when i was done with my HBA i am good but not that good.
good,I started at 6:30am which I enjoyed as I was off at 3.  Great partner to work with.  All backroom staff was excellent.  I would work with all of them again.  I enjoyed my job and I enjoyed dealing with all of the truck drivers and couriers that came to the door.  I am still friends with some of them to this day.
good,I would go in open all the doors of the bay and get them ready for the day.  we would start taking cars at 7 and have them done in about 30 minutes.  I learned more about cars then I would have in high school.
good,The employees don't always get along. You don't really get credited for the busting your butt off work. Some management are willing to help you more than others.
good,Good work place to work to learn the retail business. Would not recommend staying more than 4-5 yrs. Limited opportunity for career advancement. Workplace culture is competitive.
good,"Doesn't matter how many years you have with the company, how well you have performed, or how many contacts you have.  If they want to cut your job they will find a way to do it as quickly as possible."
good,"Work days were stressful, given the job i performed. Saw no chance for advancement. Limited future. A true ""Hate it or Love it Job"". Would have loved to stay, but saw no future there."
good,In my opinion this job did not really care about any one individual employee. Accomplishments are not viewed and/or acknowledged. again its a great start off job to see what your not looking for in a career.
good,"The hardest part of job was the lack of communication from management not having proficient team just never felt confident in my  position"
good,Being able to meet new people and dealing with the public it was a decent company and to work for enjoyed the quick pace of the job and learning to skills
good,Walmart is a revolving door company for many reasons. The lack of training. If you are lucky you get about a day worth of training. Corporate believes people come people go. They will not fight for their Associates. The assistant managers usually just look out for themselves.
good,I loved working in the jewelry department. my jewelry department manager was great..the assistant managers and store manager is what really took moral down. they don't care about their workers and only think of themselves. they really brought the store itself down. not saying all walmarts are the same but the management in this small town was no good.
good,"The job was very easy. With a fixed schedule and no overtime. They let go of almost all seasonal workers. The compensation plan could use some improvements. Feedback should have been available more often and frequent. In the Walmart I worked for lacked a concrete culture, or simply was non existent."
good,worst job I've ever had. work for 3 weeks only yelled at by manager but never received training in the their shop on what to do just thru me out and figure it out. there are favorites
good,"High expectations to finish your job in a shorter time. Very demanding in job duties. Hard to take time off, especially during holidays. Is a job for someone without a family or starter job."
good,You can start the day with certain duties but can change suddenly at a drop of the hat due to call ins and storages of Cashiers. I would  have liked if there was better coverage in departments like dressing rooms for customers and for people to be able to find people to help the.
good,"Every retail store is different, ranging from management personalities,styles,employee work ethic and even location of a store. From my point of view,my store had good hard working employees who would come to work and do their best even with challenging wages. I had good days and challenging days. Wal-mart showed me how to run a business for myself,be a better manager with all the challenges that come with it. I appreciate my time there, I wish certain key thing could have been different,but we learn and we move forward with a positive attitude and outlook."
good,Stocked freight in sales floor and back stock room. Provide customer service when store was open. Clean up minor spills. Some managers threw a fit if you couldn't get done more then they wanted.
good,"Poor working environment and no management to correct the lazy work of employees.  Most employees don't care about cleanliness and support to keep the deli ready to serve customers.   The workplace culture was very closed mouth and untrusting people."
good,No se respeta al trabajador y se abusa mucho de los valores
good,This was a very unique place to work the head boss was very nice and respectful but one of her shift lead crew member would slack on work make the crew do his job and really didn't care about the staff
good,"the culture at Walmart is ridiculous. people constantly not doing their jobs, talking on cell phones, texting on cell phones. showing up late or not at all. they blame each other when things dont get done, and management stands and does nothing."
good,Was fired when six weeks away from due date was done wrong worked very hard for the company for 3+years. Department manger awesome person some assistance manger's awesome
good,"A typical day at work required me to stock bakery shelves, baking cookies, baking french bread loaves, and assisting customers with finding the right items that they needed."
good,"Besides the near slave hours you get with no benefits while being part time and them usually slipping you overtime with no pay, the people were nice. Would I recommend it? No."
good,"Walmart can provide a sustainable career.  The company can assist with leadership skills development. There are many facets to the Walmart brand from general merchandising,  grocery, on line services."
good,"mount balance install tires "
good,It was a ok place to work at mangers sucked but other then that the employes were nice my supervisor was nice I had a good time at work until the mangers started to do thing that managers shouldn't do
good,A typical day at work is very busy and steady. The hardest part of the job is achieving advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was the other associate you work with.
good,went into store hoping to move up in career.  Passed up by others.   I work hard.  Do my job and more. Some people are fun to work with.  Alot of training courses.
good,The company advancements and benefits change.  Requirements to work and be responsible for extra departments without compensation. Rare breaks but can be wrote up for not taking breaks.
good,Management was horrible empolyee fun .I love working but when they make you work when u are sick where u can barly stand up is just ridiculous.so i will never work there again
good,"to be honest I never worked in a TLE shop before Walmart I always fixed my own cars and things like that so this was a complete experience for me, the people I worked with were really appreciative, and well respected people, I never had any issues working there, the only thing that I can say I didn't enjoy about working at Walmart is they try to transfer you to different departments when ever they want, and some times customers can be really rude."
good,"Walmart was fun and annoying at the same time. Pay sucks, but you can advance if you put in the time, in a few years you can move up, which is cool. Hour suck though."
good,I worked at the walmart in Queensbury New York and the overnight manager did alot of bullying to meiver my job because i was the only person working for a few hours and i was focusing on my different areas.
good,"Overall, not a great place to work. Management is very big on playing favorites. Hours are horrible and change every day, every week. Not a good place to work it you have a life outside of work; aka: kids, spouse, school..."
good,"Every day was kind of a new experience. When you're hired for your job, they tell you what it is you will typically be doing. However, occasionally you end up doing entirely new things and it keeps it exciting."
good,"Ok for a starter job wouldn’t make a career of it , low wages for the amount of work that is intended for one person ! Understaffed and salary managers are treated unfair"
good,"A lot of work,  few hours schedule. After 90 days you get a card for discount.they want you to do more than one job, more like three jobs at once.some bosses are fare."
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier and assisting customers'.  Also, enjoyed the work flow at Wal-mart. The best part was workng on the first of the month in the money being busy with cashing checks and doing money orders."
good,It wasn't challenging enough for me. Not demanding on body or mind. Every day was exactly the same. There was really no need to use your brain or think at all. Job became boring.
good,They don't know how to train properly. These stores are a absolute mess. Management doesn't care either. The pay is awful! The scheduling is awful as well.
good,"I started with Walmart with the hopes of advancing with the company, unfortunately I suffered from a bad gall bladder that required me to take a leave of absence, during this time Walmart fired me."
good,"Use to be a great company now it’s way to cut throat and stressful management needs to take care of their own, no team work all about each other and too much pointing fingers . Treat people under themselves not fairly and trying to change but it’s difficult to change since these management themselves suffered the same while they were coming up in the company."
good,"The work itself was easy. They will have you part-time and a certain shift but mark you down for random days of the week at different times. The interview was easy and the computer training was very impersonal and boring. The business culture was everywhere aroud you, for example posters and in training. But it wasnt enforced in the actual work you do."
good,"mala organización de trabajo, mal funcionamiento de material (computadoras o posnet) entre otras cosas."
good,Needs to learn how to treat employees. Will never take the time to listen to there people. Get treated disrespectfully. Nothing you do is never good enough. If you are a hard worker they still find ways to get rid of you and watch you like you are the enemy.
good,"Initially I was excited to work here.  After orientation, I learned that the hiring manager and my direct supervisor conflicted in their work ethics.  My direct supervisor was not excited to work with me after discovering my management style. This was the first time I fully understood how one can be over-qualified for a position.  I resigned my position after a few months"
good,i had managers that didn't even have jurisdiction over me pawning there work off on me not delegating stuff to me but literally sitting back and making me do there job on top of my own and it was not just one i usually got my stuff dun pretty quickly so i offered help to others at first but as soon as i showed my work ethic the managers swooped in and started dropping there work load on me and becoming hostile if i even talked about not being able to keep up with it as if i had personally insulted them
good,a typical day for me is heck. I get made fun of everyday and plus I get cursed out. I hate this place and I am looking for a new place to work.  I hope Walmart changes soon
good,"My current manager is useless. She does nothing but goof off and play around, then gets upset when her employees are not working. I bust my butt to make sure things are getting finished and our customers are taken care of, yet majority of the other workers goof around and don't do much of anything."
good,there was no working together .Slow workers and you have to pick up there slack but they did this purposely. more talking then working. 
good,"It was a great company to work for, but th management is very unorganized.  Leadership is not shown correctly and also the scheduling is not flexible at all."
good,"very little recognition."
good,"Walmart isn't a bad place to work nor is it hard. The management needs a little bit of help, but overall it is a good job with decent pay.  Sometimes it can be hard to get the availability that you want or the days off that you request too."
good,"Its a good place for a first job! Get some basic experience and keep searching for other options while there! Don't buy the hype its a cult, not a company!"
good,"I worked the auto department alone even while a new hire. Had to run constantly for help for customers because walmart is big. I gradually got a little better helping people, then besides keeping my area well stocked, management had us go straighten out several other areas of the store twice per shift. Then a supervisor wanted me lumping trucks, but those days are over now. So after the pallets were placed all over the store, I had to stock. It was just a job."
good,"The overall experience showed me how to take the good with the bad and make a pretty good situation. Even though I was there a short time, I definitely felt like one of there valued associates. Being as though I would work my days off and would work up to 4 different positions in a day."
good,I was on FMLA from my department in which my manager was suppose to be taking care of my department but she didn't with rotating product. when i came back i was called back in which i was then fired for expired meat in which i wasn't even in the store.
good,"It is a typical retail job. Moderate to high stress, have to deal with the general public, and work holidays. This job is more mental then physical, and can be hard on your health. Being exposed to hundreds of people all day every day means a higher chance for becoming ill with any communicable sickness."
good,working at walmart was okay but the management sucks and they are unprofessional in certain aspects. if you need different hours best bet is go to store manager or find a new job.
good,"It's an alright place to work as a starting job for teens, but not a career job at all with no advancement opportunities and poor management that does follow the rules."
good,Working for Walmart you can expect to work with the cutting edge technologies with a wide array of information at your finger tips to help with decision making.
good,My typical day at work was okay overall. There were a few parts that could have gone better but over all I would say that I did have some good and some bad days I would consider going back to being employed by Walmart Inc. if under new management.
good,"Good company, but it is changing with the times and that means getting rid of jobs in one area to create more in another. Great job if you have no family, or do not mind not seeing your family very often."
good,"They give you all of your hours, but there is no flexibility with the schedules, and if they give you a flexible schedule you will have to sacrifice your hours."
good,"On any given day you would have 4 to 5 managers demanding you stop what you are doing to address issues for other departments or their own benefit. It is literally impossible to be a Department manager, stocker and customer service employee at the same time and there are never enough employees on the floor doing their jobs."
good,Walmart is constantly changing so you learn new process daily and implement those with your associates.The hardest part is the turnover for you have several associates who point out quickly so staffing is hard to maintain. The most enjoyable part of the job is the bonds you build with your associates. The ability to teach and train them and to also learn as a manager.
good,Management isn't the best . The work environment could be better you have management that's not really Interested in the employees concerns .you get penalized if. Your child is sick and have to take off from work they believe Walmart is your life.
good,Management and job promotions are all about who you know and not what you know or can do no to say about this job anything else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Poor management, not enough pay or respect for what you do. Don't get me wrong some of my coworkers I loved and they are like family to me. They helped me through a lot from the very first day I got there. Management doesn't listen to problems within department, belittles and mocks employees when they try to explain what's wrong."
good,"This would be an ideal place to work for a Veteran or a Retiree just looking to pick up a few bucks. I, personally, wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a career."
good,"management was all over the place when we were short-handed in the vision center. When help was requested from another location it was ignored, and I felt customers were not getting the care they should have gotten."
good,"Bad working there, Management was not fair. Never had good communication. Wasn't un fair to all employess. Yelled at co-workers in the back by the freezers. Always in a rush"
good,high expectations always moving no home life balanced often work more then 60 hours a week. associates where fun to work with most where college kids.
good,Walmart is a workplace where students and part time workers. They don’t hire full time associates. Can’t advance because poor management. Nothing is confidential between managers and other associates.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, pricing items, cleaning the work area and closing, answering phones, assisting customers and fellow employees, decorating cakes, organizing the freezer, and keeping the bakery tidy"
good,It’s non stop and nothing is guaranteed especially not hours. Way too much drama and upper management rarely helps out or notices problems and fixes them
good,"The customers were great, co-workers were great...management at the time was not great. All in all, not a bad place to work, great for a first job or a part time job."
good,"Was able to meet a wide variety of people"
good,"can get as many shifts as you need when your a part time cashier, however there are no benefits and you are pushed very hard to sell mastercards. store cleanup is ridiculous sometimes."
good,To be the largest retailer in the USA this company could do much better. They offer PTO however there isn’t anything for emergencies that come up. If the day(s) you miss are not pre scheduled then the day will be held against you. No matter if you have a doctors note or not. The insurance is pitiful! Pay tips out in 2.5 years but after that your basically stuck with the same pay.
good,I perform my job duties I provided assistants to the customers by helping them look for items in and around the store some days the store is slow than get busy around the afternoon evening time
good,"long hours on your feet. bring water as it is warm. lunch must be in clear bag, they have frig and microwaves. You must go thru metal detectors. Staff was nice."
good,"I liked working at Walmart ,  I just didn’t like the supervisor change they made. And the random different time shift everyday. They would change my work schedule constantly one day I’d work night the next morning."
good,Wal-Mart is a very productive work place in which there is always a job to be finished whether it be large or small. Management is polite and professional towards customers. Management duties can be questionable and hypocritical at times. A typical day is busy in the morning and towards closing while in the evening it is a steady flow of vehicles enough to stay on your toes or until the rush of vehicles arrive. At the end of the day duties that must be done are done. Other associates can be very unprofessional at times and can cause issues among others in the work place causing a disturbance. I enjoyed working with the kind customers and kind employees. working on new vehicles or vehicles that you would not expect to see being serviced at Wal-Mart.I learned that for things to be done properly at times you must take charge of your own accord and finish the assignment when others are too unmotivated to do so. The hardest part of the job is when the other employees choose not to work and continuously go to smoke when there is only 2 - 15min. smoking breaks; when there are lines of customer vehicles waiting to be serviced and there is only 1 technician in the shop. hours being cut for part time associates so they are unable to apply for full time positions is frustrating. Also when a single co-manager is given control over associates hours after doing the same action at a different store and failing is disappointing. After completing all the vehicles before closing and cleaning up the shop; knowing all the vehicles that have been finished and on time there is a sense of accomplishment.
good,"A typical day included, unloading trucks, preparing items to be stocked, and stocking. I learned how to properly and safely use equipment, such as pallet jacks also balers. Management was very understanding tough situations. The most difficult part of the job was getting the trucks unloaded in a reasonable time."
good,"My experience at Walmart was somewhat mixed. Most of if not all of my fellow employees were extremely nice and friendly people. The supervisors were all kind and willing to help if you ever needed anything. However, management is another story altogether. Walmart has a stigma for having ""dumb"" employees. The problem is even management believes the stigma to a certain degree. I'm not saying all managers do, but the majority of them believe that. I was constantly talked down to by managers that didn't even work close to the area I did. Luckily the manager in my area was one of the few who didn't immediately assume you were an idiot. This stigma is also the main reason why advancement is so difficult at Walmart."
good,"I've learned how to effectively manage a large amount of people with enthusiasm and confidence. The work load was very large, but I've learned how to work with all my staff so that we create success together."
good,"Walmart was not so bad in the beginning, but as managers came and went it turned into a mess. Management seemed to care less and less for their associates and their safety and lives outside of Walmart."
good,"Managers would drive you up the wall even if something wasn't exactly possible. Some days were long, some where short obviously. The hours were pretty darn sporadic. Never enough employees on the busiest days throughout the entire day to keep things from getting chaotic and hard to deal with."
good,"Out of a 12 manager team, only two or three were reliable and worked to make the store a good place to work.  Very high turn over even with managers.  In 3 years all but 5 managers have changed and I've seen those positions get filled over and over because managers don't like working there. Schedules are erratic and hours fluctuate a lot. Shifts are random with very few managers willing to make it regular for their associates.  Associates and management team are not trained I  a way that everyone is on the same page.  Different managers are trained different in policy and process. In turn associates are trained different depending on the manager.  This causes serious confusion."
good,"Be ready to work,standing long hours on your feet.cold in winter and hot in summers.Long hours during peak season between November till after Christmas"
good,I enjoy the people interaction every day. I enjoy talking to the customers and helping them in any way I can. The training is very thorough.  I enjoy brightening someones' day.
good,I don't know. I think it was unfair that I got fired because I got sick and was in the hospital for a week and was fired because I missed 3 shifts. I felt that was wrong. Full time employees treated the part time like we were their slaves. Gave us way too much to do when it was graveyard shift that was supposed to do it. They played favoritism.
good,"fasted paced, no excuses for not getting work completed. only good thing was being on the pallet wrapping machine. that was a relaxed paced job. everything else had to be on your toes."
good,"Most of the front-end is very pleasant to work with, every department has there flawless, but they were very understanding. Takes care of their employees and listens/values their opinions and feelings."
good,"Everyone I worked with aside from upper management had great attitudes and knew what they were doing, upper management and some middle seemed to be figureheads with no idea how to work the jobs underneath them and always had bad attitudes."
good,I worked there for five years and did the same amount as everyone else and continuously got passed by for promotion by those that where yes men and if your going to school they will not work with your school schedule.
good,Its ok its a job they could be a lot better and then maybe employee would like this job. the customers are nice management needs a lot of improvement I like my job
good,Wal-Mart has to many department managers telling me what to do and no skills on how to treat associates by talking with manners and respect. I miss it
good,"very fast paced, not much room to advance, jobs given then taken away, customers are always right regardless of the situation, managers will give you the ok to handle situations if it is necesary"
good,I wouldn't mind working at Walmart if they weren't so greedy as well as for the managers being so rude and never on the same page as each other their communication is completely terrible.
good,"Lack of help makes working difficult at Walmart. Constant need to cover all other areas creates a gap in my daily production. asking for help is not something you want to do at wal mart, you will be coached."
good,"When I first started a couple of years ago, it was a decent environment to work for with an amazing group of people who used to treat employees with dignity and respect. Several years later, there was a big change in management and fresh new faces became a burden for everyone to work with because they were unprofessional, vulgar, and disrespectful. They played with your hours, changed your schedule without being made aware of , and some would play these politic games in which caused many to lose their jobs. If you want a temporary part-time job, then it wouldn't be so bad to take a couple of hours and build your resume, but don't make this job a career because in the end Ive learned that having advancement with this company in particular comes with a price."
good,Walmart is a business that has helped millions get employed. Individuals who have been employed by Walmart either do their best to become salaried management or are gaining work experience to head towards their future.
good,The diversity throughout the store was amazing and I learned a lot of different thing and skills but management was terrible. Managers created an uncomfortable work environment when they came out of their offices.
good,"This is an average job.  You'll have your good customers and your bad ones.  This job isn't very exciting, but rather stressful.  The line lead tends to send multiple people through one line versus opening a a new line when there are cashiers available. That was really the only stressful time."
good,"Took this job thinking it was a full time position only to find out it was part time.  Took pride in my job performance, maybe to much pride, management did not want to put me in a different position because I did my job so well and I was someone they could go to when something needed to be done.  Frequently asked to do other jobs when people failed to show up for work."
good,Terrible. management - I use the term loosely - doesn't communicate with each other.  Not a good work environment.  Nothing was ever fixed - example: warehouse bathroom door was busted by a reach lift and remained busted for 2 months.
good,It’s an awesome place to work for! Managers are pretty laid back but the store manager is unfair and needs some training on how to talk to her employees.
good,"California Walmart, where I worked was a fun place. Some of us worked hard together and such as a family keeping the store nice and customers happy. Although there was 2 assistant managers here who just wanted a paycheck and did not care as much for the customers or other associates"
good,"Depending who is your manager that day. they do have favorites and if liked,then you're good it can also be other associates putting complains on you."
good,typical day was ok
good,"Everything was schedules. There were no exceptions, had to make sure everything was kept exact. Many online classes, always adding more. Everything has to be clean."
good,"Management is sub-par, favoritism is a major issue. The hours aren't bad for the overnight shift and the starting pay at the Janesville store is decent."
good,"its a job, it paid the bills. work was reliable. employees were nice to work with. everyone helped each other.  opportunity for advancement. this is a good job for someone what has not obtained advanced education."
good,There isn't good management. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone who has a life. They do work with school schedule if you attend school. But that's about it.
good,"Walmart could be a great place to work, if this Walmart had the right management team in place.This starts at the top and go down to employees. You have people riding the clock getting pay to do nothing. The store looks dirty all the time, the damages of foods that gets wrote off, the stealing of merchandise that walks out of the store by customers and employees. This store can do better than what it is, but it starts with management."
good,Average day very stressful for lack of enough cashiers to assist customers. Hugh lack of communication between management and associates. Associate feedback is very seldom taken into consideration.
good,My job was fair for my most part. I chose to leave because of the team I was on. Some of the employees constantly harassed me and others. Other then the harassement the job it'self was nice. It was really relaxed.
good,"Lots of hard work , competitive . If you're there long enough you get good benefits. It's fast paced but can be very stressful at times because of other employees"
good,"If you are young and starting out or in need of an odd schedule then this is the company for you.  However, the company has changed radically in the last 15 years and is no longer the same company to work for and the benefits have changed drastically."
good,"People can be fired for anything and everything and nothing . Which happens on almost a daily bases."
good,"No recognition of talent"
good,Upper management is not constant with employees.  A lot of favoritism. Which is not right. Store manager is mean and out of control had no business being a store manager no social skills what so ever flies of the handle just unacceptable.  Don't know who she is still there. No accountability for her actions
good,"If Wal-Mart is your first job or if you are struggling to get on your feet then its a decent place to work. Overall, the company is poorly run. They only give the store so many work hours for each week and expect the limited number of associates to get all the work done otherwise they cut everyone's hours and hire more people. They rarely hire full time associates anymore and even when you have been there they do not offer full time unless you are promoted to department manager. They expect one associate to do the job of 3 people and then scold you and write you up when you don't get it done. They are unorganized, undisciplined and figure since they are so well known and recognized they do not have to work as hard to get customers to shop there. I have been to numerous other retailers who have their stores organized and clean, with well trained employees who actually know their store. They claim to have the lowest prices on everything but I notice I end up shopping at other retailers due to sales even with a decent discount on general merchandise. If you are looking for a job where you never get to spend any time with your family, or get a weekend off (or holiday) you can go into the medical, fire, or law enforcement field or you can work at Wal-Mart."
good,Managers are uptight and some talk down to you. Don't have a set schedule unless you have been there for years and few chances for advancement. Cashiers can spend alot of time cleaning and stocking areas them.
good,"Stressful place to work very cold in winter no heaters, basically have do what they say do your family don't matter here at all.If you are sick it's not a excuse unless your on a dying bed in hospital."
good,"As Management Member, endured extremely long hours & stressful environment, with low pay.  Rewards were the Associates & Customer.  Walmart heavily invests in educating & training Management.  Very diverse culture.  Walmart also very community-oriented."
good,"travel was fun for awhile....but when you work 12+ hrs it tends to take away any fun.  The salary is not worth the time spent.  It was supposed to be a rotating day/night schedule per project, but it never happens and you basically work 12+ at night, sleep a few during the day and then back at it at night.  no work/life balance!"
good,"Walmart was just seasonal it help me build my customer service skills I think .I had a lot of fun working there met nice people and I was told often what a great job I was doing ,yes I would go back and I was offered a position back however,the timing wasn't good for me."
good,"I learned at wal mart tey pick and choose who they want in certain positions. They praise the wrong person and over look the person who did all the work. What I like about walmart is the style of the store , which the  team members create as a  team"
good,"WalMart prides themselves on being family orientented, but in my experience it was far from it. When I was working there I worked a shift that was perfect for me, during the hours that my daughter was in school, didnt have to worry about a baby sitter or anything. After 8 months of working there I was let go because I wouldnt open up my availability and change my shift to fit their needs. I was an outstanding employee, didnt miss any work and was never late. But I was still let go because i wouldnt upset my family for them."
good,"It's a job if you need one but very hard to promote. Favoritism seems to run rampant and hard work is not neccesarily rewarded. Like I said, it's a job if you need one."
good,Walmart as a company is huge causing the employees to be treated like a number. Tire and lube is a good way for an entry level technician can learn the basics such as changing tires and oil.
good,walmart is a great place to work if you don't have family or want to have a life outside of work. the hours are mostly evening shift and if you want to advance you have to pass a dumb managers test to move up and then still pass through the hoops. most of the managers are really nice and understanding but you always have that one at every store that you think has no soul or just don't care. If you have kids i would not recommend working there. if you don't and you want some good retail experience or its your first job you will learn a lot and i would recommend this job for you.
good,There are several issues with this company. But if you find a good store to work at it will make it 100x better. The problem i had was the management and their attitudes towards associates.
good,If your sick or in the hospital you still get pointed. The hours are never the same and are not set hours. One day you can work till midnight just tot turn around and work in the morning the next day
good,the most enjoyable part of my job counseling patients recommending drug substitution to doctors the best technicians well trained upper management has no clue rules do not pertain to them
good,being a cashier is quite demanding at walmart as there are so many customers. working there as a student is always great because they are very flexible with their hours but the salary is completely underrated.
good,"favoritism, no Integrity among upper management , #7356 does not advance from within would rather hire from outside people with No distribution experience rather than Associates already working and doing the job for 2 years or more upper management discriminates ,and a lot of profiling lack if integrity and no unity. other distribution centers rely upon the WALMART WAY ..promoting from within and based on seniority this distribution center does not acknowledge these Walmart procedures and standards."
good,"You do the job of 3 people because the cut corners by cutting hours and people. They play favorites. They don't pay you enough to make a living or pay you enough for the hard work you put in. No overtime. At all. Ever. The management is questionable. A few of them are decent human beings that know Wal-Mart is a total joke, other are power hungry jerks that only care about the almighty dollar. If you're desperate for a job, it's a job. If you can look around for something better, definitely do."
good,Dept mgrs not paid commensurate to job responsibilities.  Not enough equipment to do job.  Senior Management is unprofessional and lacks interpersonal skills to lead teams.
good,"Los de mayor antigüedad establecen jerarquías, excelentes prestaciones pero muy bajo salario"
good,"i like the people i work with at Walmart, i just don't like the managers. they don't want to work with your schedule and they say you can move to a different department after 6 months of employment, but that is not true. at millbrook Walmart they pick and choose who they want to move. even when i explain to them why i want to move to a different department they just come up with excuses. but the pay is great, but i need more hours."
good,you have managers that looking out for them self and you have manager that care for everybody. you learn lot if you find that right person to train you.
good,Great people with great energy. Managers not to bad don't like the point t system though. But everything else is just really great. I like that I stayed busy so the time would go by faster.
good,"My job started as Garden Associate, then I was a basic janitor for lawn and garden. It got to be very stressful, you are required to help customers, but only if the manager of the hour? Day? lets you. Sometimes it was a #$% shot of who is in charge. I never tried for that, I just wanted to work."
good,Little pay to over worked  wasn’t given enough time to finish a task to many task given at once . Wasn’t liking the hours paste or time given . Ur opinion didn’t matter .
good,Walmart Distribution is a warehouse that is climate controlled so it is unlike many warehouse environments. It is however very physically demanding and is not suitable for everyone. They have high expectations of their employees when it comes to attendance and production. The hardest part of my job is the heavy lifting and being on my feet on concrete floors for 12 hours a day. This is why I say it is not for everybody. Management can be very demanding in order to meet goal and at times have no concern for your person needs.
good,"I was a Schneider employee working on the Wallmart Acct. I drove refridgerator and dry van. I found it to be a lot of hours for not enough pay. Schneider treats you fairly well, but doesn't pay very well. The Walmart drivers were making twice what we were making."
good,"Typical day at work included clocking in and having a mandatory meeting before getting the work day started, organizing and stocking shelves and working with others. I learned time management and enjoyed the company I had to work with including most management, the hardest part of the job was having to fix other people's mistakes when it came to stocking and the most enjoyable part of the job was the long lunches and the ability to be trusted to know what to do."
good,"Wal-Mart is not for everyone.  Can be fun, but management is not helpful in terms of making it easy on a day to day basis.  Programs being launched that are not popular with no new training provided to execute"
good,"you have your good and bad days with Walmart, but at the end of the day you feel like management doesn't actually care about the everyday employee. Also your hours very all the time weather you have open availability or not."
good,Hard to get full time work.Health care thrue the roof. Scaddered brain management priorities not set for a fine example car sitting in a bay for 20min for a lube autite a car blocking a bay
good,"My daily responsibilities included unloading trucks, sorting freight, stocking shelves and facing merchandise. I wasn't a particularly hard job. What makes my review of Walmart a low score is their tendency to treat people terrible."
good,I don’t know what really too say about it I did not like it at all the manger was so disrespectful towards me so I don’t have anything nice to say about it
good,enjoyed working with co workers and the general public.  Worked in several departments.  Minimum room for advancement in any management positions.  Enjoyed the discounts when applicable.  They should try to increase their pay
good,empresa muy matada con poca paga pero te enseña muchas cosas y aprendes de todo
good,"Not bad, fast paced which is nice as a cashier because it makes your day go by quickly. Alot of rude customers but obviously comes with the territory. Didn't hate working here."
good,the management needs to be more accommodative of their employees specially when one works so hard  & with all sincereity.
good,I wouldn't recommend this job. It's okay if you need something quick and temporarily. Management is crazy and unfair. They have ridiculous expectations of what your assigned to do. They take forever to help if you have an issue. Leaves an angry customer looking right at you as you wait. Wouldn't go back to that location ever.
good,"It was fast paced and very high energy place to work. There were a lot of meeting new people, and then also doing a lot of moving around. There was always something todo at this job"
good,"The work isn't too hard but sometime you can have a lot to do all at once. The job it self is a good starting job. In some cases if you're looking to make a career out it, it's attainable with time."
good,overall its stressful and constantly expected to work harder than before. some people have an absence counted against them even with a doctors note. enjoyable at some points but don't recommend staying permanently. you'll go insane.
good,"A typical work day can be Hectic, long hours, very stressful. Monitoring, managing and leading a team of over 20+ associates can sometimes be fun as well as extremely hard based on the workload for a particular day. "
good,"If you do not like to work this place is not for you ! You have to be fast paced and be able to lift 20lbs- 40 lbs. The morning shifts are not as crazy as other shifts but your always busy. I learned allot while there including diffrient roles. Some of Management was great they actually listend and tried to help others you wondered how in the world they became a manager. Work Place culture was ok it was like a little family and Every holiday they feed you and decorate the entire store including the break room but it's like high school gossip girls ,drama and cliques and no one stops it. The hardest part of this job is it's very demanding and allot of the time you're understaffed but they expect you to do a 3 person job in a certain ammount of time  thats the hardest. The most enjoyable part Is your Family they really care about you and your regulars are great helping others is great."
good,Just not happy because of what's happening to me at this current time. Just don't think its fair because my status is being taken from me. I've been tranfering over the past few yrs because of my husbands job. And in order to get the transfer this time I have to loose my full time status and benfits
good,"I would not recommend this Walmart in Moundsville to anybody.  the management would not help you out if need a day switch. The management also did not care about anything, like your family, holidays, pay or hours."
good,"Managers are rude and tend to talk down upon you, and if youre the type to respond...This Job isn't for you!!! BEWARE!!!..The money was okay until they started cutting back hours because of theft and money loss, but stay to yourself, do your job, and go home!!!"
good,Good place to work if you have no experience or are looking for part time coming out of school. Fast paced always doing something but you also have to deal with attitudes of customers and management.
good,"If you just wanted to work for a paycheck, walmart was a good idea but if you wanted to be able to have a place where you enjoyed working or that you were hopeful for advancement/raises, i wouldnt suggest it. they do raise people to higher ranks fairly quickly but that is mostly because they had a high turn over rate. the stress alone of constantly going through management people was that everyone had their own opinions on how things were to be ran and no one ever communicated from the different ranks. too many chiefs, not enough indians i noticed. gosh forbid you get hurt at work or a diagnosis they dont like(like Cancer) as they will find a way to not be liable for anything but if they do admit fault or negligence of some form, they will do what they can to fix it"
good,"Never in my life have I seen a place that will ride that hard workers and allow the lazy workers to go on about their way, Management will push everything off on a person so they do not have to work. "
good,There was a management shift in my store which has caused many problems for employees. Availability is not something that is checked so many of us are scheduled on days and times we cannot work. Our manager constantly yells at and berates associates on the front end not only in front of our peers but in front of customers as well. Associates who are lacking at their job are praised and offered promotions when the ones who bust their butts and try to get promoted are told no or are constantly put down. I have been told twice now that I cannot move up nor can I move to a different department by my department manager. Moral is low and many of us are stuck there because we have bills to pay. Corporate doesn't even listen to our concerns. Policies change day to day. None of the management is ever on the same page about how the store is run. It's just a mess at the store and we all feel like our complaints and concerns go unheard.
good,The upper management at Wal-mart just don't seem to care all that much about the people under them.  They want you to do more in a day then can be done.
good,"While I deeply appreciate Walmart hiring me when I needed an income, I do not appreciate how they make their employees ""jump through hoops"", to keep their jobs.  "
good,"The employees are fantastic, they were the reason I hadn’t left the job much sooner. The policies were insanely strict. There was no option to advance within the company at my particular location."
good,"At first, working for Walmart was fun and exciting. After a while, the rules changed and they are less family oriented and all about the money. Associates got promotions and raises because they were favorites of the managers, not because they did a good job at work. People who worked hard were over looked."
good,"The pay was not bad for someone in college and working part time, however, there is no amount big enough to pay me to continue to work for Walmart. Many times I was tested by the public and at times, threatened. The people that shop at Walmart have no respect for the employees or people around them in general. It was very difficultly for me to have a positive attitude at Walmart. Many times I was tested when people would come in and try to steal. If i did not catch the items being stolen, they would come back on me and management would get on to me. I did NOT like feeling this way every time I was on the clock. I was always scared of losing my job =, just because people do not want to pay for their things. I knew I did not need to stay with Walmart after witnessing this situation multiple times. I was good at my job and several employees loved me due to my positive attitude, and ability to pick up shifts, however, every night I went home in a bad mood due to the way I was treated by customers, and the way I was spoke to by customers. Again, Walmart is not a company I would ever stay with."
good,"An overall great job for a high school student or the elderly. Some managers are better than others, but the pay is not worth the stress. Having to do work that is outside of your job description and some times dangerous is not really worth $9.50/he."
good,"Arranging items or products favorable positions in the backroom, "
good,"I am working too hard. Having knee problems, back problems from this job."
good,"I worked jewelry and some of mangers used to lie to get you coached. A typical  day was zoning and doing watch batteries. Very few mangers were respectful or professional, and the co mangers would let them get away with it. I also didn't get graduation off! Hardest part if having to watch your back cause some of the staff will stab you in the back."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. For me, Walmart was never going to be a life time career commitment. It was a good customer service learning experience on how to deal with customers and potential issues that can arise."
good,I work various shifts from opening to closing and mid shifts.  These shifts include stocking and Customer Service.  I enjoy interacting and helping the customers.
good,"Very busy during the days and weekends"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart as a part-time associate. It was simply a job I got before I attended college, it was good for a precollege job. I didn't experience any of the benefits as I was part-time"
good,Running register greeting customers with a smile and making sure they found what they needed. scanning all their merchandise. I learned that customers for the most part are friendly as long as you treat them with respect. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are already angry. The most enjoyable are the customers who appreciate a good cashier and come back just for the interaction.
good,My experience with Walmart was lack of communication between managers.  I experienced conflict between managers concerning what department I was suppose to work in.
good,"Long hours, low pay.  Management treats you like you are stupid, makes you do the work of 3 people. If you need assistance with a project, good luck.  They act like you just are not able to handle anything and talk down to you.  Claim they have ""paid holidays"" and yes you are paid, but have to take an additional day off the week of the holiday to avoid ANY overtime, so no chance of getting a better paycheck that week!  NO overtime allowed any week of any part of the year.  If you have even 1 minute of overtime, you are pulled into the office and ""talked to"" (coached, written up, disciplinary action, etc)  Customer can treat you like shiv and that's okay.  Management does not care as long as they make their money!"
good,Walmart was my least favorite work place. The management was not understanding about my need for time off even though i gave them a 3 month notice....
good,You don't get paid for your time and you're rarely home. Not a good fit of you have a family. I have to to use my vacation time to be off on the weekends to spend time with my kids.
good,"Poor management and lack of motivation to employees. Even though it is possible to do extra hours, there is no salary raise. Limited learning experience."
good,If you opened u would open n do morning prep. Sometimes customers were rude if it didnt go right. Also if they needed cashiers they would pull u n put you on the registers
good,"I was trained to older way. 10 foot rule, take customers to products they are looking for,  personnel are wearing non conforming hair dos, non conforming shirts and pants that are not uniform standard."
good,"Your day is all over the place. Sometimes you work in the morning, sometimes at night. You meet some great friends honestly. Like I said, its a great job to have during school. Not really a career type job."
good,Little to no Management that know what's going on. All the Managers were rude and mean Pretty much no training what so ever. There is a huge cardboard compacter that says on it you need to be a manager and be wearing PPE but when working there Manager don't really care about any safety concerns or employees welfare
good,"It is a fair place to work at if you are still in school. I wouldn't recommend making it a career out of it. Also, depending on where you apply to certain management is ran very poorly."
good,Working for Walmart isn't all bad its just not for everyone. I personally needed more hours and they were not trying to give those hours. They do work good with people in school or second jobs though.
good,I've worked at Walmart for roughly 5 years as much as I don't want to leave the company the management is unbearable I cannot handle the stress and the belittlement from upper management.
good,Do not remember very much about the work environment or employment at Wal-Mart.  It was during a transition period of my life.  I do remember working with plenty of young adults.
good,"always get pulled to do some other job in a different department, not allowing you to finish your task in your department. then later in the day management will ask you why our ask in our departments weren't finished"
good,"we were always worked hard, there was no slowing down. I learned that you have to be consistent with your work, and many other things since walmart was my first job. The management was horrid. Me and my coworkers always felt stressed and were constantly pushed to our limits, and if anything ever went wrong, even if it was due to something out of our control, we still got chewed out for it. The hardest part for me was having to deal with the negative energy that a lot of people came to work with, and having to work overtime so many times and have members of the team leave before the job is done. I have no problem staying later as long as everyone lends a hand to help get done the job that is all of the teams responsibility. Trust me, it is hard making a 30 minute drive to work when you've only had 4 hours of sleep. The thing that got me through it all was the handful of people that i worked with and also got along with. We understood how to work right based on a simple principle. As long as you have my back, I will have your back."
good,"As an overnight stocker, I was assigned an aisle, I was required to make sure the items in that aisle were fully stocked and ready to go at 7am the next day."
good,"Managment will always be a problem here it never seems like they want to help you get a problem solved."
good,es una empresa la cual te permite iniciar la vida laboral.
good,Everything is good at walmart when your a customer. Working behind the scenes was a different ball game. The manager ... Sick as ever rude and unwilling
good,"Management has bad communication. Hours are dropping tremendously. Horrible job security. I was caught in a corner with little to no hours a week having to scavenge for other departments to work at, that or finding another job. It is not fun, and you are required to be able to multitask most of the time."
good,not a career for everyone.   Work most holidays.  Can be stressful and not a positive place to make a career out of.  Wages do not justify the job or everything expected of each associate.
good,"Stressful work enviornment, never wanted to change hours, never gave me a chance to prove myself for an advancement in company.  Whenever I got fired for a no call no show that of which I never had on my attendance before  and told them I had the confirmation number to show that I called in they didn't want to take it.  Now that i'm trying to find different work their blocking every single possible job offer.  So I do not recomment this job to anybody."
good,"We baked , stocked, sale dates on product, clean help with inventory.. we did multiple things. Mark downs chickens etc . We helped other dept if they needed us.set up holiday tables"
good,"Being a service support manager your day starts with a sweep of your tire lube express for safety making sure it is stocked for the day and the proper operation and serviceability of the equipment the employees must use to service customers vehicles."
good,"My typical work day started at 10pm sweeping the store floors, then i would start collecting the cardboard from the unpackers. I would then walk the entire store to pick up palets"
good,I like the people I work with. The pay is not good. I don't get the hours I was promised and I have worked there for 3 years without a raise. It is not a livable salary.
good,I like this job and enjoyed the fast paced demands of the job. But they did not offer me enough hours. this job required group effort which on occasion was a challenge.
good,"I worked there for 10 years, as the years have gone on the mgmnt team has also gone down,standards have gone down, the way you are treated like trash, they don;t care anymore!!"
good,"Walmart can be a difficult place to work. However there are some pros like, discount cards, hour lunch breaks and overall friendly employees. However there are some negatives involved."
good,Working at Walmart is challenging and fast pace. In some occasions it can be hard to balance work/life. Know that due to the nature of business holidays is sometimes hard to enjoy with the family.
good,"They dont train very well.  Management is inconsistent when it comes to policy,  Some managers like to treat employees has if they are a little kid.   Some of the customer service managers play junior high games and are very unprofessional.   It seems the Assistant Managers dont care about the cashier needs or feeling."
good,"Wal-Mart was a nice place to work for,staff was nice ,friendly but under staffed at the time I worked their,a lot of scheduling problems,but the staff was great"
good,"Ja fazem muitos anos que trabalhei, não estaria apta para opinar como esta hoje,"
good,Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves nightly. Very fast paced environment to work at. People are easy to get along with. No benefits and no job advancement.
good,"Each shift that I had was the same as every other shift, clock in, get on register, scan items, bag them, complete the payments, and bid the customer farewell. Nothing stimulating ever occurred for me, and it got boring after a couple months."
good,A typical day at Walmart consisted of me clocking in and then being assisted to a registered. I worked the registered all day.I took a break and a lunch then it was back to the registers
good,The employees and department managers are great but if you get about that in management its terrible. But the enviroment is great and easy going. i loved working there for the most part.
good,the system bearly works and theirs too much training not enough work it gets very boring and does not capture peoples attention you can never get ahold of anyone in store their either busy or turned the volume off on the phones.
good,"shift went by quickly because it was constantly busy, especially on weekends. Breaks were amazing. two 15 mins and one 1 hour lunch. Management was ok, scheduling was good. Switching shifts was easy due to high amount of employees"
good,"Pay is good at first,  but they now only offer a 2% raise every year.  The store manager is stuck up and unapproachable.  They like to make up reasons to fire people and when you use the open door policy it becomes a ""smokescreen"" where the human resources person your talking to will not listen."
good,I had to put up a display for the holidays 20 of them all by myself I used different methods to built them and my manager wanted me to go faster before the end of the shift
good,"Always greetings customers with a smile and see if u can help if needed. Moving any an every harmful object out of the customers way. Reporting to work every scheduled work day"
good,Walmart is a great starter job for anyone who is going to school or just beginning in the work industry. They have great advancement opportunities. Not so good benefits
good,"This place was okay to work at. I didn't feel I had the opportunity to advance even though I was an extremely hard worker. In the end, they don't care about their employees or their community."
good,"Working for this company and hear them talk and say there is room for advancement, but it just that all talk. I really wouldn't recommend working there for any given length of time. Use Wal-Mart as place holder until another job comes along and then get out."
good,"well iguess it was ok but very low pay raises only a dime at a time once or twice a year., with all the money walmart makes it doesn't go to the associats only the managemaet and higher up in the company like ceos and positions like that, all benes are pretty much for the the management team."
good,"I liked Walmart for the most part. I just didn’t like how i was being managed the managers were rude, and the environment wasn’t the best. By the store being located in warrington it wasn’t always great customers."
good,Never trust anyone but a few people and never leave food in the break room or someone will eat it. The managers were terrible and seem like that don't care about anyone but themselves. There was only two cool managers.
good,Walmart isnt a bad place to start out working. They pay a little more than minimum wage and you do learn a lot working for them. But eventually you have to move on as you find that your pay rate wont change much even after working there for a few years. Its hard to raise a family when your getting close to minimum wage.
good,"It is a ok place to work part time. I would not want to work there full time. they are not much on your needs. Pay is ok, but you can't get any hours."
good,Working there wasn't bad. I just didn't think management was on the same page. The team I was on was awesome. We got our job done early and better then expected.
good,I loved my job. But I didn’t like the fact that my manager messed up my transfer. I was trying to move out of state. Due to personal issues and she assured me everything was going to be fine. Got to the new job I was trying to get and none of my information went through.
good,Walmart was a very difficult place to work for. There was very little security in such a dangerous neighborhood. There was also little incentive to work harder than the person next to you.
good,Descent pay for the field of work. Has benefits. Managers are inconsistent on who they offer promotions and allow to move to other areas of the store.
good,"Walmart and there Management is very hard to work for/with. Walmarts rules/policies change often and sometimes are unnecessary. I used to love working for the company in the beginning, my manager was awesome, then he was forced to relocate and we got a new store manager, who changed things drastically and quickly."
good,"Management just never seems to change..  Most enjoyable part is the people you work with on your own level."
good,"I don't tell people I work at Wal-Mart, because the public has an attitude that Wal-Mart employees are not high achievers.  Due to the wages and hours of  work.  I have met some incredible, hard working individual employees while working here and I am very proud to have known them."
good,Running the front end to setting the store departments for new merchandise. How to handle Claims and Invoices while working with hazard waste materials.
good,Working at Walmart is an easy job but sometimes the customers are what make hard. It's also a very repetitive and boring job at least to me. I hate doing the same thing day after day.
good,Overall the company is decent. If you get hired on before or after the holiday season then you have a 90% chance of not being let go after 60 days. management are also a lil hard but they do offer great benefits to full-time employees.
good,Its a good job if you want to get a job but if you want to advance then go somewhere else. They will judge you on the mistakes you make instead of the things you do achieve for them.
good,good place to work when work is needed fast and fair kinda. did the job to pay bills wouldnt go back how ever its hard on a overnight shift with others
good,Wal-Mart can be a good place to work for. There is room for advancement and management will work with your family need to an extent. Over all if you need a job walmart is a starting point.
good,"They don't care about their employees, they will cut your hours just to benefit themselves. The best part of this place was the people you meet. My direct supervisor never would do her job and also denied PTO time if you wanted it paid for lack of coverage and then give it to you unpaid anyways."
good,"I was hired to be a cashier, I was put in the garden dept, very slow paced. I thought I would be a better help in the main cashier's/ checkout area. I asked to be moved and they were very slow about moving me to the main front office. Only had about 3 days training, which I wasn't comfortable alone with register yet."
good,"Just overall a poor experience. All the hard workers go on to work for better places so Walmart promotes the lazy workers. It was fun working with some people, but others, mainly managers, was terrible."
good,"Very interesting Job. I was mainly in the Garden Center, running the register and I would help take the heavy product to a customer's car. The main thing I did not like was the rude customer's, other than that it was okay."
good,"When I started it was in Staunton Virginia. I loved working there. I was over the front end- casheris, electronics ect. Then I transfered to a Metro store."
good,"Started off with good staff and management, but cutt-throating moved the productive people and replaced managers with condescending back-stabbers. Unfortunately, the good managers paid the price for that culture.of selfishness."
good,"There was not enough people to work in this department "
good,"Originally I began working for Walmart as a Ship from store Employee. This means I filled and processed online orders. I would receive orders and ""pick"" them from the floor. Scan items into the system and pack them in boxes. Then place them one pallets to be shipped. I worked a late shift with no direct supervisor. I wrapped and pulled pallets, mostly on my own. This became to strenuous on me and my family so I transferred to Cashier. "
good,"a typical day at work consisted anywhere from 7 to 8 hours in where you stood on your feet. What I did not enjoy about the job, was rude customers. I enjoyed checking customers out in a speedy and courteous manner as well."
good,it was not a great work experience but it wasn't horrible ether.  the most glaring problem for walmart is the lack of raises and promotion. for example if I'm working for $8.00 and I get my annual raise that can be anywhere from $.25 to $1.00 per hour. During my time there I don't know of anyone who got more then a $.25 raise no matter how out standing an employee you were.
good,"My job is working in customer service, this is were I work with all most everybody that comes  through the door. I deal with all transaction most of them are returns and exchanges. I also deals with check cashing and paying bills."
good,"The job wasn't the best for a first job going in, but it got the bills paid. I had a very smooth day usually unless one of the managers had a bad day. The hardest part about my job was trying to keep my work pace in satisfactory conditions for the managers."
good,"Boa empresa, porém sem equilíbrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal."
good,"Clock in, find out what your CSM wants you to do and where to go, check out customers, greet them, most enjoyable part of the day is the customers, management is okay when they want to be"
good,"Empresa boa porém vida social 0 , não havia benefícios somente salário , dias de feriados e domingos iam para banco de horas e pegava como folgas somente quando encarregado decidia"
good,"Wal mart is a good place to work if you don't really want to advance to a different job. Very rarely do they reward loyalty to the company and rather reward loyalty to certain managers. On the mod team we set new modulars and move product, and sometimes are pulled to stock shelves or other things since third shift is also very small staffed. The hardest part of the job is the lack of recognition for hard work and watching others who are less qualified get promotions simply based on being friends with managers."
good,They need to pay there employees better and give more opportunity for full time. And noticed the change in performancce that s are making. Understand that some people have kids and can't always work closing shifts
good,It was my first job and it wasn't a great experience. I was currently in high school and didn't have a set schedule and it was very hard to get in touch with the manager so I could schedule more hours. It's a good job but the management needed improvement.
good,Working Packing Shoes for store orders. Placing labels on boxes and scanning whats needed for that store . Shipping out boxes to the store of orders that are fulfilled.
good,Working in the garden department was a very enjoyable experience always something different everyday. I also worked in the bakery department you really did the same thing everyday
good,"Walmart is your typical retain job. This means variable hours, part time, and either too demanding or too flexible depending on the season. Overall i enjoyed working for a busy store, but on occasion we would be required to place attention elsewhere even when  that did not meet the needs of the customer. On average the managers are okay, but some did nothing but walk around and pretend to be important."
good,"First and foremost, day shift gets away with slacking off and pushing their work onto 3rd shift to do, in addition to all their own work. If you work overnight, be prepared to feel like you can't win even if do get everything done. They will just want you to do more and more. They drag their feet when it comes to letting you transfer to another store, and they drag their feet even more when it comes to fixing discrepancies with your pay. Its frustrating and oftentimes stressful, but you definitely will stay busy your whole shift if you're doing your job right. I prefer to remain busy, rather than just be looking for busy work, so that was a plus."
good,"Typical Day at Work: Given a stack of papers, replace tags and shelves."
good,"They did not have any training material, on the job training was terrible, after 1 1/2 years I was still struggling to do my job to my standards, I was constantly being told just ask questions, well there was employees that had been there for 4 plus years that were still struggling. I did not enjoy working that way."
good,"My experience with walmart was with terrible managers. They do not respond to threats to employees and force them to stay in unsafe positions. Managers also tended to block emergency exits with pallets and stock. Benefits were good, but overall the job was very manual."
good,I enjoyed being able to show my layers on this job by working in different areas of the store which was excellent. I learn from this job that you can have open door policy with your supervior can be a good thing. Management was really nice and helpful. I liked the workplace culture for sure. I enjoy this job it was just time to move forward in my life.
good,Needs to have better leadership. Wages were not matching the job and the duties. Over worked and underpaid were the major complaints. Great people got comfortable with just having a job.
good,Loved my job at Walmart. Hated how we was always short hand and how management ran things and would have you doing their job and not want to pay you for it. No-one there really knew the policy it was always different things from every manager.
good,"Wouldn't consider this a forever job, just something to pay the bills. It was okay working there just got tired of it quickly and I'm glad to be leaving honestly."
good,"- A typical work night at Walmart would consist of clocking in for my shift, attending our staff meetings, and discussing concerns or questions with our managers, having separate maintenance meetings, and going about our assigned tasks with the fair number of breaks in between."
good,hard work with little pay.  This was a temporary holiday job and I appreciated the extra income especially around Christimes Time.  It was fun working around people and around Xmas merchandise.
good,With the last bakery assistant manager I feel like walmart was a hostel work environment. I did not approve of being treated the way I was by the management.
good,"the pay is fine and you get a lot of hours but walmart doesn't exactly treat employees right. At my store particularly, there was a lot of things that went on that weren't right."
good,I enjoyed this job very much. The workers were friendly. there was always something to do. Also got a discount on certain store items. easy to call in to work also
good,Breaking Walmarts policy is their policy how is it that you worked an 8 hour shift or more and you don't even get your breaks how is it that going on 4 years bleeding for this company they decide to let you go because your management team can do their job an communicate with you about the hours that are left in the intermediate leave last thing they said you are not getting fire well guess what they fired me with out a valid reason so good luck be ready to be walmarts next pet that's if you want to keep your job
good,Once you get to know the store its pretty easy to get the job done. Personally my schedule is not consistent and it is next to impossible to support my family with what I am making now.
good,"Typical day is following their checklists and routines.  Corporate dictated.  No room to do what is needed in an individual store.  If you spend too much time on one area of concern you get coached.  Market and Regional AP come in and nit pick idiotic things.  Walmarts AP program is a useless bunch of paperwork that should be done by operations.  If your store has a bad inventory they will never admit it's because you cant focus on what's needed,but tell you, you must not be doing the checklists."
good,Wal-Mart is not a bad company to work for but you have to love retail there are many of other opportunities within Wal-Mart however you will be required to learn about all of the different aspects of retail and how to operate as a general associate
good,"Management was the biggest problem.  From one month to the next you never knew who was going to be your manager. Most of the time they were poor and were only there to promote themselves.  The store I worked was the worst store in the region and I believe they sent all their poor managers there to get rid of them, because most were fired. Cliques in the front end of the store [CSN's] If you crossed them you would pay for it, especially if you went over their heads to complain. I quit because of a manager who was harassing me and a employee who was snitching to her."
good,No one wants to come in to work due to poor management. Once you get into a management position its like your at a stand still as if your not trying to move up anymore.
good,this job isnt for people with kids or a second job they change your schedule with 48 hours notice so its hard to have a second job because this job is unpredictable
good,I think that manager are out to get other manager abd they like to stab other mansger in the back. I think that the manager should stick behind you and work with you and the co-manger dont come to your area
good,Its a great Beginning Job for any High Schooler or someone who is content with their small town life. Its Engaging and Fun to work with work Opportunities are available I loved working here it just isn't an income that is suitable for today's day and age
good,"Wal-mart pyramid scheme is not something I approve of. The L1's work extremely too hard for the minimal pay that they get. On top of the assistant managers thinking they are above the law, its not a place I ever want to work again."
good,coworkers are nice and friendly but the hours and organising of them was hard to keep up with and they were not flexible with my class schedule so i had to leave
good,"Busy and stresseful."
good,lots of hardworking people but incentives from company are gone and insurance costs have gone up with rising deductibles. Required to do your job plus others to compensate for lowered employee numbers
good,"At my particular store, there is no base average day. One day may be good and the next awful. Some newly hired associates are incredibly lazy and if you've been there long enough, you get away with nearly anything. Management is 50/50. Some days I enjoy my job, and other days I have to really try not to allow myself to walk out of the store and never look back."
good,Like I said in the summary good people but poor management. people are constantly working the system.And they get away with it. I tried to play by the rules and I feel as though they want me out as fast as possible.
good,Bad management only one good one. Annoying co-workers that cause drama on your first day. Stressful work load when others don't do their jobs its put on you. Management cuts hours for fun.
good,"I mean, it was a good job for what it was worth. I didn't hate my time there. I do wish that they would make more consistent schedules or raise the pay, because there were weeks I would only be scheduled for two day."
good,"The work load was overly excessive at times, there was not enough employees and they'd expect you to work twice as hard and fast to get your area done as well as others. The management was horrible other than a couple of good managers that actually helped with the workload."
good,In the beginning it was a great place to work. Good pay with lots of perks and benefits. Slowly all the perks have disappeared and the pay rate has slowed dramatically. I made the same per hour that a new hire would coming in and that's minimum wage. Only reason I stay with this company is because I'm getting older and work is hard to find. Definitely do not recommend employment with them.
good,I enjoy the fact that i get to meet a lot of people in this job but unfortunately the hours as a cashier are to inconsistent and unless you are full time you get no benefits.
good,Typical work day consisted of multiple departments while understaffed. Hard to get in contact with management and they never seemed to really care besides a few.
good,"I've worked for Walmart almost 10 years. It is an okay company to work at but it could be so much better if it weren't for poor management generally speaking across the board. Also it is a very stressful place to work. You deal with very nasty customers, you don't have a good personal life/work life balance, and also cutthroat management and sometimes coworkers.  It is okay for some, but if you can find something better, by all means do so."
good,Don't expect to be treated fairly. There will be unrealistic expectations placed on your shoulders and you'll be belittled when you don't get your job done because they placed a five person job on just you and want it done in an hour. But just because this Walmart is like this doesn't mean they all will be. See for yourself.
good,"Working at Walmart is stressful, you never know what you are going to be doing when you come in. Management is not that great, they don't listen to you when you voice your opinion or give new ideas. the friends you work with make it a fun place to work."
good,"Walmart was/is highly competitive"
good,it was as great company they dont respect the employees and i honestly love working with people and having a great while im working life is great when your providing for your family
good,"Great place to work but will fire  you in a heartbeat.learned so much "
good,"Walmart is where I learn most of my retail experience and was given a chance at advancing in Depts, Good working inviroment and Fair management. Always great customer service."
good,"This is something you can not hold on to forever. I would just say this is a temporary job. Have a back up just in case. Hours get docked, watch what you do here they do not play around."
good,"The management at Walmart it's really bad, most of them don't know how to be a manager, they overworked people, and not recognized the hard work also bunch of lies in promotion."
good,Manager seek my opinion as to what soft-lines should be delivered to the floor.  I tend to motivate co-workers to complete a certain number of pallets to get all product on the floor and on the shelves.  Management takes interest in promoting hard workers.  The hardest part of my job is keeping co-workers motivated.
good,"A typical day at work consist of dealing with customers all day. "
good,"Aprendizaje constante, no necesitas un título de licenciatura o una maestría para ser gerente, realmente los estudios No cuentan, lo.importante es que no faltes, seas puntual, cubras las horas extras. En cedis se trabaja 12 por 12 en temporada. Ya sea entrar a las 6 de la tarde y salir a las 6 de la mañana. Son horarios pesados. Pero si tienes la oportunidad de crecer en tu aprendizaje en areas administrativas y operativas."
good,"Working for Walmart has not been fun. The hours are great but the employees can really be mean. Very rude, inconsiderate, and lazy. However, you get a good amount of time for your breaks as well as discounts on already great sales."
good,I do love my job at Walmart but it can be very hard at times sometimes the pay is good but not all the time ...... it has been a great time there but I am now looking for job number 2 to pay my bills
good,"Been so long ago I don't really remember too much of the place other than the pay was terrible for an adult,  $8 a hour is not enough, at the time I had a sick kid who was sick alot, required a large number of surgeries, manager was a little crazy at the time and did not understand that I had to take off for this, actually used it against me when it came to evaluation time so I didn't get a full raise like I should have"
good,"Walmart is a company that has lots of room for advancement, but it may take awhile to happen. They do pay a descent salary once someone reaches management, but with pay increase  comes more drama. Most days you are lucky to get a break on time."
good,"There was no manager and the supervisor was barely their , and she barely wanted to help anyone when assistance was needed , i overall did not enjoy.."
good,I noticed a lot of different things while working at Walmart. The management is POOR. you tell the manager something and he goes back and tell the assistant manager. The managers also used to sit and talk to other employers to keep them from working while everyone else was working hard. I'ts not fair at all.
good,i work at wal mart supermarket on north slappey in albany ga. The store manager is Jason . Our overnight support manager is very abusive of his authority. He has access to one of the Assistant managers on day shift password and username to access our schedule and other personal information. He has been late for work hours at a time and the store manager does not follow the policy and he chooses to get another associate still on the clock to leaved and ride with him to the support managers residence to wake him up.
good,Like high school all over again. Unfair management. Pay was good. They made things harder than it had to be. They didn't really care about the workers. As long as they made their money nothing else mattered.
good,"Working at Walmart was a short time. It was busy at night. Customers would make a mess of every shelf and leave major work for the employees. "
good,not a place to make a long time career out of. They say they work with you well they dont really. They are only about the money . Not for their workers lie they say
good,"Good job for an hardworking person ready to work hard daily. They will get there moneys worth from your work, great benefits as well. short work weeks, 3 on 4 off or 4 on 3 off."
good,"very friendly workers, very stressful, small hour with more than 40 hours. too many customer walk for my help I walk with them to department and must finish tasks."
good,Poor management skills they don't truely care about there associate needs . not alot of room to move up in company do to favoritism things like that it's not right
good,It's a fun environment but would make me do heavy stuff while everyone new I was pregnant. Had to quit for mine and my baby's safety. Need to work on how they schedule lunch and break times.
good,"Working at walmart was at first fun and exciting. Then with so much turnover of management the store began to decline. Moral had turned quickly downward and with the lack of support emploees were leaving and/or walking out. When we did get management in, things got worse. We got micormanaged to the point my job was horrible, stressing and i did not want to go to work. Our manager for the front end did not care about the front end. in fact her main goal was to rid the front end of long term employees who had been there for many years."
good,"Management never thanks you for your work, just tells you to do more and more, this and that. Never any appreciation. They also gang up with each other, barely "" open door policy "", and gang up with certain employees if you have an issue and report it. I was excited about working there but once they fired me for going over my attendance a bit after making me work 7 day shifts, i was glad i left."
good,"this work place is very stressful and full of cutthroat people who don't care about you or your well being, overall the customers or the cest part about working for walmart."
good,the company and the team of the company does a great job at servicing the customer and to make them feel welcomed in the store as well as to help with there needs
good,"The shifts are the worst. Walmart likes to schedule associates until 11pm and the next day at 7am. management at etters was unreasonable and condescending to associates, didn't listen to concerns at all, and made you feel  like an idiot for even bringing your concern to them. a typical day is busy and fast paced. the pay and benefits are decent but management makes you feel disposable and unappreciated for your hard work.I loved my job but not the management"
good,"Management can be rude and corporation will suck the life out of you for little pay. High turnover. They got rid of a lot of seniority benefits and will replace long term employees for someone who they can pay a lot less.  Working in the pharmacy is super stressful and you get pressure from all sides (everything you do will never be enough): patients, store management, corporate agenda, time, accuracy, safety, sanity."
good,"There is a lack of communication between everyone in the store. That comes with associates, and managers, as well as assistance. The store itself is great but the expectations for the day are not feasible. It comes with the fact that no one cares about what is going on in the day to day progress of anyones day."
good,It's been 15 years since I worked at this company so I hope the culture and pay has changed.I hate to review a company I haven't worked for in so long.
good,My work experience here has and is still not what I had imagined. I have witnessed people being physically abused and I am myself as well abused. It is a great place to start for your first time but not as a long term job.
good,"For anyone starting off in the workforce, this is a great job. However, I wouldn't recommend it for people in the long-term. I will say that Wal-Mart definitely rekindled the flame of my ambition to do greater things such as finish my bachelor's degree and find another job that pays well and gives proper breaks. The work isn't hard however, the management makes it difficult with the constant changes of rules and regulations which makes it harder for us as employers. Management seems to only care about the numbers rather than its' employers."
good,I loved my job and co-workers at Walmart however upper management was not organized and which made Lower management suffer. The schedule was often under staffed making it very hard to operate in a sufficient manner.
good,"I've been there for almost a year and it's getting tiring. The managers are catty and lowdown as well as inconsiderate .. (FOR MY LOCATION) it feels like High School, so beware. What I do is easy so it's okay,but people are just very counterproductive and petty. I don't feel appreciated,and a few others feel the same."
good,Wal-Mart isn't a terrible place to work. I think things need to be changed however. I think they need to figure out a different way to unload trucks and stock shelves. I also think pay should be higher.
good,Management does not have knowledge of how to use equipment around the store. Little consideration given when needing time off for school needs. Hours are not regular and given minimum amount of hours allowed. Pay raises are not given out fairly.
good,His is the worst job I've ever had and I've only had two. This was my first job and it's suffice to say that it's probably the worst one I'll have in a long while. Management are unreceptive and unwilling to accommodate your schedule. I didn't have a direct supervisor for Atleast 4 months. I would definitely consider  not working here again.
good,"The workplace was easy going and the customers were always positive and delightful. "
good,they cut all the benefits this is a job for a teeneager in collage or fresh out of high school no kids you cannot survive at this job no holiday pay or bonouses
good,"It really depends on where you land in the Walmart Workforce. If your team is gold, you're set for a good life. If not, then be prepared to be worked hard and put away wet. There are days where it's worth it to be a pharmacy tech for this company. They treat you better than other retail pharmacies and their system database is solid."
good,Started out as a cashier very quickly moved to a department than made a department manager. Enjoyed the competitive spirit in the location. Also helping and recommending products to customers was a highlight of the job.
good,"Your experience will change dramatically depending on your location and job title. As the culture is a little different  at every store or  distribution center. However three things will always be the same,"
good,Did not like the work schedule. It was to stressful trying to manage the work week with a babysitter because the hours were all over. The other employees were disrespectful of each other. No one was willing to help each other like most work environments are supposed to be.
good,It was great until they got a new leadership in my team.  The outsourcing and re-badging needs to stop.  The work environment got way too stressful beginning of July 2017 and the future of the team appears uncertain.
good,As long as you are doing your job everything is good.  Management does not hover.  The benefits package has something for everyone.  If you have an issue someone is always around to help.
good,"fast pace"
good,i love to work at Walmart i like to work but Walmart do not like to pay i need someone to pay me a good check so i can make my life good and stay healthy i do what ever im told i work fast i keep the freezer  fully stocked and food at rite temp  and i keep the customer happy and safe and wanting to return
good,Work space where you are expected to go above and beyond the aspect of your respective department's duties. Management simply pass off their tasks off to the nearest associate so they can break free.
good,"a few people in the management aren't good at all, not paid fairly; as there is too much of work load and less pay in comparison to work. although the environment is really good."
good,"You have to have a resilient personality and an upbeat personality to work there. If you can do long hours on your feet in an environment where you aren't treated like a person but like a machine instead, you would do alright. Even though I'm an extrovert, the whole experience was very exhausting, despite how ""easy"" the physical part of the job was.  Not a bad place to get retail experience but I don't recommend as a career."
good,Lets just say in my state I have been working here 5 years and minimum wage went up $1 each year for 3 years the new hires in my department get paid more than i do. CEO doesnt care about its workers
good,they need improvement in management and how they treat employees. they also need to improve the the atmosphere the employees work in and engage the employees more
good,"decent work, always enough to keep o=you busy and occupied for 8 hours. the management was really nice and helpful and did their best to work with you. i enjoyed being able to work in multiple departments"
good,The typical day varies due to paydays holidays ect. Most days the managment has their favorites who they will help with anything but others are left on their own to figure it out.
good,I was a overnight stocker so there isn't really too much to explain. The job really didn't have too many requirements and for a first job is ok but thats it
good,"There were so many issues at WalMart with managers, employees, and the customers. Each day it was easy to wonder or worry what was going to happen today. I worked in the back room doing inventory in Greensboro, NC and I loved it. I worked at my own pace and worked with the department managers or lead people. I started with WalMart working in the Deli. I was glad to leave the Deli to go work in Inventory. WalMart did transfer me to the store in St. Petersburg when I moved back here from Greensboro. I was assigned to working in the back room unloading the trucks. I thought I was going to get back with the Inventory crew. I unloaded the trucks for as long as it took before I was finally transferred to the Deli"
good,"It was a part time, after school job.  They paid just above minimum wage.  There were no benefits and no time off.  They gave 2 breaks and an unpaid hour lunch.  They forced you to take the hour lunch.  If you worked more hours than 40, they forced you to take a longer lunch.  Due to a lack of help at the time, I often took 2-hour lunches.  It was really bad since most of my school work was on a computer or in a lab, so I was stuck doing nothing for 2 hours."
good,"My experience with Walmart has been a love hate relationship, I have had a huge problem with the management team that I work with. Walmart as a whole has been a pretty good work environment,  excluding management, so much so that i have endured my feelings towards mgmt to preserve the friendships I've made at the store"
good,A very productive day in the deli is usually hectic. You had to be at communicating with the customers and your co-workers to have a good work environment. Keeping the food fresh was a must.
good,"Throughout the months I worked at walmart, I would have to say it was the worst place. The managers walked around like they owned the place and would sometimes ignore us when we needed help. The other cashiers were not so bad, but the managers made it horrible."
good,"You have to come in and check your schedule. If your on the floor, you work in a specific department. Cashier are the most flexible job in there. You follow a modular to do the work."
good,"It's alright the area where u work makes a big difference, Move around until your comfortable. That being said the people that you work around can either make or break your experience."
good,Walmart is not something most people would want to do for a living as the hours are sparatic and you have no life working for this company never enough people to cover shifts
good,"was a fun place to work, the staff members were all very nice, management was hard to communicate with and was hardly around. clean store with decent sized staff room and lockers,"
good,The majority of the information learned was self taught and being there taught my how to be quick on my feet. It is very fast paced and there is always something to do.
good,"Management can be good one day, and confusing the next.  You need to be willing to flip on the dime at that store, or you could get into trouble.  The hardest part of the job is keeping your cool when the customers are rude and the manager blame you for it.  If you can handle all that, then you should do fine."
good,"a day at walmart is full of customer service and friendly associates."
good,"walmart is a good place to work if you are a people person.I personally am a people person so I really like this job, the scheduling was rough at first because my availability was messed with for a few weeks but we got that ironed out, if you get sick with strep adn your out for a week your in big trouble tho, you only get 4 points than your out. so be mindful of that. the work atmosphere is kinda great tho, a great energy and he managers are awsome."
good,managers are very disrespectful towards employees. The store is hot year round. Management does not know how to schedule the right amount of employees to get through the work day
good,Mostly they rely more on favoritism than on actual job performance when it comes to advancement and receiving more hours. They no longer do holiday pay so you work longer and harder during the holidays for nothing. They stopped giving raises every year for job performance.
good,"Thankful for the experience , Wasnt a hard job very easy and laid back . I also learned to work as a cashier and because of this i have Cashier experience as well."
good,"Working for walmart was an experience.  My job description was to always stay productive, and make sure every customer i seen had an wonderful experience and was satisfied after leaving the store. Working there I have never received an customer complaint, but always received an compliment from an customer on my smile, my patient's, and also my dedication to help them find what they are looking for."
good,"stressful since you arrive because you need to make production, management always varies because they switch managers every 6 months and sometimes the managers have no clue how to manage there area"
good,"It is a great place to work, very comfortable, everyone knows everyone. Most of the management/supervisor team is easy to get along with. You have your little cliques, like all jobs have."
good,It's a job and not all Walmarts are the same. It's not as much Walmart as some of its management team where I was employed. If the bad ones were weeded out it would be a better place to work.
good,Walmart has great potential for growth within the company. They have the wealth and the authority to invest more into their employees thus allowing the employees to feel needed and important. If the company were to make the employees feel more appreciated the employees would guarantee success. Success within the company and the employee turn over.
good,"Walmart expected too much from me and took advantage of the fact that I was a hard worker and managers never did anything about unfair workload balance. I was definitely one of the hardest workers and eventually they ended up giving newer employees who knew far less and worked far less than me a bigger pay check for the same hours worked. Very unfair, very unorganized, very unprofessional."
good,"a typical day at Walmart for me is to get up at 4 am to be there at 5 so I can start throwing the truck and sorting it into the proper bins and sections. after that I have to take out trash, clean the back room, take all pallets to the back of the store, take care of throw away and feed america lunch is around ten in the morning. after lunch I will either help on the floor or stay in the back room to make sure it is ready for the next days truck and finally scrub the floor and go home at 2 pm."
good,"There is a strong sense that everybody is in it for themselves. While Walmart has the resources to bring in top talents around the world, it has yet to learn how to keep these talents. The advancement opportunities are challenging to say the least;  ranks, status, and class are extremely important as much as they tell you otherwise; innovation from the rank and file are not embraced, but once the senior management decided something has to be done it is their way or highway. The ""open door policy"" is a joke. You will be thrown out the door if you ever dare to challenge your management for their wrong doing or dishonesty. In my two years I have seen at least 12 rounds of layoffs at this company. Too much instability and uncertainty."
good,"Well I enjoyed working there for the last couple of years, I just feel i'm underpaid and new employees that are just stating get paid way more then me the supervisors there are very messy and are not confidential. The hardest part of my job is going there every day making sure every one work is done plus mine and the most enjoyable part is that I still have a job and I'm able to pay the little bills I have."
good,You have to know people to advance here. You also get a lot of pressure put on you if you ever work in the Toy department due to the fact that no one would zone then when you get there you're cleaning up a mess that's been there a whole shift.
good,"I've previously worked at Walmart as a Overnight Stocker, but then became apart of a Overnight Remodel team at a different Walmart. Management was a joke. Two supervisors would stand in the same spot drinking there soft drinks. Getting on people because they didn't know what to do because they aren't being told what to do. Even management didn't know what to do."
good,Management is not very capable. A workload of 2+ people is required of a single associate. Other workers are easy to get along with but there is a lot of gossiping.
good,Good part-time position for a young person. No room for advancement. Little to no communication. But good hours and experience for a young person as a first job
good,"Very high stress,too many managers and not enough workers to accomplish what needs to be done everyday.Very little appreciation for work accomplishments."
good,"Thankless hard work with customers or managers yelling at you."
good,Hard on workers.  The workers that do work don't get credit.  The ones that don't nothing happens.  The night shift is always short handed.  Very hard getting time off until recently.  Even if you have vacation time.
good,"A typical day at work was being bored out of my mind because ours was a small store and very few customers actually shop their. My duties included cashier work, as well as fulfilling 1-Hour service at the Photo Lab (taking orders, turning film into photos, helping customers at the kiosks, selling cameras, etc)."
good,my experience at Walmart was ok. the managers aren't helpful at all but my coworkers made it better. its a job and if you get enough hours decent money.
good,"Good place to work , friendly people. Nice place to meet new people. Cool working   Environment  , manager are nice "
good,Wal-mart is a great company that offers some great opportunities. They offer a 10% discount for employees as well as some stock options depending on the status of the associate.
good,working at Walmart i would go into my department and immediately start answering the phones or letting customers into the fitting room. i learned a lot about how to answer phone  calls from customers and i learned a lot about the different departments to help navigate for customers. It was pretty easy to communicate with management daily on phone calls and to get help for customers. The hardest part I believe would be at night fixing all the merch after a long day. I enjoyed answering the phone and using the walkie to talk to management. It was easy and i learned the number as soon as i could.
good,"Majority of the time the management are willing to listen and to help you, but usually you have to be best friends with them too. The people who are the most willing to go in and put their time in to get a paycheck and leave will not prosper at Walmart. You have to be willing to make alliances with your coworkers because they are the ones that will calm you down and keep you sane when customers, management, or other coworkers get on your last nerve; and they most certainly will on an almost hourly rate. I did enjoy my time with this company and would be willing to return in a heartbeat, you just have to know how to let things roll off your shoulder and not get to you, but that is the nature of retail in general. People will be people."
good,"A lot of people fresh out of high school (some still in it). This of course means: lots and lots of drama, laziness, and horrible management. This is of course everyday. I learned how to use a RF Scanner. The hardest part of the day... is getting through it. There is no joy, just puppets. The really sad part is that those high schoolers are also your managers and clearly don't know what they're doing."
good,"Un trabajo que te enseña a trabajar bajo presión, convives con muchas personas y aprendes a valorar lo que ganas."
good,Easy job unload trucks then take merchandise out on floor and stock shelfs managers were nice most coworkers were lazy but had 2 breaks and a hour lunch
good,Management skills are very poor as well as their training skills. Open door policy needs to be more confidential between associate and manager. Mangers should never talk down to other employees in front of other associates.
good,Assist customers in all things electronics answer any questions or concerns they may have and just to provide basic knowledge on the products in my dept.
good,They over work you and then the managers have bad communication. They have 8 different people telling you different stuff. They want good quality work but they don't want you to get overtime
good,all of the work was left upon the overnight stocker. You have to stock for 6-7 hours then rush and clean the mess the other shifts have left for you. If you can handle dealing with alot of mess. This is the job for you.
good,Personnel are great and some of the managers are also. They should work on their attendance policy though. Attendance IS important but 3 days in 6 months can be difficult to follow when you're in an area working with fresh food. They should at least cross-town you when hired on so you have the opportunity to still work and not got others sick and not waste your sick days.
good,buen ambiente  laboral gente bastante humilde deben seguir haci
good,A typical day is clock in operate register complete any any computer base studies or simulations hard part of the job nothing the most enjoyable was the customers
good,High stress pharmacy job.  Worked 10-12 hours a shift.  Got paid for 8.  Little gratitude from upper management.  Always made to feel worthless.  Store management would want you to break laws to please customers
good,"Promotions are not based on experience or qualifications, but based upon who you know and who likes you. Awful hours and work/life balance is practically non-existent. The company doesn't listen to its workers and doesn't really care about you as part of the team. Upper management doesn't do their jobs at ALL. They wont do their one-on-ones or help you with your IDP. They dont want to see you advance."
good,A typical day at work was to come in. we would get the trucks that bring all the fresh Produce we would take all that off the trucks stock it in the fridge or cabinet where it suppose to go. Then we Stock the produce that was out and low and we would take away anything that was bad or outdated and clams it out
good,Great  starter job and comparable pay. Must be flexible to change. Paid break and 1 hour lunch. Lenient attendance policy. Has several areas to work in and will give opportunities for growth.
good,"Your supervision and management is, basically, a joke. Your CSM's will talk to you as if they're Superior and better than you, but your coworkers make the day go by better."
good,This work place is extremely stressful. There are to many managers and supervisors giving different directions. It is very confusing at times. There is no consistency.
good,Didn't like the job. Some department managers were on power trips and not interested in training or making others successful for future positions. They used workers to do what they didn't want to do themselves.
good,"In the various stores I've worked in, management never seems to work WITH you to ensure a happy environment. They would rather set unrealistic expectations and then write you up for inability to achieve said goals."
good,"Walmart was hands down the worst job I've ever had. The ""management"" didn't care about the employees. Walmart doesn't seem to care about their employees. They only care about lining their own pockets."
good,It was a very good company to work for and I wish I still did but I had to move away to Baltimore. a typical day I would restock the meat wall. then do other stuff
good,"Fast paste work environment, great people to work with and the customers make the day go by interesting. Typically cleaning, handling money, computer work, and dealing with customers 24/7."
good,"It's a pretty good job, if a job is all you're looking for. You don't get a lot of respect from management. Very stressful work environment. It's really a toss up on if you'll get good hours on your check or not. It's rewarding though when you get through a tough work day. Some of the management is really good and will help you but normally they will just tell you what to do and just leave you. I wasn't even formally trained on half the stuff that I did. But if you just want a job that will make it paycheck to paycheck then itll work for you. If you are looking to advance then I wouldn't suggest it."
good,Walmart is changing for the worst when it come to the way they treat their employees. Management will write you up for petty reasons because they are told no one is perfect. Gong Show
good,I worked as a cashier here i koved every moment there i met new people great managment i dealt with money & checked customers. I also greeted customers.
good,"There is a scholarship program that exists, but if you are a student they give a hard time about closing your availability to attend school. Mngmnt was hit or miss. Meaning that there were some really awesome managers that wanted their employees to have a work/family balance. They never stayed long because other managers claimed false accusations. If you were hard working and willing to help in any dept, then you got taken advantage of."
good,"They wouldnt work with my school schedule, management was a joke, i dont really miss it at all. Pay was kind of cheap too. "
good,when i say unpredictable i mean it. you don't know what to expect by the hour. never a due moment. i learned a lot from this job that i use everyday in life . patience is the key to this job . i grew with this job .
good,"I would induct, putwall, and pack orders for delivery. I felt that they treat employees as less than because it was a temp agency. Unprofessional staff and leaders.I learned how to work in a warehouse which wasn't in my career background."
good,Very stressful between customers \\ management \\ employees. Its also full of drama all round. Not a fast paced work place. They are not very good on management...
good,"16-70 routes shipped out on shift depending on time of year."
good,this store is different from the one I worked for in Santa Fe and they do not like it when you have family emergencies and you cant make it in they don't give you a second chance and they prefer to work only with people they know some of the managers are hostle
good,"A typical day at work is overwhelming at times. Learned to be patient. Management is ok, need more work and patience with others. Hardest part of the job is staying awake working overnights. i enjoyed meeting new people."
good,Empresa boa pra trabalha aprendi muita coisa tudo que eu sei aprendi no Walmart
good,"I didn't like working at Walmart because they told me I would be working cashier and they wouldn't need me to do anything else, nonetheless I was doing everything but my job and I wasn't getting paid for the work I was doing, getting paid as a cashier doing stockers work."
good,Lots of work with very little other co workers to help. Can only advance if you are one of the managers favorites. If a person is a hard worker and wants to advance it is not a good place to work.
good,Very stable work too many cheifs not enough indians to keep it short pay is not good enough for the hours and management you have to deal with and of course retail they have you there 24/7 and im a family man they make it very clear they as a company could care less
good,Safety classes forklift driving use of safety tools general labor and Contracting decent scheduling no full-time. No opportunity for advancement I hope to have better experiences at different companies
good,This is not the best company to work for. The pay was good a few years ago not the just star people at minimum wage and also try to work the heck out of you for low wages.
good,Too many chiefs at this location. Highly unorganized. Could not even speak with the store manager about issues. Coerced me to work before legally doing so.
good,Ok job pay not so good and barely was getting hours .. sometimes over work and management was lousy at there job . Didn't care about there workers safety or well being
good,i liked my job but then i moved away and didnt come back for a few years i shop at walmart alot i like the prices the cashiers are not friendly but i still shop there
good,I loved my coworkers. They made me so comfortable with it being my first job but everything else was a mess. The managers were horrible and seemed to have their favorites as to whom got to do what. Whenever I asked for help I would get the side eye sometimes and it made me uncomfortable. There is no room for advancement in the company. They will keep you on for the busiest days of the year and then toss you like yesterdays trash. The pay wasn't that great either. Maybe because it was my first job and I had to work my way up but there is no room for advancement in the company. A lot of high school like behavior from the managers.
good,Lo único malo en que solo contratan por temporadas
good,"Some of the people who work here are great, but even their hands are tied by company policy.  You're expected to do the job of 3 people with barely enough pay for one and management doesn't seem to want to be bothered with your concerns."
good,"A strong company, but lacks good managers and leadership. The 3 basic beliefs are not followed by many and people are more afraid to lose their jobs, especially on the higher paying distribution side. "
good,"The store where I was employed had very poor management. The job itself was what I expected, but the supervisors that that I worked under were disrespectful to those they were managing. Very self righteous."
good,"Needs more workers, more training is needed in this facility..there are no options to move up in this facility. You don't get paid vacations...The managers don't help out at all they just stand there all night.not good..."
good,"Com uma gerência que não é forte e ambiente pressurizado a ponto de afetar o ritmo de trabalho, classifico a empresa como mediana."
good,"The company itself is terrible.  I've managed to work with an amazing team in the pharmacy, but outside of that too many changes are made monthly, no empathy"
good,"Stocking is a pretty simple job...when people do it correctly.  You're rushed to stock but have to clean up the previous associate's mess so you can stock the freight.  I spoke to the Assistant Manager and she gave me ZERO feedback.  I am not going to do a garbage job so you either want it to get done quickly/poorly or slowly/neatly/CORRECTLY!  Also, all you heard was negative trash.  They give no direction and then stomp on you for doing it incorrectly.  I mean, it's Walmart.  It sucks that they have this trashy reputation because the training materials (computer only) show a pretty positive environment.  Unfortunately, it doesn't translate to the real world."
good,"Overall, Walmart helped me come out of my box a bit more but, I dont think I'd want to work in a grocery store again. I met some friends but many were way older than me. I enjoyed helping the customers though."
good,"A typical day at work for me started with finding out what people wanted me to do because 99% of the time I didn't actually work in my department, I worked for everyone else. I was treated like the community peon and while I did very well in my department I didn't get to spend much time there. Management did not really have anything to say about this other than it was making me a more valuable employee, didn't warrant me a raise though."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with,but that's it. There point system is ridiculous and doctors notes do not mean anything to them. You cant get LOA papers from your doctor for everything."
good,es una empresa que brinda primeras oportunidades a los jóvenes en busca de experiencia laboral
good,being a cashier i meet a lot of people all the time of different cultures so when i have time i get to ask questions about them that i would have never known before
good,"Then you realize that favoritism runs rampant in the company among management. Would have loved to have advanced my career there but if management does not want you to advance, whether qualified or not, you will not."
good,Los gerentes no permiten crecer laboralmente y tienen preferencias
good,I enjoyed working with the public. Typical day was 8 hours breaks were usually on time. Management focuses on the negative and not the positive. Benefits are awesome. Schedules change every week.
good,"Paid me in the wrong pay grade for months then when they realized their mistake they wouldn't compensate me for lost money. Attendance policy is ridiculous. They don't care if you are sick, they will not accept doctors notes for any reason."
good,Walmart used to be a great place to work until Sam Walton died.  The culture he built has since died as well.  Sam knew that the associates made all the difference.
good,"Overall Walmart treated me nicely, the workplace was always a fun place to be at, the only problems that i had to face was that it was too labor intensive for me considering i had knee surgery and the workplace was too far."
good,"I have worked plenty of places, but walmart is nothing that I would recommend working long-term. At the time they wasn't paying anything to workers. They offered benefits but you couldn't afford it because you needed every penny. I worked at store #2247 and it worked off the buddy-buddy, kiss tail system. If you didn't do either one you wasn't going to get anywhere. They picked and chose who was going to move up and do whatever. Some job is better than not having one. apparently now they have upped the pay and so on but I know its still nowhere near where what you should get paid."
good,Walmart at times was fun like anywhere it has good days and bad the pay was not good and I did not like the way it was ran and there was to many managers
good,Overworked and never anyone to help with the big tasks.  Team is management heavy and there is a ton of favourtism.  On the plus side you can never be bored as you always have a multitude of work to do.
good,Management was super rude. Didn't get no hours. Worked hard n still didn't get noticed. Manager telling personal information to customers and employees.
good,I love my customers that come to the store. The people that work their we work as a family when we first started and now that we have hired new people and the old people have left it has been different. Management sucks but the store Manager is Great he is best store manager in the world. When he comes to work its great because he has control over the salaried managers and they act better when the store manager is at work.
good,working at Walmart was my first job as a teenager but I really didn't like the location I was at. the managers were rude at Bessemer and some employees were rude and catty.
good,"I started out a cashier and in that time there I learned how to cashier and I learned to do customer service that includes paying bills sending money returns cashing payroll checks and how to deal with every day customers in a friendly manner, I also learned how to be a customer service manager."
good,"too many people call in"
good,"Walmart is, unfortunately, a gigantic company. You will generally be a very small part of the operation, so not much can be devoted to you personally."
good,"The employees in my department (Sales Assiocate/firing room) are hard working individuals. Constantly on they're feet, going out and beyond for the customer by going to other departments within the store just to make sure the customers needs and questions are met and answered. Making sure our station and area within the store is kept to part and even lending a hand in other departments as well."
good,The work is very demanding on the body. For eight to till hours a day its nonstop moving. Management make there own rules depending on what works best in their favor. The job is only three days out of the week which is Sat-Monday
good,"normal day at work can be quite enjoyable with my coworkers. though very fast paced,which at times can be stressful,it can tend to make the day go faster. I don't believe management steps in to help as much as they should. the company treats their employees as they are dispensable,rather than valued. the hardest part of this job is of course weekends. as those are the busiest days, also the most understaffed days. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people,both coworkers & customers. I am a naturally happy person & believe happiness is contagious.Therefore,I feel that if you can show a good attitude & smile,others will too."
good,"Getting bored, not enough in pay, trying to move on.I love the associates, the management is okay but sometimes it feels like every man for himself instead of team work whooo"
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and staff. Management was difficult to talk with and find in times of need. Many instances where they would give you the workload of 3 people and expect you to handle it on your own.
good,"Had to always work longer than expected, they were always overstaffed, management was always yelling and being rude towards employees no respect whatsoever"
good,Their management is only about making themselves look good even if that is at the expense of their employee's health. The management has no issues reprimanding you on the floor and yelling at you for things that weren't expressed to you nor in your job purview.
good,This is not a great company to work for unless you happen to end up in a store with a Store Manager that cares about the employees I have only ever seen one of them and he was moved out of the store that I worked in.
good,Walmart is a fast paced work environment to work in. They are always changing with the times. There is a lot of room to grow with Walmart and they offer competitive pay.
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart is probably the most stressful job ever. Always understaffed, always customer complaints because theres no lines open. I will never understand why the managers don't hire more cashiers."
good,Foi um emprego que me ensinou a lidar com as pessoas.
good,"En general el ambiente es tranquilo, cada cual hace lo su tarea y hay poco seguimiento de las autoridades hacia los de menor rango, a diferencia de otros supermercados, en ese aspecto es bueno porque se ´puede trabajar tranquilo y no sentir tanta presion. Pero en si cada cual hace lo suyo en los descansos, y sos nuevo no hay mucho recibimiento agradable."
good,Come in clock in and get my assignment and start from there.  Making sure that all merchandise thats on the pallet onto the self and the overstock we have to take it to the back room for binning.
good,Nice people and staff. Just unorganized and chaotic at times. Pays well and the hours are great as long as you are doing your job you are fine. Can be frustrating at times when having to do others work.
good,"They do not have much flexibility, whether it's an emergency or not. The point system is non negotiable, I lost my job a whole month after I reached 4 points. No one warned me or let me know it was coming, I came to work and just couldn't clock in. They've offered my job back since but they are hard to work with."
good,Last to know anything no help anymore just keep piling it up associates that actually work managers don't talk to you or inform you of changes never enough people scheduled
good,Pay is great and thats pretty much it...when you first start everything seems great and organized then when you get into everything and meet almost everyone you need to meet and figure out requirements and the politics you will definitely be looking for a plan b
good,This place is very boring. Worked pushing carts. Very hot outside. Pay was 9 dollars. I don't even know who my supervisor was. Employees were immature high schoolers who dont work hard. I felt there was no motivation to advance.
good,There is room for advancement and growth but it is a stepping stone not a career unless you go to college and start out in corporate management.......
good,"This company keeps most employees at a part-time status to avoid paying employee benefit. There is no respect for most floor employees. Their are treated as a body, not a person with needs."
good,"Walmart by far is not the worse job I have had, I enjoy working with all my associates, sometimes things can get crazy with prices. My main concern like any other job is with training I sometimes feel as if I could have learned more to help the customer experience, also I feel in the dark on issues that are internal within the facility."
good,"Honestly, it's pretty much what you would expect from a company that pretty dominates as the super market for the entire United States. They may be corrupt and unfair to their employees, but every now and then there are those individual stores that shine and are actually worth working for."
good,It sucked... females were treated badly and paid poorly....mangers had no idea what they were doing but wanted you to know how to it .I have nothing good to say about my time at walmart
good,Horrible place to work. The managers never liked anything you did. Basically you got treated like you were a dog. I would never go work there or go back.
good,You kind of get lost with working there and they don't remember the things you accomplish an ok team to work with the culture is fine just can be a little better with training.
good,"Employment starts with a ""family friendly"" introduction, but quickly the Corporate influence rears it's ugly head.  Individual Management is often stymied by new policies and rules.  Gets the feeling that the individual is just a cog that can be quickly replaced should it get too noisy"
good,"Good experience in working with customers in a retail environment, however the work schedule is rather erratic, and there doesn't seem to be any opportunities for advancement."
good,Did I mention that all you are to do on a daily basis is production!! A real slave driver place to work. You are nothing but a number and the numbers that you can produce daily!!
good,A typical day at Wal-mart very busy . I have learned a lot about different departments but the work can be a little to much for the amount of people they have .
good,Make sure you keep track of when you are suppost to have a break because they do not keep tracks. Its good if you want to make good money and plenty of hours.
good,When I began with this company the culture and management of the facility I work was awesome.  Every day was a great experience.  And opportunity was endless.  I carried this with me to two other facilities and the third and last one was a downer.  The atmosphere is notably horrible.  One of the worst facilities in the region.  All in all it's an experience and I learned a lot from it.  Fun times
good,"Walmart se caracteriza como uma otima empresa a se trabalhar, no meu caso trabalhei pelo Walmart por 8 meses como operador de caixa, mas chegou o momento em que pensei na minha perpesctiva de crescimento e o que eu gostaria de fazer para minha vida. Em um dia comum de trabalho eu apenas atendia os clientes da melhor forma possivel. sempre sendo simpatico em todos os momentos, os meus colegas de trabalho gostavam muito do meu trabalho, pois eu era rapido no que fazia e eficiente o suficiente. Eu penso que a parte mais dificil naquele trabalho deveria ser a distancia da qual eu me situava. levaria quase 3 horas no trajeto quase todos os dias, isso era cansativo, no entanto haviam sim, partes agradaveis, os lados bons, eu tinha uma otima chefia, compreensiva, proativa e sempre simpatica."
good,"You get to help fill customers orders and make baked goods for the sales floor. And keeping the place safe and clean. "
good,"As a high school student, it was great to work in a place that had extremely flexible hours and an unlimited number of vacation days, however, about a month before I left they implemented the new PTO (Paid Time Off) system that did limit the number of vacation and sick days and required you to work something like 60 hours to get 1 day of PTO (Not 100% sure, it was a while ago and I wasn't really paying attention but I remember the number was ridiculously high for only 1 day). Not very good for a part time student who was lucky to get 20 hours a week but might work for someone older who can legally work full time all year."
good,"This was one of the hardest jobs I had, and by far my least favorite. You were expected to manage in extreme temperature conditions and often were berated by customers for things out of your control, expected to stand for 4 hours at a time with minimal breaks. The only upside I had was a good manager team who did their best with what little they had to work with."
good,"Work and hours were good. However, treatment by management was little to be desired. Previously worked for another store with no issues. Wrongfully terminated."
good,"I learned many different things from working at Wal-Mart, this is the place that I learned most of my job experience. Hardest part of the job was to always try to accomplish every one else's goals at hand, including my own. And the managers would tell you many different things to do and none of the things would match what the other one would say."
good,"A typical day at walmart is hectic with serious pressure. I learned to lean on my Co workers. workers are under appreciated, I enjoyed interacted with people."
good,The management could have been a lot better there. One of the supervisors did absolutely nothing. We had good pay and nice breaks but I was and still social anxious. The co workers don't welcome you. You just have to invite yourself.
good,"Sometimes hard to reach production goals, mangers always quick to coach instead of help their crew. Long hours, no over time offered as promised in interview process"
good,"If you have a good combination of CSM's and floor managers and cashiers it will make for a productive and fun day, no matter how hard you customers were."
good,Okay for a first job or interim job.  Not recommended for more than six months of work. This of course depends on the store and store manager who will set the tone for the store.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. I was very happy my job and the compensation but I quickly learned that Walmart had some policies that would and did eventually hurt a disabled worker there which really surprised with Walmart being one of the most well known employers of disabled individuals. It was because of these policies and biased behavior from the store manager that I was no longer able to stay with the company.
good,"Work life balance can be challenging in summer.TIME management, sense of urgency. To much focus of  Ill send a email to the other managers . Hardest part of the job would be telling a new hire the production goals.(They get sticker shock.) As the production goals are high. Most enjoyable part of the job would be midday when the workload smoothes out."
good,"This job was ok, starting out. My issue with this job wasn't so much of the company.It was more so of the people working for the company.Other than that I loved coming to work,, especially the days I would see my elderly customers."
good,working here was fun and i learned a lot but management and department supervisors are horrible. there is favoritism and discrimination against those that are different. Over worked and Under paid.
good,Its a great job to have. Management sucks but you really dont have to deal with them much if you were to be cashier. You get hour lunch breaks unpaid. Pay is pretty fair for retail work.
good,It was a really good job for what I was working and the hours I was getting. The associates there are great to work with and everyone is friendly for the most part. despite what they say about the costumers that come in most costumers are really friendly.
good,"I just had this job for the summer. It was ok, but with no benefits except a one time $10 off coupon. Before i was trained, they said that i would get a discount on the cost of buying clothing for a uniform, but never happened."
good,"I liked Walmart at first, management was good easy going, the crew was very family based at first. But management changed and things just started getting irritating, night crew kept getting blamed for day crews mistakes so we would get written up. We all got yelled at for being to slow when they kept preaching about team work but yet would get yelled at for helping out another associate each time. Walmart is a great company, but there management is not."
good,I worked in electronic department help customers daily I like helping people liked helping people with there digital needs hardest part of job is not having enough time to satisfy all customers
good,I worked there for 2 and a half years and it was pretty bad. None of the managers were ever on the same page. There is no communication in that store.
good,"From what I hear, it depends on the center. My own center said they would hire you for full time but barely give you even 20 hours a week. This would be an okay job for those who need a second job to the side- though, be careful. Clocking in one minute late is grounds for you to be fired. I didn't very much enjoy my job, it wasn't overly stressful or anything just wasn't my cup of tea. They have an open-door policy, which is nice, and for the most part my managers were understanding and helpful. It gets slow and boring sometimes, and standing in one spot is bad on the feet. All in all it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either."
good,"Working at Wal-mart in Farmville, Virginia was interesting. My job title was a cart pusher. I was probably one of the most hard working cart pushers they ever had. I could work the whole lot by myself. Pushed carts in every kind of weather, snow was the worst. Most of the managers lead a bad example for the lower sections. The way we were managed was kinda...lazy. Like our store manager would wait until the day the district manager to come to be strict on the rules. So instead of a being a well oiled machine we were one that got checked every once in awhile. Many have been fired doing exactly what the higher ups have said to do. Overall its a job with a bit extra chaos."
good,"Walmart is Walmart. You pretty much know what to expect. I worked in several different departments so I basically would work the entire store at times. At the location worked, front end management wasn't the best. Store manager kind of snobby. Walmart has it's busy hours along with it's peak seasons."
good,Nothing has changed for year! They area all about that dollar bill. There needs to be a better training for all of its workers.  Management needs a raise!
good,"During, the time I worked at Walmart I had fun with my coworker and also made long-term friends as well management can be understanding but hard to talk to"
good,"It's retail. If you are not a hard worker don't bother. It's fast paced and can be overwhelming, especially for the holidays. Plan to work every holiday."
good,Fun place low pay and the turnover rate is very high! Your promoted only if u kiss up to certain managers! Worst part is the hours are typically from 4-3:30. Too early
good,Management varies on if there approachable or you want to avoid them. Similar day to day tasks based on your specific department. Each shift is mostly distant from other shifts. I did learn the basics of stock rotation and inventory management. Unfortunately the work load was almost impossible to predict do to being based in how much of certain product was remaining. They do have cook outs for holidays and special events.
good,"Very unresponsive to the needs of its employees , while working there none of the the employees had proper traing nor was proper guidelines followed . Would have to say they were very inattentive."
good,Am tired of being told that I never do my job the right way and know one will show me the right way. Been there 14 years and there just now saying these
good,"the pay wasn't good but I always made the hours to make enough, I worked backroom mostly but when we were short I did work on the sales floor with other stockers."
good,"It was great being free to walk the whole store and a benefit when you were assisting the customer."
good,Wal-Mart holds a standard for its employees. However that standard is not equal among all of its employees. The company tends to put more pressure on harder working ore reliable associates. But that being said it does not seem fair or just to leave less productive or focused associates to their own devices while focusing on pushing the already hardworking and dedicated employees more and more. Also they do not consider effort or qualification when giving pay raises or compensation they use a time based system where whoever has been there the longest regardless of ability or worth should get paid the most.
good,"El tipo de trabajo desarrollado es muy variable dependiendo del área y de la zona en la que se este trabajando."
good,"As an ASM, I would typically spend about 13 hours/day working with little family time. Run around and handle multiple customer and employees situations at a time, clean multiple departments, scan all labels in my specific areas of the store, oversee accounting, staffing, scheduling, work through multiple reports, stocking, customer and associate safety."
good,During orientation they make you feel like it is a great job. It goes like this as long ad your doing what they want you to do everything is fine. But the moment you need something from them. They can't do it.
good,After working with them and seeing my husband work with them I feel as though if you are not wiling to bow to management you will not get promoted. DO NOT DO IT TO YOURSELF !!!!!
good,not good at all when it comes down to shifts and politics. the only good thing was profit sharing and bonuses at all times. also sometimes really poor managements.
good,"stock and zone clear anything clothes ,food,frozen,toys that great a hard work is good .. what you think so about ?? i hope u found me today i look job found hard for me"
good,"The managment is horrible atleast at my walmart, its minimum wage with a lot of employees with an open door policy , sometimes the expectations feel too high for one person but thats jobs for you. Walmart does not make it easy if u want another job along with your walmart job, But a lot of people make it work and some make a good living. I say walmart could be for you but personaly it was not for me."
good,Assisting customers assuring that they find everything they need. I  learned how to be patient and to provide customer exact need. The management is ok. I just made sure I did my job correctly. There wasn't anything hard about working at customer service. I actually love it. I enjoyed meeting new people
good,uma empresa com alguns chefes bons e que tem respeito pelos associados alem de ter liberdade pra colocar ideias no dia a dia que melhoram o trabalho
good,"They will only hire you as part time, I only get like 20 hours a week, don't make enough money for all the hard work I do, no benefits as part time, won't hire me as full time but yet we are always so busy, cannot survive off this pay if you're single. You have people doing half worked jobs for the same pay you make for working hard. This place is just a joke."
good,I process products that have been returned back to the store.  I work with numerous courier companies and drivers in returning products back to suppliers or other destinations that are required. I also cross over into receiving product for the stores inventory. I have found that there is not much support for general associates with this company. Management is not properly trained in all positions which reflects on the associates working under them. High expectations with little reward.Even with these issues though the general staff seem to mix well with each other.
good,"Walmart is a place you work for when nothing else is available. It's a source of income. They say they have an open door policy and that's true but because of policies you should only use it when necessary and then don't let it hit you on your way out. Walmart is not the same as it was was back in the days of Sam Walton, although they do make a point to throw him a biscuit every so often."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart is a good job I get to be with the public and help every customer that I can. However as far as the management goes, and coworkers, it's not an ideal place to work for. I want to work somewhere I know I am appreciated, somewhere where my hard work is recognized and not ignored. I want to work somewhere where employees are cared for."
good,Walmart was a great company to work for but it was boring and dull. I didnt get the happy work vibe from being employed with them. The work was not worth the pay
good,"its a good working environment for full timers..not so much part timers."
good,Only an hour of training big chest some managers treat you like you're nothing like your dirt but they are so managers that would train you and to help you do what you need to do
good,"Walmart went to a NO FULL TIME positions policy to keep from having to give medical and dental benifits. There are NO paid vacations and NO sick days unless you are top management. "
good,I worked third shift at walmart for four years. Co-workers become like family. Less customers in the store. Have to do work in timely manner. You have many projects to complet in little time. Mangment are not famly freindly or understanding. No opportunity for advancement.
good,"The work is not too bad depending on where you are. If you switch departments sometimes you don't get a pay change. Especially if you think it's necessary. The management isn't the best. Very few managers are okay. The store manager isn't the nest person to work for. Yeah, she's nice. But she isn't a very good manager to say the least. Like I said, dont make it a home."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar,pagava certo tudo em dia"
good,"I learned a lot at this job. I started in the garden center and moved to working in hardware, sporting goods, fabrics, backroom, and cashiering in the front. Management was always going back and forth with directions and asking me to accomplish impossible tasks by myself like stocking 12 pallets in one day or zoning the whole half of the store in 1 hour...."
good,The job is easy but the management makes it much harder than it needs to be. They take the enjoyment out of working there they're insensitive to their employees wants or needs. They are rude and unappreciative at my store they foster an unenjoyable work environment and they show blatant favoritism
good,Great place to work if you dont have children....Walmart isnt really a good idea full time if youre a single parent. They dont take hospital notes into consideration what so ever. Whether it be you ro your children. They simply just dont care.
good,I was ok. Didnt really like working there. I was just a temporary job that would get me to my next job. Made friends but it was not really a great working environment and management was not that great.
good,Depending on your job functions its all about the customer and not so much about the employees. Corporate focuses more on what customers think and not what their employees think.
good,They have no concept of leaving your personal lives at home and things are taken much too personally while still being job related in a general statement.  Managers are inexperienced and have no idea of what is and is not within labor regulations.  This company mistreated us on a daily basis and did not even have the materials required to finish our work properly on a day to day basis.
good,"The wrong people are working in wrong positions, they should consider hiring knowledgeable, mature management staff "
good,"c'est vraiment par apport a walmart saint laurent sinon tout les walmart ne sont pas comme ca c'est une bonne compagnie a saint laurent les gerant n'aide pas généralement les associé a accomplire leur travail correctement , sinon la collaboration entre associé est vraiment bonne c'est pas un millieu de conflit."
good,"The hours would be cut without notice.  They would not hire anyone on as full time.  They did not culture an environment that keeps workers.  High turnover rates, and not a  good company to work for."
good,"While it's smart to stay updated and try new things, Walmart is constantly changing back and forth between different ways to handle sales and presentation - it gets very confusing from week to week and, in my experience, not everyone is on the same page. While there are some managers who genuinely care about you as an employee, I've also met managers who only have their own interest in mind. I've met many hard-working associates in the year I've been working for the company, but they seem to be treated poorly compared to the people who don't work as hard (like the employees who have family members in management positions). They also have extremely high and nearly impossible expectations for their associates."
good,"Walmart is a great company, however they do not value family time or work with you on your schedule. If your availability is not open you will not receive a good schedule.  They will cut your hours and you will work less and less.  Management does not care about the associates."
good,"Working at this Walmart location proved to be challenging at times. The management was not as friendly as one would hope and often were not helpful. The benefits here didn't impress me. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone. I can't speak for other Walmart locations, but this one needed help getting their management on the same page."
good,"2nd shift is not good, was the only one working my department most of the time, no control over schedule, was scheduled to work every weekend despite not being hired to, was overall not a great place to work"
good,I start out with just doing all cash counts and paper work.Searching for overage or shortage.I do learn something new everyday.The hardest part of the day is trying to get enough hours to work and management does not help.But most of all I love working with the team of the front end and they help all that they can.We all work together on all that has to make our day go smoother.
good,on a typical night you clock in and pretty much stay moving till you clock out. I can't say I learned all that much because I did not even get to finish computer training because I became ill and ended up in the E.R and was let go.
good,"Same problem like with at Best Western, my supervisor had a personal problem with me and made my job hard. She made it hard to want to push harder and work, she just had a personal problem with me I never could figure out."
good,It is a stable job. It comes with very little excitement and job duties are always consistent and repetitive. Not everyone who works there is very friendly so co working isn't always the best experience.
good,"The training is a joke. And if you aren't from the military good luck with advancing in this warehouse.  I love that they employ the veterans. Yet that is all they seem to promote with or without experience in the warehouse. The worst  favoritism i have ever seen. So many people work their butts off, for others to kiss booty and do nothing all the time. Being a hard worker there doesn't pay."
good,"Working with people was fun. The erratic demands of management caused frustrations through all associates. Common sense was not practiced most of the time, as the worry was more about getting sued than doing the correct actions. Being better educated than management seemed to be a problem"
good,Lots of work to be done in little time. Management is terrible with communication most times. Most employees are very helpful with training. Has a good pay rate.
good,"Hi working for Wal-mart is the worst job I had. The only thing I liked was meeting new customers being able to help them out and my friends I met along the way. However, I worked overnight for two years and I really wanted to go to school but Wal-Mart was not willing to work with my schedule. Its only favoritism over there. They do not go by your work performace if youre trying to move up. I will never work for that company again."
good,Not the best company to work for. They could careless if you or your family is ill and will even fire you for it. I would not recommend working here. Sorry
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers.  I need a full time job not just part time.  It has a good atmosphere.  There are opportunities to move up in the company if you are interested in that field.
good,I was young and did not do anything tough at walmart.  Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves.  Nothing hard.  I left to find a better paying job though.
good,"The most enjoyable part is finally taking your break. "
good,I don't like Walmart they do not care for they employees at all..work extremely too hard for little pay..nor do they work with you and schedule at all
good,It can be good place to work at. Just go in do your job and go home. Just stay away from the drama and do a great job at what you do. I learned time management and how to organize a lot better. I love Online Grocery and Site 2 Store. You get to shop for customers and give them their groceries.
good,I signed in and went to my cashier. Smiled and helped my clients.  Received my lunch break on time most times.  Then signed out when my shift was over.  The hardest part was getting them to work with my school schedule.  The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with my customers and help bring a smile to their face.
good,"A typical day is ever- changing. I work in a few different areas daily. I've learned how to interact with customers better. I like my co-workers, and the benefits (including ones for part time associates) The hardest part of my job is stocking shelves at the busiest time of the day/ night, and having several management persons telling you several different ways that they want the same job done. I enjoy moving around doing different things, and using my accuracy/ detail oriented skills to make our products available and look good for our customers."
good,Management puts too much on 1 person for the night with almost unrealistic expectations that could easily be fixed with more people and more hours but the company in general just refuses to allow that. either becuase they are greedy or cant figure out how to make things work.
good,I was a sales associate for 6 years. Started out in high school and ended up quitting halfway through college. This place literally sucks the life out of you. No fun at all.
good,"Working at Walmart was easy, it just like any other job. Management on the other hand were not reliable at all, it seems like whenever a customer or employee needs assistance from the management they are mostly not around or available. As for home and work I more at work then home, and I was working part-time but racking up almost 40 hours a week."
good,A place where employees doesn't matter and the management system is protected. I'm not angry or annoyed just an honest opinion I the Wal-Mart I worked for.
good,The job started out ok but it got stressful as time went on because there were alot of issues that were not under control and kept getting away from personell teams .
good,Terrible management. Benefits were over priced. Customers were very unfriendly.  Worked her why my dad was dying was on fml leave and still was asked to leave or I would be fired.
good,"There was constantly something to be done. The only hard part was trying to find the time to get everything done. I would work for about 38 hours a week, but was never given the opportunity to move up my status to full-time. They do penalize you for everything. For working more than 35 hours as a part-time associate, you will be written up. If you have 3 or more absences in the first 6 months, you will be terminated."
good,"Walmart was a okay place to work at. The management didn't really respect there empoyless. On top of that , you know you can go back to your job and get paycheck stub. The head Manager couldn't even do it."
good,Walmart wasn't the best place to work. Alot of the times the managers didnt even care or werent active in the work that we did. The employees were not friendly and it just felt like a hostile work environment.
good,"Both busy, fast paced jobs working with a variety of individuals.  The manager at Dollar Tree was not supportive of employees.  He would often yell at them in front of customers.  The store was also a mess and very disorganized.  The one thing I did like was the regulars who shopped at the store."
good,"Its a low end, no education required job. You bust your butt all day long to do menial tasks with very inept management whom will say whatever it takes to make you do your job and then flake out on any promises they made after the job is done."
good,"You will have to work super hard for 10 years to get a promotion or know some type of store manger to get anywhere high up. It does have nice benefits and the discount is very nice when you buy basically everything there (but you do have a wait period when you first start to get the discount). Like most places, gossip spreads so keep mouth closed on personal things in your life."
good,"I enjoyed the work but management was not as knowledgeable in the procedures that we all as cashiers were trained in. I enjoyed the customers, They were smiling and happy when they left. I had returning customers that would search for me before shopping so I could assist them."
good,"I work methodically, and at a fairly fast pace.  Keeping a neat and organized work area is essential to proficiency.  I learned to work smart and save steps.  Stocking becomes difficult when there is no cohesiveness among stocker's.  I do not believe it is my job to do another persons' job in addition to mine.  I willingly am helpful to anyone, but blatant negligence  I can and will not tolerate."
good,Management hardly did much for the lower associates and continued to hide in the back office on a daily basis. Terrible working conditions when dealing with frustrated customers. Constant missed breaks or sent to break too soon. Some days never got a lunch break due to negligence and forgetfulness of management yet I was held responsible for not taking a lunch break.
good,The hours are inconsistent so cant plan anything cause days off aint the same week to week. Always working different times of the day so its hard to spend time with family.
good,The store i worked is was so poorly managed dreaded going in everyday. However my coworkers were some of the most dedicated hardworking supportive people i ever met they were great team members
good,"I really have nothing nice to say. Except for the fact that its a good entry level job. Basically, if you weren't management, you weren't all that important."
good,My typical day as a electronic sales associate was to make sales to customers and inform them on the products they were interested in. Up keep of the section was mandatory as well and when short staffed I was responsible to for those areas as well.
good,"The work can be mentally and physically straining, be prepared to do others jobs if you show any kind of motivation, and you wont be compensated for having to fufill other peoples work"
good,people where great management not so much. Management only cared about their department and not how pulling people had a negative effect customer service and keeping up with scheduled work.
good,"The worse the customer the more they get and the employee is treated like DIRT!!! Customers that are legitimate problems and returns are told NO and those that yell and scream and do not have all the information needed, receipt, picture ID are treated so much better and the employee is chastised for not bowing down to the rude and nasty people that came in there. LOTS of money laundering."
good,"It was god for a part time starter job. Hard to move up in, but otherwise okay. Just what you would expect from Wal-Mart. I was qualified for a higher position at the company but when i approached proper management to ask for the job they told me no. They didnt recognize that after four years and extensive knowledge of the position that I wasnt good enough for the job. Even though i had been covering the position for people who called out over the years. I also requested a position in another area of the store and they never even gave me a chance for an interview. Long story short they could be a little more appreciative of the hard workers they have there."
good,I had a good experience but i know others who were not so lucky to have a better experience than me. Walmart is a good job if you cant work anywhere else and can deal with the customers.
good,when i first started it was lovely but after being there a year and a half I'm ready to try new things! some of the management is great but others you can see the favoritism.
good,"Don't work too hard it makes your coworkers look bad and if they could speak English maybe they could communicate with you. "
good,I did not enjoy working for Wal-Mart. The managers would get frustrated with you anytime you needed their assistance. The hours would be late on night and expect you to be back real early the next day
good,"Walmart is a good company which I was apart of for 3 years, was alot of work and was always pushed to get done with my work as fast as possible to go help someone who has slacked off all night."
good,I was a student and was not treated very well by the manager.  Was not given very many shifts that were in line with school although it was discussed in the interview process
good,good place to start and learn and get experience put not a good way to have a life.  high stress and not enough people with long days
good,"Working standard full time hours performing stocking and restocking of products. Selected products from store room to be stocked on store shelves. Sorted and stocked proper quantities of stock according to shelf modular. Repacked and sorted products to be rebind. Corrected shelf counts and caps to correct specifications. Completed price changes, mark ups, mark downs and sale items. Sanitized work space; Cleaned-up spilled goods when needed. Ensured all safety logs are completed in the department. Proper use of Texlon gun and printer. Realigned shelf modular according to company standards. Assisted and directed customers: heavy lifting, shopping or presenting other choices upon request."
good,Great coworkers. Good lunch breaks. Good employee meetings. Understanding staff for the most part. Certain work is almost therapeutic in a sense......
good,There managers are firing the wrong people. Don't understand is and what we go through. We have it hard working on the cash register.  Dealing with alot if people.  But no one understands that.  All the know is skin color.  And that sucks   ..
good,"If you aren't tough, management will eat you alive. The only reason I left was the day I was screamed out by a manager in the middle of the sales floor in front of customers."
good,"Lots of lifting products, organizing produce at the beginning of the day but as the day goes on the workload drops majorly. The afternoon and evening holds almost nothing to be done. Hardest part of the job would be maintaining your health. Most enjoyable part was getting back home after work."
good,"Was okay to work for. No one knows your name, you just go in, do your job, and leave. I enjoyed working in the bakery but was invisible when I did something good and visible when something was wrong."
good,"I fairly liked Walmart because it was a job and I provided for myself, but they were very selfish when it came asking to time off. You barely received Sundays off to attend church nor could you have holidays besides Christmas off."
good,Descaso com colaborador e uma empresa boa mas as gerência não tá nem aí prós funcionários confundir o profissional com o pessoal.
good,It's a job that will get you money and be able to adavance your career but working at this Walmart has shown me how much disrespect they have here for the employees so it's not worth it anymore.
good,"a typical day at work for me went like this,"
good,I did not have a very good experience at walmart. they werent willing to work with me when it came to my pregnancy. management also didnt not give breaks on time they would not be around when they were need which frustrated me and the costumer i was helping
good,Management would regularly insult associates and force them to take on management responsibilities. Would work a single associate until they slacked off so they could be fired or until they quit.
good,"What may seem like the do-good corporation of the world is nothing but a mask to hide an ugly truth. What is tantamount to slave labor fuels the backbone of the monstrous supermarket chain. The pinnacle of suffering, Wal-Mart may provide what is a paltry pittance above minimum wage, it certainly does not discriminate in how it abuses its employees. On my last day working, my employer apologized for ""giving me so much sh_t."" How unacceptable."
good,"Not the greatest place to work, but it pays the bills. "
good,"I enjoyed working in the pharmacy most of the time. I worked with some very interesting and knowledgeable individuals and I learned many important things. "
good,"I enjoyed working with Walmart, although I feel as they could raise minimum wage. But overall it's a fun, productive job"
good,"Worked there over 8 years , Management treat you very bad , can say anything about that to anybody or you will be fired. Its all about who you know in company."
good,"Typical day at work was productive always doing something helping customers, also managers were always there to assist you when needed."
good,They hired me for seasonal and then I went to Walmart. Was expected to open freight and place them on the shelves. Way to much work for the pay. Also printed signs for the items on sale
good,"The terrible schedule cuts aside, walmart has given me very little to complain about.  If you show up and do your job you wont have any problems."
good,"walmart have poor managers , especially the on ein hammond, la. also their racist. i wouldnt refer that walmart to anyone to save my life .... that means alot"
good,"I work in customer service, and the rules were told aren't the rules that anyone follows no matter how important. The pay isn't great compared to the tasks we do every day and the customers and managers we have to put up with."
good,"Melhorias entre colegas,melhorias na empresa em geral."
good,its ok i enjoyed working in the back unloading the truck and liked sorting the break packs some days was busy but most of the time a little slow
good,"En este trabajo aprendi a trabajar bajo presión, a conocer los diferente tipos de clientes, ya que le ayudaba a mis supervisoras me enseñaron a realizar cancelaciones, trabajar reportes, lo mas difícil era la calidad de vida por que no era un horario fijo, me agradaba el ambiente entre los compañeros de todas las áreas."
good,"Its a lot that goes on employee don't try to get the job done. Its like a big high school, that the managers just let go on and do."
good,It's a miserable company to work for. They treat their employees like garbage and don't care about them. The pay is decent but not worth the amount you get mistreated.
good,"Walmart was a fun first job that taught me to be a self starter and take initiative. There was always a lot of work to be done, and often not enough workers to complete it. I loved the fast-paced environment and my co-workers."
good,When I first began working for Walmart the job was great. They were very family oriented and seemed to really care about the employees. Sadly as time went on it became more and more about the money. Management is not being trained properly and it reflects on the whole business.
good,"Most people working here only use it as an entry-level job (students), a stepping stone if lacking experience, or a second job. Policies and procedures are not very structured, so your experience will very greatly depending on the type of co-workers and managers you have. Unfortunately, there is a high turnover rate, and the good people usually get better jobs, so you are left with the not-so-good nor educated higher ups "
good,"Serviço muito pichado exige muito esforço físico das pessoas, o gerente não era educado, e os colegas de trabalho eram divertidos"
good,When I first started it was a great place to work. Then things just started getting unorganized. It was supposed to be a team but everybody was forself. The hard working employees weren't getting the credibility that they deserve & that's not the type of business I would like to work for.
good,"A typical night at work was right to the point of stocking groceries right away. I learned safety methods, and how to maintain a clean, fast and friendly environment. Management was poor but didn't stop my motivation to work hard. Walmart's top store managers aimed hard to educate and inspire employees about the history and culture of the company. The hardest part of working for Walmart's over night stock team was dealing with the poor management of the overnight supervisors, but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work alone and also as a team to get our job done quickly and effectively."
good,Management was very difficult to get in contact with. Very difficult to work with according to my college schedule. Hired as part time but was given full time hours.
good,"typical day at work is to work product to the sales for and fulfill customer service."
good,"a typical work day would be getting my cart and doing to top stock for the first 3 hours"
good,was an ok place to work. wouldnt try to make a career out of it there though. when i worked there the pay sucked and bennefits were not much better. the managemet was great though
good,Working in the deli was fun cause there was always something that needed to be done so you were constantly on your toes and customer service was a must always serve with a smile and never engage a customer in a bad mood always smile.
good,We were always understaffed and some of my coworkers were terrible people. Some of them were very lazy and wanted to leave the work on other people.
good,I enjoyed the job when work was done and we could relax for a minute and the emoloyees that work there are very helpful if you dont understand something and management is also on board with that
good,The management is awful at some not all walmarts. If its clean and neat= good managment. If everything sucks and dirty= bad management.
good,"All workplaces are different. My personal experience with Walmart has never been good, both on a consumer level and as an employee. "
good,"a lot of dealing with customers sometime mad at you for no reason, not benefits or full time. schedule is always changing and you never know what shift you will have to work."
good,Walmart management was a problem. In the years I worked for them there were six assitant managers and three store managers who came then left. I started out as a sales floor associate and in three months i was department supervisor of hardware. Four months after that i was department supervisor of automotive and hardware then after that i had sporting goods and automotive departments because everyone kept steeping down.Almost all of the training i learned i learned from reading a manuale and the computer.
good,I really enjoyed being employed with Walmart. The only problem I had was the lack of communication.I like to talk and keep my team informed on whats been going on in the shop and what needs to be done but no one else seemed interested no matter how much ease it would have brought to the job.
good,There is always things to do. From the moment you clock in to the minute you clock out. Easy place to gain experience with customer service and warehousing.
good,"Get written up a lot. Some areas require you to hit quota or you loose your job. Worked very hard, if need to go to bathroom you will hit red lights which you can get written up for."
good,"Typical day was lifting and stocking heavy product, Learned about meat. Most co workers seemed friendly enough. Hardest part was the heavy lifting, not a good idea if you are not physically strong."
good,Wal mart is a good place to work depending on who your co workers and managers are other then that it sucks. Mangers always complaining that your effort is never enough even tho your working 8 hours with 12 pallets of fright done your still not doing good enough. Pay is great that's about all.
good,"Was a great job at first, over the years management changed and seemed to care less and less about the employees. Some of the customers could be difficult to deal with but most of them were very friendly amd polite."
good,job was easy and task that needed to be done was easy. management as far as assistants weren't the best. lacked support and didn't really give equal tasks to all assocites.
good,"Overall, Walmart is a great company to work for and I would recommend the company to anyone. Their schedules are flexible and they appreciate their employees. The only negative thing I have"
good,"My experience with Walmart was much of what I had previously heard about the company. The management wasn't great and there wasn't much job security, however, if you have a good attitude, good attendance, etc. you have the chance to go far in the job. It's a good entry level job."
good,"The wages were competitive, but hours should have been better. A generally pleasant place to work. Co-workers - some good, others not so much."
good,"I never truly believed the horror stories about Wal-Mart until I started working there. The company does not care about it's employees and constantly expects entirely too much out of them. Hours are limited, bonuses are meager, and holiday pay is no more. The associates are expected to work extremely hard while the multitudes of managers sit back and do nothing. I believe that this company has way too many people telling others how to do a job than actual people to do the job."
good,"Walmart don't care about employees. They force you to change your schedule and cut your hours when ever possible. In 5 years we as employees never got more than 42% of bonus, while everything is done to get all of management there bonus. Best part of job is customer service."
good,"Walmart would have been a good place to work in if the management team did not treat their employee as if they are worth nothing, except to just get the work done and call it a day."
good,"A typical day might include working as a cashier, a floor associate, and a customer service representative."
good,Great job to start off with.. Not very much room for advancement.  The hours are very demanding and that doesn't allow much time for family life.  I was a cashier for 4 years and never promoted to manager.
good,"Learning how to accomplish goals that I set daily in a timely manner."
good,Nothing to special about it. Its was a walmart job. My coworkers were all very social & communicated well. I would recommend this job more to people just looking to build up work experience.
good,"En Walmart se comenzaba a laborar desde las siete de la mañana asta el horario en que terminaras tus labores aun asi si se pasaba del tiempo de jornada laboral la mayoria de veces el tiempo extra sin goce de sueldo, sin embargo se aprende demasiado a como funciona la tienda y cuales son sus areas de oportunidad de uno y como mejorar cada una de ellas para optimizar el trabajo, la Gerencia es demas decir que exige sin importar y sin preguntar si tienes la disponibilidad solo quieren que hagas lo que te dicen en el momento sin importar si es de tu area de trabajo o bien si estas realizando una actividad de tu area, mis compañeros de trabajo eran muy conflictivos en ocaciones y eso afectaba en el area de trabajo, No hubo partes dificiles habalando laboralmente en el ambito de relacion laboral si se sucitan demasiados conflictos, Aprender a llevarme bien con la mayor gente posible y crear lazos de amistad."
good,"This place is a means to a financial ends, beyond that I would shudder to think about. The environment was average, the working conditions were average, and the coworkers were below average at times."
good,I  worked here 9 years i have a lot of good thoughts but i also have a bunch  of bad ones to. I would never work for this company again.
good,It is an ok place to work decent benefits. Low paying not minimum wage but still not a living wage. Management is decent. The work life balance is ok.
good,"Typical day at work consists of helping costumers, selling and handling guns and ammunition, making sure my department is neat and organized. I learned how to sell firearms, and stock shelves. My co workers are great to work with their friendly and always willing to help me out if I need it."
good,Walmart is a good place to shop but I don't like working with them cause management sucks and very mean to the workers. Overall depending where you work at in Walmart is unfair and rude
good,Sometimes a fun place to work. coworkers are nice and management is fair to a certain extent. Hardest part of the job is you only get 4 pts and then your terminated no matter why you are absent.
good,"management would not allow time for family events. the staff who were mothers would not get mothers day off, but the staff who weren't mothers would. I would work one easter year and still work every holiday after that. no time for family."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you are planing a long term career to be a supervisor or a manager. The management and the employees sucks........
good,The other cashiers and lower tiered coworkers were very friendly and understanding. The upper management was not very understanding or excepting of people dealing with personal crisis.
good,"Bad management,  alot of good condition workers,  always have hours pay is ok.  It was an okay job on the overnight shift. The management was very horrible and didn't address problems or coworkers properly, but the overall jobs with coworkers were decent, everyone was okay. Pay wasn't great but it helped."
good,"At store 588, where I was working, there is a multitude of issues that complicate even the simplest of work to be done in store. Management has a very difficult time handling the store, communication is a problem due to authoritative abuse, and meager fights for power. The employees are worked far harder then legally allowed and never gets the respect or compensation deserved. As a result the moral is low and the Termination rate is high and what's worse about these issues is that it no one cares to help."
good,They would ask me to work in so many other places in the store it wasn't worth it to me. Every day I went into work focusing on someone else department.
good,"My days are busy  from the moment I walk in the door. "
good,"Working with Walmart i had many dutys and responabilitys I had to fullfil. Such as, Stock shelves. Used the palette jacks and zone."
good,Walmart was great when I started but does not have the staff to run the store properly. Unfortunately it has become very noticeable that the employees are not cared for but the bottom line is.
good,Wal-Mart employees were fun peoplenim the enviorment I met a lot of friends there but the management didn't take time to care for there workers or couldn't even do soo much as remember there names.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of stocking milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. I would make sure the area stays clean. Sometimes, the managers would move me to other departments to help."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, wish i would have gotten more training. No back up with customers as far as management when it came to assisting the customers and doing my job to the best of my ability. Liked helping customers and improving the reputation of Walmart and giving customers a good experience. I was training the managers on information that should have already been given to higher up personnel"
good,It was an okay job customers were rude and management felt on top of the world. It was an okay experience. I wouldn't want to work here again
good,I worked there for 3 years and never got full time. Finally got insurance after 2 years. I wouldn't recommend working here. Management didn't care for their employees.
good,"poor management and dispatching system"
good,Most people were okay but the management was not doing a great job. the co-workers are alright but not friendly. The only benefit is a 10% reduction except that there is nothing else.
good,Work was long and sometimes stressful but I worked with a great team of people. We made the best of what we had to work with. For the most part the customers were great too.
good,"when i began working at walmart things went well, i felt at home respected and i felt like things i did matered and i was friends with my co workers and managers, however over time this attitude has changed and the workplace had become far more caustic with management being apathetic to the workers and environment, if you can handel high stress and laughably high expectations the entry requirements are near nill and the benefits are while not excellent definitely worth having"
good,"A typical day would be just continuously scanning items, scanning coupons, assisting customers. Making the customers feel important, offering credit cards to receive discounts. Overall providing exceptional customer service."
good,"Easy job, working with the Publics, cashing income TAX checks, and putting items on lay away was a process and credit card payment was a process with the right codes. Being a Cashier is very easy if property trained. Customer Service is vital its help the Company Io prosper."
good,"In the beginning of my employment with the company, I thoroughly enjoyed it from my co-workers, my managers, our customers and the work itself... I loved the team work mentality...during some morning or afternoon meeting would be like we were at an pep rally,the morale was pretty great until the location went through a series of not so good store managers & upper management...Hours were slashed and quantity was more important then quality at that location...there weren't enough associates assigned daily to supply the demands of the our customers needs...the ability to put a smile on every customer face became harder and harder."
good,"Walmart is a good place to start working if you're just out of high school, retired, or going to college. The pay is low, the benefits are expensive, the managers are lazy, the hours are always low, & getting full time there is next to impossible."
good,"Company cares alot about there store and products, customer service is really good.  Team work could use some work, they be more productive, if they didn't have on person for ever three isles speacilty if the people are traines."
good,Was an okay place to work. Stressful at times . Did not train for positions well and management was not knowledgeable of the departments.
good,"Was hired on as one thing and then forced to move to another because they removed my job, did not pay me holiday pay when i worked holidays, did not cooperate when i had knee surgery."
good,"Pretty easy going job. It felt awesome to sometime make someone else day better. Not enough hours though. Some good coworkers, and there's nothing hard about the job. A lot of standing around. I prefer more busy."
good,I worked putting New Fabric away in the morning as well as carts that were left from the night before.  All day long waiting on customers and helping customers get what they need to help with their problems and accompise  what they want as the end result. I would help put freight away as well. When new modes came down i would help if not set new modes until the last of my working there then they had a mod team that did them at night.  I always took the old patterns in our file cabinet out and put in the new ones that came in.
good,"Its a great place to get started in customer service to see if its right for you because you deal with all types of personalities, good and bad."
good,They don't give full time hours. they cut your hours. different schedule every week. the only good thing is the coworkers every one is friendly/
good,It is very hard for you to get management to give you rhetoric time of day. They say they areally a family friendly company yet I would have to fight to be able to see my family.
good,basically they want you to work when ever they call and u can not have a family life. if you kid is sick and u leave work or miss work you will be wrote up
good,"After nearly six years of experience in this company I can say that it was not the worst job, but I would not recommend that any body work at the Dearborn heights Walmart."
good,"at least the lower employee's. Management not so much, constantly being told different things, always wrong. Between management and keeping the customers happy, it's a madhouse. AND no help."
good,"The Walmart experience was an okay environment, but far as management things could be improved. The flexibility of scheduling and communication can be improved on a lot of levels."
good,"to much work not enough help! Employee turnover is crazy."
good,The way people get treated is horrible but its a paycheck. No holiday pay new pto. You have to work for your vacation time. Family means nothing
good,We use to have benefits but there is nothing to keep anyone interested. Attendance policy is ridiculous and family means nothing. It's all about money to Wal-Mart
good,"Not much for advancement, unless favored by management. Work hard to get not very far sadly. They did for the most part, accomodate a schedule with having a child"
good,the grunts at walmart like i was are funny and awesome to be around but the work was always hard and they pushed you to do more and more i would never want to put any of my friends or family in that work place
good,The job isn't too bad or demanding itself. The worst part is the management forms cliques with senior employees and tend to treat everyone else badly. High turnover rate because of this. They expect you to do whatever is needed to get things done on time whether it's safe to do so or not. A lot of the employees will alienate others and here's a lot of talking behind other's backs.
good,"A variety of things to do. Always a productive day at Walmart. "
good,nobody helps eachother they just make fun of people and criticize people and the store manager acts like she is to good to communicate with her employees and all management are rude and treats their employees ugly
good,It a good company to start at and if willing to work hard you can move up fast in the company. The  more u move up the more stressful the position get as an assistant manager u would be working long hours and more responsibility on you.
good,Decent place to work with the exception of dealing with incompetent and often times rude managers who would belittle their associates at every opportunity.
good,Como empresa es buena solo que la gente que la administra le falta mas sensibilidad humana hacia el personal subordinado
good,Walmart is a diverse workforce that teaches and guide their employees to success. Employees are able to work their way into management. Employees are given the opportunity to learn and maintain a business.
good,"I work three shift, and management isn't that great. I love the people that work there. Breaks are greatly split up. Pay is awesome if they would give you the hours."
good,Some of the associates were great to work with. The managers were awful. Hours were not flexible. Home life nonexistent. Training was a little poor. Was never able to do job fully.
good,there isn't a balance of work and home. no set schedules or days off. cant make plans or appointments because the request would be denied for lack of coverage.
good,This was a fun place to work at before Sam Waltons childern took over. Mr. Walton cared about his employees and took care of his employees like they were part of his family. That is no longer the feeling at this company.
good,"Cool company, needs more management training. Too many departments per manager. A lot of bonuses if you're at a good location without theft. Discounts are a plus. Hours could be better. Steady work"
good,"Very good work place on daily there where morning, afternoon , and evening meetings to keep us informed on how well our store had been preforming. We also had safety meetings and on occasion we met safety standards and we had cookouts. We have quarterly bonus."
good,"Walmart is your typical job that you get up every morning and dread doing but you know you have to for a paycheck. The employees are okay, the management could care less, customers are rude, pay is okay, however I did like the hour lunch breaks and pretty solid schedules. I would recommend this job to someone who needs something easy, quick and that pays a little above minimum wage. Bottom line, it's just a job not a career."
good,"ok start job, need something more reliable and dependable. there was no benifits and no overtime at all. would not work with hours at all."
good,"A good place to work. Plenty of advancement opportunity. Descent Management who takes care of their people. Lots of things to learn like equipment operation, and stock room management."
good,"I loved my job at wal-mart until my son got sick, and I was told I couldn't miss a single day for six months. And then my maternity leave 'was ''approved'', but when I came back they thought I had quit. So."
good,It's hard to move up in walmart you only get a 9 minute grace period which doesn't help at all. The people who work there are cool people to work with I met alot of new people.
good,"A typical day at work would be ensuring all associates were at work and on their job duties...If not, making calls to see if I could get shifts covered. Making sure all breaks were given at appropriate times."
good,Management is OK they could be a little nicer and be around the cashiers.some coworkers are nice and some keep to themselves and arnt nice sometimes.
good,I've been a customer longer than an employee but the fact of the matter is no matter how you turn the apple it's gonna have a bruise on it. Walmart is a bruise..most of the employees are lazy and don't know how to help you with simple things or the management goes on 10 smoke breaks a day walk around and yell at you because you're working hard and they don't do anything.
good,"They were great with flexible hours and listening to availability, but my experience was over looked for promotions constantly. They would consistently put people in leadership roles that has no knowledge of the tasks of the position."
good,I was not as happy with the job as I thought it would be. The mangers seemed almost against you and likewise with the hours. Everything seemed to be working against job advancements and increase in salary.
good,"A typical work day was busy. I learned to work in a fast paced work place, and how to deal with difficult customers. Management was normal. Nothing bad or great about it. My coworkers were all cool and nice. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. Meeting interesting people from around the world."
good,When I first started I looked forward]to going to work on a daily bases but over the years the turn over rate in management and regular employees was very high which contributed to a lot of instability in the work atmosphere and management inconsistent between each one. Would be told what and how they wanted something done by one member of management and then told you did it wrong from a different manager. This happened on a regular bases.
good,"I was a cashier who worked well with coworkers and management."
good,"Meu dia na empresa era excepcional devido ao companheirismo dos superiores, aprendi muita coisa na empresa, na qual me será muito util fora dela,  a direção não tenho que reclamar,"
good,"Rang up customers, worked in customer service. At times I also stocked the front end. I helped customers locate items in the store. I also did stockman duties."
good,A day for me at work is being ready to prioitize my task the successfully excute them and have aproductive day. I come in check my associates scheduling to make sure im properly staffed. After that i check the warehouse for my freight to know what work i have instored. Then i do a walk threw of my department to make sure there are no spills and that there is no reshop so I can jump right in to my daily notes. Once i know what the status is then i can get my started.
good,"For a young man or woman looking for a first job, walmart is a good place to begin. For older employees, it is not a positive place to work."
good,This was not my first choice in jobs. The management often took the staff for granted and the night crew's treatment was particularly harsh considering the amount of work we completed.
good,"Walmart has contributed severely to the mental illnesses that I currently have. I enjoyed my job when I was actually able to do it, but most the time they neglected my needs. I faced managers who tried to screw me over multiple times and coworkers that made everything seem like high school. It to me is honestly one of the hardest places to try to stay and keep myself happy. I don't know that I will go back to walmart for a period of time because of the way that I was treated."
good,Working at Wal-mart was a not so great experience for me. I have learned that speaking up for yourself will not get you any where and that you had to play dirty to get ahead with management. My co-workers were great! The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer that I provided services to.
good,"Not where you want to work if you fully support yourself, family etc. Not enough hours. Pay is fine, but it doesn't matter if you are only scheduled enough hours to earn what would be equivalent to that of a minimum wage part time job."
good,Manegment did not care for employees. They abused their manager titles and power. Did not feel that I was part of a team or appreciated for the work or time I put into doing the tasks they gave me.
good,it was a good job. coworkers nice people. just lack up communication between management which caused conflicted with the whole store.other then that good place to work.
good,"A typical day at work would involve stocking shelves, helping customers and cleaning the department."
good,"i learned how many people dont appreciate stockers unless they absolutely need your help. Managment changed all the time, there was hardly any commuincation between associates and middle management and upper mangament causing trouble. Hardest part of the job is finishing everything on time and turning the store over clean. the best part is meeting people everyday."
good,"A typical day at work requires you to clock in on time and do you job and go home. When I first worked there I really felt like I belonged and that it would be a long lasting job, but after being there for a while it changed. You end up doing more work than is really needed, and they never have enough staffing. They are constantly on your case about speed even when you're trying your hardest."
good,"DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA !!!! there was really no work life balance, they hours I received required me to be away from my kids during the most important times of the day, for instance dinner and bedtime. The csm's were young and full of drama often would not listen to employees concerns and problems, very unprofessional. Would often create hostile environments and then talk about it in the break room for everyone to hear VERY GHETTO! nothing but weaves attitudes and Jordans :/"
good,"Typically I do whatever the first shift didn't get done, followed by my own assigned work and whatever management needs done."
good,"A Typical day at work was easy yet challenging, management was non-supportive and didn't guide employees the what they should've. My co-workers all did their best at their job we worked as a great team to get daily task done in a timely manor, the hardest part was not being recognize for hard work everyday and being talked down to by managers. The most enjoyable part was clocking in to start and clocking out once the day was finished!"
good,"Dealing with customers all day, how to work cash register, I enjoy my co-workers,standing on feet all day, talking with co-workers management is fine,learned how to deal with public."
good,When i started it was a great place to work but as management changed it got worse. The typical day was standing in the same spot getting yelled at by customer and enduring rude treatment by some direct supervisors. Co-workers are great but job security make it difficult to build lasting relationships. By far the customers are the hardest part of the job aside from having to do everyone else job way too often. The best part of this job is the hours are very flexible.
good,Overall the job was okay. Not enough workers especially on the overnight staff; at most there was 40-60% of the number of workers for the shift. Horrendous turn over rate. Work completed was never satisfactory for the store manager regardless of staffing. Unrealistic goals in regards to work assigned and completed within time frames.
good,"I do not enjoy working at Walmart as a cashier because it is not stimulating me as an individual. Management is okay, co-workers are good. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the customers."
good,Okay job may work there again may not . There were a lot of unprofessional people who worked for Walmart and the store was very unorganized at times to where I had to clean up so many messes
good,"It was okay. Didn't care about employees much. Made us work multiple departments, even when some of those departments got paid more than we did. Raises were bogus."
good,ok customer and coworkers are usually very nice and friendly. Upper management not so pleasant and harder to please. Lower managers are nicer and will try to help out.
good,Walmart is confused as to how many associates need hired compared to how many cashiers were needed. I was hired for electronics and spent most of my time on a register which let my other work fall behind. Managers forget to give you breaks and treat you poorly.
good,"A typical day consist of stocking the sales shelves, and waiting on walk in customers, with merchandise for fishing and hunting along with the purchases of firearms and ammo."
good,"People are great to work with Management does not work with you "
good,Ge worked like a dog for a not so good pay and you get overlooked unless you are the managers favorite and basically be a brown noser. You meet nice hard working people thats a plus.
good,"Always something to be done in the facility and no matter how much you accomplish, there`s always more to be done. Managers that get promoted are clueless, unprofessional, unapproachable and tend to sometimes be unethical. Most of my co-workers are very hard working folks and really put in a lot to help the company though it is Rarely acknowledged or appreciated. Hardest part of this job is dealing with the managers that think they know everything because they have a degree. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and learning about different cultures and overall the diversity the company displays."
good,they have one manager for every department but they only work early in the mornings and they don't expect to have to help you and only help customers.
good,Very rude and unprofessional management team. But it made me realize what kind of work I enjoy. I was able to train in various departments and meet people that helped me along my way.
good,"I learned what type of manager I don't want to be and what I can do to improve what I observed and become a better worker and hopefully a better manager."
good,"Walmart isn't the best company to work for. They don't take care of their workers at all. I only received a break because the register I worked on would turn off after a certain amount of hours. I usually never received a break, and I generally wasn't allowed to leave from work on time."
good,Wal-Mart management is the worst. They have lack of communication. They don't care about your family emergency. They took so much money away from us this year. Wal-Mart doesn't deserve great workers such as myself.
good,It was an ok place to work at it wasn't that hard of a job and you made pretty good money you could advance the people I worked with were pretty nice
good,"Over all this is a ok place to work. There is room to move up in the company, but that depends on which area you work in. Not a bad place for a first job tho."
good,"love learning new things in life"
good,working for the Walmart company is an great experience for your first job the company police is pretty fair and employee friendly
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for when looking for stability and consistent pay. But when it comes to the treatment of associates that is where they lack professionalism. None of the managers know basic customer service skills, As well as hard work is not appreciated in the company, promotions are given to those based on who you know not what you know."
good,"The schedules for cashiering were hectic to the extreme. One day you would work an opening shift after previously working a closing or late night shift. Most of the employees were nice people which made the work, even when it was slow, mostly enjoyable. The only hard part about the job is trying to calm down an annoyed customer."
good,"I learned how to properly bake different kinds of bread and decorate cakes! A typical day would be coming in and baking bread. Then we would package and price the product for sale. At the end of the day we would prep bread for the next day, as well as clean and sanitize the bakery."
good,I'm sure everyone has heard all they need to about the Company. And it's pretty much all true. Horrible schedules. Ridiculous pay for what the associates put up with. Laughable benefits for those that actually get them. And a poor excuse for a management system. Yikes.
good,Did not meet my needs because manager at the time was not understanding of my household circumstance with my young children and since I was only one to do job correctly and in timely manner there was no negotiation.
good,"Fast paced, must be able to communicate with the public in a positive manner. The hardest part of the job is not knowing when your breaks are on a day to day basis. Sometimes the system literally locks you out due to no break in 4 hrs. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction."
good,"this is a ok place to work the management have their ""picks"". 1047 is the store i was employed at very unprofessional enviroment to work in"
good,"As a cashier, I was the customer facing contact in a super center. Knowing I was way overqualified, and just filling time they pretty much left me alone. If you want to advance you would need to aggressively seek out and apply for advancement opportunities. They will not come to you. You go get them. The hardest part of this job is the weekly variance in schedule resulting in no ability to long range plan things with family/friends."
good,I took this job only because I needed a paycheck. I had heard stories about the company and I can say from being an employee most are true.
good,"Most of my co-workers are fairly nice , management needs more training , overall my store manger is great. I've Been their 1 year and i have never meet the CEO."
good,Its an ok place to work but not a good place to start a career. I'm not looking for a career here but its not a good place to end up working for the rest of life.
good,"Going In To Work And Being Productive."
good,"Work is physically demanding (heavy lifting, bending, stretching, reaching, etc) but perpetual under-staffing combined with a loophole in the labor laws means you could end up working up to ten days in a row without a break."
good,A typical day involved lifting and stacking boxes. Very monotonous and tedious. Not an enjoyable place to work. The hardest part of the job was summoning up the strength to get out of bed every day and go to a job that I hated.
good,"You are told one way to do things, expected to find a faster, cheaper way to complete task.  If you are injured or fail, it is on  you unless you follow the written guidelines. You follow the book, and it is thrown at you for failure to achieve."
good,Unload the trucks and place the items in the appropriate departments for stockers. I learned all the different departments and the items that are classified in those departments. The management was cool and my coworkers were awesome. The hardest thing to do was to get those trucks unloaded in a timely fashion. I did enjoy the job overall.
good,I have learned team work a typical day at work was working at the register. there was not a hard part of the job because I enjoy working with people that was my most enjoyable part of working.
good,When I started to work for Walmart they were closing an old store and opening the new Super Walmart. I helped in both stores at the beginning. I had great management and good co workers. The hardest part of my job was working the night shift with a family . I did enjoy my job and the people I worked with though the night shift didn't work out for me.
good,its a nice place to work with friendly co workers and customers you get decent breaks and a hour lunch during your shift the pay is ok but the benefits could be better
good,As a cashier you're basically disposable. Walmart tells you they appreciate you but as soon as they let one go another one is hired. The hardest part of the job isn't even the rude customers. More times than not its some of the Customer service managers (csm) that I have dealt with. There are a couple of them who just do not know what their doing and have an attitude about everything even helping a cashier which is their job.
good,ok i would like to work around nice people and have a nice maneger to watch and super vice us thats pretty much it and also i would  love to have a great maneger
good,"Management treats you like low life dumb employees. Not appreciative of your hard work, nothing is ever right,"
good,There will be absolutely no advancement when you start working here. Do not fall into the trap thinking it is a good place to work.
good,A typical day at Walmart is very busy. You deal with a lot of customer service. You deal with a lot of merchandise. You learn to always make the customer happy. The one thing I enjoy the most is vacation.
good,"I started working at walmart because i needed a job and fast. I worked there for three years, while the hours were mostly steady, we were grossly underpaid, and understaffed."
good,"they need to put more money into there employees instead of all these stores and then not pay there employees the wages they should be getting. a 20 year employee should not be making less then $20/hr. there starting pay should range from 950 to 10 an hour starting out. the company has the money and resources too. they say there Vet friendly, well they need to show it."
good,"i don't have a single bad thing to say about any sales associate or cashier they are good people."
good,"This place was nice until you realize you are not a favorite, but the pay is great and the hours were good as well. My co-workers were amazing! they were like family. Good days and bad days like any other."
good,It was a hard job because I was pregnant and still working in a warehouse. But the pay rate was good and the managers were very nice
good,help customers day to day with purchases and help to answer whatever questions they might have about there electronics items
good,"a typical day at work would just consist of ringing customers up, and great friendly interactions. They did a good job of staying on top of making sure people received breaks if those were going without being given."
good,"I hated the job, because my managers were incompetent. They would have you work late even when you said you were unable to work. It was a terrible work place."
good,I like the co-workers but the managers do not care about their employers. They need to clean house. They like to take advantage of the co-workers.
good,A typical day at work is stocking shelves helping customers and inventory. I learned how to deal with stressful situations a lot better when it comes to all different kinds of people.
good,"For the 4 years I did learn every aspect of the departments cash office, Deli... etc. I worked at WalMart I thought the way they treated some their employees could have been better"
good,"It was a fine job, I am just very easily made uncomfortable. Actively dealing with people scared me to an extent. I called in a lot due to anxiety or family issues. The management seemed overall nice and welcoming. My Co-Workers equally so. I honestly enjoyed taking breaks more than my working. Holding conversations isn't my strongest ability. So checking out customers tended to be very quiet. Walmart was fine though, I was expecting worse."
good,Overall job performance was ok. The particular store was based off poor management skills. Also a lack of associates that were on duty.
good,"►Follow up on request to ensure issues are appropriately solved"
good,Was my first job out of college and I started at 7.45 an hour and eventually achieved 10.00 an hour by the time I left the organization.
good,This place has plenty of growing opportunities but is a bit unorganized. I enjoy most about this job is my set schedule and receiving some awesome benefits.
good,Worked in a small town. No oppurtunities for growth at particular location. Very old ways of thinking. Didnt acknowledge my experince in customer service or managment.
good,"The environment, was well yet to much hate towards employees, to much racial comments and to much disrespect towards employees."
good,I was a stocker at the Mount Pleasant location for little over 3 months. The job was easy and constant work. The breaks are short and the management could be hard to deal with at times.
good,This organization strictly cares about the income they make instead of employees that work very hard. Managements has no control of there operation.
good,a good job to start off at but to strict one what one has to do and one has to be careful on what to say and do one does learn how to operate machines
good,"Under paid for the hard work you do, terrible management. Coworkers are nice and helpful, some are lazy which makes your job harder. The best part about working here is meeting new people throughout your work day."
good,"There is little to no communication between the managers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart for about the first 6 months I was there, but after a while, it did start to drag a bit. Management really didn't seem to put their best foot forward in terms of how they treated and dealt with their staff."
good,Mcdonalds was the first job that I ever had. They would schedule me to work during school hours and call me in to work on my days off. You could never reach over time.
good,"Work at Walmart had a struggle cause there was so many ad matching that need to done. I learned how to be fast pace and to be able to keep up with the customers. I enjoyed all my co-workers so much I found It exciting to go to work. As for management there was good ones and i had my bad ones cause they had no care in the world if they yelled at you in front of the customers. The hardest part was not getting approval for overrides right away having the customers waiting for long periods of time to just to get managements approval, My enjoyable part of my work experience at Walmart is walk in and see my co-workers smiling faces."
good,This is not the best company to work for I would seek employment somewhere else. It pays a lot because it is a very demanding job.
good,"Management can be a bit much, but the customers are great. I have been working here for 3 years and suddenly they don't like working with school schedules. If you have a closed availability forget about it. Otherwise not too bad of a job."
good,"Always something different. I stocked shelves but never knew where i would be in the store to stock shelves. Good coworkers, i grew up knowing most of them, management is always moody. Way to many for one place."
good,"Walmart is not known for caring for their employees, and my experience was no different. I started as a cashier, and I loved it. I loved seeing people and talking to them and getting to chat while I worked. That part was great. But when I had to use the restroom, or had a problem with a register or a customer, I was SOL; management was spread thin as it was, and they rarely could come help me before ten or fifteen minutes had passed. And if I was especially unlucky, I got saddled with a manager that didn't like me for one reason or another and would be left hanging."
good,Retail is not the same like it use to be. Felt like i was working like a robot and sometimes worked late only to have to come in early in the morning.
good,the store is so understafed that when work needs to be done you have a lot of work that you have to do on your own self with helping costomers and doing your own work also
good,An amazing company to work for in management. The company is very involved in volunteering within the community. Working as management in a warehouse is not enjoyable. extremely difficult to maintain a work/life balance.
good,"Meeting new people, Learning new thing every day new fruits and veg learning  new cultures, Make new fiends standing in one place for long periods,"
good,"Pretty simple job. You get to meet a lot of people. I just didn't like the management at Wal-Mart. They can be very rude, and like to just make up their own rules. Some have a god complex."
good,i fell like theres no future working for walmart its to much work for some associates the managers dont work with your scedule its to much for the pay and quality they give associates dont work here.
good,"they over work you and overall do not care about your well-being. they expect the elderly to pull over 100lbs pallets. they do not care about anyone's outside life, they did not want to fix my schedule because of certain days because of school,"
good,"I enjoyed working there, but Wal-Mart needs to protect their employees more by staying on top of management.  I felt bullied and harassed by management which ultimately ended my job."
good,es un trabajo de momento no sirve para poder crecer como person ni trabajador ya que la empresa solo vela por sus intereces
good,always busy and a lot of variety of work but not always fair and management not great. the co workers were a mixed variety of people and attitudes
good,At Walmart I accepted the position of TLE Service Tech. Typically at work we did oil changes and tire work ranging from mount and balances to flat repairs. I learned that not only are you expected to do your job but are also expected to do the jobs for other departments. Management was usually hard to get to come to that area of the store unless they were there to reprimand someone. My co-workers with the exception of a few people were overall good hard working people.The hardest part of this job was going in day to day wondering when and if I would be fired that day.The easiest part of the job was working with the direct group of people day to day. They claim to respect the individual but after about 30 days that all goes away.
good,Walmart had some really great people who worked with you well. Then there was the others who really did not want to work. Every place has that. It is a huge company who have lost touch with the associates. You don't feel appreciated there. They have a big employee turnover for a reason. Depending on the store manager it can be a good place to work or a really bad one.
good,"cashier that helped whenever and how ever I could"
good,"This is definitely a job you do for the sake of paying rent. You spend 8 hours a night stocking shelves as quickly and as accurately as possible. This task is more difficult than it sounds mainly due to the lack of necessary equipment such as pallet jacks, L-carts, and handheld scanners. You also have to help customers throughout the night though they're pretty cool, management at this Walmart during 3rd-shift is cool too. "
good,"- Walk to fitting room find out what assigned area I had for the day."
good,When i was working they did not care much about the person that i was caring for. They just wanted the money form them. I had to keep bugging them to put the lady i was working for in a home because she needed that kind of care. The pay was not good at all.
good,Wonderful work environment if you love customers as much as I do its a great environment to work. Management ASM CO STORE MANGERS horrible
good,"The management at Wal-Mart is terrible. The customer service managers are very rude and talk to employees very rudely. They would give lunches hours late, and if you got a meal exception it was your fault. There was a lot of favoritism."
good,I would put freight away zone and put returns away. I knew several different areas of the store. If they needed help up front I would go up ans help them.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the area you work in,I worked in several different area's but was always about customer service. I learned the value of team work. Management in my opinion was questionable.Most of my co-workers were great and hard working.The hardest part of the job was making irate customers leave the store happy.The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy."
good,"Management treats subordinates as if they are uneducated, inferior, and an annoyance. Honesty and openness are not displayed in dealing with store management; employees are often surprised with their infractions and blind-sided with disciplinary actions without being given an opportunity to speak to the situation. Pay for cashiers is much less than what should be paid; many live in poverty. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are leaving for the day."
good,"A typical work day was coming to work on time, providing friendly and helpful customer service at all times. Not always was your day enjoyable, but at least you were kept busy."
good,"Being a CSM/cashier can be really fun, with customer and co-workers. I've learned versatility is very important. Communication can be very difficult, at times."
good,"We worked during the hottest time of the year, often without A/C, driving around in a hot van; but the active participation, learning experiences, and the overall challenge made it worth it."
good,its an ok job/low pay hrs aren't constant / management could be better i would not recomed making walmart a career unless desprie
good,"Good place to work , good co workers . Terrible managers tho. I learned alot i can say when i was employeed there. But the managers had a bad attitude and respect for the associates issue"
good,"Most days working at Wal-Mart were just very typical days. Most days were shuttling carts in a large parking lot and into two bays with 8 rows of parking by myself and no help. This also included managers expecting you to pull miracles and such. Lunch breaks and breaks were very standard, 2) 15 minute breaks, and a half hour lunch. These days also included managers coming out and channeling their anger out on you because someone else screwed up. Most assistant managers were very clueless of their job titles, let alone, very clueless of customers and other associates around them. My co-workers were just average or young workers taking their first foot steps into the work force of an actual job. some co-workers would also try and drag you under the bus with them when least expected because they can't hold themselves up when you are very capable of doing so."
good,I meet a lot of great coworkers /customers There safety rules and guide lines were good       they never held any cashier meeting  and for that reason   our rules went for some of  the cashiers along with the communication
good,"La empresa usa muchas personas eventuales lo que hace que el trabajo sea mas pesado ya que cuando han aprendido los chicos nuevos los cambian y de nuevo hay que volver a empezar. La parte gerencial era buena, los compañeros trabajaban a la par de uno y había un buen clima laboral. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es la atención al público ya que los clientes eran  los conocíamos y venían a comprar todos los días."
good,the hardest part was if you are in one department and someone asks you were something is and its not your department then you don't know were it is.
good,I started there as a cashier and ended up doing a few other jobs with in the 9 or 9 1/2 months I was there. No matter what they asked me to do or where they needed me I did it with no issue.
good,"unloaded trucks all day and moved merchandise to the sales floor at night.We had a team of people unloading trucks, usually did about 2-3 trucks a day."
good,"I was an overnight stocker for two years. I'll start with the pros:"
good,"Come in at 7 and open the deli which actually opened for business at 7. Turn on all fryers, rotisserie, put together slicers, fill all empty holes on floor and in deli, as well as wait on customers. Wash racks from soaker from the night shift and start rotisserie. Rotisserie's were to be started by 7:30 as well  as out of date products on the floor and in the deli. take count of how many items are thrown away and how many needs to be produced for that day. Telezon used for ordering, counts, throw aways, pricing and throw away dates. Pull Pizzas and salads from freezer, date and stock shelves while keeping an eye on the deli for customers. Enter information in computer about food temps, freezer and floor case temps.  Wash dishes, start cooking food at 8;00 to be done by 9: 00 for sales to begin. Temp food once it was cooked, while in hot case and keep on track of when products in hot case needed to be pulled,weighed and throw away and sticker made for item by weight.Cook new products,if time is allowed before the ones in hot case expire. If there is another employee coming in then take a 15 minute break,if not then you must wait to someone can cover for you so you can take your break. when new employees were hired ,we were expected to train them. On closing shifts all equipment had to be cleaned,all floors mopped and disinfected. Outside of deli area also was to be cleaned. trash was to be thrown away in the compactor and all boxes were to be put in the bailer. Boil out fryer,clean, and refill with new oil. old grease had to be taken to the back and put in a large grease tank"
good,some stores but not all of them have managers who over step there positions. when you need hours they don't give you the hours. then they give you days where your not available. when you try to speak up it goes in one ear and out the other. there is no connection between manger and associate. i would not recommend working here for more than one year.
good,the people working there are knowledgeable but the management and the pay sucks need an overhaul of the whole management system. but it was OK to me i guess.
good,It was a good place to work. The hours were great. Most of the customers were pleasant and the upper management was good as well.
good,"Lots of physical labor, heping customers, learned a lot about customer service, management, co workers were awesome,"
good,"Overall, for being the age that I was and the experience that I had at the time, it was not a horrible job. The job security, for some, and the low wages will always be a problem for the Walmart company."
good,"in all fairness walmart is a decent place to work. the work itself is all easy. it is the people you work with that can become bothersome and get to you on occasion. the general base of the store you work at depends on the management staff you have, because every store is different."
good,"Stocking products, cleaning the store, setting up store displays and shelving modules. I enjoy being busy and productive - this job definitely provided that. The hardest part about this job was that they undervalue the employees. You are made to feel that you can be laid off or fired at any time for little or no reason at all, with no consideration made for being a hard worker."
good,"The job assignments were usually normal. The store I worked at had managerial changes quite often, so I couldn't really build relationships with the hierarchy. My co-workers were great people who were dedicated to their work. The most difficult part of my job was wanting to stay there. The most enjoyable was being around my associates."
good,"My work was limited to the produce department - where I was the smallest and weakest member of my team. I enjoyed the work itself, for the most part - cleaning and prepping vegetables and going through displays for rotten produce can be weirdly calming. However, we were always short-staffed and I regularly found myself closing by myself. Not to mention that because we were short staffed, my coworkers regularly left extra work for me as they did not have the time to stop and log their donation/throw away items. So I got to do all of their work, clean the back room, and keep track of the floor. Suffice to say, something was always left out."
good,"job is ok for students in high school does not provide much of an advancement opportunity unless of course you are already inn management, black out days , not for me"
good,They cut my hours to where I was barely working at all and whenever I requested a day off they somehow lost the information everytime.
good,"It was fun, had some great co-workers but if you are really close to management you got away with alot of things. I wish it was more organized certain levels of management would tell me different ways to handle certain things instead of being on the same page."
good,"Lots of opportunities for overtime, bonuses, decent pay. Lots of incentives to motivate working hard. Not a lot of time off, do not receive any vacation time until after 2 years with the company."
good,A typical day at work would consist of working with a diverse customer base while providing world class customer service. I've learned how to handle difficult situations. In my experience I've always got along with my co-workers. What I enjoy the most is making customers happy and making sure they will always come back for my services.
good,this job is ok great people schedule is ok pay is to low for the work you preform. not really any flexibility with your hours co workers ok
good,The management staff is a gamble. I had some great manager that I learned a lot from and I had some managers that didn't really care about the people they were just dictators.
good,Walmart started off at a rough paying. I worked 40 hours and they was not willing to work around my school schedule. They always was short handed in other departments.
good,a fast paced job in some areas but where i worked it was good pace and i learned alot but there where some faults some of the manager didnt treat the work nicely but i did have good friends that worked there and we all worked as a team
good,The job duties are pretty routine and once you get it down its fairly easy. The job relies on team work but there is rarely any given by coworkers or managment. But it is possible to complete your job with  little help from others. Unless you make a name for yourself by being selfless and doing alot of other peoples jobs while still excelling at your job you will be just a number. But if you do very well at your job they will show favor to you. You start out at the highest paying job in the company which for me was kind of depressing. There are areas to move around for less demanding jobs but they are in high demand. They say you need to be employed there for a year but you will see people that have been there for 3 months and are able to transfer. I believe if you are good at moving fast waking up early youll do great. Must stay physically fit as well. Ask ALOT of questions.
good,"This job was a part time short term just for the fact that I was a full time student and the pay, benefits and employees where not that great at sometimes. but it was a job for the moment."
good,Great work environment because of the coworkers I had we had a blast in the back. It was like having an extended family. A lot of favoritism especially with my supervisor and you could tell who she liked and didn't like which had bad take on the work place. Overall it wasn't a bad job and like I said the only reason I was happy there was because of my coworkers.
good,"learned all aspects of working in deli, bakery and produce departments. I had never worked for such a huge industry before and I learned a lot, made new friends and made a decent wage."
good,"I enjoy my job. However, I would like to get in my professional career ""Human Services"". I love working with children and adults. I would like to make more of a positive impact in others lives."
good,"typical day was very laboring, fluctuating hours so you are never guaranteed 40 a week. management was good and bad, hardest part was the physical labor many people could not keep up. best part of the job was the pay."
good,Walmart is a good part-time job or additional job for extra money. The pay isn't that great but can put a little change in your pocket for a rainy day. People interaction is great. A good place to meet a diversity of people.
good,you can not live on walmart pay because they cut your hours. if they did not cut your hours if would not be a bad place to work
good,"Worked as an overnight stocker for a year and a half. Raises were minimal $0.40, even though I was one person doing a job that was supposed to have 3 people according to some management. You were assigned isles, and if you happened to finish early they would rush you to another isle where someone wasn't working and ""ask"" you to help them out. The only people who actually seemed to enjoy this job where the ones that weren't working hard and always had help."
good,"tons of work to do always helps time go by fast in a busy work place"
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful, you always do the best you can but it seems like when you can't you get discouraged and treated like you aren't doing a good job. The work is tough and at the same time it can make you sick, but for me I was taught that you have to work through it even if the management isn't great it is still a job. My co. Workers are the only ones that actually make the job enjoyable we all talk about the same things and our problems with our roles for this company. The hardest part about my job is the stress the goes with it. Nothing is ever good enough and you're pretty much just another number for the company, not an actual person."
good,"People are what it is all about. The hardest was following policy as far as overtime goes, the associates had to give that time back. That really hurts the morale when they put the time in when needed, then it is taken back."
good,"Too many managers, and God forbid if 7 managers tell you to do something at the same time and you only get the job done for 6.  Worked there for 6 years.  Save yourself the stress and disappointment. Stay away"
good,Never a dull moment at Walmart. It was very busy with down times. Harder work depending on the department. You did have to work in more than your own department so being able to zone suffered as result. You sometimes had to be superman in order to realistically accomplish all the tasks management had on their agenda.
good,"You never went to your breaks on time or your lunch until they told you could go. They don't excuse having the flu so if your sick, you still have to go to work."
good,They say Walmart is a family oriented place but it isn't. they don't take the employee and their personal life into consideration if they are having an emergency if some sort.
good,Training wasn't done well by managers. Left new employees to learn process on own with little assistance from older staff. Which allows for problems to occur.
good,"Laid back and easy work, but can be frustrating during the initial learning period"
good,It is a good place to work to bring a better outlook on your resume. It's retail and the hours flexible to suit your  needs.  Its a good way to learn a different are of work if your had no experience
good,"-A typical day at work you will find the phones ringing off the hook, patients wanting to know why its taking so long for rx's."
good,"It's an alright workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my coworkers and learning from them. When I worked there, they only paid $7.65 starting, which was a negative of the job, but now they pay $9.00 starting. They don't start many people out at full time, so if you need a part time job this job wouldn't be to bad."
good,It is a good place to work for a first time job. You will meet a lot of co-workers who are friendly and nice. You help the customers with what they are looking for.
good,"I think I have seen happier people working at Mcdonalds. It paid the bills and that is something to be thankful for, but not much else."
good,A typical day of work was doing gun work scanning and putting out freight as well as making sure things were priced right. the management there was good. in the most part helpful. The co workers you could always count on to help out when need. The hardest part was working till late and being back early for the next morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customers who came in and helping them to find what they needed and what is the best for them.
good,"I worked at the service desk, and did financial transactions for customers, handled returns, cashed checks, also I worked the layaway desk, site to store, and pick up today.  I also filled in as a customer service manager."
good,Productive work place. But employees need to be treated better in all aspects. Employees deserve pay raise. The pay was not fair for the amount of work that you had to do.
good,I had an issue with unnecessary drama where I worked. There were also a few issues with favoritism in management. Overall not a bad place to work. 1 hour lunches and appropriate breaks. I think a lot of it depends on what department you work in.
good,The enviroment was not for me. I did not receive credit on majority of the tasks that I completed. The work place was very unorganized. I can say it was a learning experience.
good,"This company is one of the top fortune 500 companies that has recently invested in training/development and hiring so they should be pushing with better benefits soon.  They have high need for quality management and makes it frustrating to work for some that are incompetent.  Overall, however, Walmart is a front runner in training and development."
good,"Good work for anyone who wants to be a general laborer. Great pay for the hours that are provided, however full-time isn't an option until you have been part of the company for over a year, regardless of how much work you put into your job."
good,A typical day at work is very busy and productive. My co-workers are very good to work with and the management could be a little better. Theres not really hard part of my job any task i am given i complete. I enjoy working in a nice fast pace friendly environment. From working here
good,I enjoyed my job as a inventory control specialist. I enjoyed working with the customers. The managers and associates were pleasant.
good,Management and pharmacists are overworked. Learned to have more patience that I have ever had with the elderly. Hardest part is being on your feet with no breaks! Loved the patient contact!
good,"Worked outside most of the time. I learned how to use a motorized cart caddy, learned some more about retail in general. Management was alright, but there were so many different managers it was hard to get to know anyone. I did not have man co-workers in my department, but the ones I had were not too bad. The hardest part of the job would be that it was manual labor outside, during all months of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to enjoy good weather."
good,the managemnet needed work but coworkers where nice. pulled pallets over 2500 lbs a night. needs to be people frendly managment was rude to empoyees talked down to them.
good,"The managers at Walmart were not very easy to talk to. They were extremely rude and condescending. The work hours were scarce, only maybe 20 a week. The customers were a joy. They were mostly nice and friendly. The best part of the job was interacting with them."
good,worked with customers. got a long with the other cashiers and some of the management. kept my workspace cleaned. loved the job.
good,"long hot days, i learned that they will use you till they cant anymore, they bought in people from the outside to be trained as managers by associates."
good,"Was a good experience working there but the customers there were so annoying, and sometimes you had cover other departments that you know nothing about, plus the pay sucks"
good,"In the past year or so, Wal-mart has pushed for a more clinical setting in the work place, which involves many more job duties to perform, such as MTMs and immunizations, and increasingly more management duties to perform, which end up being on our own time, while at the same time decreasing our staff hours.  Somehow it all gets done, and my satisfaction still comes from taking care of our customers.  I have learned how to manage over the years, do coachings, watch the budget, encourage my staff, do MTMs and IMZs, job interviews, keep track of and direct the OTC department, do scheduling, etc.  The hardest part of the job is trying to help a customer and failing.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfaction of helping a customer, in whatever way that might be."
good,"I've been working at my store for a year now, and I do enjoy what I do, and working with the other Floor Associates in my department. However, the everlasting issue seems to be that our management doesn't stay consistent."
good,In the beginning it was a company that was for the associates and customers. Now it all about money. How can a person pay their bills on 28 hours a week. If you take off for being sick or your family you get points against you. Assistant Management works unbelievable amount of hours
good,This was a great job to have while i studied in college. I enjoyed learning new things and developing to my customer service and people skills.
good,Walmart is great place for you to work and go to school its just not a career and somewhere I would want to retire. I love working there its great people.
good,"Working as a cashier is very tiring and very stressful.  Our store has become very busy and we are so short on staff.  Long long line-ups breaks running far behind and managment  that doesnt seem to care. By the end of an 8 hour shift body is sore and extremely exhausted.  "
good,"When looking for promotion here it seems more about who you are friends with and not the job you do. Got passed over a couple times by other DMs that had attendance issues, as well as merchandising problems, and no management skill."
good,not a very good company to work for always changing hours and giving less time no benefits under trained managers not able to preform jobs right a lot of of the buddy system there
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits but it can become alot if your not a people's person. I enjoy the scenery and getting to know different backgrounds of my co workers. Mangement team needs a little inprovement but overall its managable.
good,"I learned that Walmart does not care if your in labor, they will fire you for calling in. I did enjoy greeting and speaking to customers."
good,"Management is very uncaring. "
good,"There were interesting or funny conversations with a variety of people that I never heard elsewhere. I was often so busy that time went by faster for most days. I got used to serving people's different preferences in bagging and what they needed help with. A lot of coworkers came and went, so I learned how to work with a lot of different personalities, backgrounds, and experience."
good,A typical days work is very busy assisting the customers with any concerns as well as scanning and bagging their merchandise. I have  learned a lot about customer service. Management is pretty good about working with us if we need schedule changes or have any concerns about anything. The hardest part of my job is dealing with some of the rush times as well as unhappy customers. The best part about my job is my coworkers are really great and we all get along really well!
good,short of staff. a lot of hours with little to no days off. very exhausting. overwhelming. Mangement staff was no where to be found. was out of the office
good,"Typical day was going in cleaning up the tables and chairs before we opened up in the mornings. Learned how to make a pizza. Mgr. was fair never showed any favorites treated everyone the same. Co-workers were ok I guess. Hardest part of the job was people wouldn't stay employed to long, enjoyable part was customers."
good,"You would come into work, go directly to the back and clock in, get assigned a register, organize and clean up your station and then turn your light on to start accepting customers."
good,Its fast paced. The job was easy. I learn to bin freight. Management could have been better. There was no morale. Co-workers was nice.
good,Walmart is not the ideal place for me to work I feel as if management needed to step up I enjoyed interacting with the costumers
good,I was a cashier but I did like to help out different departments when the store was slow. This was a great place for me to grasp the understanding of how best to associate with customers in different situations and come to a compromise as a solution.
good,"Walmart is a good starter job, but they don't have decent wage increases and they have a high turn over of staff. The hours may vary, but the management was nice."
good,this job was based on the business making a production and not on how well they treated their employees. you had to work holidays that should have been family time (a little incentive would of been nice) the point system that they used was childish
good,OK place to work.  Management was never on the same page. Changed the rules every other day. Not consistent with any thing they did.
good,While working at Walmart I had some of the best co-workers I could have. They were all very friendly and helpful. It was most enjoyable getting to know them and make friends. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to do my job the correct way without conflicts. Many times customers would get upset with Walmart policies. Management also had a problem respecting and treating all employees the same. They also made it very difficult to be friends with a co-worker Overall it was an okay place to work.
good,Did more than what we were suppose to do. Managers never trained us to do anything they wanted done and we would get in trouble for it.
good,"i worked over night shift, the atmosphere of the work area was negative, just plain out depressing. so many of my co workers hate the job, because of management."
good,The environment was Great. Coworkers were Great and dedicated to their job and were willing to help customers with problems and questions. the company was only concentrated on the money and not the workers.
good,"If you work hard and avoid interacting with all the managers, you will do well.  The more you interact with management, the worse your time with Walmart will be.  "
good,"I learned about multitasking and safety."
good,"The managers were kind of lost when dealing with associates and customers issues. The benefits were not a big deal for a store associates liek walmart which was supposed to be like wow. Overall, I hate worling in retails stors because of my experience at walmart."
good,"a typical workday at walmart began by opening the first registers doing a safe count, delegating breaks and lunches in a timely manner. as well as customer complaints"
good,"I think Walmart is a great place to work, I have worked in produce for the past six years, I enjoy working with my co workers, the job is not hard at all, and I like to meet new people everyday."
good,A typical day at work with walmart would be an everyday meeting talking about the the strenths and weaknesses of our work. What i learned from Walmart would be working on so many differnt tasks is easy when you have a timed schedule for everything in each department. Management wasnt the best but you always had to work with what you have. Co-workers nice and kept to them selfs unless a customer needed something and we would do the best we could to meet that customers needs. The hardest part of the job is the work load every night. What i liked most about working with Walmart was the satisfaction of customers i delt with made me a better employee.
good,this particular wal-mart suffers from to many managers wanting to promote their friends instead of those who are fit for the job. Ther is a daily struggle of management wanting things done the way they say just so they can be celebrated and praised by the store manager. These actions lead to many of the lower associates be left out to dry with out the support of the member of management that told them do do certain action that may not be the proper or ethical way of handling daily practices. On a day by day basis management makes it harder to want to come into work let alone give it everything you have to get the job done. The best part of the daily activities is just being able to look to the person on the left or right you and knowing they feel the exact same way plus being able to interact as well as joke with co-workers and customers.
good,"I really don't like that you can't have a set work schedule, and the pay really isn't great either. the management was decent, and my co workers were pleasent"
good,"If you can handle being taken advantaged of then you may just survive at Wal Mart. as a overnight stocker I never new what isle I would be working. one night is may be cereal, the next could be dairy. "
good,"Wal-Mart's hours cut out time during the day that you could spend with family. The management would ask myself or a few others to do their tasks for them. For example, the signing that managers are supposed to put up around the store."
good,"Typical day is always different from day to day, working with different kind of people and customers, and management not always trulyful."
good,I believe this company needs to care more about their associates. They give a very high work load to each person without any help. The compensation is very little compared to the work that each individualis required to do.
good,"Most of the time I was there, most of the other department supervisors would assign me jobs to fulfill there needs and not let me complete my initial job duties."
good,"Wouldn't recommend the job has no consitinecy in areas mostly importantly such as, when your getting paid seeing how you work off the books."
good,"Checking out the customers after they have finished shopping, and sometimes actually having certain customers look for me when they were ready to check out made my day over and over again."
good,"Trato con los clientes."
good,To me the system is a failure and they do what they do. When we are under staffed they say we are full. Trucks come in with too much 90% of the time and a lot gets thrown away(Produce).
good,"Era para ser na Tesouraria, mas tinha que exercer outras funçoes"
good,"•	Communicated with customers of diverse backgrounds and temperaments"
good,"Great place to work, Co-workers with positive attitudes, non-stressful atmosphere, Dependence of leadership skills"
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers. Once the learning period was over, I got into the job. I think I'm a natural cashier. It was difficult to deal with some customers at times, but there's always someone there to help."
good,"I worked there a short time, sometimes the work was hard and the was never anyone to come and help when needed. The management were all about show."
good,"I worked at this store for a little over a year and it seemed to get a little worse everyday. Management was bad from the start, they made horrible schedules for people and they made it hard for me to do my job as a front end manager because i never had enough cashiers and i was usually blamed for it by either customers or management. I do not recommend working at this Walmart you will regret ever applying here"
good,"Every time we got a raise they cut hour."
good,"If your just starting out in pharmacy I think Walmart is a good place to start. It all depends on the people you work with. High tech turnover is a big problem. I cant tell you how many people I had to train just to have them quit, or fail the certification exam. In the area I worked, we had alot of low-income patients. Some of them are very nice but alot of them are very rude and expect everything handed to them on a silver platter because they have Gold Medicaid Card. You make a mistake billing the insurance: ""I dont pay fo my medicine."" Medicaid does'nt cover or requires prior auth: ""I dont pay fo my medicine."" You get the picture. If you can overlook all that then Walmart might just be the place for you."
good,"It was an okay place to work. But the stress level one can expect to walk into form day to day is unimaginable. A typical day can range from clocking in and immediately be yelled at for something you have no control of, to something that somebody said was your fault just to escape blame. There really is no enjoyable part to work for that place."
good,Typically I am looking for markdowns and missed money or markups so that the companies books won't be all jacked up. The pay is horrible for the workload they require. And now they have even made the annual raises even lower.
good,management needs to be better treat associates like dogs and don't pay enough to the employees managemnet will have you in every deoartment working but would not pay you the pay rate for duing so most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers making them smile even when they had a rough day getting to now the regulars and being acknowledged by them every time they see you made me feel good knowing i helped person or made their day by just smiling or asking how their day was
good,"Unprofessional-ism, unethical actions, favoritism, and political surprisingly-- seeing as barely anyone has a high school diploma. There is constant drama, and unnecessary amount of gossip. I loved some of the people I worked with at this establishment, but a lot of the times, it doesn't matter who you are or how hard you work you will get you head stepped on, and the person backstabbing you will not think twice about it."
good,"you're constantly being worked, you have no time for yourself. The supervisors blame you for their mistakes, it's a busy busy day which I don't mind."
good,when i need helped i had no one to help me so i did the best i could i learn how to help other people with the stuff that i learned i was a go team plyer i was all over the store helping people with there needs
good,"Majority of the customers you speak with are rude, the management is terrible constantly changing things and over looking those who deserve advancement. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you really need a job"
good,"Walmart was an okay job. It a pretty good gig for someone who doesn't have too much responsibility yet. The people I worked with were so-so. While most lived for making drama, I made a few lasting friends there. One word for Management : Shadey. They like who they like and everyone else is just there. Management can be just has bad ( if not worse!) than the associates when it came to gossiping. When it come to write up, they will do it to anyone who will let them get away with it. If you're going to work here , if you feel a write up is wrong then fight it! Management will walk all over you if you let them."
good,Shifts were very long and management was always difficult to work with. Virtually no benefits and the Wal-Mart call-in system made it very difficult to take any time off at all for any reason.
good,My coworkers were great to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people. The hardest part of my job was the standing.
good,"Started off a cashier/cart pusher. I was asked to learn certain departments for no pay raise for example Customer service, electronics and Meat."
good,"I enjoy my job, but it is very tiring and repetitive--you only get to sit down during your break times. The worst part of my  job is dealing with disrespectful customers."
good,It would be okay and normal. I learned how to work the register. I don't think the management is up to level like it supposed to be. Some co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unruly customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.
good,Love the customer and showing the best customer service skill that I have. Don't like the scheduling that comes with this job.
good,For a company that talks about culture and how much it cares about its employee it doesn't show much when you are working for the company itself.
good,enjoyed helping other people including patients.  I enjoyed the consistant   work schedule.  I wouldn't mind working in a simaliar field of work.  I liked the atmosphere.
good,"This Walmart is pretty filthy and is all about making sales no matter what the cost. Even if that cost is it""s worker's sanity and health. There is never enough associates and those they do hire have very little hours. It took me 3 years just to get a full time position and I even had to transfer stores to get it."
good,It is a lot of work for average pay. The store is kind of a mess and the expectations are kind of intense. However you do have a chance to become a manager fairly quickly and have a chance for a raise yearly.
good,Walmart is focused on making money and making sure that they don't loose any of it. They don't utilize their good and hard working employees. The people i work with are what make my job bearable. I have been looked over for numerous positions that i was overly qualified for.
good,This was my first ever job so I can't really complain. However the only thing that irked me was the way employees were treated and how it was difficult to go up the career ladder due to ethnic favoritism.
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked here, because most of my coworkers were enjoyable to be around. I would only suggest this to people who are desperate for work."
good,I had just worked there for 3 months when my 1 yr old got sick and was being put in the hospital for a while due to health problems
good,"Ok place to start a job.  If you have any ambition in life, take the skills you learn and move on.  Pay is not that great unless you are upper management.  From that podium that they put themselves on, if you are not their best friend you will never move up in the company regardless of how well you out perform others."
good,"Being a member of customer service which consist of working with many different types of people, personalities and and emotions, i've learned how to keep a consistent attitude and stay positive and productive."
good,What can you say about Wal-Mart. You have your good and bad days. They are not one for vacation time or missing days. You work holidays usually and stay on your feet all day.
good,"Occasional meetings at the beginning of shifts (nights) followed by working in the area you're told to work in (irregular jobs)."
good,i work in the Electronics Dept at the Pelham Walmart. I love interaction with the customers. I love knowing that I make a difference in their product choices and am able to help them with their shopping needs whether it is helping with product choices or giving directions to another product that isn't being sold in my department
good,"The store I worked was great cant say that about the store in torrance, ca alot of managers were always picking and choosing their favorites and alot of thefts"
good,Wal-mart is a nice place to work. They give you a good amount of hours starting off. But the pay never amounts to all the work you do in one days work.
good,Go in get the job done to the best of your ability. Take care of your customers after thats what you are there for. Management can't be everywhere and like when you can solve problems on your own.
good,"Most customers are pleasant and very interesting to meet and get to know. You learn different cultures and life experience. Helping with different situations helps you learn different parts of the company. Most of the people love customers and try to develop the family experience when visiting. The lack of respect from those few individuals makes work difficult. Most of the time from management, customers who are upset and very rude with threatening associate does not help. But overall learning how to deal with consumers and their issues helps make for a great experience in learning if customer service is something an individual really wants to do."
good,title says everything i could express here. management is very biased and there is nothing in place to deter favoritism.
good,management doesnt work with your schedule if you are in school. co workers are friendly and very helpful! hardest part of the job to remeber all of the codes to the register when checking out customers
good,"Poor management, okay working environment, I learned how to work with the general public and learned what it meant to deliver great customer service."
good,Co-workers are fun to be around. Management needs a little working with as far as favoritism and rudeness. A typical day as an employee at Walmart is stressful in my opinion
good,"2-3 photoshoots of many ages, take photos, upsell, check out. 20-30 passports take photos, cut, stamp and ring customer through, stuff animals do the wish dance and do up adoption certificates, ring customer through"
good,"I worked in the food department. I was a floor person,assisted customers. I enjoyed helping people all day. I learned a lot about food. My co-workers were good."
good,"My typical day, well, wasn't the greatest. The store I worked at was severely understaffed and therefore the staff was over worked. As a cashier and frozen/dairy stocker, there just wasn't enough people to do the work. Our store manager was not the brightest. He purposefully over worked us to the fullest. It was a very difficult job and very little job security. I honestly don't have much good to say about working at this store. The only good part about it was making new friends and regular customers that I still speak with on a weekly basis."
good,"Walmart had its perks but it also had a lot of bad experiences. The team I worked with was awesome, but due to management, it made it an overall bad experience. They were notorious for pulling people from different departments to work in a completely foreign area just because they didn't want to hire more people. My immediate team had their ducks in a row. I would probably go back to work at Walmart if I was compensated for the actual work I performed."
good,If need a job quick than Wal-Mart is a great place to start but I wouldn't recommend them for permanent employment. The hours aren't the best and the pay is about as good as working at McDonalds
good,"I enjoyed working with the public. I got to experience a lot of different jobs like cashier, sales associate, stocker, truck unloader, layaway associate, and store organization. It was good job to start off at to gain some work experience."
good,"The specific store that I worked for had many management issues. They had a new store manager each year in the last four years. Also, they did not work well with college students and time desired off for important events. Lastly I loved my job that I was doing there and was very good at serving customers to their satisfaction."
good,I didn't learn much I learn mostly about the cellular phone service and its process. the co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Management was mostly into to paper work less into management.  The hardest part of the job was long hours with no work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the hour lunch breaks.
good,Walmart really needs to look at each Individual and how they give reviews and raises. They don't treat their good hard workers very well.
good,This particular Wal-Mart I would never refer someone to work there. They are never fully staffed and you are always doing the managers jobs. They cut your hours and only pay you for a little bit of your time.
good,e uma empresa grande mas que nao se preocupa com seus empregados
good,"The job is ok if you just got out of high school. You won't make it on our own for long with the pay rate. So t's best to get another job, well a second job. The management is horrible. Supervising is horrible. Coworkers are horrible. Rude customers. Rude managers with smart mouths."
good,"The experience at Walmart helped me in many ways. First was customer service , on a average day, Walmart gets over a hundred customers and being a cart pusher, it was my responsibilty insuring the customer was taken care of . My duty was making sure the customer was offered a cart and any assistance on merchandise , if the merchandise was too heavey for example , a 40 in TV , I had to carry the TV to their car and unload . "
good,Keeps you on your feet and very busy. Management is very shaky and disorganized. Most of the other workers do the bare minimum and are very rude/ impatient wit customers. I did not enjoy working for this company and was making 9.50 an hour as a department manager.
good,"On a regular day, my fellow associates are all really nice and helpful people. most of the management at my store is too. its only our store manager and the manager that works in groceries that make it less than great job. they hardly hire any one for full time, and when they do, they get cut hours. when part times are receiving 40 hours a week in most cases and full timers get 30-32. the sporadic schedule is nothing to fancy either. and at my store 3279 many people complain about managers changing our schedules the day before when we have to plan around our schedules. and ive asked multiple people but ""no one"" knows who could of possibly done it. kind of irritating when there is no one at fault, then you are bashed at because you had to stay home the day you were supposed to. u had to be out of town or at a doctors meeting but because no one knows who changed your time they get to blame you. as long as i get a job where my days arent changed within 30 hours of me checking my schedule im happy. but this has happened far too many times."
good,"TLE was pretty much ignored by management unless there was a problem, or they need us to stock a different area. Short staffed, spent a lot of time stocking. Too many mistakes were allowed to happen. Time was always a big problem"
good,"A typical day would include performing my job specific duties "" asset protection "" "
good,"The overnight stocking aspect of the job was strenuous and a time annoying. The co workers did not really communicate. Especially with me. The management wanted me to stay on, I feel it was because they did not want to lose anyone. I really did not care for the job."
good,"Although Walmart is great company to begin your work experience with it has its flaws. Management was not all that great. Some Managers were much much better than others. I learned a lot at Walmart, the main thing I learned is that great customer service goes a long way. I had some of the most awesome coworkers you could ask for, We laughed and enjoyed each other while still doing a great job. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance my work life and personal life, I hardly ever had time to really enjoy myself during my leisure time. The most enjoyable part was the customers that put a smile on your face. it made my day that much better."
good,a typical day at work. not really fast paced so time goes by slow. Mainly stocking shelves and creating displays all day. I learned how to stock shelves and create displays. My co workers were great. I met a lot of people there. hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers. most enjoyable part was when it was time to clock out.
good,"You keep showing up to work because your co-workers brighten your day, but management is all ways watching the bottom line today, even if it means losing it tomorrow."
good,"Working at Walmart was great. The hours were awesome but it was hard to plan around them."
good,"never stay in your department, horrible pay, none to short breaks, bad benefits, bad training, bad hours, nice co-workers, mean managers"
good,"I was constantly busy on my feet for most of the day. The staff was great and they had a lot of fun working. The hardest part of the job, was finding the merchandises if they were not where they were suppose to be."
good,"Great company,I really liked working for them.I was able to gain a lot of over time work. Pay wasn't that great for the amount of labor."
good,I hated working at walmart tire and lube express. Same problems everyday. No one wanted to step up and be a manager. Do not suggest working here.
good,"Everyday of work, I would open my register and turn my light on. Once customers noticed my line was open, my shift from there was very productive. My co-workers were the best! But unfortunately, most of my managers were not the greatest just because some were rude and didn't do their job as far as helping me when I came to them with some issues I had. The hardest part of my job at Walmart would be trying my best to get everything a customer had in their cart scanned, bagged and cashed out quickly when we were very busy. The most enjoyable part of my job was becoming friends with a lot of other associates."
good,A typical day was pretty strenuous due to them not havin many people in the department to do the essential job functions. I would say the job was fairly easy. I loved working with the customers and interacting with different people.
good,"A typical day at work would include running customer service, helping customers in anyway I could. What I learned is that Walmart takes anything back no matter when it was bought. Management wasnt so good, never stand behind you and your decision. I new my Job very well, but was never recognized for that. Co-workers, some were great others not so much. The hardest part of my Job was having to return stuff knowing how long they have owned it. The most enjoyable would be working with the public."
good,I enjoy meeting people and talking with them. I work odd hours which keeps me from family time.  Would like a more steady schedule to where I can spend more time with family.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, about how to talk and relate with people to better help them enjoy their time at our store. "
good,"Not stocked with items, most of the time. Some of the management was terrible. I don't believe that all the walmarts are the same, however the one I worked for was a bad experiance."
good,"I worked in the electronics department. A typical day insist of putting out product, binning product and of course assisting customers. The customers you meet and coworkers you grow to become a family with made some days okay. Managers aren't dependable and they get on you a lot of times about things they do too. The job wasn't really hard just having to deal with the place was."
good,"Aprendi que todos deviam ter respeito um pelo outro, e tratarmos com toda a cortesia."
good,Very fast past work and no time to do anything else. Time goes by fast but management isn't that great. Very moody workers and office people. Nothing every goes good.
good,my co workers were great thats what i miss the most is working with them. management was very poor we went threw so many managers. i also loved being a help to the customers and making them happy.
good,"With my experience as a Walmart associate in two different stores, Walmart can be 'just a job' for most who have been employed here. Of course, friendly and fast return Customer Service with any customer and sales oriented business is a Must in order for the company to survive. Walmart is huge nationally, but so are their employee turnover rates. It is my opinion that Managerial experience, care, concerns, and priorities are very important where associate/ employee turnover rate is concerned. My first 4-5 yrs as a Walmart were my best due to management that cared not only about his associates and their well-being, but implemented a positive teamwork environment which resulted in a lesser associate turnover rate, positive associate moral and associates that held real smiles, liked/ loved their jobs, and carried a true positive wilingness to help eachother, a clean and organized store, high sales, fast and friendly Customer Service in all departments, resulting in AWESOME returning customers and sales. Management switches happen, but I haven't experienced or seen any of all I have mentioned since that manager left,"
good,"I would open the shop ,get computers online,change oil ,do tire work and also customer service."
good,"I enjoy working with people and seeing new faces, I learned how to use a cashier machine, management was great very supportive, my co-workers were also great got along with each and one of them being able to help each other out and one another, there is no hard part of the job I enjoy challenges and love to fight each and one of them out, the most enjoyable part of this job is customer service I enjoy working with people and even being able to put a smile on a customer face when they have had a rough day."
good,"I enjoy fast pace environments, however I didn't enjoy working at the location since it was right next to a very judgmental college. When I worked here, I wore wigs due to my hair falling out, and everyday I would get negative comments regarding what I looked like and how weird I was (I was 18/19 at the time). My manager, also the people I worked with as a cashier, all stood up for me when I was being shot down. I learned how to also be brave enough to stand up for myself. I learned a lot of what its like to work with the public, sometimes its easy, other times its hard. If someone was a few dollars short, I would give them money to cover it from my own pocket. This job requires a lot of patience, kindness, respect, being able to move fast, and being polite and sociable all at the same time."
good,"Worked the front line and you had to make sure to be speedy.  I can't say I learned anything new here.  Management was alright but at times it was really hard to get help.  Co-workers didn't really get a chance to talk or anything, pretty much work alone because you don't really get a chance to slow down. Hardest part is standing for 8 hours straight. Enjoyable part was meeting some interesting customers."
good,I enjoy my days at work for the most part but i need them to work with me on my schedule and its as if they dont care im a single mother doing this on my own and i have a certain schedule i can work whichis why need a new job.
good,"A good job for college students looking for temporary work."
good,"it was fine, did not like it much, not everyone was friendly, everyone disliked the job. no positive people, had to deal with alot of angry customers"
good,"the people working in the pharmacy were top notch they and pt's were the reason i enjoyed and went to work everyday, what was so enjoyable at this job was the ability to learn something new everyday, something i really enjoy"
good,"A typical day at work consist of standing for 8 hours checking and bagging the customers items. If they need help you assist them or get a manager. The managers are pretty quick about getting to the customer, but they usually are upset with us if we couldn't help them. Some managers are quick to anger and point fingers at the employees because they have that ""right"". The hardest part of my job is not knowing the type of people you are dealing with. You get customers who can't see, hear , or even speak all the way to customers who came through your line with tons of food and not enough money. The easiest part is scanning the items and bagging them, but the most enjoyable is being able to effectively communicate and help the customer."
good,"great part time job and they work around my schedule, my manager is great and supportive, "
good,I worked for Walmart for 3 1/2 years. I swore that i would never work for them again unless 100% completely desperate... They treat their over night shift like garbage and don't give them the respect they deserve. Over night shift puts out all of their products and they are the reason they actually have something to sell during the day. I worked over night and i seen just how rude and obnoxious day shift can truly be.
good,"Pharmacy Mgr brags about having multiple wives & about being in Viet Nam war although he isn't old enough to have even been born during Viet Nam war. "
good,"a lot of work ,a lot of orders little pay and Bosses barking orders for u to be an robot and Customers have nasty attitudes and are very demanding and any clean up and holidays are horrible"
good,"Overall the job was ok, Scheduling was a nightmare because they expect you to be available all the time. There was no set schedule since your hours rotated and when your first hired it is under temporary seasonal."
good,Walmart is a decent job if you really need to get by. I can't really envision anyone working there long term being that there are not many benefits.
good,"When I was working there, that Walmart was under different management. I'm not sure if it's better now but when I worked there it wasn't great. Co-workers often stayed to themselves, hardly ever got to talk to management. Best part of the job was dealing with the more enjoyable customers."
good,picking and binning frieght. Working in the freezer was the hardest part of the job. They never rotated amongst other IMS associates so the same two associate had to do it. Great co workers and the customers were the most enjoyable part about this job.
good,Not career oriented enough i'm looking for a career not just any job. i want to work for a company where i have a endless amount of growth and learning oppurtunity. somewhere where i can promote up quick and learn a lot of different areas in the field
good,This company is another example of a family owned business losing its core values and hiring an outside CEO to run customer service and employee relations into the ground to make more money for himself.
good,if they could get there management to show respect for the there associates instead of always belittling them. it would be a great place to work
good,This company do not show any interest on your life outside of the company. The managers' in so many word's try to make it seem like you have to put the company before your family and health. Some co-workers are very easy to bond with and some are just flat out rude. I've learned if you need something you have to learn and do it yourself. The hardest part is trying to satisfy people. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually meeting people who truly care and bonding with the everyday customers.
good,Sloppy management.  The work schedule was set however you are expected to be flexible.  Impossible to get full time employment.
good,A typical day at work was busy and exciting. I learned to work a wider work area while still maintaining satisfied customers.
good,A typical day here is an understatement. I helped move items and products to new aisle and build new aisle. I also helped stock new products and maintain a healthy work environment.
good,"my original store in AZ, store 3833, was fantastic in management, culture, co-workers and sense of satisfaction. My current store in PA is the complete opposite."
good,Always busy with different tasks and customers with lots of questions. A good feeling to help someone find exactly what they are looking for.
good,"I Learned how to stock safetly, the management was OK and also some of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to stock at different lanes and not having a stable schedule. The most enjoyable is you get to work with alot of workers and meet alot of people."
good,very busy environment with co-workers who are strong and serious about what we do plenty of laughs with one another. customer based environment friendly front end supervisors and work ethics.
good,"Management is not very aware of the needs of employees, and compensation is terrible for the position I held. As a key holder, and a manager of 80 people I feel I should have been making more."
good,Learned how to carry out orders from management and give customer service to those who needed help. This was a rewarding position because i had to become an expert on the department I was working inn.
good,"Walmart  biggest problem. They took most of control and what manger  has to say . When I started working , You whew if  you had a problem . You knew it wasn't going beyond the room  For the most part walmart was good company work for . For the most part my co- workers til is my friends.  That was I miss the most., Not working with them."
good,Wal-mart can be a great company depending who you work with. The friends you make at work make this company good. Management could be better.
good,Walmart is a decent company to work for. If you don't mind no more than 40 hours a week.Management isn't always great they'll work with you 40% of the time. It's a tough job if you can't work alone and barely any co workers when you need them the most. The customers make the job worth it. The regulars always making conversation and laughing.
good,A typical day at work would usually be unloading the general merchandise truck in which it may run smooth and it may not depending on the number of workers that show up and if everything on the truck is still standing like it should be. Management team is ok sometimes they come sometimes you have to go and find them. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers find everything they need. the hardest part of the job is doing the job with a three man crew.
good,I worked hard and seen no positive reimbursement working for Walmart. The management didn't really know what they were doing in the departments they were hired in. They knew how to manage but you couldn't go to them with a question about the job because they couldn't answer it. The hardest part of my job was the weight that they would put on me and i was doing tasks that were out of my pay grade. Most enjoyable thing about working at walmart was the interaction with the customers.
good,long hours hard working workers.  no opportunity of moving up.  management is all over the place.  co workers are great to work with.  harderst thing is the hours.  not enough pay
good,I feel that Walmart could treat their associates a lot better.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet new people and seeing my regular customers and knowing when they leave the store I have exceeded their expectations of an excellent customer service experience
good,"Customer Associate-Toy Dept."
good,"Managment isnt the greatest but I loved working with the customers and my coworkers. The work wasn't bad, mostly just a lot of shelf stocking."
good,"low pay, move up very easy, great breaks, management fair, most enjoyable part of the job is the customers hardest aprt is leaving so late and have to come back so early"
good,"Walmart is a good job to start off with, other than that they are awful with hours, if you try to work with them they cut you down to nothing. I have found my experience with Walmart horrible. I am a hard working and do everything I can and all they have to offer with me is 20-60 cent raise yearly depending on how you do."
good,Wal-mart is a typical retail Job. Its high stress and low wage.
good,"When coming into work, it was always very disorganized. No one really knew what they were doing or where they were supposed to be. We also had a difficult time finding the correct equipment needed for performing our job (ie pallet jack, hand held computer and printer etc). To me this wasted valuable time that could have been better spent performing our tasks. My coworkers were great to work with and never and any sort of issues with any of them. We all worked to the best of our abiltity to finish the work that needed to be done."
good,"this job was alot of fun and a learning experience on how Wal-Mart works from the inside. Changing to a supercenter,the whole remodel process."
good,Management & co-workers was fine. The hardest part of the job was trying to live up to ever-changing corporate rules. Employees are frequently overruled by management when employee makes a decision based on those rules. It's hard to do a good job if your never know what to do.  Working in TLE as service writer was less stressful than working inside store.
good,"When I was a employee for Wal Mart it was alright at the beginning. They seemed to have my best intrestest at heart, but as time grew I realized they have become extremely self fish and demanding for very little pay. Nor were they willing to give a full time position"
good,"A quick login, blandly emotive coworkers, and management that was often absent from the workers made Wal Mart fairly boring and monotonous. I learned that caring for your customers could cause problems and was often sitting waiting for several minutes for someone to respond to a call for help at a register."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work, Couldnt get full time and thats what i needed"
good,"walmart is a great starting job ,for anyone wanting to start out in retail,the customers are very diverce,i learned how to manage my time better on third shift i love my co workers we all try to help each other get the job done the hardest part of the job is there is never enough people to finish up what needs to get done so at times it gets frustrating ,the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and interacting with the people i work with and the customers"
good,"pros- free food and worked with my school schedule "
good,"Over worked and under paid. Especially working nights, having multiple managers telling you to do multiple tasks and then when your in trouble for not listening to one manager the other that took you away from your original assignment doesn't stand up for you."
good,"I go in and bake the bread,stock the floor,and any other duties that need to be done throughout the day. I have learned alot of things about baking bread in a commercial oven. my coworkers are very nice. I enjoy being able to please the customers with daily production. the hardest part of the job is it is very time consuming and not enough time to do it all."
good,Walmart has great potential but the management has made it very difficult to enjoy working there. They tell you in the beginning that all you have to do is show up to work and do a good job and you should have no problem advancing.  But even someone with a degree and 10 plus years of experience in Customer Service can't catch a break at this place!
good,Walmart makes you work too hard for less pay. They demand so much of you but don't want to be competitive in their wages.
good,"I watered the plants and flowers, ran the cash register, clean the area and organized the products for sale on the shelfs. I also provided excellent customer service."
good,"Overall the working environment had its ups and downs, depending on the people you had the chance to work around. I learned many different ways to work organized, and at a fast paste. My co-workers where the most awesome part of the job, we all had a way of working together to get the job done. I would have to say, I never really found anything about my job to be hard. Maybe just the pay not being enough to survive off, reasons I was forced to finding another place of employment."
good,"The work is steady with no overtime or comp. time. LP Management is excellent. Store management is sub-par. Loss Prevention is always under a microscope that, at times, hinders the LP associate from completing the job. Technology is severely lacking in the sense that the cameras and recording devices need to be updated for clarity in apprehending shoplifters. The policy for shoplifting is weak and does not allow the LP associate to fully complete the job. The pay is not in line with the scope of the job. LP constantly works with local law enforcement and must know store policy and police policy before apprehending a subject."
good,"I am always working on my feet , really good work hours make at least 40 hours an week friendly environment always willing to help one another. The hardest part about the job is meeting the standards to the mangers expectation. the enjoyable thing about my job is I go home knowing that I did everything I can."
good,"Every night after clocking in there would be a meeting in the break room where the managers would discuss the work load. Normally there would be 2 to 3 associates picking on the General Merchandise (GM) side and 2 to 3 Associates on the Grocery side. Both sides would have an average of 350 picks to complete before 3am when all picks are cleared from the system. All picks are to be transported to the sales floor for stocking. After lunch break, any overstock from all departments have to be moved back to the backroom to be binned (scanned back into proper location). Most of the time there is so much bulk that certified associates would have to use the power lift to bring pallets from off of the top steel to either add on or consolidated."
good,Management never worked around appointments or any other needed time off.  They liked to write people up for no reason.  If you needed a manager for a customer they hardly ever showed up.
good,"Walmart is a very interesting place to work, especially as a cashier, and you learn to have extreme patience and learn a lot about dealing with difficult customers effieciently and effectively. Management isn't the best all of the time, but there are a few that really care and will do anything for the associate and the customers."
good,"Working for Walmart gave me a inside view of how things are run in a larger company which is known world wide. They have many perks for working at Walmart. A uniform is provided, so you look professional every time, and no matter what a smile on everyones face. In time you get to really form a bond with co-workers and most of them are honest, hardworking individuals with good work ethics. I was hired part time, and acquired more hours by filling in for other workers shift when they called in sick, or were unable to come in. Cleanliness is one of the biggest models Walmart follows in the deli department, since there is a handling of meats, and hot foods it is something that is extremely important, as contamination can happen quite frequently. Each month there was monthly courses that educated employees on work safety, whimis, and other safety materials or information from walmart. The hardest part of the job was when I approached management for a work schedule change, I was denied it as they wanted employees who work morning to night shifts, a example of this would be I would be given a night shift up to 11pm and expected to come back in the next day at 7 am. It didnt allow me to rest properly, and therefore because of this my health had declined to the point I had to take a leave. There is not a good family to work balance and at one point when I asked for more work it was denied aswell. Benefits dont really go into affect until you work over one year within in the company, and there are alot of changes that come because of frequent changes in management and employees who leave"
good,"At Walmart a typical day would consist of at least two customers who'd be unsatisfied with the way things were run in the back, or with other cashiers. Generally I'd try to appease those customers, and explain the workings of things, thereby excusing their frustration and the behavior of those in the back. I learnt that a customer service provider such as myself needs to be extremely patient by nature, for it is simply impossible to continuously forge understanding. I believe I possess that quality. I learnt at Walmart that your direct supervisors are not trying to diminish your efforts, they simply get orders from corporate, and have their own struggles to get through. One way of helping them being a better supervisor is being a better employee. The most enjoyable part of that job was definitely seeing a customer's smile at the end of a transaction."
good,A typical day at work was first thing if there was pallets that needed to be put away that's what I did at first until they were done and then the rest of the night was replenishing pallets that the order fillers emptied. Most of my co-workers were great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was running the fork lift and co-workers.
good,"For a place that strives to have respect for the individual, I've never seen a place so dysfunctional in my life. No pats on the back for good work, just management saying ""..that's ALL you got done?"" looking at you like maybe you lost a limb because they expected triple the amount of progress for one person."
good,"A typical day at Walmart from my eyes would start by speaking to every cashier at their registers.  The cashiers are the first and last associates the customers see.  By ensuring they kee\pt a smile on their face, I felt it was my duty to appreciate them first thing in the morning and throughout the day. After going through my first walk thru to see what plans needed to be made to make the store always better, we would have our manager's meeting.  We would discuss our plans to the store manager, of course with some  notes from him.  Continual walking around to lend a hand in any area to make the customer's shopping experience a pleasant one, showed the associates that you cared and the customers respected you more.  I learned from Walmart actually something taught to me growing up; respect associates and work alongside them and they will work better for you.  The hardest part of my job was having to discipline my associates.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to ensure the customers were always taken care, leaving them satisfied and eager to return."
good,"A typical day is operating registers, returning items to proper shelves, working with the public and scanning end caps to keep a neat appearance. "
good,"Group meeting before shift starts detailing how the night was planned out and what department be working on."
good,"As for me although the organization wasn't as organized as I dreamed it would be I did learn a lot of transferable skills that I believe can be used in everyday life & to further my career. For the most part of my day I provided our guests with outstanding customer service along with the mandatory duties of my position. Most part of the day I stocked merchandise , made sure the area was always upkeep , training new associate's from the team , etc. My management was pretty awesome for my first short term with this establishment . Giving every 5 to 6 months we had a new member of management starts to become routine but it also gave me a sense of disorganized , unstable ,& that's not were I am at this moment. The hardest part of being on an overnight team as an overnight associate is most defiantly the sleep I can honestly say my job was a breeze never to difficult at all. As far as sleep well lets just say it takes awhile to adjust ,working overnight at Wal-Mart taught me a strong sense of customer service , and organization when it comes to my particular job & position."
good,"a empresa e de pequeno porte,o horario e de 8 as 17:30 e uma empresa com um bom ambiente"
good,My job duties were typical of a pharmacy technician duties.
good,Management was always busy and could hardly help coworkers or costumers. I learned how to work on a small machine. most of my coworker where very nice easy to get along with.
good,"Chaotic environment, advancement within organization was not possible unless you were in with the managers"
good,"A night at Walmart consisted of unloading 7-8 skids of product while managing a clean work environment and having the store prepped and ready for customers upon opening. There was however very little opportunity to climb the ladder and the work was very strenuous for the amount I was being paid. As well as being a very sexist work environment, the men were relied upon to do any and all heavy lifting or strenuous work, even when women were more than capable of handling the job."
good,"My day at work included reviewing department employees schedules, reviewing pending orders, reviewing backroom for backstock, making sure sales floor was full."
good,this is a started off job fun co-worker but bosses bad this was the worst job I have had
good,Working at Wal-mart as Asset Protection was a fun learning experience. Not only did I not learn about the job but I learned more about myself also. The workers we're indifferent and it felt great to be part of a management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was apprehending shoplifters!
good,I have worked part time for 14.5 months. I really enjoy the customers. The Grimes location is the best store in the greater Des Moines area.
good,I enjoy helping customers and making their shopping at Wal Mart a pleasant experience. It is very gratifying to help a customer solve their problem by recommending the right product.
good,"Grata pelo aprendizado e pela oportunidade ao meu primeiro emprego."
good,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart the customers were great fast pace enviornment. the hardest for some people would be the different attitudes you have to deal with. Mines was standing for long periods of time.
good,"Temos momentos tenso e de insegurança, tambem há liderança que dar condiçoes de exercer nossas atividades com mais empenho pois temos uma carga horaria anormal. A empresa tem uma politicas muito boa mais pouco aplicada."
good,"A typical day is set up the slicers and go thru meats and salads and take out all claims (out of dates) re-stocking pizzas and working the frieght on sales floor.  I dont feel that management treat us as their equals, for instance you should always treat people with respect just because you are management doesnt mean your our like the police.  I understand that there are some employees that need babysitting but NOT all of us. The hardest part of our jobs are just to learning new ways of doing the modular (for me its called Plannograms)  But i do enjoy meeting new people and its even better to make all customers happy.  I also enjoy restocking pizzas and workingwith the telson (hand held computer)"
good,"Nice working environment when customers were around. Hard work and enjoyable atmosphere. Immediate managers were great, However job security was an issue for all associates."
good,This company allows the interaction with others that can lead to something more promising.
good,"Fun place to work at but they always played favorites. I would get there and get straight to work. I would check out customers, and talk with them. All of my co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was working with customers that liked to start problems. The easiest part of the job was being nice to a customer, and being nice."
good,The day started out with a meeting and given out job duties for the day. Then i was personally given different duties from the managers to help in other departments as well as use equipment i have never been trained on.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of hard work unloading a truck in a small time window. "
good,"Epileptic shifts, bad pay and poor management, they will run you ragged as much as possible."
good,a typical day at walmart is clocking in and going straight to work. i learned good customer service i learned how to wrap a pallet i learned how to sell merchandise and how to cashier. i had so many managers some of them werent even over my department neither did they communicate with the manager who was but they would pull people out my department to come work in their deparment which made it harder for us cause we were the busiest department all the time. my co-workers were cool some of them im still freinds with. the hardest part of the job is when im the only one in my department and they pull me to go outside and push carts and nobody else knows how to run photo center or fix the printer when it jams or malfunctions. i enjoyed being in the photo center making canvas pictures etc.
good,You don't not want to make a career out of retail. I would enjoying working here if we were properly staffed.
good,"No regular days off.  Maybe 1 day, or 2, sometimes even 3...but you never know when until a week out, at the most.  Day off....better ask a month in advance.  Your position, and performance are never discussed unless something goes wrong.  Never complimented for anything.  No benefits for 1 year.  Security was not too bad a problem, except for the fact that how you're doing is never discussed.  Management...too much of it!!!!  Too many chiefs, and direction came in many different interpretations.  Culture was an area I had never seen in my professional life before.  However, my co-workers were the best part of the job."
good,"A normal day would be stocking meats. I learned how to work by myself. Some management was micromanaging. My co-workers were few but, great to be with. The hardest part was being by myself and lifting on heavy boxes in a cooler. The most enjoyable part was working with co-workers."
good,"work group would meet for a quick meeting and exercise. Then I would help unload and sort merchandise. what I learned was how to use a pallet jack, managements was not interested in training new employees, co workers were very helpful and that is how I received my training. The hardest part of the job was the stocking of laundry soaps on the shelves. I enjoyed the co worker."
good,"My typical day at walmart is very active because I work the Food department. I have stock fresh produce, milk, and water. while sometimes help out fellow cashiers at the checkout area. What I have learned while working at walmart is that this company succeed on team work while as well working under intense pressure. I do have an excellent work relationship with my entire management team as well as with my fellow co-workers.the hardest part of the job is that as an associate you are not going to always satisfy every customer but, the most enjoyable part of the job is that  I do satisfy customers with my excellent customer service skills and positive attitude."
good,"Management was awful, everything else was normal and fun.It was tough work, but nothing you shouldn't be expecting, pulling the shipments in nightly."
good,"What I learned from Walmart was that they hire wonderful people and working with these cashiers and other customer service managers was a great experience.  They never let me fail, I always had wonderful support in every aspect of the job.  Standing on my feet for 7 plus hours was very hard. Running to give a cashier change across the store was a lot of fun.  Helping customers find items in the store priceless."
good,"It was OK. not able to advance, they held associates back, had to fight to try for health care"
good,"When  I first start working for this company I really like it but as time went on the job ,became very stressful for me. I learned a great deal from working there, but the management is never on the same page. One manger may tell something and the next day it will be something else.  There is nothing hard about the job that I did also love working with my co-workers and also the customer where nice sometimes you may meet a customer that not so nice but just smile and treat them with kindness."
good,"I would come to work, set up register and check people out at the register."
good,Typical day of work started with clocking in to a system that assigned the employee to a designated register to relieve another cashier. Usually a manager would not come in contact with you unless you needed assistance with registers. No actual person to person training learning as you go. Most enjoyable part was being able to be independent.
good,You are over worked an under payed. Management is very poor an hours an days you work changes every schedule.
good,"A typical day included having to fill in and take on projects such as working freight, baking and preparing for the next day, as well as managerial tasks including various computer and paper work. I learned that in a business it is imperative to have employees who care about their job. I also learned that the more a person is willing to learn the better can be at their job.  Management as a whole was not very good with helping get things accomplished including disciplining rogue associates when necessary, causing issues to go unresolved. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I learned that each of them had something to offer and learn from. The hardest part of the job was not having any backup by management. No one on the management team wanted to be the one responsible for anything. It made my job much harder as I felt I only had myself to rely on even if I didn't know how to help myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my associates and interacting with many of the customers."
good,This store has so many different areas to work in it's just rediculous. Specially when they want you to be cross-trained in all areas and have complete product knowledge. We all know how big walmart is and unless you spend A LOT of time getting to know the store they really ask to much of you. Starting as a Sales Associate was quite nice learning one area and helping customers with any questions. Working on the Night time stocker position is where the cross training in everyone work area and knowing every product location was a lot to ask in just one short week. The Most enjoyable part of the day was working alone in one area putting away stock. The hardest part was getting put in a new area to stock every other day.
good,"El empleo es bueno pero el ambiente de trabajo era muymalo las personas con las que laboraba eran muy divididas y no davan informacion extra a personal de nuevo ingreso  en realidad me gustaba mi trabajo y no lo que ria dejar por la cercania y por los horarios ,loo que me gustava de mi trabajo era que una actividad que realizaba con tanto gusto y con responsabilidad."
good,"a typical day would be working from 8-4 helping costumers, putting out games, movies, and other stock."
good,worked here for a long time people within company were ok. management was horrible. work place was ok need to get rid of certain employees
good,Uma empresa sem muitas regras muito bagunçada....     As pessoas não se respeitam muito até entre os líderes havia briga ... Chamar a atenção de funcionários na frente de clientes
good,"For the work I did at walmart, it was almost a constant cycle of trying to work hard for what little pay I was getting. At times, it felt like I was indeed back in preschool. A lot of employees there would often take offense to anything anyone would say. There really was no smiles in the back. Always having to force a smile, rather than a genuine one."
good,Enjoyed working with most of the customers. The regulars were wonderful. Long waits on holidays made some people unhappy.
good,"It was ok  for me at the time,I worked as a cashier and sometimes I stocked."
good,"worked overnight ,bring produce to the front of the store witha pallet jack. some coworkers will be doing there own thing when supervisor is walking around the store."
good,rotineira e com poucos colaboradores em processo de 100% de auto atendimento.
good,"typical day is long, management is ok, some care some dont, co workers are great, but alot of gossip, and hardest part of the job is making it through the day without pulling your hair out, and enjoyable when you hit that time clock."
good,"I would work 4Pm-1Am 4 to 5 days a week. When i first started there it was good even though we were greatly underpaid i didn't mind the job. After awhile all the good workers started to leave after finding better paying jobs so it was hard to find good help especially for the pay they were offering. I wouldnt reccomend this place to anybody unless they had no job, even then i would probably think twice"
good,there are certain things that stay the same from day to day but most days things are different. one member of management will say one thing and tell you to do something and then another will tell you to do something else.
good,"Get to work & clean up the am shifts mess! I will never work for this place, ever! The management treated me bad for the most part & they never seemed to care, just do your work & fast. A few co-workers would help me not not many, 2 of them. I was so hard to pull out & dig through cases of produce to get to the bottom & then stack them back. I loved it when I quit! : )"
good,"This workplace just does not have it together. Low morale as soon as you walk in. I learned that in order to be efficient at a job that takes unity, it also takes organization. Some co-workers are willing to work and some are not. The hardest part part about this job is working long hours unloading heavy freight with no break until its complete. I enjoy satisfying customers."
good,wasnt the best job i had got lied too and not treated too well probably wont work there again
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart produce section involves lifting many heavy crates and other objects. Usually it also involves lots of self discipline and being able to work well independently. I stocked the shelves, cleaned, and maintained a well organized work space for my co-workers and myself. The hardest part of the job includes lifting the heavy items, working in the produce section, one is required to lift 50 pounds and over; it can put a lot of stress on the body at one time. The thing I like most about working there is working with the public and always having something to do; there is usually never a dull moment."
good,"we do the something every night, there is no change of scenery. The management tells us to do something one way then the next day they may tell you something different. The majority of my co-workers are hard working and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job would be getting things done in the time limit the manager wants because usually they add things that aren't in my job description. The thing I enjoy most would be unloading the trucks."
good,"overall, not a fun place to work, but you will get your paycheck"
good,This job is very hard work for the compensation. I am looking to better myself and be job secure as I have a kid on the way and responsibilities to attend to.
good,"The job is not hard it is just the way the management try to treat you. If you ask each manager there a question, each one has a different answer. There is no organization or coordination."
good,"Typical day at work would include starting off my setting up the area to unload merchandise from trucks. After unloading the merchandise we would normally go to lunch and come back to pull all that merchandise to the floor to be stocked. Once that is finished we would help with rotation of stock, and do Picks. Using mechanical equipment to help with. Hardest part of the job was the constant miscommunication from managers and just overall not knowing what they were doing."
good,"Worked as a Clothing Sales Associate. Management was never around. They didn't train us very well. I started the same day as another new girl and we were training each other off of past jobs because we didn't know what to do besides getting orders from a computer. We didn't know how to work the gun thing. Since they make a monthly work schedule you need to tell them two months ahead, most of the time you wont get it off. I wasn't there a week and they made me go to a completely different department and work because someone called in sick, they didn't tell me what I had to do. Then the manager came and yelled at me because I wasn't doing anything and I told him I haven't been working there for a week yet and had no idea what to do. Then after a few weeks I needed a few weeks later I needed to take a few days off short notice due to getting kicked out of my house and needed to fined a place to stay. They made me between them and trying to find a place to live. To me the way the manager said it was like ""just live in your car and work for us"""
good,I worked nights stocking shelves. The job was good except management couldn't manage. In an 8 hr day they expected some people to work 18 hrs of freight while others have only 4. they would never send help instead they waste the manpower having them help those who cannot even accomplish 4 hr tasks
good,"MY typical day at work can span from returning merchandise to its designated place. Check the telxon screen to see where the audits stand for the day before it's 9 am drop time. The day initial starts off pretty slow, then it begins to pick around 12pm. when the lunch rush comes. It's pretty laid back, it gets crazy when necessary."
good,"I worked at Walmart for just over 2 years, enjoyed my job and was a hard worker...however...I had a quarter of the store to take care of and was a backup cashier at the front end.  I was expected to get all my returns, get stock on the floor and cover the front and other departments that I was hired for then still expected to have all my work done.  In addition to that the supervisors and managers were verbally abusive and got away with it in spite of several time I reported them, which according to the corporate policy they should have been written up or terminiated...many have been getting away with it for years.  In all I enjoyed the job and helping the customers but the constant abuse is rampant and nothing done about it...the managers cover each other and only care about themselve...fast to criticize but slow to give any positive feedback or listen to their employees."
good,"Wal-Mart may seem like a nice place to work on the outside, but when you have worked there for a year, you see otherwise.  When I first started there, they have you watch these videos about safety and customer service.  Well, within the first few weeks, I noticed that a lot of the policies weren't being met by upper management.  All they cared about is sales and how much profit they were getting.  They don't have the mindset of safety for their employees or customers. The only part I loved about the job was making the customers happy.  And yes I enjoyed making sure my department was neat and tidy.  However, overall I felt that the overall employees of the company weren't being treated fairly."
good,"Corporate guidelines were often blurred in order to get the job done. Shift managers were more concern with completion than quality. I quickly learned that corporate rules were only followed if Corporate inspectors were expected."
good,The company I worked at didnt take Dr. notes when you had an illness. The store was short staffed and had to wear many hats a lot of running back and forth front to back of store and the pay was under 10.00 hourly. Policy changed daily to fit what the manager for that day wanted. No structure and a lot of unhappy people.
good,"3rd shift difficult to adjust to but if thats your preferance this is an pretty consistant job."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart the employees are like a family."
good,"While my stay at Walmart was not very long, I had difficulty keeping up with directions from the different managers because they were all telling me to do something different. I was not kept in one position long enough to even get a grasp on how to perform my duties to the best of my ability. I started out as a stocker, then a back room associate and finally a janitor. This was the second time I have worked at this location but the previous experience was much better coordinated because I reported to one department manager who could keep track of my progress instead of the store manager, assistant manager and store supervisor who were all sending me in different directions."
good,"Balancing cashier's drawer, preparing funds for bank deposit"
good,"part time job"
good,"Extrenly fast past work environment, no consideration for the employ"
good,"I was in need of a job and after I separated, I feel that because I am a veteran I was amongst one of the first chosen. The supervision at night seemed as if they had their own posse working for them. Some of the regular employees felt that if they stayed in good grace with the supervision they would keep their sense of hierarchy above the other employees. Many of the others who would do their job with no questions asked usually found themselves that and more of the others who didn't ""feel"" like it. I understand not all WalMarts are like this one, but this particular place was just bad news."
good,"enjoy all my co-workrs, they were team player and management always there to help when needed"
good,"was a good company but is going downhill bad. less bonuses, management doesnt seem to care about employes"
good,Its an ok job if u need work and don't really care how u are treated. the assistant managers tend to play favorite and for some that is a good thing but for others it can be bad. they also tend to make u do things that are not in ur job description and some of the things can be kind of dangerous.
good,"I applied there, I worked there and I was ""let go"" from here if I could work there again, would hope that there is job security, job promotionals, higher chance of advancement much higher pay wages, and internship programs."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be meeting and greeting customers with excellent customer service. If have to come in before the store open, I would double check our inventory to make sure that we are at one hundred percent. Next I would check our on the floor count and perform the same process. There is know hard part to my job, its a little tedious but nothing any person cannot overcome will determination. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. I really enjoy meeting people from different walks of life."
good,"No real ways to find where to go."
good,"A typical day at work for me is constant work."
good,It was fun working with customers and challenging working with staff
good,Manager do not care about the employees and some are just very rude about it.
good,"Would never want to go back. Poor communication,too much drama for a work environment, lazy people get rewarded."
good,My experience at Wal-Mart was a very busy and fast paced enviroment.  I was able to meet a large diversity of people and learned to deal with many actions and reactions from them.
good,"I looked after a large group of after school age children. We did homework, arts and crafts, as well as many other things."
good,I would know what to expect. I learned a lot about retail sales.
good,"When i first started it was okay, but soon found it uncomfortable with the favoritism shown with certain individuals.  Learned i was good at handling customers and being responsible for my shift.  The hardest part of working her at my store is the customers complaining of to little workers on shift.  Management here is not friendly at all except for a few and tension is very thick is negativity.  I enjoy most the attitude of the people who shop and show how they appreciate us who work here."
good,"When I started working at Walmart I was only trained one day in a different area than where I was initally hired to do then thrown in another different area. I worked in that area for a week or so, then they had me train one day in electronics and the next day I was there all by myself, without register log-ins or anything. I barely knew the area. The managers tossed me around to different areas until i finally had enough. I was never going to be able to learn anything or build up a fast paced routine if they kept doing that, so I quit. It was the first job that I just out right quit."
good,"The best part of my job was making my customers smile, I was very patient with the elderly and gentle with the children."
good,"The best part of my job are my coworkers who are all very friendly and caring. Management on the other hand can be easily overwhelmed, which in most cases is understandable. I have learned my store inside and out."
good,"At Walmart, I learned how to throw freight in a timely manner, use a pallet jack, and how to give great customer service. A typical day at work consisted of arriving at 11:00AM for my scheduled shift, starting on ""picks"" and then continuing on to do whatever my manager told me to do. On some days, I was called into the back of the store to use a pallet jack to pull pallets off of semi-truck trailers. Management was very confusing and disorganized; at times, i was being told by three different people to do three different tasks simultaneously. My co-workers were very nice and very reliable in a team setting, as was I. The hardest part of the job was working on Black Friday, as I was needed in very many parts of the store in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to deliver great customer service to people in an environment where exceptional customer service is not always there for the customer."
good,Enjoyed working with the Customer's very much.  Worked as a Cashier but was also working at the Customer Service desk.
good,was a great place to work for 24 years i worked with some great people and love my reg. costumers
good,"Always something to do, meet lots of new people daily. have set breaks 3 times a day in an 8 hour shift. always get lunch break."
good,"I worked here for about three months on the graveyard shift.  Stressful with the amount of people trying to lead others and management seemed to take a back seat and come around every few hours.  The pay was low for the work we were doing, but a job is a job."
good,"working at Walmart was tough. they always needed us to work, which was good for some extra cash, but difficult if you wanted to do other activities such as sports. many of my fellow employees were really great and would work hard, but many where also terrible workers that would leave half way through their shift leaving us with more work and an unreasonable time period to get it done. as an employee i felt under appreciated and frustrated with management that would not promote good workers and not reprimand bad behavior"
good,"Responsibilities include restocking shelves, rotated merchandise (FIFO), scanning all products while making sure items were accounted in the system and ensuring all items are in specified locations and store is presentable in an effort to meet and exceed customer’s expectations while shopping."
good,"enjoyed my time there, it was a steady paced work day, there was always something to do"
good,"My shift would start with clocking in for my shift, go to an assigned register, sign in to register, open drawer to make sure money was counted and placed in drawer correctly. Turn my light on and be ready for a customer to come in my line. I've learned to be considerate and courteous to customers and co-workers. The management team wants you to ensure customers are happy with the products they are buying. The hardest part of the job is long-time standing. It gets tiring on your feet and your legs. I face the shelves that need to be stocked. Keeping busy is the key to being happy at your job. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you've helped a customer with all of their needs."
good,learned two stock meet a lot of pepole used palitjack.must be a team player. and work with others
good,they hire at a low pay let you get one raise then let you go when your pay starts to increase
good,One of the worst places I've worked. Coworkers outside my department were often jerks and the management very seldom coordinated or stayed on the same page with each other.
good,"All the cash, WIC vouchers and coupons for each register are turned in every night in their designated register bags and I go through each one accordingly every morning. I use the 10-key system to key in the quantity for each denomination for each register into the SMART system. Then, the profit for each register is calculated. The WIC vouchers and the checks are also individually entered into the SMART system. The deposits are prepared and are ready for bank pickup. I keep account of the daily and monthly paperwork. The coupons are mailed out weekly. I review each register, record then research the registers that have overages or shortages for that day. The hardest part of my job is finding out the reason why the registers were not balanced and communicating with all of my coworkers until the problem is found and a solution is made. The most enjoyable part is the calm environment while sorting out the register bags."
good,"Managers need to do their jobs, NO training, Fast paced, Easy work.   Told me I was temp and they hired me Directly."
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers. I learned to work hard under pressure.
good,Managers do not communicate well.   Every associate are overwhelmed with work.  People have left but not replaced.
good,"It's not hard as long as you do what you are told to do."
good,wal-mart is not a good place to work because they are not nice to their works
good,"its a job if you need to get paid and make rent do not recommend sticking around, for long if you can find something better"
good,"On a typical work night we started off with our Wal-Mart meeting talking about how we as a team are important to the welfare of Wal-Mart, if we hit our quota the previous night, and our truck count for the evening. We ended our meetings with our Wal-Mart cheer and went to work not before checking our individual tasks. This would let us know which departments, we were assigned to and how many hours we had in said departments. The newest employees usually move from department to department until they find a place that management feels suits them. Management's optimal goal was to have one person for 3 departments. Now each department was about 8 to 12 hours depending on the truck night, imagine working 2  departments let alone 3 under those conditions. They hired infrequently, when someone would quit or terminated, they usually wouldn't fill their position for at least 2 months. Leaving all that extra weight on our shoulders, not managements. Since the manager was especially hard on the assistant managers, the assistant managers were hard if not harder on us. When asked by assistant managers and fellow employees that we needed extra hands on board, he would always say something like, ""Oh, we're currently looking"" and ""we actually have already hired some people."" He also refused to hire based off of Wal-Marts incentive giving Management a nice bonus if they had less employees. "
good,"A typical work day includes providing patients with good customer service, repairs, pre testing and verifying insurance."
good,"Honestly, I was not impressed with the professionalism with the Wal-Mart I worked at. The customer service there was not up to par like the other retail stores I have observed. The managers like to ignore the ideas the associates suggested to make the store a better place to shop, which made more associates quit, including myself. "
good,"There is no such thing as a ""typical day"" because every day could be different than the day before. It all depends on what needs done. It wasn't what I expected from what I was told was expected of me to do. I get told one thing by management but when they put me with another employee to get trained I basically got told ""yeah this is how it's supposed to be but we only do that when the big wigs come around"" and I don't like working that way. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I'm working again...even if every day I come home tired and achy from being on my feet all day."
good,Wal-Mart has a modern computer system that you must task in and out of all night long and it is a challenge to me because it interrupts my work time by walking off the job to log in and out of tasks. AS a self motivator and natural organization skills the system is a waste of time to myself.
good,"A typical overnight shift consisted of putting product on to the shelves. I learned a lot about time management, though the hardest part about the job was working the midnight shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing what I was able to accomplish."
good,"un poco pesado el trato con los compañeros"
good,"Production never goes down and it goes up every year. At some point production must peak.Use you up and throw you away, but at least the pay is good."
good,"-Over worked "
good,"The store is always flocked by customers because its complete and practical price.  Busy in the night because  more customers, everyday. Ends with zoning of all returned  buggies  at night but sometimes the managers understands our physical situation that we cant complete the buggies to be zoned."
good,Hardest part about the job is being able to live your life outside of work. No flexibilty
good,aprende bastante tem abertura pra outras areas  gerencia tem suas qualidades  conhecimento em geral  foi bom fazer parte do walmart fui uma associada
good,"* Mis primeras tres horas las dedico de lleno a  checar mercancias precios limpieza acomodo de mi departamento despues salgo a cenar 1 hora   me relajo  platico y convivo con mis compañeros, regreso las siguientes 4 horas  me pongo a revisar que los compañeros hayan hecho lo mismo en sus departamentos ya que soy la encargada de ellos, si no hay mas que hacer me voy con la subgerente haber si hay algo en lo que le pueda ayudar y si no hay nada , pues solo me ddico a checar que se mantengan en el mayor orden posible los departamentos asignados."
good,"10-12 hours of back breaking work while still trying to be productive and safe. Management was a joke. Unless you were friends with them, they could care less about giving you the time of day. It was nice having a 3 day weekend though."
good,Also most of my time was on sales floor but in a managerial position I was not involved with the customers as with Best Buy. I was more delegating duties to other employees.Would not be so bad but they never had enough staffing to do a job correctly. They also had busy work that truly had no benefit to anyone but took away time from other important projects. Management was sorely lacking in people skills and couldn't see what was truly important task from a non important task. Hardest part was dealing with management while enjoyable part was dealing with employees and customers
good,". A typical workday included you clocking in, going to the board checking worksite any extra work assignment  and staying in your department. This employment could be better in so many ways. Working for walmart is not a bad or awful place but many things do. Management can talk to you however they want to and I don't like that. They threaten to fire you if your work isn't done by the time your suppose to clock out but don't give you enough time to do the work or enough employees to break up the work. A lot times employees were screwing each other just to keep their jobs."
good,"i was a cashier, stocker, and technician. pretty much fill prescriptions and checked customers out at the register"
good,"First started out as a cashier, than got moved to being a cake decorator.  I enjoy cake decorating but they weren't willing to work with me on scheduling around family."
good,"Even on what was considered to be a slow night , there is never a dull moment. the stores customer count is astronomical. complete families will shop at all hours of the night as if they were unaware that it was the middle of the night . during the midnight hours, associates become harder and harder to find. on a routine basis I was required to execute multiple tasks , in multiple departments. it was just out of control . the hilarity of the situation became my smile and my disappointment. I am a firm believer that my clientele was entitled to more associates to keep up with customer demand. yin and yang. I miss it"
good,"I have learn that customer service or hard work doesn't matter..It is all about brown nosing..Management will lie right to your face, love my coworkers & love the hard work, but it is a dead end job"
good,"Working with a bunch of children. management played favoritism, no room for advancement"
good,The best part of my job was the people that I worked with. It was the main reason I loved going to work everyday. If it wasn't for them I would have looked for a job sooner.
good,Walmart is good for you if you really need a job. Job culture can be a bit depressing because many people hate their job. Morale is not always the greatest. The pay is OK and it can vary based on your experience. Sometimes there are periods of people getting fired randomly because they need to get rid of some people for whatever reason. Management is not always the greatest and it is customer service so many customers are not very pleasant. Walmart will teach a lot because you can be pulled to do more than your job title entails...you just don't paid for it.
good,Wal-Mart over works the best workers they have! I really enjoy the electronics department and mostly all of the department managers. Very few of the assistants know how to do anything. Managers never take on more rolls or responsibility when it comes to being understaffed.
good,"My typical day at work consists of counting money, cashing checks, and assisting customers with their accounts."
good,"I enjoyed working in the apparel department, but there was  some discrimination, low pay and clueless management."
good,I liked working at Walmart for the most part be the managers was not always there for you to talk to them when you had a problem or if you needed help on the floor.
good,very poor atmosphere conditions are terrible. the hardest part of the job was the managers were not professional at all.
good,"I'm not sure if all Walmart's are indeed as horrible as the one I worked at, but the only thing salvagable about this company is the sales associates they hire. My management team was awful and uncoordinated. They require you to do tasks that are not in your job description they hand you to sign in your third interview and they get upset when you are out of your department after being asked by another manager to leave your department. Overall a terrible management team. They talk to associates as if we are children, including older associates and they are not too keen on caring about the well being of their associates."
good,its a slaveship.hardest part about working for the company was the managers there full of it and under qualified for there positions
good,"The typical day at Wal mart was fairly busy, the main thing that I learned from this job is to do your job and not worry about what the others are doing, the management was okay for the most part but it could be better, I really didn't get along with my co workers they made it hard to like your job, The hardest part about my job is unloading the truck, the most enjoyable thing about this job was clocking out to go home."
good,"When I was working there, there were a couple good CSMs. They other CSMs ruined it for all. The öther"" CSMs were very hard to work with. They would always be gone walking around the store or outside with their friends, which caused issues with the cashiers, because when you need more cash or change you have to go to them and no matter how many times you would page them they would not come to you until the were done their ""social hour"". Costumers would get mad the cashiers that would not get the extra cash and change they needed would have to tell the costumers debt/ credit only because you could not make change. The CSMs would  get really grouchy and start treating you badly once you told them about the issue with them not doing with they were suppose to. (corruption) Then the CMSs not giving you lunch breaks or 15 min breaks because they would have had to cover someone. Thats the reason why now if it is time for your lunch break your register will lock you out. I do not know how many times I would see the door greeters go with out lunch or break. A few times why I could I would replace the door greeters so they could go on break."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working with the public and getting to know some of the regular customers.  Feeling like I really was important to some of them and making some smile when they were having a bad day.  I also enjoyed working the registers and working the layaway department some of the job requirements were challenging and I enjoy that.  The management, however, was a bit hard to understand sometimes.  For instance one day they would tell you that you were required to do something and then the next they would change policy on it (coupons, etc.) without much direction.  Also corporate offices would tell you one policy and the store would say it was not correct, which eventually lead to me loosing the job.  The co-workers and I many of them became friends and would look out for each other even became friends out side of the job still stay in touch with them.  Overall I spent almost six years with the company and learned a lot about myself and the job, that a cashier does not necessarily have a very easy job.  However, I really do miss working in an office environment."
good,"Reliable pay and hours, the management determines if your going to work a lot of course. Needs better communication."
good,Work was the same everyday other days can be more complicated depending on the customer flow.
good,"Very stable job, with very minimal career advancement opportunities."
good,experience working with the company may vary with location.
good,"co worker were good people"
good,"I'm not sure if all Walmarts are the same, and by no means am I trying to bad mouth my job, but this one I've worked for overall is quite a frustrating job. The salaried management is unapproachable, disorganized, and not helpful. The way the store is ran overall really is about a 2.5 out of 5. When corporate comes in management acts as if nothing is wrong, but when they leave it's back to the same routine. The story they sell you about moving up in the company is pretty much a lie because they aren't willing to work with you even if you're qualified. The rules they have set in stone for some of the workers are not followed by everyone, creating an unfair workplace. Favoritism is highly shown here. The best thing that has come from this job are the friendships I've made with some other associates and customers and the experience in Customer Service and Marketing."
good,"Cashier, Customer service. Did not have the ability to move up into management. Co-workers were great to be around. There was no hard part of this job. The best thing about this job was the ability to socialize with customers."
good,"everything critized about Wal-Mart is true, they don't practiully give good pay to thier workers . usally it's under $10.00 an hour and not enough to pay anything peopole really need"
good,I enjoyed working here while in college. It pays great for a college student. Some of the management could be improved. But over all a great place to work.
good,"Since working at Walmart I have made some good friends and see some off site as well. In the department I'm in at the moment there are some great ladies and we laugh a lot, truly enjoyable.  A typical day would be bringing out clothing from the back to restock and fill up ."
good,"Stocking shelves and unloading trucks. Learned how to operate forklift and scissor lift. Management was ok, just need to communicate ideas better. Co-workers keep asking when I am coming back to work there. Hardest part about the job was working overnights. Enjoyable part was when you got that huge THANK YOU from customers."
good,You always have to be on your toes working in this company. Things are constantly changing.
good,"A typical day in Wal-Mart as a cashier you are standing waiting fro customers to come into your check out line, ringing in there items and repeating these steps with many people, I learned how to manage cashiering in a retail store. My co-workers were the best part of my job, amazing people and just hard working. The hardest part of my job was zoning and the management team. The management moved me to cashier and never payed me cashier wages though it was brought up to three different supervisors, they say Wal-Mart is full of opportunity's but its not. I wanted to transfer to a new area in the store and they wouldn't let me. Every one of my co-workers reported the same thing, and that they hated working for Wal-Mart. But people put up with it because they need there jobs, and money for there family. That's the only reason I stayed and I ended up walking out on them. Money is Money. The most enjoyable part was working with amazing people,"
good,"Everyday was busy which made the day go by fast, but the lack of support from management is what made working here intolerable. Plus, I was promised full-time and when it came to change my status, it was not able to be done, yet I was given 40 hours a week."
good,"Overall i really didn't enjoy working for this company, you had no opportunity for a personal life."
good,"Loved the staff. So many associates, so very little room for Advancement."
good,"My job here was to train electronics sales people on the products that were sold in their department. My job title was cut from the company shortly after starting and was moved into a Sales Associate position for the remainder of my tenure. "
good,"I've always wanted to work at Walmart when I was little. I loved shopping at Walmart. I've watched the employees helping the customers and I wanted to be one of them. But when I started working there, it was nothing that I had dream of. I loved my co-workers. But the job was always confusing. I was hired for one spot and they had me doing other people's jobs and that wasn't right or fair."
good,I changed tires and was very good at it. they help me when I asked for their help and I helped them when they ask.
good,"Good places to work to get experience, had lots of fun. enjoyed all the people I worked with."
good,Typical day is working with customer on finding product helping out with problems.  Helping co workers with stocking.  I learned that great customer service makes for happy customer and they will return. Hardest part of the job is short staff and not being able to give every customer the great customer service they should get.
good,"My day never ends. I take caer of whatever is asked of me and I try to make sure we are available for customers whenever they need us. Often my day starts before I leave the house, sometimes a store manager calls. sometimes a customer calls. I have a great boss, and my co workers are delightful people . The hardest part of my job is keeping track of the time as I am always busy, and the most enjoyable part is the customers and co workers, and helping whoever I can when I can. However I think it is time for me to do something different. I have worked with Walmart for 22 years minus 6 months, and I need a change."
good,Most definitely different from any cashiering job I have done yet but I would not recommend this particular store to anyone. This store lacks in the communications department and is very disorganized in the scheduling techniques.
good,"I guess what you expect from a job at Walmart"
good,A typical day would be me finding out where i am going to be. I could be going anywhere depending on where they need me because of my versitality. The co workers are most of the time ok and good people to have around.
good,"this job is not for a master level college students. it was to much for me, for low pay and a long distance to drive."
good,prevent customers from shoplifting dealing with the local police department taking care of employee and customer saftey issues
good,"a typical day at work consist of cashiering, stocking and cleaning. I learn how to manage difficult customers and co-workers everyday. the hardest part of my job is the stress of the safety. the most enjoyable part of my job is that it goes by fast."
good,"no to happy with the managment and the way people treat each other."
good,"En general los días son agradables y con mucho trabajo de control y seguimiento, aprendiendo constantemente sobre medidas preventivas a tomar a los efectos de evitar ilícitos.Se observa muy comprometidos a los gerentes en las labores pero no a los jefes y supervisores de área."
good,It's a back breaking job that pays well. You have to be very aware of everything around you because they are very strict. Being able to lift a variety of different weights for long periods of time is a must. Management will bring it to your attention if you slack and you only have so many of those before you are let go.
good,"My co-workers were really nice and I still miss them.  This and getting to know many of my customers was the best part of the job."
good,"Desde el dia de mi capasitacion  ellos no contaban  con cajeras  suficientes, asi que me pusieron de cajera y ahi fui aprendiendo dia con dia, los codigos  de las despensas."
good,the management staff was very unprofessional and was very favorable to certian employees and unfair to others
good,"some of the people were nice others were snobby, there more you did there the less they cared about you"
good,A typical day in the Vision Center is going to be fast pace and educational. I enjoy building long lasting relationships with my patients and customers. Being able to help them with their eye care needs year after year is a great feeling. I have made friendships with my co-workers and management team over the years that will last beyond just our employment at Wal-Mart. Knowing that I make a difference in the people that I help on a day to day basis is a unbelievable feeling! The hardest thing about my job is when I unable to help a customer because rules and laws that enable me.
good,"it was an alright place to work for , pretty good team work,waited on customers had fun making them smile"
good,"I enjoyed the company of some of my coworkers, and some of the managers were easy to get along with, but there were things that could change. I didn't always feel appreciated as a manager, and was sometimes treated as if I didn't know what I was doing by someone with a higher position. If asking for legitimate help, I was sometimes met with disdain, and talked down to, like a child. Sometimes customers and management alike can be unreasonable in their requests. But it was really great as a learning and growth experience, and I would like to have tried to move up in the ranks, given the opportunity."
good,a lot of stuff to ring up which made the day go by faster. always would be on my feet. good people to work with and made a lot of friend in the process.
good,Very disrespectful management in this store. They treat their employees badly unless you had worked there for a long time.
good,"Waiting on customers, working at the service desk assisting customers w/ bill payments, money transfers"
good,This is a job that one should only take if all other options are exhausted. If you are looking for fulfilling work then look elsewhere.
good,"Walmart as a whole is a very driven and competitive company. The pay is better than most other retail jobs but the high volume and patience necessary environment is not suited for many. Management is not on the same page most of the time and it makes for a cut-throat work experience. Between the customers, co-workers, and upper management be prepared for a run for your money."
good,Great deal of gossip within the workplace and no opportunity for advancement.
good,la buena predisposicion para enseñar el rubro de cajera aprendi la atencion al publico manejo de dinero tarjetas y la responsabilidad y puntualidad
good,"There are no benefits unless you are management or full-time. "
good,I learned that customers are always right no matter if they are wrong and that you will get walked all over and talked rude to by customers and that you just have to take it without being rude back. The hardest part about working for Wal-Mart was putting up with all the negativity from the customers and not having management to take up for their employees when the customers are wrong.
good,"The better location to work inside in the GM backroom."
good,"The real strength of a management role in Walmart is the personal growth opportunity. Through inspiring and leading teams to effectively complete the needed tasks, one has the opportunity to learn successful management skills using as few resources as possible, a timeless and invaluable skill."
good,"Start the night by clocking in and checking task for the evening. then attend a stalf meeting to talk about sales and our goal for the night. "
good,It was a normal workplace. My co-workers made it more interesting.
good,I work Hard everyday I never stop so its a gift and a curse but we get done is my main goal. Just the type of person I am
good,it was a good job. just a lot of things you had to do to get used to the company. I didn't like the fact that they would micro manage you. every small thing was a problem. they give you a 15 minute grace period and get annoyed if you come in  or use that time. they wanted a 2700 piece truck moved in 2hours or less. when I was lead my team got the job done and we always left ON TIME when our shift was up
good,"It was tiring while working with co-workers with rude, snappy, bad attitudes. It made me learn about how the work environment can be. Management needs people who actually want to do their job, giving customers what they need and treating other associates the same. There was alot of favoritism being showed towards some associates than others. The hardest part was dealing with negativity and working with others who didn't like thier job. Most enjoyable was meeting customers and taking care of thier needs. Having customers that come back to see you and like the service that you provide them."
good,Walmart prides itself as a company that respects the environment and promotes environmentally friendly products. A typical night at work is the evening meeting about the days sales figures and what is expected of us that evening. I quite like a night with plenty to do as it makes the shift go much smoother and you have a feeling of accomplishment and a satisfaction that you did a good job. The things that I learned is that there is never a typical shift and you really get a sense of how the store operates. The management team are very respectful and friendly. They will help you with any questions and concerns. My co-workers are friendly and let you know that you are a good worker. They will help you when you need assistance. The hardest part of the job is finding room for inventory when you need to bring in more inventory but it is always manageable. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is when I can work independently and make decisions based on my own experience and have the shift go smoothly.
good,"se muito dinâmico prestativo honra seu dia "
good,I worked in the deli where I cut different types of meats and cheeses for customers and I cooked and prepared food for the daily work day. And I also made different types of food trays for customers that ordered trays. I learned that in this type of work place no one is your friend. The people that I worked with where ok to a certain extinct. The managers where strict and they had their favorite employs that would get away with murder if they could. The hardest part of the job was trying to please a difficult manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to please the customers.
good,"I have learn lots of things from my fellow co-worker in the electronics department. The hardest part of the job is trying to please management. I work in the electronics department where we have to supervise high price item, change tags around for the movie release every Tuesday, and pulling new items from the stock room to the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job I must say is meeting new people everyday."
good,was a very uneventful job was not a very good job will let you go if you are injured on the job
good,"Employees are very friendly."
good,"Things got done but the management was not the best. No one had direction half of the time and was just trying to stay out of the way. I learned how to use a pallet jack on the job, and how to utilize my organizational skills while stacking boxes on the pallets. The co-workers were friendly for the most part but there were a few odd balls that were always cranky. The hardest part about the job was repetitively picking up boxes, over and over again. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,Being multi-tasked & meeting people from diverse cultures. To work at Walmart you must wear many different hats in order to meet the demand for the customer.
good,you get to meet a lot of people.Alot of nice people to work with.
good,Good company to work for. Good advancemen t if your willing to do the work
good,"will let a person go as soon as the  month mark hits, does not have any incentives to try and keep employees and will try to find any and every way to fire a person"
good,"A lot of obligations are expected in a short period of time. Some co-workers are not very friendly, and sometimes management shows favortism to certain employees."
good,"I started my work day at 4 in the afternoon and finished at 1 in the morning. I learned how to trouble shoot cable and set up new services. my co-workers were OK, but my managers were not.They were always down your back they also showed favoritism.The hardest part of the job was when i came across a problem that they had not trained me on. I always found out how to do what ever it is they wanted but my calls would take longer and the customers would become frustrated. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I fixed a customers problem while they were yelling at me"
good,This is a temp service and was not bad for the job that I got hired through.
good,They try to give you benefits. Management is rude. Willing to call you a liar to your face. Will be fired for talking to unions. Work is fulfilling.
good,same thing as in my other walmart review. i was a cart pusher. i did this in the rain and sun
good,I learned how to be a more productive person by learning different skills:
good,i would not work here again. too much work for little pay. they cut  your hours when you get close to getting benefits
good,"typical day at work "
good,The environment resembled that of high school with the gossip and drama that flowed around and lack of accountability by supervisors when unemployment was asked for. The general manager was let go due to lack of production.
good,fair place to work. co-workers are friendly. management doesn't really work together. most are not sure what the other needs done
good,"A typical day at Walmart overnights was to come in and do the clean up of the previous shifts.I was one of the trainers for stockers as well as the overnight Ims. I learned how to handle the labeled and unlabeled frieght. To properly scan it in and out of the bins also do Bin audits as well as palletize and operate the stacker,and to use pallet jacks.The hardest part of the job was to know that you were overworked and under paid. The people that you meet in Walmart are some of the best people you will ever meet."
good,"work days were good i learned new things and the co-workers were good, but the managers were really bad. hardest part was dealing with the mangers and the best part was the work."
good,The place had me doing everyone's job including my own pretty much says it all
good,Would not want to work there again. Sucks!!!! did not like working there.
good,I rather not disclose that info.It was both good and bad but more bad. I wouldnt recommend anyone I know to work for a company without a union.
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier for WalMart. interacting with the customers daily, and helping them however I could. "
good,"I never had a moment to be bored. Always something to do. I worked all over the store. In site to store, up front being a cashier, wireless center, toys, photo lab or sometimes in the back room inventory prepping. I learned that I can work very well under pressure and I am great at multitasking. Management was hard working and helpful. Co workers always made it a great day. The hardest part of the job was trying to get used to doing so much at once. The most enjoyable was the co workers."
good,"I was kept very busy and really didn't mind the job that much. Occasionally it did get a bit tiring, but I kept at it. I was always nice to the customers, but there were a few that pushed my buttons. Management was usually complaining about stupid things and didn't even try to help out. Many of them stood back and complained while they did nothing. Many co-workers were down to earth people and fun loving. We usually just complained about how terrible some managers are or customers. The pay wasn't the best, but i could at least live paycheck to paycheck. Overall, most days were bearable."
good,A typical day at walmart was very fast paced. My co-workers (cashiers) worked as a team to keep the front end running smooth. The most enjoyable part of my job at walmart was meeting different types of people and getting to know some of the customers that came into the store on a daily basis sometimes three or four times a day.
good,Certain de nuit  aime  parler dans le dos du monde  et ce monter une gagne pour faire de la manigance et du complot
good,"Não tenho queixas a não ser dificuldade no acesso a promoções, pois a empresa impõe tempo de trabalho em cada função."
good,"I am currently a Department Manager for a particular department and I recently was given the opportunity to grow as a manager with more responsibility (about 6 months ago) when my Store Manager assigned me the head of another department in addition to my current one. I did not mind this at all and was actually pretty excited to show what I am capable of but things were very short-lived with my motivation towards the idea. At first I was able to properly work in my departments and start moving things in a positive direction but my Store Manager, being new to our store, started loading a lot of different tasks on my co-workers and I. This was not much of a problem because the things we were asked (enforced) to do were just part of our jobs in helping out each-other as a team usually would. We would do things like work pallets of merchandise for another department that had excess freight from our truck we received the previous night because there wasn't enough help during the night-shift & we would also, from time to time, have to help out with the zone and front-face the products on the shelves to help give a clean and friendly appearance to the customers. The REAL problem is the fact that just recently, us department managers were told that the only time we are allowed to our selves is in the morning when we come in at 7am then from 9-9:30am onwards we were to do whatever needs to be done for the store as a whole. Later on, at 2pm, a FULL ZONE of our Grocery department would be initiated and ALL MANAGERS are REQUIRED to participate or else... Whit this in place, this essentially"
good,"Today I cashed checks, printed money orders, helped customers with our money cards"
good,"Aprendí a relacionarme mejor con los clientes, pero dentro de la empresa (gerencia y departamentos) hay mucho favoritismo, mis colegas son muy buenos empleados, trabajadores y respetuosos. Lo mas difícil del trabajo es interactuar con cada miembro de gerencia que tiene ideas diferentes; dentro de mi puesto estoy conforme ya que es mucho muy basado a tecnología y así mismo estoy retroalimentando mis conociemientos."
good,A typical day at work was hectic You had CSM's that are Great at what they do and then you have those who don't want to do any work I learned how to be patient and to control and watch how I talked to people Management was ok depends on the days you work again if they  feel that they don't want to be bothered the disappear but if the lines got backed up they want to run around mad at the cashiers because they didn't schedule enough people or a lot of people called out the hardest part about this job is dealing with the attitudes of your  coworkers and customers alike  the most enjoyable part of the day was GOING HOME!!
good,The store worked at was not a good location. Management  was laxidasy and didn't follow guidelines set in place.
good,"I go to the receiving area and i had my own station to build bikes grills and furniture. I learn how to communicate with costumers on a sale associate level and to build them what they need to be built. My management team wasn't all that great but I still got my job done and did my best. In the store the co workers were great we treated each other like a family, we helped each other in any needs or problem we had. the hardest part of the job is to find something to do when all the task were done. the most enjoyable part of the job was to see that smile or happiness on the costumer faces."
good,"Recommended, selected and locate merchandise based on customers needs."
good,I would work at Walmart again just probably not the same one I worked at previously.
good,"Everyday was different and I met all kinds of people from all around the world. I learned a lot from customer service, piercing ears, and learning the merchandise in my department. Management would constantly stop and chat and watch as I was waiting on customers. At first it made me nervous, but then when I asked a management about it one day his response was the evaluation was coming up and he was checking to see how I provided customer service and if the customer was happy. I had great coworker and we worked well as a team to get everything done that needed to be done that day plus more. The hardest part was to please every customer that walked through the door and with working in jewelry there were certain watches we could not replace batteries for, not because ewe did not have the batteries, but because the watch was very expensive and if the watch broke in the process it would cost the store to repair the watch. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and meeting some famous people too."
good,"Era um serviço bm puxado e pouco valorizado pelos superiores,o bom e que ganhei uma boa experiencia na funçao que exercia,a gerencia na epoca nao era das melhores,o que amenizava era o companherismo entre os colegas.A parte bem dificil era de ter que ser caixa e empacotadora ao mesmo tempo com uma carga horaria as vezes bem exaustiva.era otimo quando alguns dos superiores sabiam valorizar o nosso serviço,a gente ficava com estimulo e muita vontade de trabalhar."
good,I am looking to obtain long term employment with growth potential with a company where i can contribute my hardworking ability and my positive attitude.
good,the work is not hard at all. it's a fun place to work. the hardest part of the job is dealing with a management team that treats you like you are expendable.
good,"managers and company no longer care for the employees."
good,a lot of work was pushed off onto my team we had to do ALOT more that just unload the trucks we were in essence walmart itself nothing got done if not for us.
good,good for a college student not meant for a family man. currently offer just part time and the h.r is ran by college kids
good,I worked for Walmart for over 6 years and it has its ups and downs like any other company!
good,walmart is a good company but has not so good management.  hold to adapt. Wal-Mart suppose to be about people but not really about people at all.
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves, preparing the store each day for shopping, and helping customers. Some management was better than others. I learned that the senior co-workers basically decide wether or not your going to be successful or not. They are in managements ear and if they don't like you then you wont last long. Hardest part of the job was getting everything done in time, especially when someone calls out. Most enjoyable part was helping people find what they needed."
good,It is an okay job. The management at Hartselle is terrible with the employees.
good,"I work overnights stocking shelves, running the register when they need me to, helping customers find what they need, and cleaning up my boxes and trash. I learned that customers come first, My coworkers seem very competitive."
good,"En el área laboral el ambiente de trabajo era un poco pesado y monótono pero cada día trataba de hacer algo diferente y buscar las cosas que hicieran la diferencia. El trato con gerencia era condescendiente, distanciado y con poco apoyo en las áreas pero aun así las metas y objetivos que planteaba la empresa eran alcanzados y ejecutados al 100%. Diariamente entregaba reportes al subgerente del área y gerente general de la Unidad."
good,"I honestly enjoyed my occupation at Walmart. However, I did not appreciate the way that I was treated by Management as well as fellow coworkers. At times I didn't even want to show  up for work due to the harassment and discrimination that I received while working there. I eventually ended up quitting due to these issues in the workplace. I would have liked to resolve the issues that were at hand but it turned out that this particular job just wasn't that much of an importance to me."
good,"Diverse work environment which has improved my customer service skills by the sheer number of customers provided service to in a day.  A true melting pot of customers from every nationality background, and communication opportunities.  I find it very satisfying to help customers, see their smiles as you make them feel special by aiding them in finding products, listening to their concerns and taking a personal interest in their Wal-Mart experience."
good,uloaded trucks and put merchandice on sales floor/ did floor mantaince
good,"Locating required merchandise to be sent out to sales floor using a handheld device"
good,"Walmart, I worked there for 8 yrs. I was in the Photo Department. I enjoyed my job, Management was lenient in scheduling to compensate for family life. BUT a lot of times you will receive bad customer service, people don't like working there and it shows. They are miserable half the time. They don't take the time out to actually care about their customers. The stores are usually dirty. Lines are way too long and not enough lanes open. Management treats employees terrible and are quick to fire. Benefits are good, 401 k. good. "
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to start if you are young and is juggling school. The pay rate sucks but the people who work there truly make up for the miserable hrs given.
good,"Mostly cash payroll and government checks, process money transfers. I learned how to cash checks, how to tell if a check may be fake, to successfully send money transfers and how to collect the correct information in order to complete one. Management is hard to get a hold of. Hardest part dealing with an upset customer, most enjoyable part the people I work with"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of extreme multitasking, we didn't have enough employees  to accomplish all that we needed to."
good,"A typical day as a cashier is a register and helping customers."
good,"The job itself is wonderful, what I don't like is the pay for the work that I do. I work full time hours but I am a temporary associate so I receive no benefits. Management is overall okay. I enjoy interacting and helping the customers the most."
good,"Great first job, you must have thick skin and know you are easily replaceable."
good,A typical day at a retail store.  Co-workers are easy to work with.
good,Great most of the time. Had some rude customers and rude CSMs.
good,Everything went smoothly except for the hardest part of the job is Black Friday during Thanksgiving weekend
good,Never knew what my job would be when i would go into work each day. They were always changing assignments putting way to much expectations on their employees. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working and interacting with the customers.
good,"I thank the Lord above for a job, Walmart is not for everyone. The work flow every morning is very diffrent with the thousands of notes you recieved from management. There is very little team work,management does not supply you with what you need."
good,"I had good and bad times with Walmart. I came to work, stocked the floors. The co workers were great. Most management were easy to get along with. I loved the customers"
good,"I worked here for almost two years, but then when it was time for my raise it was always a problem."
good,"I personally learned a lot from certain people while working at Wal-Mart in one year. The biggest problem is there are entirely too many ""bosses"" there so you are never able to complete your job accurately before your shift is over with. The customers are great if you have good people skills. Another bad thing is once you start with a certain availability, its hard to change it."
good,"Meus dias de trabalho eram tranquilos, aprendi como lidar com vários tipos de pessoas, como resolver problemas que não cabiam a mim resolver para não deixar o cliente esperando, o meu contato com a gerência era pouca, mas sempre que nos encontrávamos era uma relação tranquila, pois a gerência era boa, meus colegas de trabalho variavam bastante pois cada um tem um jeito diferente de lidar com colegas, mas fora isso era muito boa. A parte mais difícil era os horários. A parte mais agradável era e foi a experiência."
good,"Meeting new people everyday, I learned that some people are just not happy at all and all u can do is smile and say have a nice day. I really liked my C.s.s's they all was pretty cool to talk to and i still talk to some of them to this day. working all crazy shift never the same hours or days or even times. I really loved working with the people that I worked with and meeting all types of different people it was very interesting."
good,Well walmart will be walmart. You know how retail is. People are friendly that you work with until it goes all high school. Work you into the ground without the benefits Not my thing
good,"Very basic days, lack of assistance etc.  It seems as though this company is continually declining although their revenues continue to increase.  Although it seems as though much of that increase is at the expense of those who do the back breaking work for them."
good,the pay wasnt that great but the people interaction was pretty cool
good,"The company is never what you see from the outside, it's structure and management techniques also instilled a lack of direction and constant misdirection amongst members."
good,"a typical day at work was just stalking the shelves and making sure costumers were happy and found what they needed. the mangers were there if you had any questions and all ways there to help. i learned that it is still demanding work especially during seasonal. the co-workers were all ways nice and helped you if you needed help. the hardiest part of the job would have to be the costumers that were unhappy with something that happened between the company and the costumer, and the negative energy would bounce at you the employee. it wasn't easy to keep a level head but its what needed of you to do. but the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart would be that every one that work there were friendly and respectful to you and anyone else that worked there."
good,"Please do not call Walmart."
good,I worked for Wal-Mart as a temporary employee and when your a temp they seem to try and take advantage cause they know your trying your all to not mess up but then they put you into situation were you may try you hardest but end up not becoming permanent because they don't think you tried hard enough.
good,"if you value your sanity don,t work for wal-mart. lousy pay, long  hours, management uncooperative and injuries occur often with out notice."
good,I did not really enjoy my experience at WalMart. The people that work there are rude. The managers are also rude. They don't really care about the employees.
good,Would unload trucks and stock shelves in the store. Would interact with co workers only when stocking shelves and encourage speed in moving the boxes.
good,"Usually had Mondays and Tuesday off, worked every weekend because and that time I had no car and I had to rely on my dad and then my husband to take work and pick me up from work.. I worked every after Thanksgiving sale and any other after Holiday sale. I started out up front on the register and then I was sent to the Garden Center as their cashier. I also was the front end exit greeter, front door greeter, and Garden Center greeter. I had several jobs.. I learned some CSM skills I have had to over ride a sales item that was not put in the system because my Dept Manager was busy and he gave me the key and is ID I ran my own reading to balance my register. I trained other cashiers that is a cashiers job when new employees come in. I got along ok with my other co-workers except for one. The hardest part is getting angry customers."
good,Walmart is a good place for me to work currently as I'm in school and they have flexible hours. The managers are like managers anywhere. There is some good ones and some bad ones. My coworkers I love! They are for the most part wonderful people who are just trying to make a living. The hardest part of the job is learning about cars as I work in the Auto Department. The most enjoyable part is when I have a nice customer. I have learned quite a bit about cars so its good.
good,"Typical day was answer phones and directing them to appropriate departments or answering customer questions, restock product, set up new displays, maintain appearance of sales floor, help customers with their questions on the sales floor, and help as a cashier."
good,"I found that working as hard as you can will never advance you in this company. In order to advance you must know someone in a higher position to promote you. I was never officially promoted and my pay was never changed when I did my work as a Customer Service Desk Associate. When it comes to work though it is for the most part leisure time all the time, But every good worker knows how to keep busy while the rest stay lazy. One person holds the team together in Walmart but in this economy it's almost worth it."
good,"I learned many new trades working at Walmart, I don't recommend anyone work there. Management is not professional. Co-workers talk to much about personal things, that should not be discussed at work. The hardest part of the job would be tolerating the people you work with. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the customers, especially the regulars. I amounted the job as being in High School still."
good,Fun because of the customers and work load. Certain rules don't apply to all associates.
good,busy pace learnd stocking pricing etc good co workers  hrdpart working in freezer
good,"I worked on the chemicals isle and really enjoyed learning about all the different laundry detergents, fabric softeners and cleaning supplies. The hardest part of the job was the amount of work placed on one person. The most enjoyable was working with customers and helping them find what they needed."
good,Typical day greeting customers and performing sales transactions. Co workers were very helpful and always nice. There was not really a hard part to this job. The most enjoyable was the customers that always made sure to come to my line
good,"Night Receiving: Worked to restock shelves. Had to know where items went on shelves to make sure inventory totals can be accurate. Had to work in a fast pace environment and keep work space clean and neat. Operate a baler to recycle cardboard, and a trash compactor."
good,this place had its up's and downs. was nice to get a bonus if you ever got it. some managers are nice and some are just out to get you! working part time is a drag! work one day get a day off. you are timed and if you are off they will let you know! most of the times you have to do stuff is unreasonable! work every holiday just to get your hours cut after! you are lucky to makes ends meat! if you are desperate is ok for a while but not a job i would want to retire from!!! stock shelves and unload trucks no extra time to unload trucks. no extra time to help customers! the hardest part of this job is making the times and having a personal life! nothing ever gets fixed. no training on products!
good,"The managers are incredibly judgmental, I did not enjoy working there."
good,the job was to make shore the parking lot was clear of any carts
good,"I enjoyed the design side, and felt that it was a creative way to do things. Had little guidance from management but was able to make the best of a job that I had to take as a single mother."
good,"Working overnights going in at 7pm trucks are not unloaded , break packs not sorted , grocery truck not down stacked , dayshift picks still in receiving , store not zoned , carts not clear on the lot , all this puts overnights behind from the start."
good,"aprendí hacer  organizado en todos los aspectos, el manejo de equipos de alta tecnología, que en su momento no conocia."
good,"What Ive learned in the year that I have worked at WalMart. Being full-time I have lil to no benefits and that is what commits me to a company. WalMart is not where I want to be in my future it is just a mid-point in my career path. I am the baker in the department and my day is a fast one. I start at 5am and I am finished at 1pm, it is a day of managing your time. For if you do not have time managment and organization than you will not be able to work in this position, for time is not on my side. I have to be faster than time. Management for the dept is average but could be a lot better. "
good,"A normal day begains with walking to designated area / department and clocking in. For shipping associates that means walking 1/4 of a mile to clockin, to go to lunch, back from lunch, and to leave at the end of the day."
good,I personally had issues with travel to get to work as well as child care so I was not able to get to work. 
good,"	Assist customers in all needs of having a great experience while shopping"
good,"Very functional work space, when kept properly organized. Co-Workers weren't always by the book, and that rubbed off on me. The management didn't really make it a mandatory thing to observe what was really happening, but things flowed. I learned how to use a slicer. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up at the end of the night when people leave the shift without doing their part. I really enjoyed my interactions with the customers."
good,"mejorar salarios, personal administrativos en los rangos de subgerencias y adelante."
good,"Greet customers, ring up items.  Management rarely backed you up or helped out. "
good,"Management needed some work, but overall decent. You were given a lack of hours, which in turn, caused money issues for the fellow employees. Overall it was not to bad of a company to work for. I worked there for three years."
good,"I was a crew member working on the third shift, stocking shelves.  This job was very physically demanding, and the hours were from eleven p.m. to seven a.m., which was very difficult for me to enjoy time with my family.  I appreciated the job opportunity that this company provided to me, but ultimately, when another came available to me within a month, I decided it was more suitable for my family."
good,"I have worked for the largest retail company for the past six years. I have gained experience from learning to work through the positives and negatives of Walmart. I have been front end associate of the month four times in the past six years, that is the most out of any cashiers in the store. I have gotten many positive acclamation from customers, associates and managers. I deal with monetary tasks with customers, and enjoy working with them."
good,"Not a job for life. Barely enough to get you by. Loved most of the management. Most coworkers were awesome, there were a lot of lazy people so I had to pick up their slack. Hardest part of job was being nice to customers were rude."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked around on a daily but the management was unfair and overrated. Its hard to move up in this company unless you got buddy buddy with someone in management.
good,"It was an okay job I love people ,But I did not care for the lack of English speaking worker that .I would have to stop  to help a customer because they couldn't understand them. and the favoritism that was shown "
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was going home and I learn to work a Rf-gun
good,Started work stocking shelves. Ended day stocking shelves. I learned how retail works. Management seem to be understanding of employees. My co-workers were always helpful team players. The hardest part of the job was Christmas time. Very busy! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the sales results and realizing your hard work payed off.
good,An average day at work is to learn how big business is moving forward. How important it is to get on board with the team or get left behind. Most co-workers are half my age. The hardest part of the job is hiding how difficult it is to understand some of the newest technology out today. Most enjoyable is to realize you all get along and make a great team!
good,unloaded the trucks stocked the shelves it was a good gig for a high school student although i do not remember much from that job.
good,"La empresa talves en si es buena pero las personas acargo en su mayoria  no son los mas indicados , lamentablemente cuando empeze a surgir ,  me cambiaron de jefe y el no me tomo buena , eso genero rencillas  , a las cuales yo estube abierto al dialogo  ya que erea mi jefe . Pero no siempre las cosas resultan bien"
good,"juntas en la mañana entre semana, aprendi un poco mas en computacion"
good,"Its a pretty easy job, low impact and plenty of sitting time."
good,"Management is difficult to work with, great for a first job."
good,"A good place to acquire a variety of skills. You will be put in various departments where you will be taught basic to intermidiante skills from co-workers or supervisors. The hardest part of the job would at times be the customers. Unfortunately, most supervisors and managers turn a blind eye when their cashiers or floor associates are being physically or verbally assaulted by the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers and the hour long lunches."
good,You work from 7am - 4pm everyday and a lot of overnights.  Management could care less about your life outside of work. there were nights that I worked from 10pm - 7am and as I was clocking out the GM would stop me and ask my to work the rest of the day so then my 9 hour shift turns into an 18 hour shift...
good,Walmart is just like working at Dillons poor management! Day to day tasks end up getting added to if they see that you can get alot done quickly and on a busy day where you may not be able to get extra work done they expect that from you still.
good,Typical work day is 12 hours. Customers are number one so they will take up most of your day. It's sometimes hit and miss with the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the co-workers. The most enjoyable is customer satisfaction. 
good,Work is very stressful within this company the manangement shows no concern!
good,"Typical day at work for me included taking inventory on the fish log. Then feeding the fish and cleaning their tanks. If needed I ran stock carts to the floor, did backroom processes and also assisted either as a cashier or an extra associate in other departments."
good,Working at Wal-Mart for me was a good start off job and a good learning experience.  Its retail so there really isn't anything that is extremely difficult besides dealing with a difficult customer every now and then. But it was a good job overall.
good,"Working nights was hard,  and really didn't care for that. However at the time I was working 2 jobs. Leaving one and going straight to the other. "
good,On a typical day I would mix paint and work freight. I learned that I could beat the stereotype and do what is commonly know as a mans job. My co-workers always helped when you needed them to. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that cant be pleased no matter what you do. The most enjoyable part is being able to help someone.
good,I like working at Walmart cause i met a lot of interesting people.
good,"Highly fast pace work place. Between keeping the cashiers on time breaks on time, making sure customers were happy and treated nice. The registers would break down and I had to fix them. I rarely got my breaks. I was held responsible for customer complaints and making sure there problems were dealt with. Responsible for the cash, if the cashiers needed change or loans."
good,"Not a great place to work,management is clueless at times,never properly staffed."
good,"Really, apart from a few things, working for Walmart isn't that bad."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, the management team is ok, they do not always agree on some things. My co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job is trying to explain to an customer why we cannot work on their vehicle, but the most enjoyable part of my job, are the customers who love to joke and being easy going."
good,"A typical day at work consist of myself and dozens of customers. I help with a variety of things, answer questions and calls, locate items and prices, etc. I enjoy conversing with the customers, everyone is so different and I enjoy them each in their own way. The hardest part about working there would have to be the managers. They expect you to do your assignments plus theirs. "
good,"A typical day for me at work is being sceduled in oe area of the store for that day, but i end up in another area or two completeing two of three task in the one day. Customer service is a big part of my job and i ejoy helping the customers as well as my co-worker. I am all about being a team player. My co-worker as well as some managers know that they can count on me to get the job done; no matter how long it take it me! Through out my years of working at Wal Mart, i have learned that a title of a person does not define who they are, it is whats inside of them that counts. Not all of my managers are nice, but where can you find that? but i do respect each and every one of them. the hardest part to my job and not having everyone on the same page and being a team player."
good,"Greet the customer with a smile, ring up their groceries and selections from the store,bag them, and accept their form of payment. It was a great multitasking job in which that is a skill one must master in order to become a good cashier. The management was really well they were able to answer every question that came up and handle every issue that needed attending to. Everyone was very nice with a great attitude towards the customers and their jobs. The downside to this job was the constant standing on your feet in one place and the long hours, it seemed that I never saw daylight. The enjoyable part was being around all the customers and meeting different people."
good,moving up in the ladder.  the management was hard to impress. They  seem like they did not care much about the people who where on the front lines.
good,"Working at wal-mart was truly a experience. A typical day at work consist of me helping customers and providing a friendly check out process . The hardest part was dealing with customers attitude , but I manage to over come it."
good,"Overnight cashiering required a lot of standing, stocking, and cleaning. It wasn't hard work but it was very repetitive and not very challenging. It introduced me to responsibility. My first manager was helpful but the overnight supervisor was not hands on and often couldn't be found."
good,The hardest part of the job is there is not enough associates so sometimes the work becomes too much too handle.
good,"Most employees did not care about there jobs they were only there for the paycheck. did not do their jobs properly, and management was the same way95% of the time."
good,A typical night would be 4 cashiers two of us resetting all registers exept the ones that are in use.
good,"A typical day at work was unpredictable. We did what management told us to do, and it varied on a daily basis. I learned how to manage inventory and create wireless contracts. I also learned how to take good care of my customers. Management was evasive. The hardest part of the job was the lack of coordination with management. The most enjoyable part was setting up customers with working lines of telephone service."
good,"My typical day was coming in and heading stright to the floor, management was friendly and my co-works was great. There isn't anything hard i can say about the job but the most i enjoyed out of the job was all the friends i made."
good,"trabalhava muito e ganhava pouco,comida ruin,muitas horas extra e duas horas de intervalo"
good,"A typical day at Walmart was like going into a military! I worked there for 8 years. It had it's ups and downs. Management was unfair to alot of the employees, I guess you could say that they had their picks."
good,"I don't believe that any day in retail management can be summarized. I had the most amazing coworkers, who possessed a can do attitude."
good,it was just a job and personally it sucked there was not enough staff and too much work
good,i worked the night stock shift and i enjoyed it it was independant work and i thrive at it
good,Walmarts is a suitable workplace management and policy could be worked on
good,A typical day a Walmart is you get to meet a verity of people. i like where I work because I like to help people and feel like I have made a difference in someones life that day. At Walmart you can do that because a lot of people come in and if there is something that they really need. You can almost garantee that Wlamart has it. The things that hurt me is that you work with people who do not seem to enjoy there jobs. Someone always has an attitude or just grumpy. The job over all is a very nice place to work.
good,"The Walmart i was at was very unorganized, the manager was stealing employees bonus money. And the starting pay was horrible for a company thats worldwide."
good,"A empresa e otima mas tem muitos funcionarios que ja estao la a bastante tempo que acham que os funcionarios nao tem vida fora da empresa.Quando voce colabora esta otimo,quando voce sequer pensa que nao da para ajudar, a opiniao ja e outra."
good,"The job is a good job to develope beginning skills to work on cars, the company Wal-mart is not my favorite company to work for. They make you do other jobs in the store even if you have no experience which is also a good thing at the same time. Because you develope more skills it has it's good days and bad days,"
good,"The days were very different and it was always a learning experience. I learned that you have to be very cautious when dealing with multiple customers at once. Management assisted when they could but they usually sent another employee who knew more i the particular area to help when needed. The co workers made the daily routine of working at Wal mart much more enjoyable and they helped even when told not to because it may not be their particular area. The hardest part of the job was having to move to a different department within the store and completing the task in that area. Sometime is consisted of pulling pallets of things that were much taller then me, or to use equipment that I was not trained to use. The part I enjoyed most was helping the customers locate items in the store or just answering their questions it made me feel like I was needed and I was glad to be able to help."
good,"Regular, horas extra sin pago de las mismas, aprendí a hacer nominas,manejo de personal,uso de diferentes métodos de revision de test,etc"
good,"Coworkers are friendly for the most part. Management is unrealistic with timeliness and goals. Not enough staff to meet demand of customer workload, inefficient staff on overnights."
good,The job opportunities are very good if you are willing and able to relocate. Salary for management is not competitive enough for the field of work.
good,Its always great in the beginning but the employees are rude and keep things stirred up. Management cares about no one but themselves.
good,"Loved working with this walmart in Noblesville, in cause they people i worked with were very nice and helpful."
good,Had fun learning the bakery process and working with friendly staff
good,What I did:
good,"Very busy environment, great people, but horrible pay. I loved working with my fellow employees, but management was not too great."
good,"Not the best, but not the worst. I loved the contact with the public, and getting to know our patients. However the compensation, for the job was less than desirable. Standing for 9 hours was not the most fun. Management was fine, as you work with the Pharmacy Manager on a personal basis. So getting along with your co-workers was a must have."
good,"It was a night job, and I loved it. I learned to do a lot of things I had never done before in a remodel of a store. Had lots of managers they were ok, co-workers were ok, hardest part of the job was not knowing whether you would be hired when the remodel was over. The most enjoyable part was getting to learn things you did not know."
good,I worked day shift (6-3) on the front-end of Wal-Mart. My item per scan rate was 1245 per hour; multi-tasking and interaction with customers was an enjoyable part of my job; helping the elderly unload carts and sometimes even helping them to their car. Making faces at the babies and holding conversations while performing the tasks needed to make the transaction complete.
good,My day starts out with cooking food then getting advised about new procedures such as no cross contaminating the cheeses slicer with meat. I have learned to work with people who have two jobs and personal problems that affect their job duties. The hardest part of my job is workers who get sick and not enough coverage for those sick. The most enjoyable part of my job is having a job that gives raises and works with my hectic school schedule.
good,Nice people and good place to learn new things. Some co workers were rude there. Learn alot from different people coming through your line.
good,"Did their best to help as many customers as they could. at the time had excellent management, and people looked out for one another, had to ask for time off way in advance."
good,A typical day:In at 5:00 am. Vendors waiting. Check them in one at a time until you catch up enough to stop and enter your paperwork into the computer. 15 min break if you can get away. More vendors until 10:00 am. Receiving closes and you can finish your paperwork and clean up your area of empty pallets etc. Lunch for an hour. Back to receiving after lunch to see if there are any late vendors that need you. Prep milk credits to go out the following morning. Shrink wrap that pallet. Enter milk credits in computer. Make sure all your paperwork has been finished and then file it in the UPC office. Take one last look out back. Make sure all is clean and organized behind the store in your receiving area. Lock up and clock out.
good,Everyday was unorganized. We never had a understanding of what the management wanted because they were always changing routines at the last minute. Claim to be family oriented but when it comes down to your child being sick they were not understanding. My child has seizures and you would think they would be a little more understanding. Overall its an okay company to work for.
good,Nice place to work. Good environment. They donate a lot to different Charities.
good,"All of the managers were really nice and very understanding when your couldn't make it in, but I only worked there a month and a half. I was hired in November and laid off at the end of December. I wasn't given any notice of my lay off either. I feel as though when a company asks for a two week notice when an employee is getting done then they should give a two week notice to the employee when they are gonna lay them off so that they have enough time to begin looking for a job. Just because your job suddenly ends doesn't mean that your bills stop suddenly too."
good,"Ensured that each customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, which includes greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintaining solid product knowledge and all aspects of customer service. Maintain an awareness of all promotions and advertisements. Assist in processing and replenishing merchandise and monitoring floor stock, floor moves, merchandising, display maintenance, housekeeping, completing price changes within the departments and ringing up customer sales at the registers and/or bagging merchandise. Communicates customers requests to management, and demonstrates the ability to carry on a business conversation with business owners and decision making. Adheres to all company policies, procedures and business ethic codes and ensures that they are communicated and implemented within the team. Build trust, value others, communicate effectively, drive execution, foster innovation, focus on the customer, collaborate with others, solve problems creatively and demonstrate high integrity. Proactively establish and maintain effective working team relationships with all support departments, and maintains professional internal and external relationships that meet company core values. Demonstrates ability to interact and cooperate with all company employees. Any others tasks as assigned from time to time by any manager. Ensure merchandise is unloaded from trucks and stock is placed in the appropriate location such as the backroom or sales floor. Utilizes handheld scanner to identify items needed on the sales floor and retrieves merchandise from inventory"
good,"I worked at wal-mart for 5 years. Its hard to get move forward in the company they tend to only promote the people that they like. They have favorites, and you know exactly who they are."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public and learning new tasks every day.
good,"I absoulutly loved the people i worked with, they became family to me. My co-workers were the reason I wanted to come to work everyday, specially on our slow days those could of been some my worse days at Wal-Mart. I can say the Management could use some MUCH NEEDED improvement."
good,"A typical day at work is that you work where management sends you. You may end up working in more than one department per shift. I have learned that money is the bottom line, not the workers health or what the workers have to say. My co-workers work but they are not appreciated for their hard work. The hardest part of the job is that even if you have a good idea management will not even take it into consideration. The most enjoyable part of the job is the comradery with my co-workers."
good,entrei como operadora de pdv fui promovida em um ano pelos meus atos de interesse de aprender as tarefas ali fornecidas.
good,"Managers did not follow procedure, co-workers were reliable, hardest part of the job was not being able to advance and also the lac of consistancy in the rules and procedures. Most enjoyable about the job was the days normally went by fast."
good,"Walmart is a okay company to work for as long as you do what your asked to do for your daily task. You can advance in the store or transfer to other stores, which can be a plus if your trying to relocate."
good,My typical day would be to come into work and check in with my managers and get assigned tasks. Help customers when need and making sure there having a good shopping experience. We zone our areas making sure everything is clean for the following shift. The hardest part of my job is dealing with managers that just like to interorgate you for no reason. Te most enjoyable would be working with my fellow coworkers and our friendly customers.
good,Was an ok job but not a life time job. Some racisum goes on. Sometimes you will have to work in other areas besides the area you were hired in. Fun places if you do your job.
good,"Hard work, I was doing 5+ job codes, and was paid for the lowest one. I was the 'go-to' guy for the managers because they knew I would do any job asked of me because I wanted advancement. I never got any. Half of the people I worked with with good people. The other half were people who were miserable and if they didn't like you personally, they would ruin your reputation, which would get you fired."
good,i have learned a lot working at Wal-Mart over the past three years and worked with many different people . Wal-mart is known for great customer service and the management there tries to live up to that standard each day . The hardest part about the job is trying to please every customer and stay with in the guide lines . The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart is being able to stay busy and learn new things.
good,good days and bad days good starting job if your looking to start a job at a young age just to make money. A lot of management changes all the time. Dealing with customers was fun and challenging for some and co-workers always made the time pass
good,"When I first started at Wal-Mart it was a great place to work at. I started as a cart pusher and set my goals to get promoted, it took me a year in time to get a management position. I managed an elite team to unload trucks and to process them and stock and bin merchandise. I set up a way to easily separate the merchandise we got in. as time went by we had to help overnights do there job and days finish there thins and got griped at for not hurrying to complete our task they would work us to the breaking point and never gave me or my team the gratitude o the appreciation that we deserved. I had been fighting custody ship with my ex wife and needed the days off to go to court I brought it up to all management including the store manager of the situation and they all told me they would ix it and they never did. I came in on my days off and did everything for the company for them to fire me cause I had court which I told them about."
good,"Uma empresa boa,oque é uma pena que a gerência não corresponda."
good,"a day at walmart was based on how well u could convince some one to buy things they really didnt need and i was pretty good at it, i went from a cashier to cell phones to overnight stock"
good,"es bueno el ambiente de trabajo, mucho movimiento todo el día, harto trabajo por hacer, lo difícil que aveces se hacia trabajo doble, lo que mas me gusto es aprender hacer distintos tipos de alimentos me encanta ese rubro, pero es por turno y necesito un trabajo fijo para estudiar."
good,"Management yelling saying get it done ,get it done with no support or help half the time. No encouragement. The enjoyable part of the job was going on my lunch break, and going home."
good,"Trabalho tranquilo e fácil de executar , aprendi uma cultura de outro país que não é o meu , a gerência demonstrava sofrer muita pressão e passavaisso aos subordinados .colegas cada um por si e deus por todos , a parte mais difícil foi aceitar isso , a mais fácil foi testemunhar a evolução ."
good,"Management tried to walk all over those that are beneath them, and refuse to take any comments or suggestions from those who are not in management."
good,"Open and closing proceedures. Turning on all machines. Intake and processing of inventory. Greet and determine the needs and wants of patients, retrieve medical records and pre-screen patient for Dr."
good,Wal- mart is a very hard place to work due to the fact that they don't care about you or your family they just care about the sale numbers are high.
good,"I really enjoyed working in the sporting goods department and I especially enjoyed the people that I worked with. However, the upper management of the store was the worst I have ever experienced because we were threatened and belittled constantly and never, ever, complimented."
good,"I would work for walmart again, if they paid decent. I liked the people and the work"
good,"Most Walmarts start out with wages over minimum wage. There are many locations within the United Staes. They're great with availability and have flexible hours that can accomidate with other occupations (i.e. school, second job, etc.)"
good,"Both times I worked for this company was a great learning experience. Learned to mix paint as well as the vast knowledge on products as well as how to sell them to individuals. Upper management was willing to help and listen to ideas, and even implement them. Having customers come back and ask specifically for you because of the knowledge you possess is a great boost to my enjoyment of the workplace."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a great career experience. The management staff was not the best, but the skills that may be acquired were. The benefits are great! There are opportunities for bonuses, 401k plans, medical and dental insurance, short and long term insurance, life insurance policy, and stock."
good,Come to work get my cash drawer ready for my shift. I was a cashier and a layaway associate. Front End management was great and so was one of the Co-managers. The hardest part was working til 12am and returning at 6am with me having kids. My best part of the job was doing layaway's for customers. Getting their stuff in boxes and putting them away.
good,"Some days they will have really high expectations of you, but if you maintain your speed and learn where to put stock, most days you will be more than fine. Managers will constantly be on your back and have unrealistic expectations on your stocking speed. About half of the other workers on the shift are constantly complaining about the job, yet they've been there for over a year, which is very demoralizing. Use this job as a stepping stone to move up the corporate ladder, provided that you latch onto a manager that you like very quickly."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be clock in, find out where you've be positioned on a register. Work at your station for the rest of your shift. Ive learned that staying busy is always a good thing and the time will go by fast. Management needs way more improvement."
good,"Like any company, its all in what you make of it. Have a positive attitude and no matter the outcome will be positive"
good,"Overall experience will vary depending on the store you work in. I been in great stores with great managment ,and vice versa. Just roll the dice..."
good,"Department Managers are extremly overworked and very under payed. They are the heartbeat of the store. They are responsible for price changes, working freight, merchandising in every aspect, setting modulars, and conversions for every holiday and event. They do all the work while the salaried members of management receives all the recognition for a job well done. The store manager walks the store every morning while the assistant managers take notes. Those notes are then passed to the Department Managers and they have to be done no matter the cost. If they are not DM are held responsible. The morale in the stores are not of Sam Walton. He would literally turn in his grave if he knew the how the associates he paved the way for are now being treated. The salaried members of management do not take accountability for anything, they will throw you under the bus in a minute to save their job."
good,"Walmart was a good work enviornment. I learned a lot of things, which was how to multitask and learn to work in several diffrent departments also you have to get trained on how to cashier. Management where very polite and always on track of their duties but didnt really comunicate with the co-workers. My co-workers where always on task, also very helpful with eachother. The hardest part of the job i must say would be the complicated hours they would give us. Last but not least the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the costermers and giving excellent service."
good,"empresa de boa qualidade, e objetiva da oportunidade aos funcionarios, mais infelizmente esta perdendo bons funcionario, por pagar mal os funcionarios."
good,needs more manangment......everyone needs to be on the same page
good,"Work was always extremely busy beigh short staffed. Management always ordering and not assisting in duties & creating higher expectations than attainable. Write-ups frequent and given for anyone being outspoken or even termination if the Manager felt they were not ""doing the right job/thing"""
good,"A typical day at work for me was a little exciting because i was a seasonal worker. It was always busy because of Christmas time. I really didn't learn anything new that I haven't learned before at any other job. The management there all had a dont care attitude meaning when you tell them something they just act like they didn't care. There was nothing hard about working at walmart, but I really had fun speaking to different people that came in"
good,The people were great to work with. It was hard to get anything done with management. I learned to be patient because the answer usually take a while to get back to you.
good,"I am a student who works. A typical day would be I come in I get on the register, interact with the customers, have lunch, get back on the register, and go home. However, sometimes I would like to have a set schedule. One that I'm comfortable with and cooperates with my school schedule."
good,"I am in charge of the sales floor and helping customers with items they need. I am also a service writer, this means writing the customer up for an oil change, tires, etc. I drive the vehicles in and out of the shop. I enjoy doing this and would love to be out in the shop more. All of my co-workers are dependent and the only thing i have complained about is managements communication,"
good,"Resolving customer complaints, through means of refunds and exchanges"
good,I worked there in electronics and it seemed like I was actually in my department maybe half of the time. I was either sent up for cash or sent to the back to help with the truck. Now I wouldn't mind helping because I am a team player but I applied for electronics not every department in the store and for the salary we get paid its not worth it.
good,"Walmart seems like they have everything together but they dont. They say you can work your way up to management but when I got my interview for a management position they turned me down and said I didnt have any experience.. After all the days i was suppose to be off they called me in, covered other associates and even took the role of a manager after mine left to prove to them i could do it. Co-workers dont work as much, you end up covering them to get your job done so you can go home."
good,learned alot about retail. customer service and made alot of friends.
good,It was a steady pace work and i din't learn anything new.The management was decent and somewhat fair.My co-workers were okay to get along with no problems.The hardest part of the job was getting all my work done by a certain time and the most enjoyable part was just getting the exprience.
good,"Walmart wants the money and could care less about what you have going on outside of work. Best suites a person with no life, family or friends."
good,"stocking shelves gets monotonous. Did have fun with my coworkers though. Managemnet was not really connected with our daily activities, giving us other jobs we were not experienced with or not equipped for."
good,"A typical day at work was work in produce until they needed help elsewhere then that's where I went. I learned how to tell bad for good produce and i also got certified in PLE (Power Lift Equipment). The management was not that good because they could not discipline employees the way they should. My co-workers were about the best people to work with, they were fun to be around and worked hard."
good,I worked here for a little while until my grandfather got sick. I had vacation days but got fired anyways.
good,Where do I start.... $7.45 an hour
good,"They speak of being family orientated by in reality you are a disposable person and your family dose not matter at all. The only thing that this company was good for was the money, if you have no life and no family then this is a great place to work."
good,"Worked with costumes at the cashier and at the fitting room . Help them out if they need assistance. It was a hard job , i always had good costumes and co workers."
good,A day of work at Walmart was very unpleasant and the worse company I ever worked for.
good,"I was a Cashier/Floater so where ever I was needed I was there. I trained new employees, inventory, pricing etc.."
good,"The main duties of a cashier are simply scanning customer purchases, processing their payment, and bagging their items. However, most cashiers are required to do much more."
good,"hectic envirolment, learn how to merchantdize from older associates,management inneed of IPC skills,co-workers are grate people, least of the job is management, enjoyable is going home to your family.."
good,In my area the bakery we have no team work and it makes it hard to work. Learned how to see how the bakery realy works. Some Managers are have no respect for the associates.They think the re better than you. Some of my co-workers are hard workers others are lazy . Team work!! When i see smiles on customers face and say the bakery shelfs look nice and full and they say custumer service is awsome.
good,"If you were not in with management then you were never considered for advancement because of your skills only if you were part of their crowd. This was not the case when I worked at the Kissimmee Wal-Mart, the atmosphere there was more positive. I learned how to market and display merchandise and manage a large group of employees. The hardest part of my job was being a mother of a young child and balancing my work hours. The enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of taking care of my customers, and working with good people."
good,looking as overnights are no good. bennys are terrible & i am not sure what this has to do with a resume being posted. lets get on with it!
good,No advancement opportunities due to being a woman. Looked down upon
good,"O local de trabalho é agradável, os colegas são companheiros e sempre dispostos a ajudar,a parte mais difícil do trabalho é no começo por que normalmente somos contratados sem experiência, mas com o decorrer do tempo vamos aprendendo, a parte mais agradável é que se saímos daqui, temos experiência da função exercida em carteira."
good,Management was horrible. I got fired for being too slow as an overnight stocker when I had gave them paper work and had told them numerous times about my ADD.
good,"ingresar ver que el piso de venta este listo para la apertura y que las gondolas esten con mercaderia siempre, debe estar todo limpio y ordenado como corresponde y con los precios en cada mercaderia sacar toda la mercaderia del deposito y exivirla y atender a los cliente y resolver lo que el cliente te plantea ya sea un problema con la mercaderia o con algun pago. lo que aprendi como resolver los problemas de los clientes y darles un buen servicio para que vuelvan. mis colegas son lo mejor que tuve fueron compañeros , amigos y como hermanos que siempre conte en los buenos y malos momentos. la parte mas dificil los jefes y los gerentes los malos tratos psicologicos y verbales. lo que mas me gusto fue mis compañeros los clientes que me buscaban para la venta y darles solucciones a sus problemas y que adquiri conocimiento en controlar la mercaderia en general vencimiento temperatura, donde la fabricaban"
good,"Cashier, checkout customers at register to ensure no theft is done."
good,"This was a good first job, but not a career. Walmart taught me about good customer service and how to multitask things."
good,it was a family ran place good energy we always had fun while working
good,I would pick products from different shelves and put them on my pallet to send to the walmart stores.
good,"Wal-Mart is what everyone expects it to be. Hours aren't great, takes several years to make a decent salary, and management isn't what you'd hope for, minus a select couple. Management doesn't have an understanding of how customer interaction effects your productivity, and expect you to do more than possible. Benefits aren't worth it as every year they charge more and offer less. One week I work 30 hours, the next 19. One day I will close at 10 or 11, the next they expect me to be in between 5 or 7 a.m."
good,"Wal-Mart is fun workplace and I have learned a lot there. Management was supportive. Co-workers were friendly and helpful but exceptions are always there. Sometimes you had to deal with rude customers, I agree with walmarts rule that customer is always right but Its annoying when they never try to listen to you and discriminate sometimes."
good,The pay is not comparable to other companies. Walmart cares about lining their pockets and not about their employees. Walmart expects you to run not only your department but others as well. I ran frozen/dairy and the meat. I was never compensated for it and was making 10.15 an hour. They make it seem like the union is bad for everyone at walmart. They chased the union out of our store and told them that they were trespassing. The employees of walmart need a union to bargin for better pay and benefits. I dont think Sam Walton would be proud about how his company is treating its employees these days.
good,Working for Wal-Mart was okay but they had you doing things that were not part of your work requirements.
good,Overall the company is a good company to work for but its stores is somewhat another story and a life to experience.
good,Maybe if I worked in different part of the store I would have liked it better. I enjoyed my experience but wanted more. A lot of favortism at this store.
good,"Trabalho de Domingo a Domingo, interferindo um pouco na vida pessoal.Gerência não muto presente para escutar.Lidar com público era difícil,mas sou muito calma, e sempre atendo muito bem os clientes."
good,"Short shifts, management is AWFUL. However, your coworkers are mainly good people."
good,typical work day at walmart okay
good,The job was over all a fun job to have. A typical night at work was fun also my co-workers were very helpful with showing you the ropes and helping with getting things done as a team. Management helped with everything from questions to helping with the handheld computer. the hardest part of the job was staying up all night. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and helping the customers with what ever they needed.
good,"They care nothing for there workers or customers , Management is lacking i every way. It was a harsh unpleasent working enviroment."
good,My job was to make sure that every customer was extremely satisfied with their merchandise and visit there to Walmart.
good,i worked at walmart for a year until i had a big family tragedy and my other managers and ast managers was ok with me being gone because they new my situation. well my store manager was no help and not very sympathetic toward anything and either was corporate. They told me they couldn't do anything and that there is rules to follow well when there is a unexpected family tragedy rules shouldn't apply. I had many friends and the managers under him was amazing and I really enjoyed my job there and if there was a different store manager I would return someday.
good,"the work was tedious, SOME of the management was terrible, but SOME were good."
good,"Es una cadena de supermerado muy grande y de las mas importantes, un un número extenso de trabajadores."
good,I had a headache everyday that I had to go. It was not organized and the management never knew what they were doing.
good,"Help managered the meat department. Professional management experience; overseeing all restaurant operations, including audits for health, food safety and sanitation, implementation of training courses as well as coaching of new recruits into their fullest potential"
good,"I am one of two Cake Decorators at my Wal Mart Bakery. When I work I take customer orders for cakes. I help them with what the really want for their special day. I also sometimes help with the bakers if they need help with bread. I came into this position knowing how to cake decorate but I have learned so much more as a year as already passed. I love to take orders then work on the order, to see the customers face when they see the final product, that's a great feeling."
good,Collected shopping carts in store and in parking lot. Maintained rows of shopping carts in store and in parking lot. Assisted customers with carrying large items to their vehicle. Helped with shipping and receiving during slow periods.
good,"The overnight hours were very stressful. The job required more than what the pay was worth. The management was fairly good, and the co workers did good team work."
good,I feel that at walmart there is so many issues with how everything is run and who is responsible for how things are done. Often you do not feel appreciated for what work that you put in everyday. There are also things that go on in management that I do not appreciate. Although everything there isn't bad but I can say that wal mart truely cares about customer satisfaction but not of the cares and needs of its employees.
good,This job asked to much for the pay rate. The people were nice but management wise there was no communication. hardest part of job no room for growth no incentives. liked co workers
good,Atypical day at work included making you daily tasks on time and in orderly fashions.The thing i liked most is they gave me the chances to make more money by helping different stores with remodels.The worst part was the communication between the managers.supervisor and employees
good,"stock merchandise, inventory control, set mods, ordered merchandise, supervisor, customer service."
good,"you can be working one day,things going pretty good,then your fired seen it done just don't enjoy my job any more."
good,"The management played favorites there were no proper disciplinary actions when needed the essientials of my job was great, like stocking merchandise, dealing with customers, being a cashier, kepme busy which is what i liked. i just didnt like the way how some (favorites) associates were lazy and got away with it and the ones theat womrk hard would get disciplined for one small mess up that was very easy to deal with and fixed."
good,It was my first job and the pay wasnt too bad but I was treated badly by some of the management and was fired for no reason becuase the manager didnt like me. The work was easy and fun but being treating like that wasnt worth it... not at the store I worked in anyway. Hardest part of the job was taking the yelling and cussing from the customers for things you had no control over and most enjyable was dealing with and helping friendly understanding customers on a day to day basis
good,i feel that the managers show favoritive
good,"Need to have more hours.Hard to get more time, want to get back into retail store..Like working around people"
good,"I have worked in two different ASDA stores. While working in Breck Road store, I loved my job! I would start at 6am starting the price changes, and then carry on to checking deliveries. My co workers at ASDA where a lovley bunch of people and i think think it bonded us all together as where where their from when the shop first opened. The hardest part of the job, was the amount of work we had to do, but had important targets to meet and I personaly would work as hard as i could to get the work done. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers. I began to know shoppers by name and not by sight. I really loved helping the older ladies, who would even try and give you a tip!"
good,"A typical day at work, is finding out how many tasks you are assigned and trying to complete them all before the night is done, typically the average person will be assigned between 7 to 9 tasks (departments) and is expected to complete them all with time to spare for clean up and zoning."
good,Walmart started out as a decent job but went down hill fast. Too many sub-management positions.
good,"Walmart is good to work for if you have nothing else going on fo instance school or personal life, social life. It makes it hard to do anything else. The pay is good considering it is a little above minimun wage. I learned that being a manager doesnt make you a leader, the management style is very un-coordinated. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my co-workers."
good,A day at Wal-Mart consists of me checking out customers with a friendly attitude and exceptional customer service.
good,"Wal-Mart Inc. is hard company to work for depending on the job because of the high stress, emotionally abusive, physically demanding work environment. Constantly being told that your not doing enough even if you see other associates goofing off and committing massive amounts of time theft. There is no accountability to each individual's work ethic."
good,Good associates. Promotions slow
good,walmart is about productive which is required to some people.but you can learn alot of stuff from cashiering to picking and binning.my co workers are fun to work with.hardest part is dealing with unmannerly customers.
good,"Working cash register, cleaning general work area. Counting til at end of shift."
good,"I really liked to work at Wal-Mart, but because it was a new store in the area, Its was very unorganized. Right after you clocked in, I would have to report to the manager to see what I had to do for the day. Then I would have to go get all the returns for the day. I liked my department manager, she was understanding and helpful. The hardest part of my job was doing inventory."
good,CSM's think they are managers !
good,I work with great people and build a great team. Areas that I found in needs of improvement with this job is the professionalism with management. Event though I hate working at Wal-Mart I gain excellent work experience and meet great people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management.
good,"not value family inconvenient, management never try to understand what is call ""emergency"" and they don't even take time to take to the employees"
good,"It was crazy busy. But working with the public and others in my department made everything worth it. The management were seldom ever on the same page which made customer service hard, but anything is possible when you care about your customers."
good,Not the kind of place where intelligence or alot of other tradtional work values are held with much esteem.
good,Meu dia de trabalho super normal e divertido
good,"A typical weekend I am all over the store register, backroom, salesfloor, and it depends on who;s managing in order for you to learn things. Our store use to be one where everyone wanted to work but things changed over the years. They seem to hold you ina position not wanting you to move up. I work hard, but I want to advance. I am respected by my coworkers and managers. The important thing to me is getting the job done and completed by the end of the night. I want to be promoted."
good,Working here was ok . Breaks were not given all of the time . I felt like some people got better treatment than others sometimes.Co workers were ok. Management looked out for each other. Hardest part was having to work overnight. best part was seeing the theives being caught.
good,a typical day ..Come in provide customers service and deal with any concerns that customers or associates my have..Go over paper work checking the associates quality work and numbers.
good,Good place to work. The best part was the coworkers. Also had good hours
good,the people were very profesional and helpful and somedays it would be busy and make the day go by fast i learned a lot about customer service and dealing with money.
good,You have too be willing too go far and willing to learn alot more than you are hired on for.
good,"A typical day at work is either being a cashier or working at the service desk. I learned customer service well here. Most of my co-workers are great, but there are others who think they are the boss when they are not. The hardest part of the job is trying to please people. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and making friends."
good,"There was no A/C in the shop, and cars above you in the pit is very hot. For the most part employees were easy to get along with. Managers were cool, and easy going. But strict when they had to be. The hardest part of the job was the excessive heat, and the labor with the heat. The best part of the job was doing something that I enjoyed to do, which is work on cars."
good,They give you a job and make you work and keep oppertunities open
good,"On a typical Walmart day, I clock in and report to my CSM/CSS (cashier manager) for my register assignment. I try to avoid the smokeshop where we sell cigarettes and let them decide where to put me for the day. I am one of the rare employees with a decent college degree, which I try not to rub in anybody's nose."
good,"I thought that I would get advancement quickly, but I struggle just to get 20 hours a week. The pay is sad."
good,The work place was fun at times but for the most part the communication of what is expected and needed to be done on a daily and productive basis was lacking.
good,Learned new things but training was not very good. Just got thrown into the job without much training.
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for 12+ years. In that time I held many positions. I worked in Lawn and Garden, third shift stocking, grocery, produce, dairy, unloading, all sales floor positions, cashier and supervisor. The fact of the matter is that Wal-Mart expects it's associates to be able to do anything asked, as asked, and as quick as possible. I agree with that ideology. However, there are problems with the company. I enjoyed the customers, co-workers, and some of the managers that I worked for. The hardest part of the job was realizing some members of management could harass and discriminate against other associates and wouldn't face corrective action."
good,"A typical day at work included stocking grocery shelves, being a friendly worker who assisted customers in locating the items they needed. I learned that serving a customer with excellence was not about the day I was having but rather my willingness and readiness to make their shopping experience valuable."
good,"typical inventory work. company values are atrocious, but management left me alone to do my work."
good,typical work day is normally busy or slow all depending on the time of day.
good,"it's wonderful place i got support in Wal-mart from all my mates ,I started as a cashier 2 years ago and am a trainer now.we have a good mangers no one perfect in this world but at least they are helpful and friendly ,my position keeps me in touch with the customers so i enjoy when i am talking with them everyday learn new things because I came from differnt culture.i got payday off because the selected me the best cashier in January 2012."
good,"I'm sorry to say that the experience at Wal-Mart was one of the worst in my opinion. They pushed people to do jobs quickly, not efficiently. They had a few good things about the job, safety was always pushed. I was the lead safety person for our store. We always tried to keep our store safe & clean.I did enjoy working with the other employees, we had each others backs, making sure that our jobs were done effeciently. The open door policy wasn't exactly the best. I was having a hard time with another employee at one time. She was moved to another department & I was put in her old spot. She blamed me & was causing me a few issues. I didn't seem able to talk to her, so I went to management.I wanted a meeting with her & a manager, but didn't get it. It didn't get resolved for a very long time.It made my job a little more difficult becausr of unnecessary tension. She & I finally worked it out."
good,Working for walmart has been a wonderful experience for me. The people you work with really do take there time to get to know one another. They are awesome people. They are family and your friend at the same time.my coworkers at walmart taught me alot abput being a sales assoicate .
good,I loved working for walmart it was just the management that I did not like. I learned excellent customer service skills. The hardest part of my job was really there were no hard parts.
good,"Walmarts' a good starting/temporary position, they are always hiring, but there is a reason behind it. They don't treat their employees right. The management generally sucks. I've only had 2 good managers, and they weren't even in the same department I was in, so I hardly ha the pleasure to work with them. They will fire you for little to no reason, if you aren't doing exactly what they want you to do(and sometimes the things they say/ask just don't plain make sense). There is a good camaraderie between coworkers, though. A lot of us got off at the same time, and we would all make plans to go eat somewhere, or do a group barbeque or gettogether. Other than that, though, not much room for advancement. I spent 2 years trying to get supervisor, and they only moved me to customer service, meanwhile they hired someone from outside the company to fill the role."
good,"ok enviorment, terrible manager employee interraction. the customers were difficult at this particular wal mart. but the pay check was always pretty steady."
good,i work with lost of people and they sell food cloths what ever u need they most likely have it.
good,"Room for advancement, some managers are better then others."
good,Pay was decent for the job you did. Management could be better.
good,pay is better than average. Alot is put on middle managements sholders. Not given the opportunity to manage area thrown in as coverage.
good,This is an okay place to work. Nice atmosphere and friendly people.
good,"typical day was standing at door handing out flyer greeting costumers checking receipts maybe help, unload the truck ,or relieve a cashier for break."
good,"A typical day at work, involves me helping customers to complete their purchases at a register, help them find any items on their list, and making sure any complaints they have are solved before they leave our store. The managment at Wal-Mart is not always satisfying. I hate it when managment give rules but do not always implement them to everyone. They most enjoyable part of the job would be talking to customers, my fellow co- workers and of coarse the Wal-Mart discount."
good,I was wrongfully terminated so that changed my whole outlook on how WalMart valued its hard workers.
good,"It a good starting place for customer service. I greet custom I help check out grocery's, I handle the money, I make the check out process as fast and efficient as possible."
good,"I loved working with the employees and learned several areas of the company. Started out in the bakery, then went out to other food service areas in the store. After a while, moved to the retail areas of housewares, clothing, garden center, toys, and tire/lube express as well as other areas. I worked with the accounting office to verify deposit and cashiers' reports, helped maintained inventory, and scheduled employees, as well as handled any customer service issues."
good,I like working at walmart but the management doesnt follow all walmart policies. I want to find a better job that doesnt pick and choose favorites.
good,"A typical day includes maintaining the photo lab and straightening the electronics area, providing customer service. I have learned to operate many machines at walmart. Management is constantly checking up on people. my co workers are amazing they help with any difficult task. the hardest part is dealing with difficult customers. my most enjoyable part is working with my coworkers"
good,"I made sure there was enough money in everyones till to get threw the day, helped customers find what they needed and made sure the cashiers knew what they were doing"
good,I feel secure at Walmart. I just feel that I am needing more from my employment. I have over 5 years of customer service and I dont feel that I am fully utlizing my skills. As Loss Prevention I feel that I just stand at the front doors and check recipts.
good,The Assistand managers were great and I loved my co-workers. I like working with the public and being able to assist others.
good,Management would scream at you no matter who's fault it is. A lot of stocking & organizing.
good,A typically day would be to go in have a meeting get my direction from my shift managers then have a meeting with my associates to assign them their tasks for the day. Then I detail tour my area and then assign tasks for the issues I have found within my area. I go back and follow up to ensure everything has been completed and then have an evening wrap up meeting with the store mgr and shift mgr to go over what we completed that day. Most of the managers are awesome but then you have some that well it's just all about what they can do to promote even if it means making someone else look worthless. I have learned over the years that the harder you work and the more knowldgable you are the less you are appreciated and there is almost no hope in promoting. I have great co-workers who will stand behind you no matter what. They are always there for help and support. I think the hardest part of my job is going to work every day with that mind set that you are gonna do something with this job and then working so hard to prove that when you just get shot down and kicked in the face when you try to move up. I think the most enjoyable part of my job would be how many new things I get to learn about the company and also my customer experience. I love learning new things and meeting new people.
good,Ive meet some good people here even some I still call friends.
good,"i sliced meats in the deli department and took orders for platters and sandwiches, management was good to work with and the co-workers were helpful in training, there were times when it would get very busy and for the most part we got through it, i really enjoyed slicing the meats and weighing them to accuracy."
good,"Wal-Mart definitely has its advantages being a top consumer for groceries, electronics, and appliances. The opportunities for moving up within the company aren't good enough to keep good workers in the company. Therefore, in most cases, the result is a high turnover rate, as well as, an increasing amount of long term associates being terminated to reduce hourly payroll. Overtime is also not allowed even when on occasions they ask to extend a shift, you're instructed to cut the time before the pay period ends."
good,"Everyday included assisting the pharmacist and other pharmacy staff members obtain, process and dispense prescriptions as well as other medications and supplies. Clerical duties included making an receiving telephone calls, handling customer service issues, data entry, maintaining pharmacy records, assisting with inventory control, ordering drugs, DEA reports, Prescription transfers, Doctor call ins, insurance calls and judication, voicemail, shipping and receiving, and filling prescriptions."
good,"Wal Mart is a great place to work if you enjoying being over worked and under paid. The company doesn't appreciate the employees, they consistently find a way not to give quarterly bonuses. Employees work hard the entire year but only receive .40 cent raises. The bright side is they offer a 401k"
good,All the training at Walmart suggest that the customer is very important and that the employees matter. This I have found is not the truth in my situation at Walmart. They do not wish for you to spend any time getting to know the customers wants and needs.
good,the people on 3rd shift O/N at the store I worked at were phenomenal. very detailed and hard working and most of all fun and safe to work with
good,Wal-mart is very much like a high school. No one really gets to be promoted unless you kiss up to the managers. I've worked there for almost 7 years and never got to move up. Some managers are okay but most of them have an attitude.
good,I am simply looking to get back into servicing the customer and feeling like I helped someone.
good,"typical day started by printing photos, answering phones, cash handling and providing customer service. Best part was when i printed photos."
good,Good Co workers good management. Job Just didn't pay enough
good,A typical day at Walmart consist of management bossing you areound with little to no appreciation.
good,I worked at night time from 10pm til 7am.we start out by having a meeting before work everyday to tell us the numbers of production on stock.we then go to work and start pulling the items that need to be stocked to our aisles.then cut the packages with a box cutter to get to the items and simply stock them on the correct shelves and in a nice and timely manner.
good,Loved working there Had a great experiance I learned alot of Great things and how to better myself as a manager.
good,I have learned that if you have issues to take it to a hire level. it was hard at first but I learned to do several different aisles at a time.
good,Wal Mart is a company who is very competitive in the market and very customer friendly. They will continue to be the leader in provider excellent service to the public.
good,A typical day at walmart is helping hundreds of customer a day at the check out lanes. Is a very awesome place to work you get to meet lots of people and communication with them about their walmart shoppimg experience. All co works help each other out with their problems and try to achieve their goals together. The harder part might to be the management their not as helpful as they should be you have to learn the new things your self.
good,Wal-mart only hires associates part time and you have to wait until another position opens up if you want to move or move up. You have to work at your current position for 6 months before you move. You have to wait a year for benefits if part-time. Wal-mart is best for school kids or people that just need a part-time income. The pay is not enough to support a family.
good,"The particular Wal-Mart in which I am employed is very poorly managed. Not all Wal-Marts are like this. They are unable to keep trained staff because of the way that they manage the store. The management staff was promoted when to salary managers when they store was opened, however they were not trained well enough how to properly do their job, managing."
good,I used to love working for Wal-Mart now I just go through the motions to continue having a paycheck while I find something better.
good,"Over all it was a great place to work, great customers and co workers. Would go back there any time. I learned alot about plants and people and working for a big company"
good,"My review about working at Walmart, I did a lot of unloading Semi trucks and putting the boxes on pallets to take into the store to be unloaded and put on shelves, by the employes. I got along good with the customers and the people I worked with. It was a good enviorment to work in."
good,"The management team for the most part is great, help with tasks, friendly. But also the workload exceeds the amount of workers so its frustrating and stressful with an inadequate compensation"
good,"So, I have been working for this company for almost a year. I can't judge all Walmarts. But, this one seems to place zero value in thier employee's. There is little to recognition for hard work or effort. The promises made when coming into the company seem great. The truth is far diffrent. The inner working of managment in this particular Walmart are much like that of a high school. Performance isnt what gets you acknoledged or promoted. Popularity does. This is the main reason the current managment staff there fails at running a succesful store. There is a ever growing turnover rate for employees. Several factors have a part in that. A few major ones are low pay and part time hours for most employees. If they would pay more and give full time hour the employees they have would stay long term. Increasing the quality of service the customer get. this would lower the cost of training new employees and cause current employees to care about thier job. the store and quality of service they provide. Which in turn would increase sales."
good,"under valued, not a career for women at all, not treated equal at all, and management are pushy."
good,Good palce that works with your schedule. A lot of diiferent things to learn.
good,It could have been better if they was more understanding about having unexpected problems in life like your child being sicj
good,"Even after more than eleven years of working for this company, Management was not willing to work with me in moving me back to a job which I excelled at in the past."
good,"Long hours, poor advancement, overall poor treatment of management. They believe that the objective is to tell you every day how bad you have done and never praise anything you do well. This along with constant threats of write up's will make a person feel as thought they are worthless."
good,It was a nice place to work if you did not want to go anywhere. tryed to get more hours kept getting runaround on how they cant do that right now to worried about sales
good,"It is a stressful work environment, the company does not care about anyone or anything other than the bottom line."
good,Working at Walmart was not very enjoyable. They used the people they hired and would give them compliments one day then complain as workers do the exact same thing as the day before.
good,Great place to work but desperately needs better management.
good,"They don't care about there wokers, and there is no open door policy like they said she is."
good,I thought this job wouls have been fun and sometimes it was. I just felt like I wasn't a part of a team and ended up doing most of the work.
good,The company overall can improve upon salary for those individuals who are certified and skilled in their craft. Yes the customer is always right however they do not stand behind their employees when its obvious the customer is trying to get over on the organization. Management is not strong nor or the company benefits. There is favortism with some management people.
good,I have enjoyed working for this company. The most that I loved about this company is meeting new people.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has been okay, I wish I could get more time off. Working 16 hours on the weekend is really difficult and I would love if they'd take into consideration about time off and school."
good,"i didn't plan on staying long but ended up being there for 3yrs. it was fine until we got a new store manager, after that things change for the worst."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart, but the pay wasn't the greatest and they didn't have any benefits for the part-time employees and they usually had me working 34 hours a week, which disqualified me for benefits. But i had customers that would come to my line every time they came in the store because i gave them great service and got them through the checkout quick."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. When i told them i was going to start school during the day, they changed me to over night shift."
good,"Beaucoup trop de remarque raciste au quotidien, presque une habitude."
good,It was very hard working the schedule they assigned. Their schedule left very little room for emergencies when you have children. The work environment was not good.
good,"It was like the female manager hated men.  Nothing was ever done to her satisfaction.  She wanted so much done, but there was never enough personnel to do it."
good,Walmart is a good starter job and it can be a career but with retail you get burned out fast for how rude customers are and with how some management wont help you with any problems and yell at you when something is not right.
good,"Treat you as if your disposable, they act as though they don’t know you once they’ve let you go. No one fights for what’s right when it comes to the lower paid associates."
good,"Biased due to unique events in my experience with comoany, so I am not going to express my opinion. I believe that would be the professional manner in which this issue is to be handled."
good,"Trabajé para grupo gestión en waltmart hay un diferencia de 10mil pesos entre lo que gana un asociado y uno de agencia. Exprimen, explotan al empleado de agencia. Los asociados toman mates y escuchan música sentados mientras los de agencia corren. El sindicato sólo defiende a los waltmart nisiquiera se acercan a los de agencia. Una desigualdad total los supervisores.solo presionan a los de agencia y dan trabajos livianos a los asociados."
good,The company doesnt care about their employees. The managers do nothing to help. They stand around and watch us work hard. They are very unconcerned about everything.
good,"Managers are not supportive to employees they’re biased and big headed, pay is not at a good rate considering you are working in a fast paced rude arrogant customers who think they can abuse you or you’re co-workers, rude customers can go and lie about anything about you, over absolutely nothing, constant shoplifters  and not a so safe pace to work in."
good,"Management is very poor, they do not care about their associates. Poorly staffed, made the workplace all about them and not about the customer itself."
good,"The majority of my coworkers felt like family, and they were very supportive of my work. Job overall is tedious and the customers can be unbearable, although that's just a part of retail. Few managers that displayed favoritism and were generally bad at managing, which all in all ruined the job."
good,"Es un trabajo muy lindo, fácil de aprender, con un clima de trabajo muy bueno. Tal Vez el trato de algunas roller no es muy bueno."
good,"I feel like as a company and my experience at the store I work at, that there is no balance between employee morale and customer happiness, I've never met so many people in my life that disliked the people they work for more than they disliked the job itself, it's become a rather depressing environment that many people are unaware of because of the paid smiles."
good,"I learned so much working in Management at Walmart. I wrote daily plans, managed my team and met all goals. This was a fast paced job & we were always on the go. I really enjoy my job & take pride in it. The only drawback was no work personal life balance. I'm soaked up so much knowledge and I'm ready to take on a new path and pursue other opportunities."
good,Managers play favorites. Customers are extremely racist. Overnight managers are horrible and lazy! Management is never on the same page. The overnight managers bully workers they dislike.
good,"Wal-Mart is downsizing every year with fewer associates. A typical day at work can be fun to socialize with the people around you. The hardest part of the job is when Wal-Mart cut associates hours weekly. Therefore, not enough associates present to handle the workload that needs to be completed."
good,I don’t believed Walmart didn’t care for their employees as much as it is televised   I was a single mom with sick kids and need to call in sometimes. I need some time off for my untreament migraines and the could accommodate me
good,On your feet a lot. Not a bad place to work. Hard to get promoted if that is what you are looking for. Seems you have to know somebody. And not on merit.
good,I been in Walmart for 17 yes and soon be 18 yrs  . And I was dept mgr for 8 yrs and had to step down  cuz of my life situation. Now Walmart no longer can promote anymore I wanted be dept mgr again  but not going to happened anymore. New program now. Also the pay raise wage stinks! Everything cost higher now.
good,"Walmart does not have any competitive benefits or salary. The people you work with are very good people very hard-working. The company as a whole has no leadership, communication or strong Direction. They used to have a sense of you have some type of ownership what you did but now it does not the culture has changed."
good,"Te cargan con mucho trabajo y los peores días son viernes y sábado, de lo demás no tengo no hay problema!"
good,"As long as you follow the policies and maintain communication with ALL management, you will succeed and go far in the company. you must first learn the in and outs of how management works, the way they do things and their communication styles. then learn the policies, stay informed."
good,Your job experience is solely based off of the salaried management team of the store. The hardest part of the job is being able to get your job done with limited resources.
good,An average 40 hours a week. Very routine job. Depending on who in management you are dealing with they can be a real hassle to work with. Very corporate like entity and tries to follow corporate guide lines even if not setup to follow them.
good,"I really enjoy the people here, the customers and associates are for the most part wonderful. I do feel that there is a lack of communication between the associates and managers. Safty is an "
good,"Vc pode trabalhar e mostrar o máximo possivel de esforço,  não é reconhecido o seu trabalho , sempre quem ganha promoção para subir de cargo são as que passam pelo teste do sofá, ou então ""parentes"" dos que tem os cargos maiores , então me diga qual funcionário que fica feliz e animado em uma empresa desse tipo ?"
good,"Lack of respect for full time employees who have been employed with the company 10 or more years.  Most employees are required to accomplish work of five employees in short period of time.  Example: 54 isles only 6 minutes each isle in order to zone,straighten, and stock merchandise,along with"
good,Can be a great place to work. The associates are great. Management need to take management and customer service classes and training. A raise should be based on your work experience not who you are friends with.
good,"Management was not willing to work with any employees, they would not do the work themselves that they asked their employees to do.  They are not supportive towards their employees and there is a big turn over rate.. They have tenancy to hire and fire a lot of employees."
good,"Working here has enabled me to gain a lot of skills towards working with the public. Coworkers are great, but the benefits continue to get cut. Just wish that the call  off system was fair."
good,Managers sat in office more than on the floor working with staff. Found out some staff making more than floor managers. They definitely need more staff. Hour long lunch too long 1/2 hour long enough
good,One big complaint about how it always feels like you’re just being used to do other people’s jobs because management can’t schedule people to cover areas.
good,"Didn't have enough trained staff to work most of the time.  Turnover great in the dept.  Management promised to move me to another department summer of 2019 and it never happened.  It seemed that reliable workers were always left to take care of ""everything""."
good,The company is a great way to enter into sales and merchandise management as a starting basis.  The company has many places for folks to transfer out if needed to another facility.
good,The Walmart I work at has lots of favoritism. They tend to take advantage of their hard workers meanwhile the rest of their associates are playing around and finding excuses to not work. The point system is really dumb seeing as it only applies to some bc management takes points off for others. They don’t care about the associates and management is rude they take advantage of their title.
good,"At work one of my managers treats people badly and lacks knowledge, to the point I am unsure how the store still runs on her days. She alsp is forgetful and toxic to the point I had a mental breakdown."
good,"Multiple department/assistant managers creates a stressful environment due to the fact that you're being told to complete different tasks by different people, each of which supposedly has the ""most urgent need"". "
good,"A typical day of work at Wal-Mart is usually fast paced, you have to learn to work efficiently around customers. Management is young and could use a little structure they tend to put more on their employees than they can handle. Employees are nice and work good together the hardest part of the job was the spill's and the best part of the job for me was helping customers have a great time shopping in the store"
good,"Cuando se trata de que el Subdirector te evalúe a tu tienda no es equitativo y mucho menos honesto ya que si no eres de su agrado o su allegado llega hasta falsificar información para que te perjudique aún sabiendo que esto por política es una ""baja"" por falta de integridad."
good,"worked 40 hrs, cut me to 3 days, cut me 2days and cut me 1 day a week without advance knowledge until I text an associate ( that said she was the only one to connect with) and a supervisor called and said they Walmart only have so many hours for each store. now going back to 3 days finally.after 2 weeks. No notice of this."
good,I don’t feel like I have a purpose at this job and the managers are very subjected to only a certain kind of workers. When I first started it was great then the true side of Walmart came to face and it wasn’t very nice so I’m looking to leave
good,"I enjoyed the work I did. I had hopes to move into management. I was on the road to promotion but I have small children who get sick and the flu went through our home for about two weeks. I had to call off a few times and my points exceeded the 5 point limit. It didnt matter that I'd never had an disciplinary action before. "
good,"local de trabalho intenso, sobrecarregam os funcionarios"
good,"My husband had a near Death accident that lead to a two week hospital stay and tons of appointments, I made everyone aware of the situation at work they said they would work around it, then automatically fired me for the absence. Thanks Walmart"
good,"Working for the company completely varies by location, quality of life varies on location, pay is great for the amount of work required.  Advancement is more based on current facility than individual performance."
good,Corporate does not care even though they say they do. Your Management team does not care. Walmart is now a company where you have to look out for yourself. Jobs are always changing and getting taken away. There is no safe position with that company and it is sad.
good,Walmart had goo benefits and great opportunities and they have good people working there and stay long you could move up in employment they had horrible management and the customer is always right never forget that part and you’ll be smooth sailing
good,Walmart is a tremendous place to build experience and knowledge. The limitation is that only playing through the office politics games will you be able to advance past the lowest levels of management.
good,"Full time hours given to associates that they are friendly with and the rest suffer only getting 20 hours for a full week, had problems with a supervisor lying about me to get me fired."
good,"very messy environment, some managers are there for the wrong reasons , they have favoritism and do not acknowledge good workers just people they’ve known for a while."
good,I liked the people I worked with but the policy is the main reason the turn around is so high unless theres life or limb involved your punished often for missing work or not completing tasks of 5 people by yourself
good,"In between jobs okay, but hopefully you have unemployment while working, very little hrs, lucky if you work 18-20hrs. Must have other income to make it."
good,"Management can be very pushy , also it is really easy to get fired so just be careful with what you do or say also who you trust , management is all connected so they know who to trust and what to do"
good,The job was okay for the most part. Some customers were very nice and some were extremely rude. Management there was ok after holidays my hours were cuts lower than half.
good,"Not a terrible work environment, however, management will cut hours/ assign erratic schedules in an attempt to prevent employees from gaining full-time benefits. They will also under-staff many departments in order to slide into quarter-end under budget."
good,"The co-managers are immature and petty in this store. The Assistant store managers all care about getting their OWN objectives taken care of regardless if it messes someone else's objective up. both co-managers and ASMs back each other up in coachings so even if you open door policy the coaching, its useless. one comanager is a big bully and likes to fire people for no reason. if you work in Cap team 2 here, good luck trying to get any type of promotion or get your department change request approved in a timely manner. i know corporate doesnt care as long as the store makes money, but this lack of communication with the upper level management is really an issue here that will lead to an eventual downfall of this store. too many people who see how bad the conditions are for cap 2 end up wanting to go to another department before they are even fully hired, so that leaves cap 2 being understaffed for so long and management still expects them to get through 3 trucks daily in one shift."
good,"The management was poor, they had no respect for the people under them. My associates weren't respectful either and I felt like it was a bad environment and made working not enjoyable."
good,"My time working at walmart for a decent stretch of time was enough to collect information on how poor the management was but the pay was good. Breaks & lunch were overly lengthy but it seems like the company tries to dodge the 40 hour minor limit by implementing hour lunches into minor’s schedules & having them work 32-35 hours a week, pure sketchy business."
good,Great place to work with ok benefits. Management could be better. They also don't give you the job you interview for sometimes and they also don't give you the job you applied for.
good,I believe the interview process is similar to a cattle call in which HR never gains insight into the personal and individual skills of a team associate. I believe management is very inflexible and disorganized.
good,"In this company not only do you have to be really fast at what you do, but you also have to be really safe . Its kind of impossible to be both, each day as employers come;  we are always reminded how anyone can be replaced instantly. Its not only a hard job but very dangerous indeed."
good,Pull out pallets onto floor and into your area. work in that area until you have finished your pallets once you have cleaned your area you get sent to help others
good,Working for this company has been a good job. It provides you with the knowledge and understanding  to manage and maintain a department with in the store .
good,Management are very unprofessional. They come in just about every day with very negative energy. When asked questions they act as if you’ve asked for one of their kidneys.
good,This is a place to work short term. They are not worker friendly and the pay was not great. Let this be your stwpping stone to sonwthing better you deserve it.
good,"They have flaws, but as a company Walmart displays a specific culture to the public. Sometimes Walmart has trouble keeping its promises to associates, but for the most part they have a strong work environment."
good,"If someone, worse at the job, but has more time, wants your shifts, you lose.  Doesn't matter if you are good at your job, you really are just a body."
good,Walmart is a great starting job especially for students but there isn’t much opportunity to grow and move up the management ladder. Walmart also doesn’t seem to want their associates to move from part time to full time. While 25+ weeks pregnant I was working 40+ hours every week and was repeatedly refused to be bumped to full time.
good,"Muita pressão para atingir metas, pouco ou nenhum investimento em treinamento e promoção são poucas."
good,"Don't pay holidays "
good,My pay is bring cut due to lack of hours at the end of the holiday season. I was told that the core hour package was not going to be the most hours I would be working.
good,always be on time and ready to work make sure you have a positive attitude with a smile on your face. be very productive making sure your customers comes first.
good,"El organigrama de la empresa es bueno.  Las personas que lo llevan a cabo han tenido que moldearse a las necesidades actuales, que incluyen imposición de horarios nocturnos, y otras actividades extras. No hay posibilidades de crecimiento o mayor remuneracion.suba de contrato."
good,"Great job in terms of benefits, coworker culture, and a steady schedule. Unfortunately no room for career growth unless years of experience. Otherwise good steady job."
good,"They give you 1 hour lunch and 2 short 15 minutes breaks. They are very nice to you when they don't have anyone to replace you. When they have someone, it's a completely different story."
good,Still learning correct way to do job requirements almost 2 months in with more that needed to be retaught because original instructor showed wrongly how to do tasks
good,"Working here was fun, made a lot of new friends. However, the management team was weak. The schedule they gave me were not fit the schedule I asked for."
good,I worked here through graduate school and was able to transfer when I moved away after obtaining my degree with minimal fuss. It was easy to transfer closer to my new residence.
good,"Walmart is a great company and i learned many new things while being apart of their company, the management was good and associates were always on task finishing their work."
good,Walmart expects all cashiers to sell their Walmart MasterCard. many either got the card when they came out or get annoyed for buggering them with trying to sell them another credit card. but Walmart judges performance on MasterCard sales.
good,good place for a first job.could improve on cleanness. could pay a little better but overall its a good job.they should remove the self checkouts thats all
good,"A pretty boring atmosphere, I suppose it depends on which location. There isn't much to do, your coworkers are very friendly and helpful. The customers can be rough sometimes too."
good,"They call you in and ask you questions, have you fill out a paper and then ask if you have any questions. For the interview. After a while the managers start getting really mean and they didn't care about anything."
good,To work for Walmart is like work 10 jobs at the same time. You're over worked then when you have a break down the replace you. You get barely any help from management. Employees don't get trained properly.
good,"Willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done without breaking company policies or state laws."
good,"Walmart is an ok place to work. They have good benefits and pay, But there shift aren't family and friendly and the say the are. Long hours days off are random the company only looks out for them self."
good,I like my job just the managers are very poor rated and don’t appreciate what anyone brings to the table at work in general I do work hard but feel unappreciated
good,the location I had worked at was very unorganized and unprofessional. Granted it was Walmart but there is no reason why I should be working 6 to 7 hours straight while working 9 hour shift with no required 15 min break or lunch break.
good,"Walmart management basically bank off the associate and we do all the work. I feel the bonus don't fit our good job at Walmart and the pay should be more. And I find it crazy for the staff to have the attitude that they do and I thought Walmart was supposed to be all about family and friends. The company doesn't understand costumers and their needs.Just overall, Walmart will fall because of the way they treat their employees and customers."
good,"11 yr employee.  Fulltime employee, hrs continue to get cut making it an unstable place to work.  Management  care about CFF and not about there employees and how stressed they are with the work load and not enough  employees.  No recognition to the associates who actually work."
good,anything you think would be the right way to do something Walmart does the opposite. You can get a lot from Walmart but they're more worried about getting everything out of the back and making the back look pretty instead of making your store look pretty
good,"It’s easy but also difficult to get on at Walmart. Depending on which Walmart you work at you could have a worse or better experience. But working for Walmart over all isn’t that great unless you’re trying to make a career out of it. "
good,"Where do I even start!?! First off the customers ( some,not all) are super rude. The most impatient people EVER. At least 4/5 of those old people complain about the line size and wait. ""there are no cashier's"" they whine BUT who can blame anyone for NOT wanting to be a cashier when you have to listen to people whine and cry at you all day. Seriously not worth the time or money. I took a lower paying job"
good,when started was a great place to work after a couple months they started cutting hours and keep cutting hours .able to learn new things and areas . started off with remodel and now work half or more of store and still not able to move up .
good,"Wal-Mart is one of the largest companies in the world. There are a lot of things that fall into the cracks."
good,"This is a very well paying job, and of you can put up with the added stresses holiday time demands you very well could move up and build a career here. Just try to make sure you don't end up on the CAP team as they are the worst treated"
good,People come and go. Some Management is ok to work with. Typical work day is 6 -8 hours in the Auto shop. Hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers that did not like their tires and wanted refunds.
good,Walmart is a decent place to work. It is hard to move to other departments after being hired. Most of the time you have to “find your replacement” before being able to move to another department.
good,"never felt liken i was important really, the other associates were great and supervisor were great, assistants managers  half and half  for great and just bad. Now i was there long enough to go through a lot of them."
good,"le travail était assez dur physiquement, mais l’esprit d'équipe aide beaucoup."
good,Don't have a sense of purpose or fitting in with the people in my department.  Manager is never available. Constant mistakes and changes to schedule on pretty much a weekly basis.
good,"It is hard to advance to different departments/management positions.  Management can be hard to deal with but some are really great and fair. Like any workplace, you have good and bad."
good,Poor communication from the top down as well as tons of favoritism In The facility. Lack of Communication on expectations. As well as different accountability across shifts.
good,"As a CAP 2 associate, we unload 2-4 trucks in a backroom without temperature regulation, palletize all general merchandise and grocery, stock consumables (i.e. grocery, pet food, etc.) during the afternoon, and then tidy up the shelves at the end of the day. There are other minor job duties. It's hard work--which I don't mind, but management doesn't recognize how tiring it is and often expect more from us than I consider reasonable. If you have a thick skin it can be alright, but everyone on the crew can get pretty burned out."
good,I enjoyed working for the deli and with my customers. They were always satisfied with the fast pace I kept. I was always one to put a smile on their faces and keep the line moving forward. My hot foods were always fresh and dated and that made for less waste at the end of the day.
good,It’s a job! It can get crazy but so can any retail job. The pay isn’t bad for what you’re asked to do but the way customers treat you sometimes isn’t worth the pay. other than that it wasn’t bad
good,"The Walmart i worked at had problems "
good,"Management seems mostly naïve"
good,Building is in disarray. Extremely high turnover and poor senior management. Training is below standards. Cleanliness and housekeeping are poor. Something needs to change.
good,I enjoyed working here I was able to talk to people I rang up customers with their food items and bagged them. I also helpped bring in the shopping baskets from the parking lot
good,It was an experience. Hard work at times. Busy most of the time. Most employee's are very friendly and helpful. Customers are often rude but it's not bad
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ringing customers through in a timely but friendly matter, keeping your area tidy to minimize the risk of injury for customers and associates. I learned customer service skills and time efficiency. The hardest part of the job was asking about the Walmart Mastercard and trying to promote it to the customers when you yourself didn't feel comfortable having the card. I enjoyed interacting with the customers, you learned who you could joke around with and who wanted to get in and get out as fast as they could."
good,It was the same thing day after day the bosses were terrible and they never worked on scheduling with me.and the co workers weren't good they would always put me down
good,"Empresa razoável, tinha um ambiente relativamente tranquilo de se trabalhar."
good,"There were people who made working bearable, but the auto care center at my store was a mess and they denied all three of my transfer requests. I eventually quit because I couldn’t handle the work environment."
good,The coworkers are pretty cool but my managers weren’t the type to listen so when stuff would go wrong in my work field I felt like I had no one to talk to .
good,I have been there for 9 years going on 10! I have learned many things working for Walmart! I can drive many different kinds of power equipment! I need more hours
good,Job not organized. Don't approve sick days. Turn over rate horrible. Benefits  great. A lot of test on the computer. Not enough hands on training. Rules change to much
good,usually worked for 8 hours a day putting stuff on shelves. i learned a little bit. Some of the management was a little overbearing. the start of the day was a little hard.
good,"The people make the store in every location. I have worked with people who i will respect for the rest of my life. The upper management can be overly tough, but they just do the job thats handed down to them. They make mistakes but usually fix them given time."
good,Il faut savoir être rapide et travailler sous pression car dans cette compagnie les moments stressants sont très présents.
good,my overall experience at Walmart was enjoyable for the most part. great people to work with and some not so great. worked hard and had some laughs. management seemed to know what they where doing but some of the supervisors under management dont seem to have it all together
good,Want work to get done no matter what obstacles are in your way with minimal help from upper management. Switched to a new position after a year and a half and got fired after three months of not being able to keep up with production.
good,I believe that Walmart could be a whole lot better with who they choose to be management. The employees are treated poorly even though they are always under staffed but won't hire anyone.
good,"The place was decent to work at for the pay. I made $11 an hour. The manager wasn't interested in teaching their employee. If you get lucky and find someone to help you then that's great, but most people there won't help you."
good,I worked for the company for 12 yrs. & saw a lot of changes.  Worked with a lot of great people as well & some great manager.  Corruption with upper management & its unfortunate that corporate ALLOWED them to continue to work for the company despite their disrespect & attitude.  The company itself is not healthy either & laid off tons of workers recently  with no warning.
good,It’s a decent job if your fresh out of high school and don’t want to join the army or go to college. I really enjoyed my time with Walmart despite the fast past environment
good,"For entry level Walmart pays better than most. Base pay is $11/hour in nonurban locales. More important areas such as sporting goods, electronics, the fresh grocery departments, bakery and deli, and OGP have higher pay starting at $11.50/hour. Job candidates with management and/or retail experience may be offered more."
good,Overall the job is a good one.  Management needs to work on their people skills; talking down to associates is not conducive to positive productivity.
good,The great thing about stocking was getting to see all the new products that came out every day. I also liked the discounts that they offered on all products.
good,It's a mess full of vile people everyday wanting to move up and crush his competitor down. It's only with your power can bring it out. Once you've past all you see some good people that are just trying to live and be them self.
good,Company doesn't give enough PTO out now and they can overwork you. The workplace culture is usually good but that depends on the management team and everything else.
good,Very quick-paced and managers didn’t really understand their employees. Could be a really awesome place to work at if their employees and staff weren’t so rude
good,I clocked in and got straight to work putting new items into the shelf to helping customers find what they were looking for  to going up front to help
good,"Worked here for 13 years,  I feel trapped that is why I stay.  The only thing consistent is the inconsistency.  They are constantly restructuring,   so I feel that you never know if your job is being eliminated.  They are not good with training.   They built training center for management,   regular employees are not trained,   they are shown videos and then sent to the floor"
good,I like working there just alot of racism for the csm most of the people that work there are nice and i got along with them pretty good ...............
good,i worked with individuals that had put up with management repeatedly. Management was quite undesirable and very off track with no actual coordination and team effort just inconvenient Quotas that where conceivable.
good,"Customers and other associates aren't the actual problems, management is. There is too much favoritism, and many managers like it belittle their people and make us feel like we aren't needed. Unless you kiss up, it doesn't matter how good you are, they will treat the ones who don't deserve it so much better. "
good,"Walmart is very fast-paced and busy which makes the job experience very stressful. Management can vary but for the most part, it isn't the best. The atmosphere is very depressing. Would not recommend but for part-time it's okay for a while."
good,"Wal-Mart pays a great starting rate, however friendships will cause gaps in pay between yourself and coworkers.  management does not help with serious problems, also they will protect friends in the company and make sure they promote regardless of their qualification."
good,"I had a trainer who ""trained"" me on how to stock. Afterwards I was left to do it by myself. They would expect you to go as fast as them when it's ONLY your 3rd/4th day. Lack of communication by the other coworkers, coworkers would blame the newer employees for stuff they didn't do.  In short: Lack of communication,  bad team members,  poor training, and poor work environment.  Management seems cool though"
good,Management in this particular store are unsympathetic and ungrateful. They will work you to the bones with not even so much as a thank you. Not a very good company to work for.
good,"Very stressful environment, and no help from higher management. Job constantly adds new rules, or more responsibilities with no increase of pay, or respect."
good,"At the location I worked at, I was terminated even though I was on Leave of Abscence and had several days approved, while there were several other associates that missed a lot of time but they weren't terminated. Some of the managers were great while others weren't. The salaried managers would get overly stressed and it showed to all employees.good, but the amount of work expected to be done in a sho"
good,"I enjoyed working with some of the associates there and I met some interesting characters as customers. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Walmart however, I doubt I will return with my employment."
good,"can educate ourself about Retail Sections, Merchandise."
good,Can’t move up in the company management can’t talk too no open door policy not paid enough for the work u do rude customers friendly staff not enough hours
good,"Walmart elminated to many key positions . Which hurt long term employees. "
good,"It's difficult to say what a typical day work at a Walmart Store looks like during the holidays.  The work is fulfilling and associates are friendly.  This is a great place to start to develop a customer service skill."
good,A very good paying job with good benefits have to be well versed in equipment training and safety to be able to do the job the right way and to keep it
good,"their management could care less of your needs "
good,If you don't mind working hard and long hours with okay insurance and sometimes not full time hours Walmart might be the place to work for you. Some managers treat you respectfully and then there are quite a bit who never tend to care about their associates other than the bottom line number daily.
good,"Not the best job but a job.the pay is decent for what your doing. But as a maintenance associate they had me doing every job in the store which is fine but I wasnt getting paid for my cross training. Cross training increases pay, they aren't doing that for me. I work as a stocker, support manager, cashier, and maintenance. And only get maintenance pay."
good,Walmart was a great place to work when I first started very family oriented. Then after many years things changed drastically. Management was terrible communicating with their associates.
good,Not is a bad work compared with others but is not to stay there because you can find something better and management is horrible. They never ever take care of employees or help they don’t care.
good,Attitude among Managers is poor they don’t care but expect you to care. They refuse help you advance and the scheduler refuses to listen and give you needed time off.
good,This is the best place to find a job that would give me the best way to provide for my family getting me into something I've never had interest in so I'm all for it.
good,There was constant pressure to pick up the slack of other associate on those who were dedicated and enthusiastic while not on others. Kills motivation
good,Corporate office dictates store policies. The people at the top do not understand what happens on a day to day basis. Unrealistic goals are set for employees.
good,My experience at Walmart was generally good but I started a long time ago and was able to work up to these things .  It’s quite a bit harder for newer associates as a lot of the programs that helped me are no longer available .   Overall I think hard workers are treated fairly and can move up quickly .
good,"A typical day. "
good,It was a good place to work at I still work their I woulding recommand nobody to work their they don't care about you at all they want you to be pt...
good,"I actually loved my job there. I also have a very positive outlook and love working in retail. I was a favorite and part of upper hourly management which made my experience different than your typical hourly associate. I am also very good at helping irritate customers. My ratings are based on what I saw happeneing to other associates and how they were be tested by biased salaried management. Salaried management plays favorites (this is a common complaint I hear at many stores). Two associates of equal skills and drive can be treated completely opposite. I have even seen highly skilled and amazing associates fired or treated bad if a manager’s favorite dislikes or feels threatened by that fantastic associate...even though they were equals and there shouldn’t have been any fear or threat felt. If you are bubbly and optimistic or just good at playing the game you will do fine and might even thrive at Walmart. "
good,"The Walmart I worked at was in my small town of Mountain View Arkansas! I got hurt on the job and they tried to talk me out of going into the hospital, they admitted they new that where I hit my head at was already a problem and it wasn’t prevented  they gave me an extremely hard time at work for my injury"
good,Not enough pay. Horrible people to work with. I prefer warehouse over a grocery store. The job was Easy. But wasn't the job for me. It was a seasonal gig for me
good,They are going back to the old concrete floors and changing everything around half the managers left so the newly promoted are on power trips but its really not all that bad
good,Its a lot better then some places. The management are rude and bias towards a lot of the younger workers. But if you do your job correctly then you will be ok.
good,Management uses policy and procedures against employees to meet their needs  Only use policy and procedures when they want to.  Trying to be PC correct.
good,"Good work enivorment, friendly coworkers. Its really hard not to get wrapped up in the drama."
good,A fast-paced job with insufficient workers for the number of work orders. There was a high turnover of workers and management during my time of employment.
good,"Working at Walmart is an easy and simple job as long as you do what is expected for you. Some locations are better than others but they pay pretty decently and more actually than other department stores such as target. Do your job and show up for shifts on time, and they will treat you well."
good,"Walmart's management team can vary from very poor to extremely hard working and fair. There are situations in which management does exactly what is needed for their employees, yet other times in which situations are never taken care of, or employees feel tossed to the side. There is a lack of teamwork between many upper managements, and it feels that because of this lack you will have certain managers giving the green light for their workers, but another manager refuses and you will get in trouble. Scheduling is a mess, and word of mouth is never trusted. The way things are done changes every season, and drama in the work place feels very common. I enjoyed my job, but I felt desperate to keep it. The work place felt unpredictable, but it paid decently for the work you did."
good,"I loved working as a CSM. Loved helping customers and helping cashiers with whatever they needed. But management  is what drove me away. They don’t care about you. I was told I was the best csm there, but got in trouble for complaining to management about another csm not doing there job. And it never got better."
good,"I worked there for almost 2 yrs. If you can keep focused and on task you will be fine. People skills are a plus. Always greet everyone you see, no matter what."
good,"Its not an amazing job, but it was a job with its individual ups and downs. It is a very transiant workplace and management tended to make sure this was known. They are fast to give negative feedback and really really slow to give any positive feedback."
good,"multiple supervisors who give contradicting direction, and will berate you for accomplishing tasks given to you if they come from of the other supervisors. great co-workers though, and definitely formed a work family of sorts."
good,"Enjoyed my time working there until the last couple of years. Prior to that it was an enjoyable work experience. After new Management took over, the work environment became very antagonistic and uncomfortable."
good,"poor management"
good,"Era bom trabalhar lá,  mas a liderança deixava e desejar"
good,"Walmart was not a tolerant environment unless you knew the right people."
good,"I was on pins and needles from the time I got to work till I left, waiting for my boss to fuss at me about something."
good,"If you clock in, do your job, and clock out, then this is a job for you. If you think working hard and showing management that you care is going to advance you, you're wrong. All it does is have more work assigned to you for the same pay rate. There really is no such thing as career advancement."
good,I loved working at Walmart. I have met so many people and have made so many friends. I think that Walmart as a whole can do better for the people that have families and children.
good,The pay for a lube shop isnt bad. But they dont hire alot of smart people for their lube techs. The management can be a lil rude. All in all not a super bad place to work.
good,"Walmart was not flexible with my schedule, and did not understand that people had lives. They were rude,  did things wrong, and were very unorganized."
good,Needed a better job than Walmart. Didnt like the employee. And poor management. Environment packed as well. Need a netter opportunity in life to support family.
good,"Many work two Jobs just to be at walmart. In other words, they dont make enough at walmart to live near the walmart they work in."
good,"Working there was a different working experience,learned how to deal with public and to help them find what they were looking for, lead them in right directions for items they wanted."
good,just a temp job. i couldnt see myself working at this job as a career. theres no clear communication between managers and associates when makes the job u do more difficult than it needs to be
good,"This is a job for someone going to school. You just can't provide for a family working here. Management is poor, no communication what so ever.   The people have to be young to advance in this company."
good,Walmart has good benefits but management wants you to handle all their issues they never come and then writes you up for unjust reasons would not recommend unless you go for stocking or cart pusher don’t waste your time working for the white man
good,I do love my job because of the patients  but there is too much favoritism and managers change too much. Ethics committee doesn't return calls or emails.
good,"The job itself is very demanding especially with managers that don't listen to experience and degrade you for not making ridiculous expectations. That being said, the people I worked with made 7 years there possible. If you can tone out corporate overtones its not a terrible place to work."
good,"It was alright for my first job, I was excited to start working then that slowly faded the more the management team showed their a****. I was blocked from being moved up in the ladder so I don't know if it was just my experience or that location. I might and a strong might think about working there again but in a different location where no one knows me cause, ita about a new start."
good,en esta empresa no tienes vida propia te pasa algo alfrente y ya lo sabe la tienda entera
good,"*Some* of my coworkers were the best people I’ve ever met. Especially the night crew. However, the pay is offensive, the management is a bunch of cowards, and the company itself is awful. They don’t have any respect for employees whatsoever. Such a disappoint since when I was hired I was genuinely excited and moved by the story of the founder. What a shame."
good,Not a great place to work if you want to be treated fairly. A lot of mistreatment and biased treatment based on what position or department you work in. Management and and personnel don’t help if people have any payroll issues or investigate if people are harassed or mistreated.
good,To many bosses no one knew what was going on to confusing employee not really happy. No respect for managment among managment. Just hiring young people that can't even buy  cigarettes so the older employees have to  twice as hard. I did enjoyed my coworkers
good,Its overall not the best place to work its just convenient for the time being management have poor communication skills your always told to do better but no one acknowledges when you go out your way to help it a slave working job just for a check
good,In my opinion management should have took more accountablity for not planning for success and the treatment of associates was poor. You lead by teaching and setting a example. I'm not sure if it was the location or the culture of the business.
good,"The job can be simple if the managers make it simple, but it usually tends to be more than your job description and very fast paced. The managers are not very good at any location in San Antonio I have known."
good,"na don't have anything to say at this time. I worked my days and went home , i had an ok time working with the company for all that is worth. teachable experience for later."
good,"I honestly don't know if I would work for them again but u never know, maybe with different management and people who actually care about their employees"
good,I was a cashier and self check out at Walmart. It’s stressful because they expect you to watch 16 self check registers by yourself when it’s low staffed and on top of that keep everything stocked and cleaned. They also pressure you into applying for a WalMart credit card for their scores. Discount isn’t even on groceries. Management was horrible and not flexible at all. If you don’t want to work late night you’re probably not going to get hours b
good,Walmart has shifted around their positions for management so much that people are afraid that they may lose their jobs. Positions have been eliminated therefore leaving the person to wonder what will happen to them.
good,The managers and the way things are run isnt very efficient and the way the supervisors treat their team members is terrible and I do not agree with how they run things.
good,"Wal-Mart as a company is an amazing place to work however the stores in the Little Rock, Conway , Sherwood, NLR, Jacksonville, Benton, Bryant , &  Maumelle areas have poor management. The buddy system seems about the only way you’ll get promoted. The schedules are inconsistent hard workers get taken advantage of and over looked all the time. If you can find good management you’ll be fine, good luck on that though."
good,"Started out as a great job as a overnight stocker. As time went on, Walmart decided to eliminate overnights at the store I worked for to save on costs. This resulted in a large reduction in staff causing many employees to lose their jobs. I stayed for another year, during which the corporation increased their downsizing efforts resulting in several management positions being eliminated making advancement in the corporation extremely difficult."
good,"Very challenging work.  Hard work was not reflected in pay.  The work load increased, and there was no pay increase to compensate for that.  The scheduling has also been in-consistent: changing work hours and changing off days."
good,This company needed alot more training or experienced advanced management staff. Not enough proper communication and terrible team work. If more assistants would have worked together and the store manager worked harder the store would have been alot better.
good,I would have to say working at Walmart on a daily. Walmart world could be really a fast paced job at times. Walmart also have many things you have to learn in a quickly manner in order to survive. Fast quick friendly is Walmart number one rule.
good,You feel like you are very replaceable. They will work you to your breaking point. You will work all Holidays and be required to work weekends. Think before making your decision.
good,I genuinely learned quite a bit at this job. But unfortunately it was not up to the management level I expected. Removing that from the equation it was a good job with out many unexpected bumps in the daily routine.
good,le problème c'est les haut placer qui n'encourage pas les bon travailleur.. et ceux qui travaille médiocrement ne sont pas du tout réprimander donc cela fait juste en sorte d'avoir des conflit entre chaque département
good,The job is decent for what it is. Being that they hire in at 11 and hour now its is a great job for people in a bind to get them through. But from my experience it is not a place to build a career.
good,"The management is very poor. There are a few good ones, but they mostly walk around and do not help problem solve or help meet goals. The benefits were good."
good,"Management was okay, some management were uncooperative and gave to many shifts at once, uses student to advantage. Great associate team and fun workers."
good,"Interview was quite easy, questions were simple common sense. The interviewer was my future supervisor/manager. She showed me around the store and told me what i’d be doing."
good,"I liked my job, but the management is lacking. They barely ever tell you that you are doing well, they only really talk to you if you messed something up. The people I worked with were pretty cool."
good,Walmart is an okay company to work for the pay is not that good and it depends on where you work in the store but generally it's a good place to work.
good,"Any workers under management level are trained by computer programs on how to do their jobs. Management levels are now sent to training academies to be trained on certain aspects of their jobs which is better than the old computer program course they used to be required to do. When I worked in the academy most days were preparing classrooms for incoming trainees, then doing a mix of in class training and hands on training on the store floor.  Days I didn't have class I was to do audits or help out in the respective departments I trained managers in.  When I was put in Support manager position I was given the back room.  I took the position when I was told I was too young and needed more experience before applying for an Assistant manager position (even though I had 4 years of experience as an Assistant manger from other companies). I was under the impression I would be working with the other associates to gain the experience needed however, found out I was to be the only one in the backroom cleaning it up by putting up overstock and getting rid of trash and empty pallets. After 7 months in this position, I asked about the Assistant Manager training program again and I was told I needed to hold my current position for 5 years before they would let me apply. I left the company after this."
good,"This was one of my first jobs. They are an okay company to work for, but they do require a lot out of their employees. There isn't much room for advancement and the pay is less than adequate, in my opinion."
good,It was really good and was very happy at first but then got injured and asked to be moved to another job area and they refused. Had to go through a outside company for my injury to keep my job but that company wanted medical forms which I couldn't get filled out due to me not having insurance at the time and had to go to er. End result I was dismissed due to absents if having a doctor's excuse
good,"I worked everyday in keeping the store neat and organized. Customers are said to be the priority. And stocking was a consistent need, regardless of the position you held."
good,"I mostly did not enjoy the coworkers placed with me, they formed a very toxic work environment. I had a great supervisor and a good manager, but was often left disappointed by my peers. The pay was better then most jobs I’ve held at that point in my life."
good,Ok place to work everyone has to have a job somewhere. Great for someone just starting out or that does not need the income as their main source.Great as a second job.
good,Mañagers didn't seem to care much about cashiers. Didn't understand when family things came up. I hated the attendance policy. It was really hard to get time off if needed
good,I cap merchandise from backroom and bring it into the front and stock it.The work is easy and the days go by pretty fast. The management lets you be as long as your doing your job.
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work, as far as non-professional jobs go.  There were a lot of times where we would receive multiple sets of instruction--from hr/store management, or from health and wellness (corporate pharmacy management), and they would be in conflict.  The store management and hr were very slow to address matters.  "
good,"I worked at two separate Walmart locations, in Florida and Ohio. They both had the same problems of favoritism and managers that overstepped their roles. In Ohio, I was hired as a cart pusher, called an associate,which was managed by the front end department. As I took one of my breaks I checked my blood sugar, it was 63, I was feeling a little low. I went to the vending machine to get some peanut M&Ms and I was followed by the grocery manager as I sat down on the ground he came up to me, asked what I was doing, told him I was taking break and he told me to get up and go back to work. I went in to tell the front end manager but couldn't find her so I left and never heard from them."
good,It wasn't a bad job it's just management had favorites and anytime there was an advancement opportunity it would go to the person that was favored the most
good,"The management was good when I first started working there.  The current management not so good. I was out on a medical leave. when I returned from my medical leave I found out I no longer had a position, since they gave my job to somebody else.  This was a violation of federal law.  Then my manager the lied to the Virginia employment commission.  My manager told them that I quit my job."
good,When I started Walmart it was a great place to work. Now you are treated like a number and not a person kind of like they don't care every one is replaceable no matter how long you worked for the company. It seems like they do not want long term associates or full time employees.
good,"Everyone who works there is depressed and hates their lives. Their management was very poor. The whole time i worked there, 3months, my manager never completed my training and he always took out his emotions on our team members whenever he would get upset on the job. Very unprofessional."
good,Employees were constantly complaining of upper management skills.  First line supervisors did not have good communication skills with subordinate staff. Managers would not take the time to introduce themselves to subordinate staff.
good,Over the past 4 years I have given up alot of my family life after requesting earlier shifts but according to management I was the only one with open availability and if I closed it I wouldn't get any hours.
good,The management is terrible and gets to pick who advances in their little groups. Don’t try to work hard it won’t get you anywhere. Company is great though.
good,"If you work at Walmart W. Clara Lane in Muncie, it is a good paying job for a college starting out, but not a lot of hours. Just show up and do your job and get paid, and don't call off alot, there is a lot of favoritism there, but it is a good temporary job,"
good,"Empresa oferece um local de trabalho bastante estressante para desenvolver suas atividades. O esgotamento físico e psicológico´é notável em todos os funcionários, independente de nível e turno de serviço.  A parte mais agradável são as pessoas e a parte mais difícil é a falta de reconhecimento, com oferta de plano de carreira."
good,Its an ok company to work for the managers dont really have your back they just try to push the blame to the lowest level so there safe. But it did teach me how manage and run a successful area because i knew how to prioritize the work load so that the customers shopping experience wasn't affected
good,It was a great working environment. They do not provide enough working hours to support a family. Was not at all interested in working with you to get more hours.
good,"A typical day at work mean clocking it at a very specific time 9 minutes early you get a point 9 minutes late you get a point. Its almost like a high school if you're popular and people like you its not too bad, if you're not well... it kinda sucks."
good,"The cared more about the store then they did the employees and how we felt, nothing was ever right to them, and it was the there way or no way. Not a great place to work, they want you to be Walmart Walmart Walmart even when you have other responsibilities."
good,"They gave me a job when I needed one.  I enjoyed the work and took pride in what I did.  However, don't like Walmart as a company, and there was not incentive for the management to help workers improve.  Management was always on the side of corporate and not for the workers.  Many times I witnessed a coworker with sub-par performance, but management would let it go and lean on the better workers to get the job done.  Then when it was time for the annual review they would give most of the workers the same level of review regardless of performance."
good,"not very family friendly. Have to work weekend, 12 hours shifts, and holidays. it's a 24 hour retail store. you have to do shift work as a member of management. Associates have better schedules."
good,Stressful not family friendly makes depression worse they have favoritism they’ll pick and choose who gets in trouble for the same exact things won’t take drs notes
good,"I worked at Walmart for almost two years.  I was promoted 4 times and worked all sections of the store at all times of the week.  My final position was the Overnight Front End Manager.  The entry level positions were easy to acquire and perform with above average pay.  It was great if you're just starting out.  If you're looking to live you'll quickly need to advance.  People are constantly being hired and quitting so positions open up often. Which sounds great but also warrants concerns. As the manager it was my duty to oversee the overnight crew, solve customer issues, handle the finances, and restore the store to pristine condition each night.  The work load was extraordinarily stressful due to the lack of proper procedures, sheer size of the building, and staffing. While the pay was above average by comparison of other similar positions, the pay was not enough to afford basic living by yourself.  I ended up having to get a second job and was working 16-22 hours a day, 6-7 days a week to make my bills."
good,During my time at walmart I came in contact with wonderful management-- and some real idiots who should not have been in their positions. The one I worked at catered to lazy employees who did minimum work yet stayed 'working'. Was glad to move on! Hopefully pitiful management is not the norm!
good,"The team for Wal-Mart was not there and need more associates. Not enough for customer service "
good,Walmart is an ok place to work to get you to your next step but if you want to move to management can work your way up. Trying to balance life with this job is kind of hard to work with
good,"Some days it’s an okay place to work, other days it’s a terrible place to work. Pay is alright for the work, and benefits are fine but getting full time hours is tough. Schedules are inconsistent, and poorly done leaving associates by themselves or having to cover multiple departments that no one was scheduled. Throwing associates in places they are not trained for and destined to fail. You get used to it but it’s not something you want to get used to. Other aspects depends on who your direct supervisor is."
good,Walmart is a great store but the management is horrible. They don't work with flexible hours. Customers are never satisfied. The employers don't get enough recognition.
good,Manger would pick & choose. Have problems with little things was doin like I wasn’t doin my work or I wasn’t working hard. I really dislike the manger made me not wanna work there anymore
good,"10 years with company and make less hourly than new hire.Have worked many areas excellent evaluation, unable to get job advancement. Even though they say you can. Doesn't happen for me."
good,"Good for your first job, specially if you are a teenager with little to none financial responsibilities."
good,Don't believe everything they tell you or promise  you. No job security these days! For a while  with company i enjoyed  my work and it was challenging at times. At beginning they had great management team  who were willing work with you.In the last few years while working for the company i found it to be the hardest people to work for.
good,"I did not enjoy working for Wal-Mart, the management doesn't care about employees, we were frequently forced to take our first break late so we could finish unloading a truck."
good,"I would normally work 4am shifts so right off the bat that would be the hardest part about the job. I would come in and organize the back room and get everything ready for the produce truck delivery. After that I would break the truck down and put everything on carts so other produce associates can start working product. Management was probably the worst I've seen in any place I have worked. No communication at all between assistant store managers and store manger. You would have to tell multiple managers just to be heard if you had to get a day off or anything else. Workplace culture was like any other retail place. You would have multiple cliques and if you didn't fit the bill, you were cast aside and would have to deal with banter."
good,"i enjoyed working self checkout, customers where fairly nice, not all, did not like working as a greeter, or checking customers receipts, they always made me feel like i was accusing them of stealing.."
good,Great opportunity for someone who is looking to get experience in the field.  Walmart logistics is a tough but rewarding experience. Work schedules can change within a weeks notice or area you will now manage with minimal training. Great job for someone without a family or personal obligations.
good,"Overall the co-workers we're great and supportive.  Unfortunately , there was a lot of favoritism and unprofessionalism from management.  The pay could have been better.  We worked one Sat. a month , and had a day off during the week."
good,"All cap 2 employees need more pay and recognition. The work load is tuff but not impossible if you know your department, it just takes time, however the expectations from the supervisors can be over zealous with time contraints."
good,They expected too much for the amount of money that they paid. Never had enough people scheduled to work there. They aren’t considerate of family issues or emergency’s that may arise.
good,"I've spent the last 9 years at Walmart, and it been adventure. While it definitely still a good company to work for as either a stepping stone or a career. The high pace nature of the job might be too much for some, but the pay and the benefits are better then most in the retail market."
good,I didnt really like it there. I felt it wasnt for me. It was drama filled. Wasnt very professional. Not much structure and i felt i needed a job more for me where id be happy to actually work.
good,"Not a place to work when there is a huge culture barrier. Some managers leave you to do your job, others walk around rushing you to finish so they can send you to help someone else. Do your job then go help someone do their job."
good,"I enjoyed the physical demand of unloading the truck."
good,"Not exciting, limited learning, managers are petty, people have clicks as if they were in middle school. Poor management structure, employee do not get along!"
good,I like working for Walmart. It's has its advantages if you want to move up in the company. There is teamwork among the associates not so much with management.
good,Favoritism is kinda bad at this particular walmart. You're gonna have to be friends with some higher ups to land a better opening. Not really fair but there is only so much you can do.
good,"Management should be making people aware of their specific job functions during the interview process....not leaving things out or ""sugar coating"" what you will encounter on the job. I've been verbally abused by customers on almost a daily basis, almost physically assaulted and had I known I wouldn't have made the change to this position."
good,Stress not well handled by management. No sense of urgency when key departments need help. Total unprofessionalism given by upper management when conducting a conversation.
good,People try to get into your personal life and if they don’t like you they try to fire you  they don’t have free lunches you have to bring your own or buy it
good,Ridged timeline even with low number of workers mad if overtime mad if job not done. Customers are mostly great you can’t make sure that the customer is totally satisfied because you have no time. I was happy at first but I wasn’t trained so I got demoted because I was not good enough. Very  frustrating
good,"Walmart isn’t that bad. I got 40 hours consistently for awhile but after a mixup with my social security number, my hours slowed down and eventually I didn’t have any."
good,Department manager very loud and rude even to her customers. When employees speak to upper management they state nothing can be done because of racial issues. What a joke!!
good,I  stared off good and then I was working hard and being my self . poor management they weren't being kind they cut all my hours and left me with 4 hours and 2 days
good,Loved the people I worked with but bad management. Management wasn't always clear on subjects and fired me because I was sick with the flu and missed work.
good,Current Great Work Place transition is making it impossible for DMs to do their jobs. It was good before all this started but I would wait until they figure out what they are doing to apply.
good,"Walmart's standards have gone out the window. No job should be like a slave ship. Yes,we have a commitment to the company but it should work both ways. Employees give more back when they are treated decent and fair."
good,Walmart is just a start off job I love every one I work with and enjoy it my job is pretty self explanatory . Every month we have inventory for our department
good,"It’s a job that you can barely pass on to pay your bills, can be exciting at times "
good,"It's a good place to work, however you can't balance life and work when you're working there. The management is terrible. I've been working hard and for some reasons, I can't move one."
good,"I'm my opinion, working at Walmart gives you a lot more experience with customers and the different types. Which is fine considering everyone is different. Management wise, they suck, everyone wants to be a leader and still following because they know nothing. Everyone should be on the same accord, not telling the associates many different things."
good,it is a great place to work although we you have your moments they are pretty proactive in tough circumstances Would definitely recommend people to work there. i'm just looking for an opportunity to use all my skills that have gained from my experience working there and be able to use them to gain more experience.
good,The work is easy but the managers are incompetent and are almost too unbearable to work for many do not know what they are doing and are only support managers because they are in favor with their supervisors.
good,Walmart On Wilkinson blvd speaks for itself go inside take a look around and you will be able to determine for yourself the job is very easy but management and long time employees have a relationship that butts everyone out if your not in their group that was a no for me to continue
good,"Working at Walmart was a decent beginner job. The starting pay is great but, the management could use a little bit of work. They need to distribute the amount work evenly rather than just pushing it all on a select few."
good,I really enjoyed my job and they had great benefits especially for part-time associates. But the store is short staffed and at the same time hours cut. Management is ever changing and there is a lot of overturn due to this. There is a lot of conflicts among management and  staff are stress due to the continuing changes taking place.
good,It’s a great place to start your training on costumer services learning more about how to tend to consumers needs and being able to think quick on your feet .
good,"The company gets a bad reputation, but honestly as far as discounts for the associates it was one of the best. You've got your good management, the good stores, and then there's the bad ones. I just so happened to be in the later. I'd recommend it to those entering retail, as it's one of the better ones to apply and work for."
good,"It’s not to shame the management but they are by far the most unorganized group. Trust me when the higher ups and HR is not for the associates, they will favor managers and openly disrespect you in front of people.  The management team are really inexperienced and have no knowledge how to run imports. HR team is just useless and will blow you off ."
good,"Considering it is a retail environment, I couldn't ask for more,  my experience was great, I felt respected as a veteran, as a person."
good,"I worked as a cashier, n there it's very fast paced. It was a good job but management on 3rd wasn't the best. I don't see myself going back there to work again."
good,"no promotions is you Spanish,9years with company nothing the a new one then I get a promotion,poor management, to much heist be twin managers to associate,"
good,"They offer little pay incentive, poor benefits and long hours.  While I was proud of of the store I worked at and got along great with the team, the corporate aspect of it was disappointing and left people with low moral."
good,"Walmart in itself is a great place to work have had some great jobs in walmart, it was easy to move from cashier up to working on the floor. Some of the co-workers are amazing and will be lifelong friends, and some are complete jerks that only want to see the people around them fail. In my year at walmart i have moved from cashier to online pick-up to jewlery, and i have never met so many people that are willing to drag your name through the mud to advance their own image. I had a manger that said to other employees that she actively trying to get me in trouble and get me fired or make me quit. I recommend walmart to people who have thick skin or is willing to take abuse, but if you get frustrated when people spend all day just trying to ruin your life i dont recommend it."
good,Walmart is a horrible place to work  if you want to be full time  you never get 40 hours there on top of that  management sucked and only care about money and themselfs
good,No advancement. So much nepotism in the workplace. Always over worked and under staffed. Don't pay what we should be getting paid. Management would bend the rules for who they wanted.
good,"Management could be difficult to work with, most of the co workers on my level were great to work with.  There was a lot of construction in the store which made jobs more difficult"
good,You don't get paid for what your experience is it is how long you have been with the company. They give very low raises and low bonuses. There is more bosses then there are associates. They expect you to do the job of more then one person at the same time.
good,Wal-Mart is a very diverse and fast pace company to work for. There is never a dull moment and always something to do. I have had good and bad experience with management.
good,they like to work you a lot regardless of how you feel. the do not accept doctor notes unless you are admitted to the hospital. And they have a limited call off policy
good,"The only thing that mattered to them was production. If you had a terrible trailer it didn't matter to them. They don't listen to there own employees. They let the lazy employees slide by and let the hardworking employees go. Break starts as soon as you leave your work station, so you should subtract 4-6 minutes from every break."
good,En los Estados Unidos estuve en la empresa walmart en la cual  aprendí en cantidad tanto como en el supermercado amigo que son de la misma compañía. actualmente sigo en walmart y a diferencia de allá afuera aquí hay que ser un lambon para poder crecer o obtener un buen puesto. Quieren implementar ser como Walmart allá afuera pero realmente no trabajan con la calidad que amerita
good,When I worked for Walmart they didn't care weather you were sick or even if you got in a wreck. You had better be at work or you were fired on the spot. All in all a very stressful biased job that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy
good,"Every level of management is trained to not take the employee side from your csm up during any customer conflict/ argument or allegation, you will have to cultivate political friendships to maintain your job, have tardy's and absences cleared and avoid write ups . you operate under the umbrella of the Walmart corporation but each store will work like a small business. Your experience will be determined by your relationship with your peers."
good,The company has a system where new managers who come in from outside are always looking over their shoulders and not trusting anyone. They rather intimidate people to quit so they can bring in their own
good,"Walmart is a good starter job, but is not really a good forever job. The management is hit and miss ,and the pay is not great. Plus the benefits of working there for long periods isn't worth it. They don't reward full time any different then part time really. Also, coming in with experience isn't rewarded either."
good,Forgotten people are the reason Walmart is successful seems that loyalty is not appreciated as long term associates seem to be loosing jobs do to restructure. Yes things need to change with progress but doesn’t mean you have to be replaced.
good,"Enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part. Enjoyed the other employees I worked with. Learned the difference in Identifications and drivers Licenses (which were fake and which were real).  Management wasn't very knowledgeable or helpful at most times. Walmart is not very employee friendly at times, however they never discriminated again the disabled and that was very nice to see. Hardest part was when customers wanted to speak with the manager and he ignored them and left the employees to handle all situations the best they could. The best part of working for the company was the different people that you got to interact with."
good,This job was very labor intensive. Management puts a lot of pressure on you to finish tasks even when short handed. Managers are disrespectful. There is a lot of turnover.
good,"They Try, it gets very difficult in the management. It's very stressful when everyone instant on the same page. I really don't have much to say, I wouldn't recommend or favorite this job honestly."
good,"The Job itself was very simple. I came in every morning, scan the bins, take whatever beeps onto the sales floor to be stocked, and that's it. What made the job difficult was management was always very stressed and would not communicate to one another. If the shift before you didn't finish what they were supposed to do then you had to do it plus get what you were supposed to get done finished. However, if you weren't able to do what they left and your stuff you got blamed and yelled at. The customers were the best thing about the job."
good,"Walmart  was a great place to work , 7years ago the store I worked at had 500 employs know it has 300 , it makes more but has less people to do the job. I love to work with the customers  and fellow  employs . I did not like the changing shift start times and days off."
good,Money was good. Lot of favoritism. Management had unrealistic expectations. No sense of teamwork. I personally would not recommend this place to anyone.
good,"The job was fun and easy, even as a cart collector. Problems arouse that caused worked to be more stressful. The management expressed no concern towards the circumstances."
good,Really enjoyed the company until the ghettoness started. The management team doesn’t know how to manage. Customers and associates are all disrespectful and rude..
good,Poorly managed. Unobtainable goals for maintenance. Held accountable for assets.took accurued time away.No paid holidays.management is always breathing down your neck.
good,"The job itself isn’t bad and the company offers benefits, stock options, sick time, and vacation. My biggest complaint is with management and it wouldn’t be fair for me to criticize the whole company based on my stores actions. As long as you are professional and nice, I’m sure your supervisors will work with you and leave you alone. If you ever feel concerns with management or are afraid of being retaliated against, you can always call the ethics line and they will definitely investigate fairly."
good,"I was able to work various positions during my time at WalMart, such as Cashier, Customer Service, Customer Host, Self Checkout Host, Garden Center Cashier, etc."
good,"I loved the fast paced of my job as a manager. I did not like the way management treated their employees. I was able to gain friendships, and meet new people everyday. I got a lot of joy from helping people and watching them leave with a smile."
good,"Walmart’s a good company to work for, management needs to remember their roots and where they started at!! Especially at Store#2822 in Walker Louisiana"
good,Management should be fair and not pay more attention to those associates that suck up to them. We have hard working associates and they get a poor raise. We have some associates that don't do a thing just walk around and get the same raise like others. To me thats not fair. Leadership can be improved. Startinfrom the top going down
good,"Assistant store manager. Very demanding with low standards. Benefits are descent which is why I stayed. I did a lot of hiring, follow up, merchandising, training and customer service."
good,Productive and good work place. Employees are friendly and helpful. Management could improve on communication. Over all I would definitely recommend someone looking for a first job to apply to this company.
good,"Company itself isn't bad, its individual management that that give the company a bad name. in this stores case management would tell you vague instructions then if ya do something different then what they want, they would blame you and write you up for not following directions. THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR ALL WALMART STORES AND MANAGERS"
good,"The employees were okay, it carried some drama with employees but besides drama it was a nice place to work at for time being. The management team was very excellent and organized."
good,"regular, buenas prestaciones pero no te permiten el crecicmiento laboral"
good,"It was a job that found you expandable. It's you wasn't doing your job, they moved on to the next person. They were always moving people around. Always firing people."
good,I worked in warehouse freezer. Runing high lift forklift restocking. Environment was horrible management at that time was worse. Crazy goals limited training. Always writing u up.  I would have never left this job if the management was different. I asked for more help/training to help meat my % goals. Was told yes I could get more help but still revived write ups for not meeting goals. My opinion nobody should be required spending entire day working in below zero temps. People should be rotated in and outs of these areas. Crazy unrealistic shipping orders hit... No ways of splitting it up... So your day was long. 430 am till whenever... Several days I didn't leave till after 9pm.. Horrible days for sure. The company puts so much stress and pressure on management in turn they put on employees. I'm surprised the injury and turn over rate isn't higher they it actually is. They stressed safety...but in allot of cases safety feel to waste side in order to get your %. So u didn't get wrote up.
good,"don't know what to say about this place."
good,The hardiest part of Walmart is the disregard for family life and time away from home. Once in management all your time will be required and there is no pay for going over your salaried time. And they will make you go over 60 hours a week
good,"great place to work, the only thing is the schedule. its hard if you have kids to work a flexible schedule but other than that is an excelent place to work."
good,You just have to be able to have flexible hours and be able to do what your job title requires you to do. If you do both of those things successfully then you will be fine.
good,"A typical day involves unloading a truck, then stocking what was unloaded. We were assigned sections to stock. In that environment I learned to work hard but also quickly and efficiently."
good,"The only livable positions at this company are for assistant managers or higher. Then they intensely focus on an intense, but rapid training regime that instills Walmart as a culture, a way of life. You either conform to the brainwashing or get out."
good,Oportunidad de desarrollar multiples actividades en la unidad de negocio.
good,It's not a difficult job just not for me also going to welding school in August so i need something more accommodating for me. I start school the 12 of August so it's soon.
good,"I enjoyed Walmart for many years and under two different managers, but our most recent manager is incredibly disrespectful. He does not follow basic ""One Best Way"" taught to management at the Academy stores, such as respect for the individual or acting with integrity. I have held on longer than many veterans who he's chased off, giving him and the company the benefit of the doubt, but I do not see things getting better at that store. The fact that he is still a store manager makes me think far less of the company as a whole, as I'm aware of at least a handful of ethics issues that have been brought to upper management's attention."
good,The workers were great but constantly overworked and understaffed.  The availability hours were constantly being ignored and there was no training program in place.  Management was constantly saying the problems the department was having were above their ability to fix.
good,A big store to work with a lot of opportunities to grow if well maintained by the management. No good culture and morals. On the job training is fairly good but had a better training in the human resource office
good,I would have given them a better rating if my position wasnt given away when i went on leave to have my son. When my selected time was up and needed to start working again i was told my position was given away even though i was guaranteed my position after maternity leave.
good,"Uma empresa boa, onde tive o privilégio de trabalhar com excelentes profissionais. Que me Deu oportunidade de aprender."
good,"I have been an employee of Walmart for 8 years. I can say that Walmart has been to Dependable source of income for me, but that doesn't mean that I've enjoyed my time as an employee. They have a standard model that they are supposed to follow, and I feel that they missed the mark time and time again. Respect for the individual is something that I truly believe in, and I feel that nowadays management is trained to move away from that value."
good,I dont like that we have to work the holidays. The pay raises suck the bonus we used to get were great but now they have really dropped off. They also only give you 4 points for missing n if u do a no call no show your done
good,"The management seemed to think that any sized truck can be unloaded within 2 hours, and be completely organized within that time frame, so the work was rushed due to management breathing down your necks. That is pretty much the worst part of the job, while the second might be while putting the merchandise out on the sale floor and having to deal with customers"
good,As a customer host you are stuck at 1 door for 8 hours a day that's with talking 1 hour lunch. You can not leave your area at all the radios they give you sick and the people on them don't know how to use it. There is a big lack of communication between employees even if you try to plan everything out they act like they care bit they really dont. When it is time for your lunch you are suppose to wait for someone but no one shows up.
good,Great to work as a temporary job if going to school but for advancement it is really rare unless good with management. Career I would not recommend to anyone.
good,"The people that worked with me, were for the most part, great people.  They were unappreciated hard workers, but they hung in there, because there were NO OTHER JOBS in the community.  Wal-Mart took advantage of this by under-paying, requiring crazy hours...inconsistent scheduling, ostracizing employees that could not conform and were fired (making it hard for them to get the other few jobs in the town).  It is an okay place to work...airconditioned, bathrooms, co-workers that want to work as a team.  The customers were either extremely rude and hateful or the best ever.  Mostly, the customers are in their own world...zoned out...and do not appreciate the service that the employee is allowed to give.  Management is TOTALLY A MIXED BAG...they are uneducated and untrained, so that should tell you everything.  I worked in pharmacy, so the manager was educated.  For the most part, he was great to work with....especially compared to other departments.  MANAGEMENT:  bias, jealousy, women strutting around trying to prove themselves, men that try to overlook the god-awful women managers.  OVERALL:  NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEASANTS TO RISE ABOVE THE SLAVERY LEVEL."
good,Management is the worst. They are rude and hateful. You bust your butt at work just for everything yo be messed up again the next day. The stress isn't worth it. New hires in different departments make more than I do as a department manger. Things constantly chang everyday. One day it's this and the next it's completely different.
good,If you are going to work in retail asset protection is position to seek.  The position is a constant challenge and one of the positions that is not cookie cutter as you never know what each shift will bring.
good,"I had liked my job & the people I worked with & for, I loved the customers."
good,Managers are to busy to help with anything.  Most seem like they don't know what they are doing and for 70 thousand a year they should.  Not very flexible.  Under compensated for some roles.  Freight movers and cashiers and cart pushers should not all make the same
good,the overall job is good but depending on who your manager is can make it bad due to lack of positive motivation.  There is lots of favortism and its all about who you know instead of the quality of work you do.  May be better i other locations.
good,No advancement opportunities or very poor. After 5 years at the company I tried to get a management position and continually told that my job performance was to low even tho I was the one trained in the entire store and willing to help when needed. And that because I had a relative working there I could notmmove up.
good,"This place has changed a lot since I left there. I heard that much is expected from  a few people, meaning the staff is small, and the expectations from that staff can be tremendous, coming from both the public and internally."
good,It was a job. Way too many managers telling you what to do. Not a lot of consistency. Poor communication. Inconsistent schedules. Hard to make your life a priority.
good,The money is ok 11 bucks an hour is better than 9. I have tried to move up 15 times in this place I was already doing the mangers job when they weren't there I took and passed my dm test and my assistant test each time a position opened up i was interveiwed but never got the job because I wasnt in the click with the store manager or i was to good where i was at. If your lazy and dont get your work done you'll be moved up.
good,"***DELI DEPARTMENT*** "
good,Some of my coworkers were nice but most were rude only because of me being the youngest out of all of them. They thought they could boss me around as if they were my manager.
good,"Most enjoyable part of job was my bonuses 2-3 times per year! "
good,Wal-Mart happens to be one of the most popular jobs of all time..the only thing is that the store. Has lack kf communication and is always undergoing employee turn over rate..because walmart only cares about the bussiness not its people.
good,"Being a fresh cap associate at Walmart is not a hard job. Honestly, it all depends on how management conducts their business. While all task are simple, it can become overwhelming if you don't have help, which was the case with the Laplace Walmart."
good,"I would exhibit customer service, while greeting customer during their check out experience. I would encourage to come back with a smile. I would also assist customers finding merchandise as well."
good,"I punch in to work and then I would have to find out where I’d be working inside or outside in the rain or heat, so most times I was unprepared for the weather"
good,The job pay not that bad just the member of management that like to slack of and get paid without barely lifting a finger and making other people jobs sound easy and scolding them when they do the best they can
good,"Old guard being pushes out for for new guard. Hourly associates have it made. Plenty of time off, lax attendance policy and if you do your job you are left alone. Once you promote to management it all changes. You are on a BE here schedule. Unrealistic workloads and constantly pestered by management on days offo"
good,The company as a whole is getting better but management is holding this back with lack of empathy for their associates and customers at times which reflects the attitude of everyone. The amount of vacation and off days are limited to the point of never having any with management denying the given dates making work/life balance almost nonexistent.
good,"Associates are over-worked, under-paid and definitely not appreciated for a day's work. Management is more interested in number of customers served in as little time as possible, than providing good customer service."
good,"Have to finish a computer program to get a raise and be there for 90 days."
good,Need more help there for better customer service.. and better bosses..that care more about helping people than getting more done with less people and help
good,"I worked there for 3 years, it was fine for the most part as a job to get me through college. But if you're not brain dead they pile responsibilities on you and make you learn and perform in every department in the store without giving you a raise. I left due to bad management as well as finally getting a job in my area of study."
good,"Not bad for a starting job, decent pay but management can be awful. The work can be stressful sometimes but like any retail, it requires patience and good will."
good,High energy but fulfilling my only issue is management and lack of hours the experience was great I give it 3 stars the most .the co-workers are nice some of them the customers make my day sometimes
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part. Management kind of sucked. I put in my 2 weeks with my dept. manager and he didnt notify the store manager or put it in the computer like he was supposed to because he was leaving too and didnt really care so now I can't go back because they have me down as job abandonment.
good,El horario era bueno aunque en temporada había que quedarse tiempo extra y no nos sacaban a comer
good,Walmart doesn’t have a huge focus on their hourly associates and the salaried managers are hardly qualified. Associates who have been employed with the company longer than a few years have certain pay privileges not available to an associate hired today
good,I put out stock and zone clothes. It is a lot of hard work and you get frustrated because people will tear it up as fast as you straighten it. It is good to know you have done your best and it is great when you have a manager that sees the good job you did and is appreciative of your hard work.
good,"I was sold on a culture of teamwork throughout the store, but that clearly isn't the case. Beyond that, it's a good job, with a store manager who seems to care, and most people work hard."
good,I was a hard worker and I learned a few things when I worked with Wal-Mart I didn’t like how  management ran there store and how they treat there  employees
good,"Tho the work done is all well and good, but the management often pick ther favorite associates and favors them above the rest. They dont discipline these associates and often take their sides in arguments."
good,"To some people it’s a good company but for me the employees are bad, they treat they’re people like nothing. And that’s not the kind of environment I wanted to be with."
good,Pay is not comparable to job responsibilities.  The culture of the company has changed throughout the years.  All hiring is basically part-time now. Management does not take on a role of leadership (not all stores) because they are constantly being pressed to push sales and prevent shrinkage.
good,"I was told would be offered full time job when it became available but in the year and a half there was never offered a full time position. The management was okay and co-workers great to work with. I think I would work for the company again, but only twenty hours per week after working my real job during the day time shift."
good,Its hard to be a full time associate and I have to stay on top of management to be able to get my 40 hours a week. They expect the associates to go way and beyond for them but wont work with the workers with there hours. Some days are very busy and some workers call out and the csm wont come and help out. Overall I feel like I can do better and actually be excited to be in the Medical field and make the patients happy and comfortable.
good,"easy for Advancement if you're willing to work hard,management(depending on manager on duty)there very understanding,willing to work with you.Expect to work part time (unless a supervisor or manager)raises are between .25 and .50 cents yearly(so expect very low compensation) staff was very friendly easy to work with. High exspentancies  for career advancements if you.re willing to work hard)."
good,"I’d recommend this job for college students. You’re not guaranteed hours and the pay isn’t much. It does offer good benefits on the employee’s benefit site, though. No insurance, no benefits and if you’re sick, it still count against you. Manager didn’t want to sign off on me closing my availability for my other job and it forced me to call out."
good,I enjoyed working there I had fun and have very well comments from my customers but management was not very fair and I feel I wasn't treated very fairly or rewarded for the hard work I put in.
good,"Lots of task had to be completed. Friendly coworkers, Management were always having conflicts, late shift pay was ridiculous. Driving more than 35 miles to get to work for a low pay."
good,External employees are not set up for complete success with the company! They should never be with a new store manager because they lack the leadership capabilities to develop them correctly! I haven’t worked for Walmart for long but it’s hard to learn when you aren’t taught anything
good,"Management Team does not communicate. The equipment necessary for day to day operations is scarce. Employee's ideas are usually not considered, even if management says they are."
good,"Okay, Let's be honest the job has a very high turn rate when it comes to the work. Always bickered at and put too much stress and work on the individuals."
good,Enjoyed meeting customers. I really like working with people. I learned a lot about working in retail. One of the hardest part was being on my feet all day but you get used to it.
good,"overall i worked for the company for a little over 6 years in two different states. when i initially moved to texas, i was told that there was a job offer for the position that i was in before the move. upon getting to the state, two different stores stated something different. i was demoted and had money taken from me due to that. i was not able to get my previous position back nor even given the chance to get it back, being told several times that there was not a position open. if you are not wanting to move up, it's not a bad place to work at all."
good,"Made you take an hour lunch break, preferred you didn't leave. Made the day seem long!"
good,"Working in the stores, you were not acknowledged for doing a good job and being dependable. Management did not treat you any better than those who were lazy and missed work a lot."
good,"The benefits of working at Walmart are having good people to work alongside with.  Those who have been with the company for years are family oriented and friendly.  Those staff are now replaced with cheaper labor and some positions are reduced to machines."
good,crazy hours never the same schedule management was ok typical work day cashiering keeping your isles organized and stocked clean alot of strange people hard to get to know
good,"Would be a better place to work for if they wouldn’t let a barely out of high school child and yes I mean child have a position with the name manager in it. The girl thinks she’s the best thing known to Walmart and man. She’s a freaking babysitter of the front end not a manager! She ignored you unless you’re her best friend. If it wasn’t for her, I’d stay at Walmart. Sorry, but I’m gone!"
good,"If you have a high tolerance for drama, and favoritism walmart is for you. While for the area the pay is fair, the job is stressful.  The employees for the most part are bitter and no help."
good,peers i worked with were easy to get along with but management on the other hand isnt good. they cut my hours and with no questions asked they wanted me to move postitions they felt were more comfortable for them to throw me to wherever they want.
good,"It was a decent job. Loved the customers and flexible hours, but left due to poor management and it becoming a toxic work environment with huge favoritism that I'd never seen In a work place before. While I stayed as a cashier and worked hard and even went out of my way for customers, many who slacked off or were just kissing up to management moved up higher to more fulfilling positions. It's a good job if you're in highschool / college and just need money to pay for bills, but I wouldn't recommend if you already have a degree or can find another retailer to work for especially if in customer service"
good,"No work, family life balance. Unfair scheduling for associates with new scheduling system. The company overall is coming down with so many changes in the structure within its stores which is far from beneficial for the hourly associates."
good,They want you to basically make your life surrounded by Walmart they overwork you they cut hours without notice if you don't know nobody in there they're not going to move you up you basically have to kiss a*s for advancements
good,Walmart morals have changed and they could be better with their management team. They care a lot about the hourly associates. Management are the one who helps stand policies and procedures and gets no moral support when we need it nobody has time for you.i used to love coming to work but not anymore.
good,The store manager needs to run store properly and hire the right staff for the right positions. Upper management needs to work hand in hand with supervisory team and not against them.
good,"Walmart was an excellent way to get into the workforce to develop many of the skills I need to move forward with my career. I was able to be productive, budget time, work as a team, and maintain a quality work ethic. Additionally, I was able to help managers with various projects around the store. The only flaws I had was that some of the management and co-workers were hard to work with."
good,They put you on a probation. And you can only have 4 points if you're late it's half a point . I worked a 30 mins away and if u are 5 to 10 mins late .
good,"Walmart is a hard place to work, sometimes they give you grief if they are busy and you need to go to the bathroom.  They are always short of staff and some of the employees don't do their job as needed and it is left for the next person to do when they take over."
good,"arrive early to start my day"
good,Walmart's full-time work schedule was very demanding. Pay is ok but they do not show appreciation. They make it clear that you can and will be replaced. Store management was very inconsistent and unprofessional. Hours were almost never consistent and none of the management were ever on the same page. Best part of wal-mart were my co-workers.
good,Management Needed to learn to work together. My co workers were great people. Management was always out for the all mighty dollar. Walmart says they are a family oriented company that can't be furthest from the truth.
good,"Walmart is alright, management is literally terrible to good and bad employees, “open door” policy is not open door at all, overall wouldn’t recommend. The work itself is good, easy, customers are normally nice."
good,I worked at Wal-Mart in 2012. They started you out at whatever your exp. Level was. Mine was 8.65. The hours were never good for me. One day I worked 6 to 2. The next 6pm to 11. But the schedule was made out in enough time. I loved it but got pnuemonia and had to quit.
good,Pretty chill and relaxed place to work (if your not a cashier). Some days are dreading but its somewhere to start if you dont have a lot of clues of what to do in life.
good,"Having to work with customers, filling shelves for customers to buy and driving sales. Willing to go above and beyond to help a customer get what they need and came to the store to get. Willing to help and learn."
good,"Good job for high school, not a lot of room for promotion. They tend to over hire and there are too many managers for one store. They pay very well. I am glad that I got the chance to work there but I am very excited to leave."
good,they teach you skills that you can use anywhere and you can transfer all over the country so if you need to move for family there is usually a wal mart near by you can transfer to
good,a typical work day at Walmart in Robinson 250 summit park drive. there where about a good 5-6 employee's you work with in the online grocery department that where great workers including myself the rest of them i have nothing against older folks worker but i do think there's a limit or should be a limit to the type of work that they should do and online grocery is not one of them there is a lot of lifting bending pulling pushing reaching moving etc there was a girl who had got promoted to department manger in our department very rude and bossy and would yell at people in their faces and just do alot of things she got reported several times even myself reported but still nothing i got called in the office and coached even though she called me a fing loser and had me do her work such as exception and resolution for bad survey's the head manger she was always there but never to be found they don't help and we are very short stuffed we get our behinds chewed out behind the lack of work management does for their department
good,Over all This  company is OK I would say.I had a Bad experience with them due to mistakes made by the  Managers.  The  System is  Somewhat a Confusing One
good,"It's honestly a fun job, but after a while one realizes that advancement in the workplace are only for employees who are willing to overlook the lack of integrity and respect some managers and/or co-workers have and suddenly you're branded as someone who has no business in the management field if you don't kiss up."
good,well in the beginning i love working with walmart but when they stared getting rid of the dedicated workers is when my store started running awful as in managers did not care co workers where always rude.the hours just vanished as well as the favrite game the managers played.
good,"Typical day a work is receiving products off of the truck, and putting them on carts . After that you go on the floor and stock the aisles of whatever you received off of the truck. Helping customers is an essential part as well."
good,Cool fellow employees. Fun atmosphere. Fun talking to customers. Fun learning experience. Inside jo. Makes working better. I enjoyed the people most. No room for advancement.
good,"Walmart was a good company to work for. Stores varied by management. When I worked for walmart in Texas the employees were treated fairly but the store I worked at in Tennessee was basically run by the""Good ole boy""method."
good,The Walmart I worked at in Watson Louisiana had a new worker in management whom had to learn about Tue bakery and deli. She was not a professional worker and she d8dnt even know how to properly treat customers. From day one her behavior was childish. The customers would even complain how she was due to the fact that the customers noticed how she was.
good,Un ambiente cargado con mucha presión y mucho trabajo para poca paga y pocos beneficios  no solía ser así a cambiado mucho dentro de los 10 años que llevo en la empresa ...
good,Have fun working at walmart. Learned a lot of new things. Great people to work around. Managers help with everything you need. Flexible days. And work overtime every once in a while
good,"It would really suck living off of a walmart salary, embarrassing even, but its a good entry level job. No over time kinda sucks, new attendance policy is trash. Yeah"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. The customers were unbelievably friendly, and most of the staff were amazing. I was a pretty socially anxious person, but being at Walmart for so long really helped my people skills. My favorite parts were when I was on a register and it was steady busy. And when I was picking the groceries as a personal shopper, I personally found it fun, going down the aisles and scanning the groceries. The hardest part of the job for me was the micro managing, and the favoritism. I understand that a manager will have favorites, but it shouldn't interfere with another person's schedule, or work day. And micro managing is a bit of a pet peeve for me, because once I catch on, I know what I'm doing, and I don't particularly enjoy being watched like a hawk. Multitasking got easier, because I had to juggle answering a phone and giving a person their groceries, or answer a phone and ring a person up. Overall, I did enjoy working at Walmart."
good,"There is really no advancement in Walmart if you don't have a college degree.  There are no vacation or sick days or any kind of benefits.  "
good,it's a waste of time to work hard and expect anything in return. As soon you receive a raise (peanut). They cut the hours so the company budget stays the same.
good,"Constant changes in policies, mgmt doesn't follow guidelines. Unorganized, not associate friendly. Personnel associates are often demeaning and uncooperative."
good,They don't care about anything except their own needs. I have a family of five and anytime i needed off for events which are far and few between i was denied.
good,"I have been working at Walmart for almost two years now, and with all the experience I have had there, I would say your time there is ultimately affected by the managers you have. Walmart managers are changing a lot, always at least once a year, and definitely at least a few times a year as well. They really determine the atmosphere at the store. I would say ours was extremely strict with no room for creativity or individualism. I work in Online Grocery Pickup, and I started about a month after its opening in our store. It was very new at the time, and is still fairly new in general. Over the course of my working in OGP I have seen many changes, whether it be management, the number of orders and customers we handle a day, the staff in my department, and policies around the store. The hardest part is definitely working your way around favoritism by managers, and just feeling unappreciated. It may just be something that is natural, but I feel it really can bring someone's hopes down, and passion for the job entirely. It makes someone feel like they are working for nothing. The most enjoyable part is feeling fulfilled after a hard day, knowing that you completed it and that you can take on anything. My job is very day to day, and what you complete in that day is important, and I enjoy knowing that I did a good day of work. I also love the feeling I get when I can help a customer by giving some of my personal experiences and recommendations, and them liking my answers. It's a nice feeling when you can actually help a customer, and not just give a generic answer."
good,"on a typical day, for a properly trained associate, the worker is to check with the fitting room for go back then the back room for freight. after completing the tasks listed, the associate is to began zoning and merchandising the sales floor."
good,"The pay is excellent, but the managers were not very friendly. When you apply to Walmart, get ready to make it your number one priority. Hardly had weekends off. Seems as though I was at work every single day to the point where it was stressing me out because I had no time for family and friends. The new point system sucks!"
good,Love the people love the environment. Family felt work place. With plenty of opportunity to move or advance yourself within the company. Management staff understanding and easy to work for.
good,went on a sick benefit when I reurned got cut hours and them also had other isuused management works you eith very little breaksit was not for me two weeks I wasn't even on the schedule.
good,They say they hire within but you pretty much have to know somebody to get promoted. It’s hard work and they do have great benefits. The management does have favorites
good,I never had problems with a lot of my co-workers if I needed help stocking heavy items they are willing to help my CSM will always help if I needed help with anything.
good,"No work/family balance. Micro managed all day long. Not given time to do administrative work/taking care of associates. "
good,"Learned how to pierce ears"
good,"I loved working here mostly because of the people I worked with and the people I met. I hated to leave (I quit voluntarily and they put me as terminated) but the management team there IS THE WORST I've ever worked with in my life. Managers work strictly off favoritism if you weren't a favorite then don't expect management to treat you like an actual human being. If you had overtime they made you get rid of it, they worked you like dogs, all that store was full of was just pure drama (chidish workers), you hardly got paid for vacation and any insurance you had you wouldn't received until you've been working there for 6 years."
good,The company is going through a transition and change is a good thing but finding where my skills are effective under this new Direction has been a challenge
good,"I love my job,,, Walmart has changed so much during the 23 years there.  So stressful,,,, hours vary.  I always had a set schedule.   Not no more.  Hours vary anywhere from 28 to 4o hours. Poor management there."
good,Management can be difficult but they give the hours your looking for. Busy work for most of the areas but nothing there is to hard. Can’t be lazy though.
good,"fast paced, on your feet at all times, would like to learn more about receiving product and morning procedures so I can advance to a more challenging position."
good,The supervisors played favorites and they would yell at you for no reason and wouldn’t explain to you how to do things.Also management of backroom was terrible
good,A great job for anyone looking for part time employment. Flexible scheduling to be able to enjoy a social life as well as participate in school activities.
good,The part time/ full time associates who are not in management more or less don't care about how things get done. The motto that they go by is everyone is replaceable. The pay for what they require is not equivalent.
good,"There was no advancement opportunities for cashiers, or Customer Service Managers. No raises except annual raises. Long hours during the holidays, but cut hours extremely during non-holidays."
good,"This is a job that would be cool for students during the summer or college kids. There's not too much of a workload for the average worker daily, and co workers are normally really nice."
good,If your a good worker they will work you harder and always ask you to stay longer. They get angry when you change your availability and they don't like it when you work another job.
good,Good pay. But you are always working 24/7. Work life balance is non existent and job security is day by day for salaried managers. Must be a perpetual optimist if you hope to survive for a career.
good,"Retail. Clothes, items, stock shelves, run the register check customers out. Change watch batteries and watch bands, my favorite part of the job was when I got to mess with the watches. I was Secondary in Jewelry and found out people actually working Jewelry got paid more an hour than I did."
good,Walmart is not a good place to work. Walmart will hire you and say you will get paid $11/12 a hour but in reality you don’t get no hours. I started at Walmart in 2016 making $9 a hour it is now 2019 and I make $11.50 a hour. The new associates are starting off at $12 a hour. I don’t think that it is fair. Not only that but I did not get my yearly raise like everyone else. I have work my hardest to get to where I am at. Walmart has treated me very poorly and I would not ever recommend anyone to work there.
good,management depending on location isn't fair needs improvement in all areas. Walmart is flexible with the hours but there seems no room too move up keep many employees at the same level for years.
good,Okay place to work but expections are nearly impossible to achieve. Pay is good but the amount of production they want to do makes the job stressful and not fun. Mandatory OT is done frequently
good,I knew alot of ppl there and they made me feel comfortable.im a good person at heart and looking helping others find things. I loved when i was able to get subway for luncch every day
good,"I would go to work at 10 , clock in and start stocking up things on the floor. I learned how to fold clothes the correct way and let things go when customers would not fold clothes back."
good,"me retire de la empresa por cuestión académica, continuar mis estudios"
good,Walmart was a great place to work for when i started out but it seem the higher i got with the company the worse it got for me. I enjoy learning from the company and the excuses to and the training tools i had.
good,"The managers are something else, hard to get a long with unless you kiss their butts. They belittle you, don't listen to you. Always short staffed, don't understand health concerns."
good,"the job was only a stop gap between jobs , however the people I worked with became good friends.  Its unfortunate that the company does not the see value in their staff."
good,"it was ok, it wasn't my favorite job but its what you make it. advancement is easy if you apply yourself but the pay is at the store management level."
good,It all started ok. I started with pushing carts around 10pm and when finished of told to do something else they put me as a stocker then cashier then this is where i quit... they literally lied to me saying i was maintenance... which i never agreed. I didn't apply to be maintenance st all..
good,"it has its days where its fun but it has it bad"
good,"Income was not suitable. Worked very hard for little money, hard to maintain a family on this income. However,the discount for food and clothes was helpful."
good,"The pay was decent, the job itself was not hard except there was never enough help so that made things hard.  Management team was less than eager to help and there was a lot of favoritism.  "
good,"Overall I would have to say that when I worked for walmart in the late 90's they were very family oriented. This time around being a single parent with three school aged children and a mother who was terminally ill, they did not provide myself and my family with any support. When my mother passed away I didn't even receive a card or anything not only from my department which was pharmacy, I also got nothing from the store manager as well."
good,I will admit that this job has helped me become better prepared at working with the public and has taught me on how to problem solve even better when working with customers
good,"No set schedule, employees  worked mostly a  5 hour shifts. There was not enough money to pay my bills. Most employees worked two or more job , just to make ends meet and they were on food stamps."
good,En mi caso no tengo nada que desir de la empresa Walmart es una empresa que te ayuda mucho a superarse como persona
good,"I learned a lot from this job since it was my first. But the poor management/Poor training was my reason for wanting to leave. There were a few good department managers but for the most part they were rude, disrespectful to customers and employees and didn't properly train the new employees that they had hired."
good,"Walmart was a really good place to work in the past, but the company culture continues to change and they reorg every couple of months. There is no job security."
good,"Walmart was a good first job but it only gave me enough money for gas, my insurance, and my phone bill. Management was not the best their they were very rude but the associates were very nice and easy to work with"
good,I love working at Walmart but at times it can get hard trying to balance work and home life but other than that it’s an amazing place to work and it has really good benefits
good,"The workplace is.fast pace"
good,i think working at Wal-mart is almost like a right of passage. Leave it to teens that are looking for a job right after high school. not very good pay but there good hours at least.
good,Was a new store and new management in roles they never had before and it showed. They let team leaders have too much power because they were short staffed.
good,"This company would have been great to work for if it wasn't for the management. They were very picky with who they let advance in the company. If you didn't know somebody, you didn't get a promotion. Or you had to work three times as hard as someone who just got hired from knowing someone currently there."
good,"It’s a nice company to work for your first job or need a little extra money in your pocket ,they are very flexible but management can get out of hand at times other than that it’s a very well respected environment."
good,"The pay is low you do a lot of work but don’t really get paid. The Management/ Store Manger  at my store do not give out much information on benefits, hours, any thing in that nature. It’s mostly figure it out on your own but if those things changes it could actually be a wonderful place to work."
good,"Working at Walmart was easy for the most part."
good,Had some very serious things going on at home and they just didn’t seem to care. I get it’s a business but when it comes to family you would think they would try and be there and understand. Nope not at all.
good,I missed a few days from work due to medical issues and they let me go.  My managers loved me and how hard I worked but the company could not do anything about missing days.
good,"Every other month or so, the management team is different. The recent team will mot say anything to you unless you are being reprimanded. It has become rather hostile. I prefer to work where i feel i am valued and an important member of the team."
good,"Would recommend to someone who is looking for something right now. Not sure about long term, if you're looking for a career I would suggest something i that you can see yourself never considering giving up."
good,For one working here hss been the worst time of my life. Management is awful they tell you to do one thing and make you do something else in the middle of you already doing something. Nobody really works in there. Hard to advance beacuse management doesn't want you to transfer to another department. Overall this is a bad store to work at Avoid it at all cost!!
good,"A typical day for CAP 1 is stocking freight, then scanning things in backstock, and running the stuff that will fit on the shelf. Other duties as assigned."
good,everything at Walmart is always a day by day thing. nothing is ever the same and thats what i really loved about it and drove me to become a manager and want to move up. but once you get salaried members of management in the mix who are just as confused as everyone else then act stuck up  and make you feel icky then thats when you just want to give up.
good,It was great at times but when they make changes it seems to affect the management team which then affects the hourly employees. I think the starting pay should be a bit higher but its not the best place to work.
good,"If you do get a job there, just keep in mind you are responsible for keeping up on your tardies and absences even though they have a point system set up that is flawed. It seems to not consistently update so lets say you call in one day and youre on your last point but you have sick hours to cover it but for some reason the system hasnt updated a previous tardy/absence, then even if you use your sick hours thinking you will be safe their point system will eventually add that point you may have forgotten about since it didnt show up the last time you checked and you'll be automatically flagged for termination if you go over even by half a point. You have to constantly keep asking HR or the managers to make sure the system is accurate for your peace of mind. It wouldnt be that big of an issue if you didnt already have a huge workload that was expected to be done by the end of your shift and trying to always get a managers attention is a very time consuming process that, depending on who you are, may or may not work out for you. But like any job your experience there may vary. Just thought I'd point that out so someone else doesn't end up getting fired without notice even after putting in a lot of hard work."
good,Work day was very busy.  Customer sometime vary rude because of lack of cashiers on duty. There was favoritism on site. Employee brakes was few and not very long.
good,"I loved my employees that worked for me. but, the salary management is a different story. they had favorites and were not very good leaders. I am not saying all of them were like that. but it only takes a few to make the day go from good to bad. because of lack of help or guidance."
good,A typical day at work is kind of like a mad house with the store consistently being understaffed at night. I usually only look forward to pay days and find myself constantly wanting to switch departments. I believe the most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships you build with fellow employees and the hardest part is dealing with difficult customers.
good,"It was fine for a first-time job. It was very hard to get into management positions. Being a regular worker on days your hourly pay isn't enough. You make decent money, however, if you work overnights but that is a back-breaking job."
good,Co-workers are great! The pay could be better but not bad. Management in my store never agreed on store policies. It was an average work pace which is good. The dress code is relaxed now that they let you work with any type of clothing as long as you wear the customer service vest. The hardest part of working for Walmart was the managers not agreeing on policies and making up policies on the spot. The best part about Walmart is you receive a 10% discount on taxable items.
good,"A lot of responsibility on you in every position. All of gossip and not much working, no holiday off . You will never have thanksgiving with your family."
good,"July will make three years for me being at Walmart as a front end cashier. This job is easy except for when it comes to dealing with the different attitudes and personalities in customers. Customers have never really been my issue, more so management. Walmart is definitely one of those places that managers walk around as if they are better than anyone else. My main reason for wanting to leave is how horrible they are with availability. I’m in school so every semester my availability usually has to change. I don’t like how long it takes for it to come into effect. It takes three weeks for that next availability to come start which is too long, then I have to worry about points and getting them erased and all that, it’s just too big of a hassle. Hours have never been a problem for me, management does expect your life to revolve around Walmart though."
good,Every day I work I feel stressed! I do my job and I follow all policies but I feel like management there are bullies and make you feel like you you will be fired at any moment.
good,"Wal-mart is definitely one of those places where, if you get sucked in, you are probably staying for life. Run! DO NOT PASS GO!!!"
good,"after 21 years, the overall mgmt could be a lot better and they lack certain skills from the top down and it trickles down to the people who work there."
good,Back when I started 5 years ago walmart a family orientated company .Now the company is getting away from understanding the associates have family obligations.
good,"not bad place to work, job itself was easy. the managers never communicated. co workers are great. hours are okay, hard to get full time, slow at times."
good,"During my interview the store manager asked what I was looking for out of Walmart. I told him I was going to college soon and needed a job for at least 4 years and Walmart had good pay so I just needed to make sure they could also work around my hours. He guaranteed me they would as that was something guaranteed at the corporate level. Worked through the summer no issues, gave them my school availability when it started, was fine for a couple weeks then out of no where they start scheduling me a couple days then I'm off for up to 11 days in a row at points, then when I'm due back it's during my unavailable days/hours when I'm supposed to be in class. They kept doing it and I couldn't afford to work there like that and they weren't happy with me calling off even if I had told them multiple times that I can't work those times/days. No surprise after working there why their turnover rate is so high. They told me it was because it's difficult to find people who want to work, but it seems like it's because they don't treat people right."
good,Walmart is not that bad. It just depends on your managers. Everyone’s experience at Walmart is different. Give it a shot yourself. Things might work out in your best interest.
good,"Good pay, break times were good, most people were nice. Sadly some poor managers, bad organization. This company can be very beneficial, but too many loops to jump through without hard workers getting recognition"
good,"The Work, while it could be stressful, was repetitive, and it was easy to get into a rhythm. However, the managers dont forgive easily. even with doctors note, being sick for a prolonged period of time is treated the same as a No-Call: Write up/ Beig let go."
good,"From what I hear, most Walmart stores have mediocre or poor management. It was quite stressful, especially around the holidays. The best part of the store is the friends you make."
good,"Wal-Mart is no longer what it used to be. I wouldn't reccommend working for walmart unless you like working under favoritism for very less hours. On top of getting barely any hours, they'll forget when its your break or will mark you off and forget about you. If you tell management something, they'll act like they care but disregard it as soon as you walk away. It seems like in todays workplace they care more about their numbers instead of trying to provide customer service.  Multitasking is a thing."
good,I worked Fresh Cap 2. I stocked and zoned all fresh areas to include inventory. Usual shift from 1300 to 2200 to include donations and compost. Also did CVP (customer value program) at 1500 and 2000 hours to markdown all soon to expire foods.
good,This place isn't very busy. I had to work extra hard to pull customers into the store. I liked working alone and having that type of responsibility. It was a decent place!
good,"Management would just pick on me and use my services more than others. Other employees did not have to perform job duties, they literally called my name over the intercom during lunches and breaks and told me to come clean up messes even though i did not finish my lunch. This happened almost all the time. I talked to my supervisor but she did nothing to change this. I felt overworked and underpaid at times."
good,"Like high school culture, unfair, bias, poor management on an assist and Co-manager levels. Many company policy and procedures are not followed. I would reccommend walmart but not this location."
good,"a typical day at work at wal-mart is typically easy and starts to deteriorate the longer you stay there, management is always struggling and unable to grasp the concepts of what makes a store run efficiently. workplace culture consists of people that can't manage to do simple tasks upon repetitive request. the hardest part of the job is most people are swarmed with job responsibilities they weren't prepared for. the most enjoyable part of the job are the friends and people that you'll learn from and enjoy the company of just to get through the day."
good,It was stressful at times but I made it work but the management was horrible and I left for better treatment as a hand being but i did work hard but I love to shop at Walmart
good,Since we were required to work at a fast rate i couldn't keep up sometimes . i left work really exhausted . The management was so rude and so strict. It was work and work.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers choose which kind of oil and tires they should buy. I learned to be very patient even when customer aren't happy with any troubling situation. Biggest issue with working there was management scheduling and lack of care for the automotive team. Hardest part of the job would be having to cover the register, phone, and service writing all at once, it would get really busy and i never felt like it should be a one man job. Best part about the job was my coworkers, they helped the best they could and always gave a helping hand."
good,"ok starter job, meet good people but can't afford a living only if worked there for a long period of time. but starting off you work under 40 hours and mostly on weekends and all holidays ."
good,"It's okay,  the people I worked with were awesome but managment not very good. I wanted to learn a story manager position and was laid in the face by several managers ands was told no i don't. Management changed my career preferences without my knowledge or consent to do so."
good,It was just boring if I could have gotten passed that It would not be terrible. The colors are depressing and people there are also depressing. The managers were not the best and seemed to always be flirting with employees or just having to much casual time while on the floor. I worked as a cart pusher so work was strenuous on busy days and they rarely were full staffed and the electric cart pusher did not work for my entirety with the company so we had to manually push carts and you could not push more than 10 at a time.
good,They keep you busy and always expect as much out of you as they can possibly get in an 8 hours shift. Pay is alright but hours fluctuate. Do allow for the use of PTO and PPTO though to make up for any days you may miss.
good,The store i worjed at didnt follow the miasion of the company. They were unwilling to work with employes and their needs. Sales associate were forced to take on work not in their job discription for standard pay.
good,"When working at Wal-mart you never knew what to expect. One day you may be a cashier and the next day you have to unload a truck. Although there wasn't much consistency, working there taught me several things, I now know how to work a pallet jack. The hardest part of the job for me was the lack of recognition, no matter how hard you worked, management always views your work productivity as insufficient. What I did enjoy about the job is being able to assist the customers."
good,It was so hard to schedule days off for doctor appointments for me and my mother. The lady in personnel was mean and rotten and hated people in general. The managers and the Csm supervisor were all backstabbing two face liars. The training was short lived.
good,"I really didn't like working at Walmart, but it was a job. The hours was always changing. I didn't like working on every holiday. It took a lot of time from me, being with my family."
good,"Management was awful, not realistic in what they wanted done."
good,The job was find but the one thing i did not like was that code 12 or the bugy pusher did not a way to move up in the store. the code 12 would do a lot of thing in the store and still get bad maker on them. The management team was good but there were management that should have got fired. The pay rise was a joke wend i was there but now they get pay good now.
good,"The stress of the job isn't worth everything management and corporate put you through. It's okay temporarily, but not as a career. The benefits are nice, but they make you wait a long time to get them."
good,Walmart has a high turnover rate for a reason. This should be a company for someone who needs a decent job for 6 months to a year. It is a pain to work there.
good,I would say this is a good starter job for anyone that is just starting off in the work force. I wouldn't recommend it if you have been working for many years.
good,"I love the job and the people I work with, and I especially love helping customers, but management is very poor and I wish things could/would change because it'd be a great place to work."
good,"Walmart can be a stressful environment. Hated working graveyards. Was paid decent at the time but it was hard work. I did cashier and stocking, they threw me wherever."
good,This was a good place to work until they drastically cut the hours without warning. I went from working 24-32 hours per week down to 8 hours. With what they pay I can't afford to work there.
good,Non-flexible work hours. Strict rule following but not all rules are clearly communicated. Overall lacking in communication between all associates and management. Unrealistic expectations at times.
good,Working at walmart is great if you are someone who enjoys people and organizing. Management is extremely poor and probably will never be around when you need them.
good,Management is messy and borderline childish. Not all some are great but nothing seems to be done about the rest. No appreciation for work done. You can bust your tail or do bare minimum the results are the same.
good,"Same physically demanding work everyday. Unload truck/freight by piece manually, stock shelves that were constantly messy and missing products, and help your typical customer."
good,I think cap 2 should be paid more and they shouldn't ride there backs as much as they do. Cap 2 is the quarter back off Walmart and doesn't get paid like one and they work harder then others
good,My typical day at work would consist of coming in and clocking in and going to work right away. I learned that the customer is always right even when they aren't right. Some of the management is alright to work with but there are some managers that I would not recommend working with if possible.
good,some days I love my job other times just want to go home as soon as I can. But I have enjoyed my time at Walmart thus far. Learned a lot from all the friends I have made the last 3 years
good,Plenty of opportunities with end the company ..... get to work and learn different areas and dept with end the store ....  ability to learn different things and move up in the company
good,"Good place to work while in high school. Good work environment, little stress, no pressure. Very easy going atmosphere. Managers are understanding and help out when needed."
good,"The job is very easy to do. The management is very uncaring. They harass you and write you up for stuff that is not work related. I recommend if you have a problem with management, call Ethics!"
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. And I love helping people and make people happy and deliver a good customer service expience. I will be able to work in every department like customer service at the self check out and sometimes doing stocking items on the shelf.
good,"The managers were a pain to deal with, most of the associates on the shifts before me were not doing their job and it became my fault every time I came in. Nobody was held accountable for the work they did. There were not enough employees hired at any point in time and the employees that were there were overworked and under appreciated."
good,"It's a pretty easy job, with great people. Hours vary pretty widely from week to week, but overall it's a great place to work. Sometimes management can be a little hard to work with though."
good,Si le caes bien al la jefa de cajas todo bien pero si no la garra encontrá de ti.
good,Great company just senior management needs more training. I look forward to another start at a different facility or store in the future. This is the greatest retailer in the world.
good,its ok the work is cold and management is very bad.but I really love being a freezer orderfiller it was very good exercise and I really enjoyed seen the difference foods and ice creams
good,"When I first started I was a cashier, then I moved over to Toys, but that took 3 months of asking for them to notice. but now they send me up constantly, just because they can't keep cashiers due to lack of support for them when a customer is angry. Most employees are amazing and some of the best people I've met. The management is lacking heavily in connecting to there employees. My department manager is so kind and actually tries to connect to people, but shes the only person in toys when I got there. The work and life balance is little if even existent, if you put on your work availability form you can't work Tuesday's then you will have to tell them constantly its against your availability. and they make sure to schedule you as much as they can even on days you have asked off. "
good,"Walmart is a good place for younger people just starting in the work place. I have a desire to work in a place with a more positive atmosphere. I enjoy working with customers,but not with management."
good,"At the beginning of the day I was required to audit my department. In the meantime I also helped customers. Processed their photos, did price changes, audit the backroom and ordered merchandise for my department."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the first year, then a new store manager was brought in and the entire environment changed. I think that with a good management team that communicates in a positive way with associates it's not a bad place to work. However, a bad manager can ruin EVERYTHING. People don't quit a company or a name on a building. They quit managers."
good,"no consideration  for employees or customers. they say one thing and do another,.. if you go to them about a concern they ignore you they know they can get new employees and customers so it is only about money"
good,"I use to work at Walmart a few years ago. When I first Started it was cool, we had a pretty large staff and there was always teamwork. As the years went so did the staff lol the departments went from 3-4 workers to 1 maybe 2! The pay should’ve been went up when I was working there, I remember working in one section and then getting pulled to do a million and one other things in other departments that I wasn't getting any extra pay for. Moving up in this location was HARD to do if you weren’t a butt kisser to the store manager  (at the time), I wasn’t one of those lol so I couldn’t move up and be fake. Also when it came time for the yearly raise they would bring up the dumbest thing to not give you the max in your raise! Also being on break and still working was very annoying! I loved when the head people came into our store because then all the managers would speak and try to help out lol it use to be so funny and weird."
good,"Overall it’s decent. My department is one of the hardest working in the whole store and we get paid the least. Our supervisors are not the best, and nothing is done with common sense. The best part of the job is the people the work with me. A typical day for me would be set up for the truck, unload it which could take from 2 to 5 hours depending on how big it is. Then we finally go to lunch when it’s done. When we get back from lunch we stock the freight that we unloaded. We don’t have any management for my department so we just have supervisors."
good,At the beginning I was nervous but over time with the staff and management team I had we became more like family and I learned a lot over the time period I was working there.
good,I learned a lot from my time at Walmart and I also kinda grew as a person. Most work days were extremely busy but I was trained well on how to do my job efficiently.
good,i meet a lot of cool people i loved working there cause the people made it so fun. they got the job done and knew how to have fun at the same time. the customers were amazing people.
good,"Typical day varies from season to season, can be a rollercoaster, yet teaches to not panic, go with the flow and provide quality customer service. Variety is the spice of life, so can be said about the workers and customers."
good,The job itself isn't difficult and advancement can be done in a reasonable amount of time. The company does a great job taking care of it hourly associates but when it comes to salaried its different.
good,"It is a great place to work, people around me don't always perform at the high level that i myself performs at. However, management doesn't set a good example. I perform a lot of duties for the low amount of pay that i receive."
good,Management changes too often and does not like to listen to you...unprofessional at times ...love the customers and most  employees. Good discounts and good benefits are a plus. I love what I do and love learning new things and you can have the opportunity do so in a timely manner.
good,"I started my day by clocking in and putting my hairnet on. I cut meat and cheeses for customers. I fried food for their hot foods area, mixed up bagged salads, and cleaned the deli. I learned customer service skills and working with others as a team. The workplace was very stressful. We were very short staffed and some managers weren't very helpful. 6 months after being in a position you are to be able move up or changed positions as long as you do not get wrote up 3 times. I was unfortunately wrote up on my days off and got stuck in the deli position I eventually wanted to get out of. Managers there got my hopes up to stay longer by promising me to be in different positions including even management. It was extremely disappointing. Not only did they write me up on my day off but they also tried to force me to work off the clock. When I went to management they did nothing. The most enjoyable part of my working experience there was to be able to learn new things and get better customer service skills. It was an experience I will never forget."
good,"Walmart is an okay workplace, depending on the location that you work at. I worked at the one in Kemah, and while the job itself and my coworkers were great, my manager and supervisor were TERRIBLE!"
good,"I started working for this company almost two years ago in the Bakery department as a cake decorator. The job training was not sufficient for the position, and the existing supervisor in the area was fired after only a month of my working there.  I enjoyed the job until I found out that the reason for high turn over in that department was due to the extreme unresolved conflict in the department between workers, which made for a rather explosive job environment that was extremely high stress and took a toll on my mental health. As such, I requested to be transferred out of the department and was given my choice of 3 other departments. However, Job safety is not a priority at this store, and I was repeatedly asked to perform unsafe lifting maneuvers as a stock associate, which injured my back only 2 weeks after being transferred. Due to the injury, I was unable to continue my job in that position and was offered a position as a cashier, which I took due to a promised advancement opportunity and further job training. However, said advancement is still pending approval and I have been in my current position nearly a year."
good,"For the pay, depending on the manager, you are asked for more than it's worth. But, if you are lucky like I was, the work environment is great and productive with great management."
good,"Fast paced, always busy, in my area there is one specific manager that is beyond disrespectful. The job has lots of good coworkers, and as usual you're not so good, unfriendly one."
good,it was the most contradicting place to work. There would be days they would have you ready for work the next day and when you come in the next day it would all be changed and completely unprepared for work.
good,"This company use to take care of its associates. Anymore it’s all about profit. So many jobs are replaced with machines. I am a 19 year associate that has been displaced due to downsizing. Co managers minimized so no where to advance. Assistants down sized due to day stocking, no cash office associates, less cashiers, maintenance robot machines, computerized truck unloader. Managements bonuses based on store standards but stocking is now done during the day. Long term associates are bought out for their service. Walmart also no longer hires wheel chair bound associates. It’s very sad. I loved my job and the company once"
good,This company had a lot of crooked people management was poorer than expected cared very little about employees. And my hours went from being 35 to 40 down to 20 25
good,"It was a nice place to work it was for the Holiday I didn't  stay on after the holiday they needed extra help I needed the extra  money however, I'm always getting asked when am I coming back .That makes me feel like I did a Great job"
good,"Una empresa que ofrece oportunidades de crecimiento, pero no existe la cultura laboral, jefes que se dedican  explotar a los empleados con sueldos bajos, sin pago de horas extras"
good,"Greetings customers everyday while cashiering, always giving great interaction with customers, really enjoyed working with the public, trying to smile with some customers can be very difficult that would be the hard part of my day, loved giving stickers to the kiddos and learned allot about the different types of people in the world."
good,"Employees are expected to complete all tasks before they can go home. If a truck is late, it's that much later that you get to go home. Also there is not enough people working on a shift to get everything done."
good,"The schedules are very flexible. The management is extremely poor. The do not have the necessary skill to be a manager and the handling of high stress situations are handled terribly. If you announce you are trying to better yourself, they will make your job worse."
good,"Things Learned:"
good,Es una empresa que debería enfocarse en el trato con asociados y tomar en cuenta decisiones u opiniones de los mismos.
good,"Typical work day starts with different managers yelling at you to do different things that contradict what each other manager says. Then getting yelled at some more when you don't do it fast enough. It is a high stressful place to work, thus is why I am on indeed looking for a new place to work."
good,"The company overall is average. It's not as bad as people think, but it's not a ray of sunshine, either."
good,"The hours are horrible! Home office makes schedules so if you don't get hours that's on you. Some managers don't like doing their job, and personnel is RUDE and LAZY!!!!"
good,"Pulling product for site to store pick ups. Enjoy the  working hours either 6:00 am -3:00 pm. or 5:00 am to 2:00pm."
good,Good.place to work just have to watch for managers a power trip. Benefits are good. 401k is offered. Its not hardwork.Good location. Training is none existing. Fast paced. Lines are always long. Never enough lines open. A few managers are approachable Only a few. Employees are okay. If you can deal with this it is a great opportunity
good,Walmart is great for starting off! They respect you at first since you’re new to the job but once they know you they get to talking to you like you’re they’re child.
good,Walmart is a wonderful place to work but the cut backs on staff and hours has hurt the store and its employees. There is still the same amount of work if not more and only half the emloyees to work it.
good,"flexible schedule"
good,"The lack of leadership in the management is making the employees more stressful than they need to be.  I have learned to stay to yourself, do what you are told, then clock out and go home."
good,Really enjoyed my job as a regular hourly associate but wouldn't recommend management unless you do not want a life outside of work. As a salary member of management I worked on average 60+ hrs in 4 days.
good,"Some times it unfair at walmart.  Favoritism.. Pay is unfair. I like to work, I go to work to make a pay check. I also enjoy what I do. "
good,"It use to be a good place to work, but now everything is pretty much who you know and how much butt you are willing to kiss. It doesnt matter if you are good at your job, just who you know. Not only that they expect associates to work for little to nothing for the one that have been there the longest while new hires get hired on at a higher pay rate which is not fair. They also do not give you raises based on your real performance because you are not allowed to get full ""exceed expectations"" even if you do, because they then beileve you shouldnt be in that area, which what is wrong with being good at your job?"
good,Most of the time management refuse to work with peoples availability and often schedules them to work on days they are completely unavailable to work resukting in them having to call out and often times be fired for going over their absence point allowance
good,"Walmart used to have good values but they started to be every time less for their people ."
good,"Small crew daily, service writers told to keep writing up but do not give a time when done.  Priority with oil changes within minutes with no special crews for them, must take body away from tire service to do oil jobs within 15 minutes and let tire jobs suffer.  This is not what is in the policy at the original walmart procedures when we opened. Now the manager does what he wants done for repairs etc. Which we never did because of dot and manufacturers."
good,"If you can handle stress and horrible people on the daily then you will fit in at Wal Mart. On a daily i had to deal with rude people. I worked in the money center, customer service and cashier. You really have to have tough skin to work there and put up with ignorance from alot people..  I think all the management there needs to be retrained. From what i saw and see at other walmarts is that the higher ups have big heads because of the title that they have and its sad.  That is why i quit there."
good,"The managers there do not care about the employees they make you do other peoples jobs that are not on your job description, also they make the work place an uncomfortable place as well as not letting you go on your breaks when youre supposed to and not answering walkie talkies when needed too."
good,"A typical work day back in the Deli is not too bad unless we are short on staff (most of the time we are). The managment is actually pretty terrible. Nobody cares about our department and the day shift only makes our job harder because they leave their mess for us night shift people. The only enjoyable part of my job is most of my co-workers, they are very nice and funny people. It isn't the worst job out there but it can be a very nasty one."
good,"The job itself was fun, working in the Tire Lube Express was a good experience. I enjoy working on cars so specifically for me it was fun. The biggest issue for me is the way customers are handled. Sometimes I would get told some pretty nasty things, and I would take it to management and the customer would end up getting free products or services. Sometimes I would get nice customers but it felt rare to me. The negativity outshined the positives."
good,"Enjoyed the experience to work amongst different people from culture to view points, enjoyed taking different task from greeting to stocking, and was paid very well. The manager didn't seem to get most task done, with a lot of smoke breaks, they couldn't keep up with my personal schedule, I would at times be the only one outside while being rushed and pressured with little to no assistance"
good,"All based on my location:"
good,Started as an associate and quickly was moved into a supervisors role after a few months. Took on way too much responsibility for the pay I was given and was eventually turned off by the situation.
good,You can't place your views on a company by the manager that you report to. Overall the company is a good company to work for. I learned to always treat my people with respect.
good,"I really liked this job, and was sad to have to leave as suddenly as I did, but I just couldn't bare to go another day. The managers do not talk to you unless they need you for something in that moment, period. They will cut corners off hours so you're functionally working a full time week for only part time pay and benefits. They will not speak properly, as someone with a hard time hearing, I have no choice but to ignore them and hope it wasn't important, or ask again only for them to mumble even more out of annoyance. We never have enough workers. I've had staff promise me new machines and new help for months and months and months, which never came, of course. Our equipment is barely functional and breaks on a regular basis, each time it takes at least a week to get fixed. Even in the rare case equipment works alright, we don't have enough people to keep up with the needs of the store. This is not a problem of worker scarcity, they always get new people in when they really want to, and they have people to spare that attempted to help at times (though often they'd just get in the way because they had no training for my job). Even when we have enough people, no thought goes into our schedule. Traffic does not pick up until around 10 AM are our store every day, so with proper scheduling of 3 part timers working 5 days a week, we should *never* have to work an entire day with no help at any point. In fact, there was a point when there were only 2 of us, and for no reason in particular, they just weren't giving the other guy more than a few short shifts a week, meaning that I was"
good,Job has good days and Bad. Management doesn’t have a clue and there’s no Communication. Otherwise a decent place with fair pay wages. But could definitely work on it.
good,"A stressful work environment, consistently understaffed. Management expects the world without realistic means. Co-workers make the place enjoyable. The job is easy to do given the proper tools and staff"
good,"OK until I went out for Medi-Cal leave.  They didn't call to check on me and didn't tell, me about filing for Medi-Cal leave or disability. Had to find out about Medical leave from another employee and not management."
good,not understanding to the cost of living and it's like we hear you with all the outside things happening in your life but all they care about is sales and not about the lives that sacrifice to work for this place.
good,My manager was very rude. Her and I did not get along very well. And she helped spread gossip about me and another employee stating I was cheating on my husband with him. Very unkind behavior.
good,"Not much just something at the time I needed a job, it was hard work, little pay and very little time off. No benefits, management was good, and through a miss communication and cut hours I had to leave."
good,"8.65/ hour for a part-time"
good,I like it just too much stress and not enough money.the customers are rude to you when you are trying to stock.Management is not good with holding people accountable for their actions
good,Managers played favorites. Was hired as a Remodel Associate and never did any remodel jobs. Worked as overnight stock associate. Work was very easy. No real training though. Horrible point system that managers would only take points off from favorites. Had 3 points so I was sent to the worst possible store when remodel was completed. I quit the last store after only a week.
good,"Starting pay is not bad if you are young or just starting out. Coworkers are good, most customers are great. Management varies. Most management are not on the same page, therefore, you get mixed instructions. Benefits will be excellent if or when you make full time."
good,Good place to work with friendly co workers. Management is somewhat unorganized and can lead to stressful situations at times. But overall a good place to work and build relationships
good,"I didnt receive my mandatory breaks, i was called randomly to work very long hours on my days off. There was a lot of drama. The mangement was not put together very well."
good,Very busy store with different kinds of people. Some workers hide in the bathroom to not work and also people were all over the place . Lots of anger customer from the lines being so long .
good,"Walmart advertises on their BLACK FRIDAY, certain items very reduced in price, but they do not tell the public there may only be a couple or so of the items available. Also, your work hours change about every week, which makes it hard to plan your personal life.I went home sick one day about half way through my work day, and got 1/2 a point because I got sick at work about half way through my work day, That didn't make sense to me, but their reason was, Walmart has to have a 0 tolerance policy with their employees. The 1 1/2 yrs I was with Walmart, I worked every weekin day the whole ti,e I was employeed with them except a day I asked off about a week earlier, in which the manager said I could have time off for my family reunion, but I was expected to come to work right after the reunion was over that day>"
good,"The busier the location that you work at is, the more overwhelming your job will be. In high traffic stores, it is impossible to keep up with everything and also keep the shelves neat. Highly recommend working at a not so busy store."
good,"Walmarts culture has taken a plummet in the past 5 years. The instability of job security has become the key ""leaving"" point for many associates.  Many feel unappreciated and the Walmart family is no longer evident."
good,You do not receive consistent hours to work and hard to get benefits. The management is not the best of help. There are a lot of people not doing their job as they should.
good,I really didn't care working for Walmart. The hours and atmosphere weren't the best for me. There overall feel to the place was that Walmart can beat Amazon.
good,Customer friendly enjoyed working with other people and helping customers store and upper management did not aide in training and daily operations of store enough. Too much favortism
good,I loved what I did as a cashier and customer service representative but most of the customers were absolutely horrible. They were very disrespectful and rude. Walmart management was not very kind and considerate. They never cared to know me and did not work well with my school schedule.
good,Massbuild was an amazing experience and I learned a lot of things some of the skills I have today came from them.I won't lie they have a lot of work and it's a fast pace place.
good,"I made several friends with my coworkers, but management itself was harsh. They were strict about how much you needed to get done in a short period - which for me meant sorting through 8 carts topped with toy returns, organizing shelves, cleaning and sometimes helping customers at pickup - even though that department was closed. I knew nearly every department yet I was not offered other positions or higher pay for performing various jobs. I also worked as a customer service associate and was underpaid."
good,"They don’t have flexible schedules, and you usually won’t get time off when you need it. Also for sick days there is no compensation instead you just have to to rely on a computer instead of the actual managers"
good,"For many people looking for a job where you dont need education but still get paid well, this is a good job. But the more you advance the more you stress and spend less time with family. They expect a lot out of you and the holidays is the time you put lots and lots of hours."
good,"Walmart is a very hard job. If you have a question you can ask your supervisor, they will not give you an answer. They will tell your department head, and he or she will tell you later."
good,The main aim to provide good service. The management of the store is not satisfactory. There is a lack of system in the higher level of management. Sometimes as a department Manager we have to face so many problems which should not happen.
good,Good part time employment for entering or reentering job market. Great orientation program. Very welcoming to new employees. Hopeful start lose energy once through orientation
good,"I can honestly say that each store is different. My first store was well managed and part of the community (as it was one of the few department stores in the county) and I feel the atmosphere was very acceptable. In that place the newer wages definitely helped cover the cost of living in that place, but in my new city it is not nearly enough. Management in this larger city does not care as much for their associates, the wages don't cover the difference in cost of living, and the stress is ridiculous. The worst part of all of it is that there doesn't seem to be much more coverage in this store despite the much larger traffic flow of customers. Add the flow to the poor management and I can't imagine any worker builds strong loyalty to the stores here. Back home I would have stayed late, taken extra shifts, done what I could to get our store where it needed to be. For all of us we needed to succeed. Here? No loyalty gained in six months. It makes me miss home and drives my desire to work for a company I can get behind."
good,"It's only good when you have good hours, or have a good reputation working up under Walmart. Hours go up and down depending on the time of month, during holidays, etc."
good,"didnt get much chance to stop, but i liked it that way."
good,"It was fair in the beginning but as the seasons change and the managers shifted the culture changed and work became high pressure for a low reward. If you like serving customers it should be a fair job, it's main struggle is if your managers treat you unfairly."
good,"When I walked in for an interview, it took the managers 45 minutes to decide on who was going to interview me. This painted a very vivid picture of my future time at Walmart. The most difficult part of the day was getting up at 3 am for a 4 am shift. Your first 4 hours are going to be down stacking pallets (5-9) and placing items on the shelf (yes, this is every day). The next 4 hours of your shift are focused on pulling items out of the back and onto the sales floor. This is a simple job to do but doesn't challenge you to do more as they don't promote good employees at my location. I was never taught by my managers how to do anything and most of it came from a kind coworker. On top of this, the managers were hardly ever around and were somewhat passive when they were. One manager in particular ridiculed me in front of my coworkers for getting a 350 lb. pallet stuck in a hole in the backroom floor. This was not meant as a friendly taunt as the culture would have you believe, however. The only enjoyable part of the job was that everyone was given an hour lunch. I did not enjoy my time at Walmart and I guess it just wasn't meant for me."
good,"Was a great job for a student. "
good,"My manager was not flexible with my hours. Even when saying I needed time off for school, she did not give me that time off and said she didn’t need me. You are also scolded if you get an injury."
good,The problem in Walmart is the micro managing other than that the environment was great to work.Also it is an issue that the store manager is very rude and talk down to you
good,The overnight hours are good for people with school children. I enjoyed working overnights because it was easier to to get the stocking done. Not as busy. I loved stocking the shelves and zoning them
good,"Stocking and unloading pallets usually or sometimes unloading a 2,000+ truck. Usually not very detailed on what to do. Training is very easy just sitting on a computer."
good,I loved the people I worked with but the amount we get paid is not enough for the amount to f things we do and deal with. If we wanted more hours we couldnt.
good,"Seasonal job, I received training only 2 weeks for cashier training was poor since all the cashiers did not want to train. I had to talk with the manager to move me to another area at the floral dept."
good,DO NOT WORK HERE. Management do not act appropriatly toward their staff. Time off requests are never granted unlesss you have worked there for a long period of time.
good,good job to get if you can handle coworkers begin rude....managment doesnt care....i have learned alot....they did give me a chance at a store...i appreciate that...but your coworkers there cuss and scream at other employees....behind their so called cameras...they managament dosent see this they only see what they want..then into your shift your busting butt while other coworkers on on their cell phones during working hours.....alot of stress for sure....
good,"Slow paced management is ok could be better, some what stressful but it’s an ok place to work . I worked there for 4 years as an electronic associate, there was good and bad."
good,"I was hired early (Temporary) and was full time. it was good, I had a great mentor but everyone there but very confusing managers didn't tell you anything and expected you to know everything."
good,well my job was not hard any thing managers want to get done they call on me they get it done right away or I will let he or she know am taking care of a tasks now as soon as I finish I will take care of it
good,We had four people on CAP 2 every day we were so understaffed. One person threw boxes on line and then one person on each side of the belt stacking onto pallets and then I was the last person which would do breakpacks. We took our lunch late because they made us finish unloading the truck before we could eat or take our breaks.
good,"Everyone has problems with Wal-Mart. Communication is usually poor in the store, not everyone is easily gotten along with. Hours are never consistent, depending on where you were work getting more than 18 hours a week is difficult. Getting full time is like pulling teeth."
good,it was a fast pace environment had to move unload the trucks the were full of freight then need to be placed on the shelf in the correct at thee same time being timed on how fast you need to put the idddems out highly under paid for the job
good,"Working in Walmart was stressful due to lack of communication with management, lack or raises, and poor social structure. Too much of job advancement had to do with who you were friends with in management."
good,Lots of good people fast pace work. Learned many things and also taught me to be mlre organized and on time. I was exposed to all sorts of cars and car issues.
good,Walmart is a stressful place. Employees get very few hours. They don't really care about the associates anymore. The bottom line is all that matters. They pay pretty good but you really don't get enough hours to make it on.
good,All thru out the training video talked about team work customer service. But once I got on the floor management didn't seem to care about any of that.
good,Well my Store Manager said he approved for me and my daughter's transfer was approved before we moved back to Texas. Found out that was a lie. Some CSMs would like to bully their cashiers.
good,Really have to be great with people and keep your peace. Management sometimes had their favorites. Have to keep yourself occupied at all times. I've learned to be a fast paced worker.
good,"el trabajo es bueno, pero el tiempo ke tengo ya en la empresa no he tenido el crecimiento monetario"
good,"Every day, I would review with my co-workers on how the work day has been. I usually had afternoon/evening shifts and liked to know how busy or slow the day has been. I would restock the shelves and displays and ring up customers. Depending on the day, I would assist my co-workers with helping customers if we were busy or get to clean my department thoroughly if the department was slow."
good,"I enjoyed doing ;my job and took pride in my position but a lot of the employees were not team oriented and no goals just unhappy with there job and majority managers were snobby and not real friendly but when I went to overnight position we had a good team and it was fun but every 6 mths they change managers and each manager had there own way of doing tasks and it would disrupt our team it is very important to have good friendly and appreciative managers and not negativity it is not good for moral so that was the downfall we had a great overnight manager for 2 yrs he was great then when managers changed they were selective on who did what tasks and just upset our team and the moral was not as happy and did not perform as well you just need team players and incentive and praise and respect for the associates you will see the difference in work performance but you just do your job the best you can and get through the shift, and just ignore the negativity going around you and focus on positive."
good,Okay pay. Great to help with customer relations skills. Management is bad. Work load large for time frame it's expected to be done in most of the time.
good,"working here can be both enjoyable(working w/customers) and challenging(working w/management)"
good,"A typical day at work would be walking around the store and watching for unusual activities from customers as far as concealing merchandise  in bag or under clothing. After seeing so, then you would continuously watch them thought out the store and as the passed all points of sale. You would then stop them and confront them about the situation. Bring them into the office and get information about the, call the local law enforcement to process them."
good,"I have worked at two Walmarts in my three years and both have varied in my day-to-day satisfaction which relies heavily on my management team. They are what influences the culture and overall environment for the employees. On that note, my market is notorious for people being friendly with higher-ups in unprofessional ways. My area could very easily be an outlier, but it's also fairly easy to whisper in someone's ear. In short: high school. I would say this is the hardest part of the job."
good,"Scheduled hours for next pay period were totally inconsistent with my availability, which I gave the hiring officer during our interview.   Everyone was very nice, but all were too busy cashiering to really interact, or help the new employees."
good,I ran into countless problems and issues being a greeter at walmart. I also was treated with no respect whatsoever. Every manager was telling me to do something different than what i was previously told. I was coached 3 times with no actual error made on my part. The work culture was very negative and people would complain about there job frequently. The Loss Prevention team would tell me to stop people at the door and act as security before they apprehend them. All of this is no lie and i was fired after putting a two-week notice in very unprofessionally.
good,"I think Walmart is an excellent place to start out your career if you are young, however it doenst offer enough benefits for one to be able to surpase and rise with in the comapany and ones career itself."
good,"Lots of variety with tasks, but not much compensation or feeling of caring from company management. Better to stay hourly than be salaried. Salaried management get the most put on them for least amount of compensation."
good,"Do not work for Walmart. At least not the Cap 2 team, the management is terrible and they treat you like you’re in jail. I do not recommend this job at all"
good,from 1989 to about 2000 the job was awesome but after that they started not really caring about the workers...they capped pay for jobs..gave very few hours to cut cost and cut full time positions
good,It was not a cohesive invorement for working. Felt like I was in high school all over again .ranging from management to associates.i would not recommend
good,If you're a laid back worker with a good mental stature you will do rather well. If you get your feathers ruffled by drama and wrong doings of management then stray away. The harder you work the worse the managers look because they don't like to work. So if you work hard you will be singled out as a outcast. This job felt like high school all over drama and rumors everyday.
good,"Working as a cashier wasn't difficult work by any means whatsoever, however, roughly 70% of customers were rude and vengeful no matter how fast and well you did your job. Management wasn't helpful at all to the cashiers, the CSM's (customer service manager) rarely brought the necessary change refills, and when they did, it would take what seemed like a lifetime."
good,"Out of this world expectations for low pay. Managers will stand around and talk for hours, then take a break from talking with each other to sit outside and talk more."
good,"did not mind working there. It is more work than most people think it is. Some people can get away with slacking off, I never had time to slack off. Someone had to do the work."
good,"Its not a bad job. It has it's up and downs. The hours are good. Every day you clock in and headed to start up for a meeting to let you know what's going on, safety tip, if something has changed or happened that we must know."
good,I worked as an assistant manager. They expected me to stay over up to 6 hours after my shift ended to work n other projects. This was problematic after being on third shift for years and having young children. Wal-Mart is not great to external hires. They have higher expectations for them without giving them the knowledge of a seasoned associate on equipment and policy issues.
good,"The hardest part about working at Walmart is the disorganization. There are procedures set in place to keep things organized and to keep things going smoothly but in order to do that, the management must take use of those procedures and enforce them and be prompt when doing so."
good,Work was fine. Management poor. Too many supervisors and managers and they all wanted to have everything done a different way.  You would be moved from one department to the next continuously and not be able to learn each department but yet ypu were expected to be flexible.
good,"Tasks given by a manager often come with an expectation of each step and how to take it, but is often not communicated, resulting in negative feedback regardless of completion."
good,"Job was fine when I would work in other departments. However, running registers up front can be extremely stressful especially because they cut their cashiers hours and only staff the bare minimum every day. That doesn't include the call offs which happened daily and left the front end registers massively understaffed. Customers complain to you for waiting in long lines when they should just call corporate and complain because that's the only way it will ever change. Wasn't a very friendly and welcoming staff, some were most were just cranky all the time. CSM's were lazy and got mad if they had to do their job. Expect to be told to do one thing by your department manager and then yelled at by another manager for not doing it their way."
good,"Walmart is a give or take job. Promises made but not fulfilled. Walmart gives their employees a good chance of keeping their job after constantly calling off, and being late. They will terminate you. They will give you a chance to redeem yourself."
good,A lot of the employees were nice. Tough training. The management was not very considerate and accommodating. The pay was nice and the discount you got did come in handy
good,"Walmart is a job where you know you will make decent money, given you get the full-time positions, and will be paid fairly. It is a very high stress and fast-paced job that can include some overtime for those who want the opportunity."
good,"Not a good place to be if you don't have friends or relatives working there. I found myself being surrounded with not friendly coworkers who only wanted to take from me, not to give."
good,"Cul-ture and work enviroment varies store to store, stay in school if stuck in small town to avoid this being your future career.             written by a past emplopyee of the walmart"
good,"I recommend anyone to apply to Walmart very good benefits and offers flexibility in schedules. Paid and unpaid breaks, discounts, insurance on health and vison"
good,"Management was always the bad thing . The work environment was fairly okay . But management could have been ALOT better . The pay was good , but It would be nice to get paid every week ."
good,"Wal-Mart is becoming a hard company to get into being that it requires all employees to be available at all times. It's not a bad job to have once your there. It's a typical retail experience, however, its not easy to work around tight availability."
good,"Walmart isn’t a bad company to work for depending on your location. If you don’t work in the suburbs then expect the worst even as an employee, but working in the suburbs is quite a hassle due to distance. It’s kind of a lose lose situation. Also they won’t hire you unless you’re “available” 24/7 so once you’re hired the scheduling is ridiculous. I could get off at 1am and they’ll have me on the schedule to come in again that SAME morning, not good for anyone with children. Good luck."
good,"The possibilities within Walmart are pretty good, buy limited. I was put in SCO, and later offered Sporting Goods, which has higher pay. I trained for Sporting Goods, and worked in the department for about 2 months before they outsourced the job. They wanted me to cover the department when they needed someone, which was often, without the pay bonus. They lied to me about giving me the job and raise and expected me to do the job for less money."
good,"Cashing out customers , greeting your customer. Learned how to count change back to customers. Work place culture was fast paced no real time to get to know your customers . Hardest part of the job was rude customers . Most enjoyable part of the job was the bonuses that were given ."
good,Was a good place to work but it’s hard to move positions and get full time and if you don’t have full time or work so many hours benefits aren’t available to you
good,You'll enjoy working there but your supervisors will drive you to look for another job. It's emotionally and physically draining how they constantly just use you. Nothing is ever good enough for them and you are constantly reminded how replaceable you are. They say they are family oriented but after a miscarriage you get two days of grieve and back to work or you lose your job.
good,"Low pay, no benefits until a year of employment with them, scheduling ALL OVER THE PLACE, nothing regular or close to regular (retail hours...) training was good, management scheduled me to work when I was not available to work and had no consideration to help assist me with the situation, most employees are on public assistance.  Perhaps I am being harsh.  I would have kept the job and not left if management would have worked with me on scheduling.  You might like it here.  Everyone is different."
good,Walmart is a well known company with locations all over the world. There are many positions available and the pay is pretty good compared to industry standards but be ready to work long hours.
good,"Typically, we were ALWAYS short-staffed and or people would call out and management would not bother to help out."
good,At first Iiked working at walmar but then it was starting to change and it got very stressful
good,"Clocked in, had daily meeting with coworkers and management to discuss task for the night, did my job, clocked out. "
good,a typical day at work is when you don't have customers you red line to get customers. I learned to keep my mouth shut when getting yelled at for no reason by CSM's.  Zone the isles you are in..  The hardest part of the job is getting your break and lunches on time.
good,Management is complete cramp they never are on the same page with anything. They never check schedules to make sure there is coverage in the area you work in. They say they have many opportunities to move up in the company but if you are too good at the job originally given they’ll never let you leave that department. There is a point system you can’t call off more than 8 times in a 6 month period which isn’t bad at all but they claim to terminate you if you pass it but they keep certain associates. I’m my opinion isn’t fair because they always seem to save the bad works and get rid of the good. I was let go but knew of other people who maxed the points out by four or more and where kept. They switch your assistant manager every few months and mine happened to be a manger who didn’t like me so I got terminated quick. He said”I rather struggle than have someone who calls off” doesn’t make sense because  in the bakery/ deli you need 5-6 people at all times but never would hire anyone so there were four of us now only three.
good,Walmart is the largest retail chain in America.  There are many opportunities if you work hard and are flexible with where you live. This is a good employer for those looking for a first job.
good,the associates are mostly nice and friendly the management team is a different story some would help you and talk to you if you had any issues but mostly they sucked with helping you advance in your career with them
good,Depending on your supervisors and the culture in the store will determine whether or not it is a decent working environment. Most Walmart employers are disgruntled workers.
good,sometimes a great place to work but stressful at times. management needs to get on same page cause one will tell you one thing and other will tell you to do it different. but overall i do what told by my manger and the way it suppose to be done.
good,They didn't train me very well. The management was polite and almost always very helpful. I enjoyed my coworkers and managers. I would work there again.
good,"Throughout my time at this company, I have noticed that the managment there shows favoritism and retaliates against the workers they do not like. For example, if you speak to your direct manager and they do not provide you with the help you need, and you go above them they will intentionally sabotage your work experience. Although, this may be true for the majority other members of management, not all are like this. Some members of management actually want to see you succeed, even if you go against them and go above their heads. Not all management is willing to work with you, some are very negative and act as if they have a ""god complex""."
good,genuinely loved my job. I worked on the floor helping customers and doing many other things at the same time such as on line order safety sweeps and cash. It was a lot but also took a lot from it.
good,"There were benefits that made the difficulties of the job easier to withstand. And there was a collaborative effort to succeed, which I greatly appreciated. They set you up for success: training was optimal."
good,a typical day at work. learned nothing. management wasn't at all helpful. culture wasn't very steady. dealing with rude employers. waking up for the job. going home after the clocking out part.
good,Inconsistent schedule not getting the hours promised supposed to be full time and not sure what they consider to be full time. My hours very frequently
good,"Honestly, the only reason to take a Walmart position in North Windham is for money's sake alone. They pay on time, but that's about where the benefits end. Rampant favoritism, disregard for corporate policy, and a a promotion structure that requires you to be among the favoured few to rise. Even then they might just discontinue your position on a moments notice giving you little time to find a position that maintains the same pay. That or take a pay cut."
good,"My review of this company is it had great benefits, and it was well paying for a high school student, like myself, yet the management was disrespectful towards all employees."
good,While working for Walmart there are times there are times of being understaffed and forced to still work as if there are people there. Management is too caught up to help at times and you just need to make a decision instead of asking
good,"Company is definitely focused on bringing the most products at the best prices to its customers."
good,"Pays very well, very strict. Some managers are decent. Most do not care about you. A lot of people will screw you over so watch your back. Very heavy labor. Plus side is you get the right job and the right shift it can be a dream job."
good,Hours could be set that are flexible for College courses. Can move up when positions are available. Time off was not to hard to get. Managers were pretty good at handling business.
good,Working at Walmart was pretty cool for the most part. I liked that we were able to get discounts with our discount card and I liked the coworkers that I worked it. I think the downfall of every company is the lack of management and communication from store managers. There was really no point in talking to the store manager because nothing was going to get done.
good,"Walmart is a great job opportunity for someone who is looking for a job in college or first time worker in high school but as an adult looking for full time, it isn’t the place for you. Always busy it’s non stop competitive work and customers could be rude throughout your shift."
good,"Very poor management. Too much favoritism. You make sure u work hard to do your area by the time it's time to clock out, they pull u off as soon as your done to go do another area where others aren't doing their job."
good,"You were timed and if you didn't complete this task in a certain time frame you were written up, but they are a ""team"" based company. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. The management was very lazy and abused their power. The hardest part of the job is completing certain task in a certain time frame that seemed impossible alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we actually worked as a team which was very rarely."
good,Walmart is like any otuer grocery store they need peole because nobody wants to put boxes up for a living and the few they have that are worth their weight deserve a better work place and paycheck
good,they say there flexible but not really. it's a big store there shouldn't such an issue to give the hours requested. they always need help. a lot of departments are under staffed
good,They work you really hard but you don't get paid good enough you can't be sick you can't sit down if you start to hurt you can never get a csm to even cover you for the bathroom
good,"You get new managers they come and go all the time, so it’s always change .. some days are ok and some days were stressful , and  of course with retail it gets really busy around the holidays ,  sometimes you get overtime for most of the time you don’t"
good,"Acceptable company to work for, but sacrifices will be made. Scheduling could be better considering the typical employee."
good,"Hard manual labor, employees should make more than their paid hourly especially forklift operators! Very stressful and grueling hours.Work culture is similar to an High School."
good,Part time only does not give anyone enough total hours worked for each week anyone works for a two week pay period some things an associate is asked to
good,Wal-Mart is a fast paced work environment. The management lacks necessary skills to deal with stress and being overworked. The environment is competitive and cutthroat.
good,"Being Walmart, it is not really meant to be a career; rather, a stepping stone. If you really wanted to, you do have the option to work your way up into management and beyond after years as an associate, but that wasn't my intention. Co workers in electronics were phenomenal, and I am still good friend with some almost 2 years after quitting to pursue other options. Management really depends on which manager is over your portion of the store. My first manager was awesome and she kept things running great, but after a switch, my second manager was pretty sloppy and he let our departments fall apart. Pay was $10 to start, but has since been raised to 11 or 12. Not bad for people who just need a short term job, but I advise against trying to make a career out of it unless retail management is your calling."
good,They want you to be like Walmart is life. They don’t care about emergencies or sickness it will still count against you. They hire just about anyone and make their favorites the CTA/dept manager.
good,"In my experience, people were expected to do far more than they should have been because the company failed to hire enough employees to properly staff the shifts. Many times the day employees failed to get their required work completed and the task ended up being added to the night employees who already had more than their share to do because of poor ordering by the managers of the departments. While I was there they implemented a few different systems to solve the problems, but as far as I see they are still having the same problems."
good,"I come and clock in and, whether I am a cashier or self-checkout host, I find a CSM and ask them what they want me to do. I like working at Walmart, but management at the store I'm at is horrible. They really don't know how to run the place. That is the hardest part about working at Walmart, the management. I think the best part about the job is my fellow cashier associates."
good,A typical workday is somewhat frustrating at times. I've just learned to mind my own business & try to stay positive no matter what. Management is not up to par as far as talking to associates with respect. The workplace culture is fine never had any issues with that. Hardest part of the job is trying to stay positive with all of the negative energy around. The part of this job I most enjoy is the hour long break.
good,"manager push too much and expectations are higher than average. Can be let go just like that with no care for financial security. A very negative culture,"
good,Working at Walmart wasn't the best but it was a job. They had very poor management skills which made it hard for our staff to do our job. overnight the store was only busy during up coming holidays. the hardest part about my job was not quitting even tho I wanted to everyday I came in. the most enjoyable part was receiving my direct deposit.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart."
good,"a typical day at walmart included working on about 20+ cars for oil and tires. you learned how to change oil and tires on a car pretty quick. management at walmart isnt the best, they tend to not show up when you call them to come approve a lube audit or if you have questions."
good,"When I worked at Walmart, it was typically the same thing every day. There was no real variety to my tasks every day. For some, it may have been comforting to do the same thing each day, but for me it was menial. I felt depressed in the position, where I was stuck behind a cashier desk with limited interaction to my other coworkers."
good,"There is a lot going on at wal-mart all the time. The company I believe made a personal decision to cut back on its work hours, but that was never a problem for me as I received 40hr weeks every week. CAP 2 process was difficult and the managing staff never really helped unload the trucks, even the training for new people was pretty poor by them. The un-loaders had to train alot of new people but the unloaders were never trained well themselves. "
good,"not so fun and enjoyable. people are clicky and treatment is not always fair. expect to be unappreciated, over worked, rushed, pulled to other areas and overlooked."
good,Can move up easily. Nice to be able to transfer if need be. Pay isn't bad. Training is not the best and short on tools to complete the job at hand .Communication is poor between Management .
good,customer relations job was terrible. customers were rude disrespectful .  the work enviroment was poor management employee relations was poor and the pay was not enough for cost of living
good,Was ok at first but store manager is always hateful and treats people like a trash. At first it was a fun place to work but as time went by we just had to keep hiring new employees because of the management team and no one wanted to work for them.
good,"The work is not hard, but this company will work you into the ground. They expect so much, but don't say thank you, or seem appreciative. No matter how much you've accomplished, they always find something to complain about."
good,They don't take into consideration scheduling and school life at all. There was always something wrong never enough help always a conflict with customers managers were disrespectful.
good,"Walmart isn't a bad place to work depending on your management team."
good,"Typical day as a manager is to  oversee general operations of the store associates, programs, finances and human resources department. I learned to organize time, preform multiple tasks at a time to ensure meeting deadlines. I learned to supervise 100 or more associates at a time to include making schedules of those associates. Pros were the pay and the benefits and the learning experience and managerial skills acquired through on the job training. Cons include work life balance and overtime. The management scheduling was grueling and provided no off time as well as no overtime when working 70 or more hours a week most weeks."
good,A place where there is low morale amongst the workers and management push you to work harder and you're not getting paid a lot of money . co workers just feel that they don't want do do but so much work because of the low pay .
good,"my store manager is awesome, some of the assitant managers are different but overall its not a bad company to work for event though we got a dollar raise in my department i personaly feel like deserve more."
good,"While my store managers at Wal Mart were always great, the Co Managers were always some sort of primadonna who thought they were Gods gift to retail and usually didn't have a clue. Ended up nearly needing therapy before finally realizing it was them causing my issues."
good,The typical work day includes ensuring customer service on the Front End is running properly to keep the customer happy.  I have to ensure the unload staff complete the stocking of the Grocery truck. Last I run the overnight shift ensuring the General Merchandise truck is stocked.
good,"Decent job, not to hard. Poor management, managers do not care about employees, and do nothing to fix problems leading to a toxic work environment.  Would rather hire new employees than keep current."
good,I'm  glad Walmart  hired me. I love my job but don't like the way they us. When u give them 100 percent  they want 130 with no extra pay.  When there's  work to  do they run you off the clock.. there's only one off day which is Christmas
good,Great place to work if you do not have school.But as a student I do not recommend you to search for a job at Walmart they will convince you that they care about student and that the will work with your school schedule .Do not believe them.
good,Unfortunately I would have to say the luster was all in the leading up to the position and not in the experience. The training was fantastic however the actual job was not inline with the training at all. Moreover the lack of professionalism was rampant among the staff.
good,They work you and work you and barely compensate with your needs. You’re just there to work and leave and if you get lucky after 6 months or a year you’ll get 15cents for a raise.
good,- Great place to kick off ones Asset Protection career. I would not limit yourself to Wal-Mart. Always be looking for a better opportunity somewhere you can make a greater impact and your work will be appreciated.
good,Working there you don’t have a set schedule and you have to have open availability to get hours. Not every Walmart is the same so I can’t speak for all but after a year and so working there it wasn’t for me!
good,The Walmart I work at does not follow the rule book do whatever they want help whoever they want don't care if its a life or death situation still have to come to work and very unorganized
good,It is an okay job if you want a place holder in life but nothing to hold on to. If you want to climb the corporate ladder be prepared to never have the ability to say or suggest anything that goes against whoever is in charge of you no matter how little they actually know of the job.
good,I have no comment. Some stores are good and some are horrible to work in. They seem to overlook the people that should not be with the company and do not help the ones that deserve to move up in the company. The teaching and training in some stores do not exist . Some are more about  running their store as if it was there own private business... So investigate the store you go to...
good,Its not uncommon for people to be fired just to be hired again in 90 days. Many times management will want you to stay late but they don't want overtime so they will want you to take a longer lunch the next day.
good,Very fast paced and very productive work environment I learned how to handle very large amounts of money while working at the money center the hardest part of the job was that i rarely if ever had a break on time
good,"Also known as sales workers or salespersons, sales associates sell retail products and goods, such as equipment, clothes, cars or car parts, etc. Sales associates work with customers to find what they want, ensure a smooth sales process and process transactions."
good,overnight stocker is not for faint of heart. its hard work. would have helped a lot if people at front would have put return items in correct department basket instead of mixing items.
good,Too much expected of one person not enough staff because people were always calling in sick and the employee turnover rate was extremely high I did make some wonderful friends and sometimes the job was fun but overall it wasn't worth the work you have to produce
good,I didn't feel appreciated when I worked there I felt like just a worker and not part of a family but even with that being said I was a hard worker I had to stop working because of a pregnancy loss of one of my twins and stayed home ever since.
good,"We were all told they needed a team to do inventory throughout the entine. Once we started, we were only a stock team for groceries. We were all lied to from the management team. I had a inner infection, and was taken off the cap team for a few weeks. I was told to either take leave of absence for 90 days, or be a cashier for 90 days. I took the cashier. They dropped me from 38 hours a week to 10 hours a week."
good,Walmart was a great starter job with the ability to get people started in the work place. I would not reccommend it as a long term career.  Walmart is unfair to their associates by giving speacial benifits to some and not others. They are not Firm Fair and Consistent like their motto says.
good,I like my job at Walmart but the management was poor and unorganized. I was always running out of product I enjoyed working with public . I liked the co-workers it was a time to build on skills
good,"Understand that going in what you will be paid is going to depend on exactly which job you're doing. Cashiers are paid well above market value but have uncertain hours, while a Tire and Lube Tech will quickly earn full time if they demonstrate they're reliable but pay will be well below market value. You will be frequently asked to step out of your lane to do other things because corporate caps hours and puts pressure on the managers to do more with less."
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me. I worked here while I was at school and they worked me every weekend. I never really had a chance to go home unless I requested it off. I will say that when I had a family emergency, the manager worked with me and gave me the whole weekend off when my dad was in the hospital. Managers are really understanding if you are honest with them."
good,"Place makes me chain smoke. Between customers and the workers, man im suprised im not in jail.. If u really need money go ahead and work there, othwrwise keep looking."
good,They aren't fair on their attendance policy. Certain people can miss as many days as they want and the Managers will approve their days off. As others are dinged for days off and tardy/leaving early.
good,"Wal-Mart was an amazing experience. Truly enjoyed working at walmart. Managing team and all staff were super friendly. Training was done very well. Very face paced environment, however very easy to grasp on to."
good,good job . keeps bills paid. management poor. i havent been working long just about 2 months and i need a new job already. cool place but staff is childish and goof around a little too much. unprofessional management team.
good,"The job itself and what it included is really not that hard and simple and easy to perform. But the supervisor and direct management have no clue what they are doing.  There is lack of communication between department managers, supervisors, hourly management and salaried management."
good,Since my time at Walmart I wouldn't go back to it. They have changed their policies so much that you may or may not see much in the way of hours and the ability to have any kind of work life will look small to you.
good,"This job is great for kids right out of high school. Not for a person who is use to making a lot more money than what Walmart pays. The morale is very low, management doesn't treat the employees fairly. The attendance policy is ridiculous. They do not accept doctor notes."
good,i had to stock shelves everyday i learned that everything have to be stock neat front and center hardest part was stocking the pet aile they keep the store pretty neat
good,"It is a busy place,some days are good and some are bad.Sometimes we are understaffed and too much work and then you have to do multiple jobs. But overall i have learned a lot from working for this company."
good,Good place to work they will not pay over time they dont really train you but the people are nice just the managers dont want to do there job if you run out of change it might take 10-15 mins to get any.
good,"While the corporate policies are very appealing the management culture is focused on personal glory, in other words the salaried management team looks for ways to make themselves look good to higher management often at the cost of hourly associates."
good,"While I worked at Walmart it was very fast paced, stressful and a little confusing for reasons I would only share with potential employers upon request."
good,An OK place to work full time but I was a temp an less was given plus no job security. Just take time out to review all other options before applying with a temporary agency for this job.
good,The managers suck the hours suck the way the csm run the front end is beyond unprofessional they laugh and joke and dance in front of customers some of them are disrespectful towards customers and just gossip on the daily its ridiculous i could go on overall the pay is pretty ok 11.00$ an hr for cashiers plus benefits you get pto i just hate the stupid point system
good,Work was good and the pay was not worth it . Management was not always on the same page. Employees became family and good team to work with but some managers were not so friend and thought they were above every one else.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced at the start of the shift and slowed down after lunch "
good,Walmart is the most flexible job ever. They allow you to set your own hours. Bonuses are nice. You can purchase stocks and get a discount card. The work load is manageable.
good,"It was a good job to start with, it helped me come up on a lot of different things like becoming independent, meeting new people, helping with money for my kids and even helped me buy the basic necessities such as a car. So i wouldn't say its such a bad job and i would honestly work there again. I loved to work with people helping them with their decision making and it helped me greatly with my social skills in general."
good,A typical work day was overall stressful. It never felt like there was enough employees present to help handle the daily tasks on a normal work day plus the extra work that the managers would pile on top of it.
good,"Management is not very good, messed up chain of command. Go to the deli its the highest paying sales associate job. Hardest part is dealing with management, who does not work with you."
good,"A typical day at work was busy, I've learned customer service working there. Management weren't always available, but when they were, it was worthwhile. Workplace culture was workable but it could've been better. The hardest part of the job was having to work in an area you weren't trained in, but being a fast learner I often enjoyed working in new areas. I liked learning new things and it paid off."
good,i loved the diversity of the job. no day was ever the same. Hours were very flexible and most of the pharmacists were willing to help when you needed it.
good,"I learned a lot from Wal-Mart on customer service. I learned about "
good,"Wal-Mart is not a Company that you should consider if you are looking for Advancement or Great Benefits in a reasonable time, and definitely not if you have to support a family. "
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if u like helping people and working in customer service. You have to have patience and a good attitude because sometimes u can get rude customers and u have to know how to deal with them in a cool, collective way. But other than that its like any other job."
good,"Working there for a year I loved my co-workers and the department I was in but as far as the facility itself I expected more. Even after working there for a year, I was barely getting hours and my schedule was never consistent."
good,"Although the compensation was suitable and the experience helpful toward my career goals, there was a notable issue with the work/life balance with Walmart.  I was promised 3 12-hour days and often found myself working 5-6 days, averaging 12-18 hours each."
good,"Expectations unreasonable with limited resources to achieve job performance. Liked providing excellent customer service. Company seems unappreciative of efforts to do whatever it takes. Low morale among associates. Too much pressure, understaffed."
good,I worked as a cashier first then went to customer service then money center then to the operator. The management was poor and not fair at all. I was off for a whole week at a time and then work maybe two days the following week.
good,It was ok to work there but stressful. The pay was bad and the benefits. I was in school in the daytime and working at night. They push you to get things done.
good,"I was a seasonal cashier and I enjoyed working in a fast paced environment. Cashiering was easy and I got to multi-task and learn new things about the job. My work hours were fixed each week and scheduling was okay. Management is quick to terminate anyone who is not having a good day and not able to keep up with the fast pace checking out as this was the case for me; no second chances given. There are too many cashier supervisors telling you different things on how to do your job and this can be confusing if you have no experience. Culture is unfriendly and poor management. Employees do not stay long on their job, no job security."
good,Enjoyed working with the public. The company did offer benefits for those who have worked with the company for a certain number of years. They also offer advancement programs.
good,"Busy days."
good,"Depending on the day, you would be either extremely busy or waiting around. You will end up doing work that was already done or you will be doing so much,  that you will be late for breaks, lunch and even leaving work. Management needs work. Such as better communication with employees, care and teamwork. This would greatly improve the attitudes of employees and in return, the customers experience. "
good,"Promised full time hours then they give you whatever they want, promise you job roles and have to many trainers and no consistency."
good,"Always more to do than can be readily accomplished within a realistic time frame. Overnight shifts are especially tough and create hardships on those who don't want to work overnights.  Rotation of one year at minimum, is too long."
good,"Trabalhos de segunda a segunda, dia da folga era escolhido pelo encarregado, somente em dias de semana. Salário baixo e promoções raras ou zero."
good,they push every day till you break and replace you the benifits were great and pay wasnt aweful but half the management had God complaxes and the rest were working to hard to be useful
good,"everybody that was working their was very nice and respectfull"
good,Honestly did not feel like management had a whole lot of respect for their staff. customers and co-workers were typically miserable too. it made it hard to work there and still be happy about having a job. the only good thing i have to say is that their training programs were very impressive.
good,"Very busy job where much is expected."
good,My manager was very controlling and not very understanding. I enjoyed some of the people. The hours I worked were horrible. The chances of me ever going to a day shift was not going to happen and I needed to be able to see my children.
good,"Working for walmart taught me two things, one people will treat you like trash and two look at your schedule consistently it changes every day. Management might like you today but not the next day. The hardest thing is realizing that both company and customers don't see you as human beings but something below them. The most enjoyable, being able to help a person. This is fast pace environment and targets need to be met so anxiety and stress will happen. If you can get past these things you can take on anything."
good,"Stay in good graces with management, they will move you up.   Expect to work almost every weekend and holidays.  Always check your schedule for changes."
good,"Fast paced, overly stressful environment, with no work life balance for salaried employees. Good people with quick turnover because of poor culture within company"
good,"working at walmart as a CSM was nice, but the managers that were over me wasn't very professional and wasn't organized.  working at walmart was pretty good and nice dealing with other employees that were willing to help when it was needed. I learned patience with working at walmart still need a little more work but it is getting better. the hardest part is when all the managers aren't at work and its just mainly you."
good,"I had been out of work for a long time since I quit college until a disabilities service found me this job at Walmart. They hired me almost immediately. My tenure as a maintenance associate at the smaller Neighborhood Market isn’t all that bad. Once I settled into a good routine I realized I had probably one of the least stressful positions there. Very little changes in routine, lessening actual challenges. Still, it takes a great deal of tolerance to stay for as long as I have. You really have to be a full-time associate to qualify for any benefits. While they offer plenty of chances for career advancement, observing your fellow managers in action makes advancement less appealing."
good,"This company was once a great company with plenty of room to advance and cared about its associates. Years later, the retail giant has continued to drive the business at the cost of its associates quality of life, in and out of the work place."
good,This job was easy but some nights their would be way too much work to do in one night but the managers expect their employees to be robots and finish quickly and efficiently in 8 hours.
good,"When I lived in a tiny town in Georgia, working at Walmart was amazing! Made amazing friends, and was even offered a place to move up within 4 months! But when I had to move to Arkansas (personal reasons/ family hardship) the managers disregarded my offered training and my extra training. Not to mention that the HR people tossed around my paperwork and made a lot of horrible excuses. These people treated me like garbage."
good,Una buena empresa con buenas prestaciones pero malos directivos
good,"Before opening day our team was ready to meet all of the requirements of getting ready for our customers.  Six months after store opening the team was dispersed. Some where terminated and others were given special treatment. I enjoyed my job at the money center no second chances for errors. Because Washington is an at will state, no job is secure."
good,learnt to make sure that management knows and explain job well. management is always right even if they do not know the job. when i did the job even thought i was not tough how to do it.
good,"Walmart was poorly managed, and often employees didn't know their job duties. Any confusion was frowned upon and there was a poor amount of training, and no hands on training."
good,There are so many old school people who refuse to change and allow change and refuse to listen to any new ideas on how to do something. They would rather blame the associates for everything instead of their outdated unproductive processes.
good,"Learned how to work with the cash registers and different people, management not very knowledgeable about their jobs and policies of the company. Management show favoritism."
good,"A fun place to work, however the pay is low and the hours are long training was minimal at best. Most employee had little to no customer service skills."
good,"Very stressful customers, management are very unprofessionally hired and definitely need to stop dating co-workers. Hardest part of the job is hearing all the bs gossip with employees and management."
good,you get paid okay.... I mean some of the bosses suck. the breaks are short. call off procedure sucks . NO OVERTIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but at leat it paid my bills
good,"The size of most Wal-Marts causes problems with the work environment. With how many departments there are, communication is hard. Managers would rarely communicate successfully between each other. If you are a newer part-time employee, you will usually be thrown back and forth between departments by managers to do menial jobs or cashier. I can't count how many times I was called over the intercom to do this or that within my first few months. Managers are extremely competitive at Wal-Mart, and will do anything it takes for their own area/department to be well maintained, even if that means causing problems or short-staffing the department you were hired for, which in the end just causes stress for more people. Customers are either very polite or entirely look down on you just for being a Wal-Mart associate. You also get very strange customers who do very strange things at times, which honestly adds to the fun. Co-workers either have a bad work ethic (due to Wal-Mart's hiring process, which is far from selective or thoughtful), or are hard-working and kind."
good,"honestly working at walmart sucked. the management was not very nice and they do not go based on your best interest. if i could, i would not return to a walmart store."
good,"Management when I was there was lacking. There was always a manager present, as in sitting in the office in back, but when a customer needed a manager we had to search for them, there was no way to reach out and get a manager without leaving my post."
good,Could receive a phone call at anytime where you would have to go into work.  Pay is good if you are willing to make the sacrifice to your family.  Must be very good at holding people accountible.
good,"Transferring to another store is usually pretty easy, I've worked at 3 different stores in the nearly 11 years I've been with Wal-Mart. They usually try to make it an easy adjustment when transferring from one store to another."
good,"My experience really showed me what Wal Mart was really like. They are quite frankly a dirty company when it comes to their workers. They seem to, at this location, pick their own favorites for management. It was not a fun place to work at all."
good,"I enjoyed the customer service experience and talking to customers each day while ringing up their items. I did not like the lack of experience and professionalism from most of the managers there. The culture was slightly negative. It seemed that nobody liked working there and made it hard to be enjoyable or exciting to show up to work. I wasn't doing work I was passionate about or learning new things each day so it got very mundane, very quick for me. Overall, I think it is a great entry level job and will give anyone great customer service experience and even more depending on the department one works in."
good,"Empresa , com poucos benefícios mas da chance de crescimento."
good,"Lack of communication,  lack integrity, racial profiling, overwhelming and unfair treatment from upper management. No hours beyond management. No respect for the individual."
good,The work was not worth the money. Long hours hard work but there was some good moments the workers are great. Can get repetitive. Management doesn't follow one best way as it should be
good,Overall good company to work for. Opportunity for advancement limited to region in which you work. Relocation is necessary with most promotions. Training and development is a good cornerstone to uphold the value of wal-mart employees.
good,"My store in general was not that bad which is really because of the customers not the company.  However is varied by department and which manager you had weather or not the work day was bearable.  People do not get promoted based on on clock work ethic so not much room for growth.  Management of most levels don't help fix problems until their management starts fussing at them for poor performance."
good,"This is a fast paced position with very little down time.  There is no such thing as being finished with the job.  All the employees seem overworked as well.  But for a retail position, there are benefits included.  There is a strong divide in management, with those willing to work and those wanting to avoid working."
good,Salaire non approprié pour la charge de travail accomplie
good,"A good place to start a job not to build a career , your constantly , helping other deparments , when there short handed , you go where the job wants you not just your department...."
good,"A typical day was making sales and helping customers, the only fun parts were talking with a select few customers and the other employees. The hardest part was making sure to keep the aisles clean."
good,if you have a family or kids this is probably not a place you want to work. If your kid falls and needs to go to the ER even with a doctors note you will get points and once you start getting points they make sure they can find anything possible to give you points for to fire you and get you out the door.
good,"Could have been a better job but management was extremely rude and required a heavy rule of expectations among all staff. Otherwise, the environment wasn't too bad and I was able to get stuff done."
good,"Attendance policy is not parent friendly. Once you hit 9 points your termed. No warnings, no flexibility, management won't even try to work with you. Any emergencies are not excused even if Police are involved. Wrecks/traffic/weather are not excused. Medical emergencies such as broken bones with your children are not excused. They go through a difficult 3rd party for LOA if you or a family member is critically ill for more than 4 days. If they do not approve you Walmart doesn't excuse it. Management favors and is poorly supervised. You won't go anywhere in advancement if you aren't favored no matter your performance level and experience."
good,"Prefer working for Walmart Corporate Home Office where the culture is strongest. Each department / area has it's good and bad points, just like any other company."
good,Although not a bad place to work still has certain things that make it almost impossible to deal with. The biggest thing that makes this place enjoyable is the people that work there.
good,It was a good job not enough to pay bills but it was a good help. There was just lack of communication throughout the managers which just caused the cofusion between Associate & supervisors.
good,Management seemed to not care when assistance was needed. Most days you wont be doing what the position you applied for entitled you to do but learning other positions is a fast way to advance
good,The job is easy enough and kinda fun or relaxing to do but management is what ruins the job for me. And they say your job is the most important but they don't pay you like it is.
good,"On overnights the CSM's wewe required to have the parking lot cleared of carts in the dark, by themselves,  no matter what the weather conditions.  Very disrespectful to their employee's, not offering to help get things done even if we were overloaded  and understaffed. We were expected to get everything done and without going over our scheduled hour. A VERY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT TO WORK IN, especially if you are a valuable employee, like I would rate myself and others.  I wll never work for this company again."
good,they promised me things that I didn't get and couldn't even take my doctors note from the hospital they just said I had no job if I couldn't come in although my daughter had an emergency.
good,Enjoy working at Walmart. But my hours are being cut even though I was made full time. And I don’t think they should be opened on major holidays. I feel family time is important.
good,Have to keep the place clean be customer friendly greet with a smile an always be persistent at all times. Make sur thestore stays organized for a great shopping expierience. Walmart bielives in second chances and the wages have went up sin e i was rhere they have done a lot more for there cuerent wmployees
good,"I enjoyed working with Walmart for sure even if it was part time.  I would like to continue doing the same hours as a Garden Centre Cashier for sure. I was promised to get my job back when I had to leave for my father's sudden surgery, to India.  Despite of having a return ticket within 10 days, I faced challenges getting my job back.  I am waiting and looking forward to get my same time and job back still.  Hope the wait is for not long any more."
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work but, I would not recommend anyone to spend the rest of their life there, unless they luck up and get a co manager or store manager position."
good,"Typical day at work started with a meeting. Upper management was hard on everybody. I did learn a lot about what looks good on paper. "
good,"The pay is good, the job itself isn't that bad, but the company can't keep anybody because management is awful. There's not enough supervisors to keep the shifts on the same page and there's not enough people on the shifts to get everything done, yet management still expects us to get tasks done in about an hour. They figure it should only take us a minute per box for stocking. That time doesn't allow for helping customers, cleaning spills, or fixing mistakes made by someone before you."
good,It a good place to work I just think I would like to learn different skills. I would like to take my knowledge that I have learned to a different trade. I have really enjoyed my time there in the years I have been there.
good,They give an unreasonable amount of time to finish up unloading the truck and when to finish our designated areas. The atmosphere is awful because of it.
good,"When I first started wal-mart was fun to work for. However over time a new store manager took over and started to delete positions and lowering the amount of workers in a given depatment. Leaving some departments either with just one worker or none to help customers. They no longer care about the customer and instead let customers wait for a long time in lines rather than spend the money to hire more people. The higher ups dictate how many workers they need based on sales of the previous year and smaller stores with lower volume, none of the higher ups have worked in the departments they cut people out of, but expevts one worker to do the job of five people and if they can't finish the work they get punished with coachings and terminations."
good,"While working in the Walmart community, I was able to learn a lot of things that would help me later on in a different work force such as customer assistance, material handling and different computer programs."
good,"I didn't mind working at Walmart, simple, straight forward work, most employees were nice, overall not too bad of a company to work for when you could use the work."
good,Managment is terrible they will pull you from your job to do something else but then turn right around and get mad at you for not doing the your job and when you try talking to management about your problems and or your opinion on things it's like it going in one ear and out the other. I have told management I wanted to learn more so I could move up and they said they would help me do so but never actually gave me the opportunity to even when I brought it up many times to management
good,"When I worked at the store that I started out, it was a nice place to work. When I transferred to another store and then I did not like it. The management was bias to the locals that she new and I could not advance or get any job that I wanted."
good,"great management experience provided; fast-paced and  lot of cross-training in the departments. Casual friendly environment, quick shopping after work"
good,Fellow associates made the job worth having. Co-Managers & Store Manager where unappreciative & unrealistic with their expectations of their management teams.
good,"Although the company is a giant and has changed to allow some individual expression, the truth is that they want all employees to wear the same stenciled face. As long as it is not outright theft, the managers will surrender to a customers complaint no matter  how ridiculous. Sometimes giving away entire services or products and will include a gift card for customer satisfaction. They do this because they can afford it, since the company now makes over 250 billion dollars a year.The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Always."
good,"It could have a lot of improvement, especially to how they treat their college and disabled employees. If your a college student I don’t recommend working here, it’s either school or your job here."
good,"The interactions with customers were an experience and tending to all their questions, the only downside would be how management or supervisors running things. We’d have yearly meetings on how to or what to improve in and around the store and it seemed like nothing ever got done."
good,"Managers didn't communicate with the managers from other shifts making it difficult for those that worked overlapping shifts. One manager would tell us one thing and halfway through our shift, we are told something totally different."
good,Lack of communication caused a lot of issues. Was very fast paced but had a lot of good things. Left because of time at home with kids. Different stores ran differently. Really liked working for different stores.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of me arriving and getting my till so my register was up and running. Open the register and accept customers, scanning their items and food. Regular breaks when applicable during a shift, close register and return unwanted items to costumer service."
good,"Working at Walmart no longer offers any more stability than working for a vendor.  Compensation is pretty nice and heavily focused on performance.  Current turmoil exists in getting a clear vision from the top makes it hard to know if you are doing what is expected.  Current struggle of power between Bentonville and California is tiring and creating a lot of busy work that keeps you from focusing on goals and things that you will be evaluated on.  Because of this and because of the culture shift, work/life balancing is also fading."
good,"Walmart builds a culture of paranoia with constant implications of being replaced if expectations aren't met. In the market in which I worked, the was still a Good old boy system in place for advancements ."
good,The pay was good but the work was back breaking.  Depending on the shift the managment quality goes from competent to terrible. The training process  is less then ideal.
good,"I worked overnights hired as a cashier. Ended up being a cashier, stocker, custodian, and sales associate. Not the biggest fan of the work. Most of the time, they would have me do the same busy work every night by organizing the same shelves. CSM's also never kept money in the drawers and when you sent them a notification, they would take upwards of 15 minutes to answer."
good,it was good to me i did not like the associates was treated i was able to advance in the company but in they area was a lot favoritism and who u knew when i got promoted there i did not know anybody higher than my store manager so that was against me at the time
good,Hard to advance or switch areas. Favorite plays a big roll in the work area. Lack or work in other employees. Customers are terrible. Pay is decent. Have to have tough skin to deal with it all
good,I worked at Walmart for experience in the retail and customer field. It was a good learning experience even though the working environment was not favorable.
good,"The management was bad, they are rude and don’t understand that you have a life out of work I have a child and I told them that but they didn’t understand. The put me down on paper as part time but work me as full time gave me one day off almost every 5 days and called me to come in on that one day I had to spend with my family."
good,It a ok place to work I enjoyed working with the people and helping customers they do need better management and insurance and need to be fulltime work not just part time
good,Helping customers to find what they needed and ringing up their orders was fun. Competitions held were not always fair. I enjoyed being helpful but everyone was kind of disconnected.
good,"They treated me fairly, when I did work there. Of course you get what you sign up for which is the occasional rude customers, standing 24/7, but overall it was alright, I wouldn't mind working there again."
good,"A day of work was simple, I would check what food was needed on the wall, I would go in the back and find what I need (using a hand computer), I would put the ""sell by"" stickers on everything going out, and I would stock everything. This was 90% of the work. I was usually closing so I would spend the last thirty minutes to an hour cleaning and sanitizing the back area."
good,Walmart is a good place to work for a first job. Wouldnt recommend for long term. Benefits are great but management isnt. No overtime and trys to force you to stay after its time to get off.
good,To many days in a row and only one day off in between for part time position.  Wish the company were more flexible with the work days and time off.  The more you do the more that is expected.
good,"I enjoy my usual customers, but do not like how I treated by my managers. I also do not approve the double standard they have. A usual day for me is being told to go random places. I am a cashier but I also have to do service desk, customer service manage and stock when there is nothing else they feel needs to be done."
good,"The actual work to do at Wal-Mart is quite easy, requiring only memorization rather than any sort of specialized training. However, the management and customers are consistently frustrating, and never mentally or emotionally rewarding."
good,"Walmart is great company if you do not progress into the Manager role and if you are solely looking for benefits. The management team is never trained on how to lead. You are just placed into lead roles and expected to grow from your own ambition. I loved Walmart but unfortunately, making young and dumb decisions, I was let go. I would still recommend this job for anyone who is looking for benefits and yearly raises or is able to handle larger role stress."
good,"the job i work for is not really worth it in the end. they slave you til you either quit, terminate yourself or fired. the pay seems good but they take most of the money out of your checks, and when you need off days they won't give it to you like that at all. they all for themselves and won't look out for you ,"
good,"walmart is an uptight place to work they are not super flexible with you, walmart does not give you sick time, walmart gives you in an 8 hour shift a 30 min unpaid lunch and 2 15 min breaks."
good,"There is a huge lack of coordination & communicaton between managers, which unfortunately reflects in how effective associates jobs are done. Making it very stressful."
good,"Meaningful work, great associates, and family like environment. with"
good,"This is a job that pays slightly above minimum wage. You will most likely not start at full time, either, which means no benefits and fairly random hours. Expect to stay at part time for at least six months before you get an offer to come on board full time. "
good,"Most Assistant Managers are pretty good to work for. But I get stuck with one that hasn't liked me from day one. Especially with my hearing impairment."
good,"I enjoyed talking and meeting so many different people as a cashier. "
good,To many boss and not enough workers. Always short staffed. No customer care to busy putting up stock or moving it one place or another. The customers did like the moving of stock from one place or the other.
good,"Pay Attention to your department manager, ask many questions about sales and goals for the day.  Have a positive attitude and use the 10 foot rules always."
good,hardest part is having to deal with customers who are persistent that you don't know how to do your job. I learned that not everything is as easy as it may seem. There are good days and bad days. Mostly depends on the management sometimes you ask for holidays and instead you get more shifts than usual
good,"I worked overnight and weekends. When working that shift, you don't really get any holidays off. The most enjoyable part would have to be my co-workers. Management is scarce overnight, one or two. Sick time or time off always has to be approved to receive pay."
good,very fast pace during holidays. very friendly co-workers. you need to have alot of patience. recently over the past 5 months management has not been reliable. there is no comunication it can take weeks to try to comunicate with one.
good,"Walmart is a good start off job but, I wouldn’t recommend having a career in it.The management there is too demanding,and the work environment is not as friendly as I would like."
good,Working for Walmart you must be able to handle a fast environment and to deal with many different situations. Very mixed culture and it can be used as a job to get you grounded and on your feet.
good,Walmart is a fast-paced and lack of accomplishment company to work for. The hours are long and the compensation is lacking. It's great if working while a student.
good,"Empresa muito boa,  mas não me oferece oportunidades de crescimento seja em cargo ou remuneração"
good,"Work in the past year was more of a hope to get out without nearlylosing my hair from anger that management would enforce."
good,"Wal*Mart is not what it used to be when Mr.Walton was living,and it gets worse with every passing year.They have relaxed their standards in hiring and thy do not value loyal workers anymore.Its all about the almighty DOLLAR."
good,Started in maintenance was always short staffed. We never had enough supplies to finish our job properly.My training was not adequate for what they expected. Moved to stocking on the floor. I did enjoy that position.
good,"They're not very understanding of life situations. I am a type 2 diabetic and although I don't mind doing the 3pm-12am shifts for Asset Protection, I don't necessarily take kind to closing almost every freaking shift they give me. "
good,I was fired because of my attendance however during orientation The attendance was only went over once and it was very brief I had no idea of that I got points for absences and I had no idea that there was a spot where I could post my shift that I could not take and somebody would take it Very poor orientation work for human resources
good,"The managment isnt the best, they really only look out for them selfs but everyone else take care of each other. They have food for us almost daily and we have good benefits."
good,"A good job to improved your customer service skills."
good,the job required hard and honest work for ten hours a day and 7 days a week as needed. I was on call for suppliers and associates 24/7 to answer any and all questions.
good,Some people can do walmart as a career cause they are at a point that the hrs and pay really dnt matter and then there is other people that we do whats right and all the ect and you will have problems just because they see you going to do your best no matter what and they dnt like.
good,"walmart was an interesting place to work at for a fact if you are a part time you still are going to work as a full time employee at list i did. i was located in the country and some people working there didnt seen to good in shape to be working there and also they would let all sorts of animals come in through those doors which was disgusting, because there was foods that dint need animals around."
good,"The hardest part of the job is, having enough employees for the customer intake."
good,Good people mostly I just had a hard time because of my physical and mental illness they didn't understand my disabilities or my limits of what I could and couldn't do.
good,"In the Vision Centre, I would answer phones and make appointments for eye exams. I did some filing. I would do the customers pretest for there eye exam and take payment and walk them to the Doctor for there eye appointment. I would check OHIP cards. I would help the customer to pick out frames for them, and then to choice the right lenses. I would take payment. Receiving orders and stocking product. Ordering contact lenses. Cleaning and dusting. Closing cash at close. I learned a lot about the eye."
good,Not a bad workplace. raises are not good and hour cuts 3 weeks per year. It seems like you have to know or be friends with a higher up to hear about higher paying jobs.
good,"Deberían de dar más oportunidades de crecimiento al personal."
good,It was okay working there just didn't care too much for higher management other than that the Assistant managers at my location were pretty cool. But the hated when they cut hours you really can't live off that. They do have high expectations. It's just they should pay their employers more than for what needs to be done.
good,"8 Hour shift"
good,Walmart was very unorganized and customers were very rude. Workers didnt care much and the managers were always busy writing people up for being a minute late.
good,"long hours low pay management doesnt care quality sucks low self esteem management doesnt care if u had the tools u needed to do your job, they just wanted it done"
good,Scheduled times was not fixed for five months that i was working there. Managers are rude when answering your questions. Make you do overtime when you have a specific time schedule
good,Overall its a job. I liked the fact of meeting new people. I did not like the fact of the breaks being short or late same with the lunches. I was willing to go over and beyond to do my job.
good,It was a stress environment every time because you never had the support from management. To succeed in a company we need to all work as a team and that was one of the main lack that they don’t work as a team.
good,"My main complaint is that higher up management does not know what they are doing and that was a big reason why I quit, they also very much play favorites."
good,"For my role, i really just stood around and helped people run the self check out. No one in our area likes the self check out anyway, and always had trouble with it so they were generally very rude about it. Walmart pays well, but they refuse to give the hours for it to matter."
good,If you don't mind working around the public it is an okay place to work. The management turnover was terrible when I was there and a lot of people had stepped down from department manager roles. There were a lot of cliques no matter what shift you worked.
good,the management team is non-existent and no team work one person does it all with no help at all and not even a thank you from anyone maybe one day it will change
good,The people i worked with there are hard working. At times you have too many managers telling you to do different things. Pulling you in all  directions.
good,Walmart under pays is cashiers and floor associates. They never schedule enough people so they expect one person to do the job of 4 people. They give associates more work and more responsibilities but don't increase their pay at all.
good,"Having been a courtesy clerk/cart pusher at walmart, I was working in the parking lot no matter the type of weather. Often times for me, cars would fly by in the parking lot going well over 10 mph. Trying not to hit cars was easy provided no one sped around a corner and cut you off."
good,When I worked in the deli we had a manager who made the job less stressful but then she got sick and got replace by a manager who came from a better Walmart than ours and tried to change the whole place to be like his Walmart.
good,It's not the worst job in the world. You get full-time hours when working overnight. But some of the people and management that you work with my the day really difficult to work with.
good,Empresa complicada. En muchos sentidos  gerentes muy complicados
good,"I loved working at Walmart it was nice until they cut my hours , I had good coworkers besides some mangers they wasn't , most thing I enjoyed was talking to the customers and making they happy and make sure they had everything they had I loved every single my customers"
good,The people I work with are amazing. Everyone that’s on the same “level” as you treats you with respect and it’s a fun work environment. It is a great place to work as your first job.
good,"When I worked for this company it was all about who you knew. Certain people did all the work while others did the bare minimum, but depending on who you were close to you received recognition for your work. This is a hard place for a new employee to come in and shine. Management played favorites a lot, though I blame the town for that not the actual business, and the favoritism made things unfair a lot of the time. This particular Walmart is not the best place to work, unless you're a local."
good,"A typical day involves an early start, 07.00, as the van needs to be inspected and loaded. This can take longer as expected as you won't always have help loading 1000kg of groceries for a due departure time of 07.30. The most challenging part of the job is during holidays, as the store i worked for was severely understaffed, this made the job difficult. "
good,"If you are going to decide to work for Walmart. Be slow. "
good,honestly the pay isn't too bad compared to some but after awhile it becomes not worth it. Management plays to favorites so good luck on advancing. Would only work there if there isn't other places actively hiring.
good,"Overall this is not a difficult job, being a cashier. The company mostly hires only part time and the compensation is terrible, minimum wage and no benefits."
good,Great if you are still in school and need to work and take classes. Not great if you are looking for full-time or a career. They do not want to promote unless you are their friends and they do not want to hire full time or give full hours.
good,The store that I worked at was very rough. We had a good store but you could never please the store manager. You would never get recognition or a pat on the back for a job well done. The assistant managers are who made it tolerable to work at that store.
good,For me it was my first time in he retail field and had no idea it was of this type. Maybe the store I was at but the overall experience was terrible and I wouldn’t do retail again.
good,"not really a place I would go back to, if I had been on the packaging maybe it would have been better but I'd prefer not to go back the people were great I liked talking to them they were helpful its just the job itself."
good,"the newly growing atmosphere at walmart is showing itself to be very none caring about its employees. with all thought going into profits at any cost, many a great employee have been thrown out."
good,When I went full time i lost hrs. Makes no sense. And the 3 points system is not ok. Things happen. Kids get sick. Mainly the hrs being cut is what hurt me.
good,"The management doesn't care for its employees. We're basically robots to them. However, I have learned a lot about people from this job and I've learned how to ignore what people say about you. I did love working with the coworkers I made friends with. I also enjoyed interacting with a bunch of different people, especially our regulars."
good,Some managers are great and some are not so great. When you're dealing with large corporations at least all that I've worked for that is what you get.
good,"During my time there, co workers were really were a blast to have around. We all helped each other out when we could and had each other back. But with all jobs there is a down side, and you would think it would be there couple of customers that come in grumpy, but it was management. They were disrespectful, and only cared about themselves. They would down talk to everyone as if they physically owned them instead of was their boss and higher up. They didn't respect customers nor other employees. That's not a safe work environment."
good,"working as a cashier has it's pros and cons."
good,"Working for Walmart was a challenging experience overall very strong Company . The managers all  need more consistency all managers never want to be liable for the mistakes play games mind games fact   for the leadership they have been selected . When using the open door policy they established  ""Walmart ""   You get retaliated harassed called to managers office for unknown reasons that don't make sense at all and yet your trying to make an all american wage there pay level is way below market value and they make you  work hard for it  so hard do this do that   . WALMART is a huge corporation they have billions of dollars to make huge mistakes this is a known fact . Your own co-workers will stab you right in the back just to please the Management . And when it comes to the Walmart cheer assembled from management . Team work there is no such definition of that at all . Walmart has taken lively hoods away small business gone in lititle towns and big cities  manipulate the culture  of our society. Finally jobs creating ones but realistically there in CHINA that's where they are . God Bless us all where is the direction as americans  going who knows ?"
good,"I worked as a cart pusher for two years and it was the hardest two years of my life. Being outside in the elements for 9 hour shifts takes a toll on a person, especially in subzero and above 110 degree temperatures."
good,Working at Walmart was probably a good place for me it was just very stressful on the management side and very unorganized but I wouldn't mind going back under different management .
good,"I had a supervisor who didn't know what she was doing. I was not trained as I should have been. I didn't mind retail side, but local management is bad."
good,"I have worked in a deli since 2016 at Giant Eagle. I left there because I was going back to school. I left Kroger because of scheduling conflicts, I still currently work at Walmart but am looking to advance elsewhere. "
good,"Working at Walmart in the Deli is hard work.  Not only is it hard physically but mentally as well.  There is always so much drama and backstabbing that you will be miserable.  The older ladies that work there are so racist that its ridiculous.  The management is poor at best and nothing ever gets done.  Supplies are short and you have to be creative to fill the hot bar from day to day.  Nothing comes in fresh.  All the salads are premade and comes in a box.  The only chicken that comes in that isnt pre cooked is the hot and ranch wings.  Sometimes the dates have expired on stuff and they ignore it and serve it anyway."
good,"its an okay company to work for, the co workers are alright if you get along but the management is awful. too many chiefs so to speak. good luck getting full time"
good,The work place had many task and responsible.  Its a fun job with many teamwork and busy most of the time.  Sometime over working and stay over time due to not enough employees schedule to back up.
good,"Nice place to start a job with potential to move up. However there are obstacles that you must weigh to see if it's the right choice for you. I suggest try it first hand don't settle for what the next guy has to say, instead make your own assumptions because your experience may be worlds apart from another individual's."
good,"a typical day at Walmart as a Cap 2 associate would be clocking in, finding out which section of the store you will be working, pulling out L carts and stocking merchandise in appropriate areas of the sales floor. I learned walking throughout the store when not on the clock and possibly during your breaks is a good way to recall where items are located throughout the store and makes it easier to stock and lead customers to an item they maybe looking for."
good,You stand on concrete all day. Deal with unprofessional managers and supervisors showing favortism. They’re tryna replace associates with machines anyway. I don’t know how they gone do that but whatever. Once the pay went up to $11/hr they started cutting hours.
good,was a good place to work but i am ready for a change! I find there is not much room for growth in the company! I didnt have much family time available to spend with my kids
good,"A typical day at work started with unloading the freight trucks, and then stocking the shelves with that days freight. Helping customers in between stocking. The hardest part about the job was being under staffed."
good,"came in, got my tools, and started doing oil changes and tire changes. Learned how to change tires with machines and how to balance them, also learned how to use hand held devices. Management was pretty good. hardest part of the job was trying to be polite to rude customers. Nothing really enjoyable about the job."
good,"If a good manager is working the work is more relaxed,  the poor ones just hide all night than panic when work not completed.  They measure your work in hours and expect you to complete 8 to 10 hours of work in 5 or less.  The good managers will watch and check you to see if more help is needed and rearrange work duty so jobs are completed.  When more than one manager is there they each try to tell you what to do contradicting each other and disrupting the job you are doing slowing you down in the process."
good,I have worked for this company twice and the first time I quite because I was being harassed by one of the managers.  the second time I quite because I needed more money and I didn't like having to work every weekend
good,Gostaria de trabalhar no Nacional foi o meu primeiro emprego.
good,I think they should do a lot more customer training on the job. And I also believe that the pay was to little and need a raise. I also think management need training also.
good,"Walmart has absolutely horrible management. The managers act like high school best friends with some employees while the others are kicked to the side. They favorite certain employees, letting them slide with doing nothing while the others have to work three times as hard to pick up the slack. Management expects us to do seven different jobs all across the store, and then reprimand us for when we aren't able to get our assigned job done in the few hours we work."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the clothing section. I would occasionally have to help put merchandise on shelves, restock, and pull merchandise forward to make the shelves look nice and neat."
good,"No holiday pay, no full time hours and no flexibility. Fast pasted environment must be able to stand for long periods time and doesn't pay enough for the job description!"
good,"I have worked for Walmart for nearly a year and it is beyond difficult to not just quit. My coworkers are amazing but managers barely seem to care if there is ever any kind of issue. Departments are understaffed and management never schedules enough people, leaving the rest of us to pick up the slack. When bringing this up to the managers, nothing is done about it. This also causes me and other people in our departments to constantly deal with angry customers for something that isn't even our fault purely because not enough people were scheduled- if any were for that department at all. The only thing keeping me from quitting are the benefits and coworkers. It's sad."
good,"A lot of politics, and if you do not play them, you will pay the price."
good,The pay sucks and the people I worked with where not friendly. They don't care if you have sick kids or family to take care of if your on the schedule to work you have to be there no matter what.
good,"You're expected to go above and beyond for work that's not really worth the pay, though it's a good job for those who really need a job. It will feed you and pay for a cheap apartment."
good,"Advancement was placed in the hands mostly of one individual, not the main manager, was very much a dictatorship. The work was fine, and CSM's were great."
good,don’t work at Walmart if your under age. Will not get enough hours. Mangers arent really that nice... pay is very good but the hours will not show for it.
good,"CSMs are ruthless, they gossip about people while other workers can hear them. It's not a good environment, they CSMs also get on some cashiers especially if there is no customers, even when they haven't done anything wrong."
good,"I had stable hours."
good,I worked 10 days straight with no day off. They don't go by you work preference. They take forever to help you at times. They don't give you any set schedule.
good,Management are not friendly to there workers at all unless you are their friend . Over all it was a good learning experience. I learn how to cope  in a not too friendly work environment.
good,I was always being told to do something and then lectured from another manager because no one was on the same page. The managers choose favorites and they run with it.
good,"I hate working for Walmart the only reason I am still there is that I have bills to pay but as soon as a job grants me another offer I will be gone. Management has no kind of communication at all, one manager will tell you one thing then another tell you something totally different they are not all on the same page. and the employees feel like they can do whatever they want. If everyone was on one page then it would be an okay place to work but it is so unorganized."
good,Cashier hours are horrible. Hard to work any schedule they throw at you. Could close 3-11 pm one day and the next open 7am-3pm. No sleep. harder if you have kids.
good,It was an okay place to work. If you are coming right out of school this place will help you learn all the thing that you need to lean to be a pharmacy tech.
good,My time at Walmart was when they where trying to get rid of door greeters. So they work stick us in other jobs casher/stockboy what ever they could find for us
good,sometimes it was slow I really didn't learn much because it was repetitive. The hardest part of the job was fixing items on the shelf when it was slow.  There is only so much fixing on a shelf one can do while waiting for customers on a slow day.
good,Good stepping stone for envancement. Alot of different jobs to choose from. Experienced facility to grow from. Family oriented. Fun place to be. Alot of offers and programs.
good,Scheduling is inconsistent. Customer Service Managers are not friendly to employees or customers. Trying to take breaks requires jumping through hoops.
good,I have worked for both the store and the D.C.. I admit I really enjoyed working at the D.C.. the only con I have there is no air condition. Everyone has just about worked at walmart one point and time.
good,Where I currently work they don’t do teamwork but sometimes its fun to work in there because everyone works together! (Sometimes teamwork) Management are worst when needed they come a half hour after you called them or an hour later. Security it’s good but still bad things happens.
good,"Good Job for people without much experience. Hard to move up in management unless you know other management personally. Managers have a hard time with actually helping their employees. Decent pay for associates. Pharmacy, Deli, and Auto Techs are underpaid."
good,Work ethic of the team is not always collaborative and management/leadership was seriously lacking. Because they are corporate they offer education programs toward becoming management and decent benefits but the leadership and work ethic of each team was seriously lacking. (Hence the high turnover and increased workload)
good,"it's a fairly easygoing place. You do have to work quickly and keep moving. unfortunately, not all management seems to care about your issues. The hardest part of the job is if you are a department manager."
good,The management and pay needs to change. Workers are not treated fairly when it comes to bonuses and perks. Advancement within the company needs to improve and better work environment needs to be changed
good,"Walmart has a laundry list of things they want done, and they know exactly how they want them done. The problem is, they do not have the time to properly train you, so you are on your own to figure it out while trying to avoid getting written up."
good,"While working at the Walmart off Bush River, we never had enough people on shift. When coming from the back training they didn’t give you proper training out front on registers. The line would be backed up, even at self-checkout. Most managers act as if they were too good to work on a register. Often times some of the cashiers would have to do put back. The organization  all together wasn’t organized."
good,"I work for Walmart for two years, and personally never really had a good experience with it, the store manager was nice, but the other managers treated me like a dog, I don’t believe all Walmarts are like that, but the one I worked at wasn’t good, I was treated as though I was unintelligent and completely expendable"
good,management was bad and rude work environment was ok no kind of communications skills at all but the company has a great benefit pakage and bonus was ok could be better though
good,"10 hour days."
good,"Best part about here is the people you will work with everyday. Make friends and connections with your co-workers. Hardest part is the Management and favoritism. Add a healthy dose of worst retail customers on the daily....and low wage. Taking your sarcasm up a notch to deal with the best of the worst people of retail. 6% match on 401k is one of the best things. Otherwise, don't work here! Its a pit and it hard to get out."
good,"Come in to work, check customers receipts and greet them, inform customers of policies while managers will tell those same customers that they can do something for them after I going by the rules told them we can't do anything, customers shout at you for not having enough carts despite how many times you have informed managers of the situations, inconsistent hours for example I come in late/evening shift and the next day I have to be at work very early not even 8 hours after my shift ended."
good,I worked hard in all areas.got let go because I needed surgery. Not good with absences. The management I worked with was awesome. Its just walmarts policy
good,Since I do whatever the management ask and it full-time benefits I've find it difficult to want to stay at Walmart. The management is okay working on the front end is a complete nightmare since you have anywhere between 2 to 3 supervisors any all have different Jobs for you to do which makes your job a lot more stressful and painful at times.
good,Walmart working environment is fast pace from start to finish. Must be a self starter and make quick decisions. Working with associates of all ages and help them with their job duties.
good,Good place to work as long as you have open availability. Hard for a single mom with closed availability to keep when they suddenly cut you to 25 hours...
good,Walmart may be a great place to shop at but work enviroment has too many managers giving different instructions. Low pay for manager who are hourly. They say they care about workers but thats bull. Just like every other large business they care about the money.
good,"not a good place to work, once you upset management it is impossible to change their opinion of you, good health benefits if you can afford it, good quarterly bonuses"
good,Great Pay!!
good,Not really any reason I'd recommend working here unless you're still in highschool. Pay is awful and the job is mind-numbingly boring. Most of the time just walk around picking up what other people knocked off shelves.
good,This use to be the best driving job. Now everyone wonders if they will have a job tomorrow. I love this job but they have now done away with set runs so not much home time anymore
good,The culture at Walmart is difficult to work with. Employees only get three absences within the first six months of working or risk termination. I thinks its easy to get sick 3 times in 6 months so i don't agree with the policy.
good,Working at Walmart was okay. I luckily worked at the pharmacy but I was very close with people on the sales floor. We had to do a lot of helping with ringing customers out.
good,"I enjoyed working there until management changed where was working. Now there is no team working, some just disappears for some time. They are under staffed & sometimes it gets very stressful. I enjoyed  waiting on the people."
good,"its a place to start but it's not a career and it can be more stressfully than most people think."
good,"Many medications available at discounted prices, allows for patients to have more affordable prescriptions.  Most health plans/insurances accepted.  I have been with Wal-Mart almost 22 years and the changes in those years have for the most part been good.  Health care is changing and people are living longer due to innovations in medications and medication management and this has allowed me to grow in knowledge and experience in the practice of pharmacy."
good,"Low pay, never enough associates, abusive customers that believe you owe them the moon. Turning into Walmart USA. They keep reducing hours and expecting more to be done. You will end up loving your co-workers."
good,At times its been good depending on the management. It is also very demanding emotionally. the other associates became like family. Lots of time pressures
good,"As a cashier we had to rely on the CSM's for everything, but most would never actually get on register to ring if we were packed and needed the help. One time I was super anxious because I had gotten like 5 100 dollar bills and I asked a CSM to please remove them from the til because I was getting super anxious about it and he just said to get over it."
good,The requirements of the job were physically strenuous. The expectations were very strict but this also was motivating. The pay was good. The management was helpful.
good,"When I first was employed at Walmart back in 2003, it was a fun place to work. There were enough associates for each department to service the customers. As with every company cuts were made to staffing to increase profits for the company, so by the time I left the company in 2017, most sales floor associates were stretched to multiple departments and were not able to assist customers like they deserved to be."
good,I started working for Wal-Mart in Indy. I loved it. I got put on third shift stocking apparel and infants. There was 7 women that worked in this area. We had a blast. Then life changes and then I had to move. So I transferred to Terre Haute. I was back on third shift working in the department. I felt lost because the way we worked in Indy was not the way they worked at this location. It seems like they where doing half stuff backwards. The management was not helpful.
good,"Es una empresa estadounidense que comparte la filosofía de su pais de origen, donde lo más importante es el beneficio que se puede obtener a costa de su clientela y esclavos, perdón digo ""asociados"". Nunca hay acercamiento directo como sociedad laboral. Y debido a que los lideres (Gerentes) no tienen interes en sus empleados éstos tampoco tienen interes en la empresa, lo que se vuelve un circulo vicioso de mediocridad. "
good,"I worked my way through college and after college at Wal-Mart and it helped with the money for simple things like textbooks and gas mainly simple stuff. But unless you were given a house, a vehicle, or have someone that pays your utilities don't expect this to be a lucrative job in any way. This jobs barely gets you by I would suggest having another job to accompany this as you most likely won't be able to afford an apartment alone with bills especially if you had a car payment as I did. If you accept this as a life long career be ready to have a roommate or live with your parents as that will be the only way to make it. This is NOT an equal opportunity employer as that would suggest that everyone has an equal chance to move up in the company. Even after graduating and coming forward with an updated resume showing a bachelors degree I was still told that a diploma of higher learning did not hold a grain of salt to the company. I was told on many occasions that management jobs were more available to those with a degree, but was later told that I would have to leave the company and come back in 3 months to have a better chance from the show of my experience background even from that store. It was a terribly long 7 years summed up from the end of high school to two years out of college. Once you're in the Wal-Mart or Sam's Club corporation I would suggest looking for a more professional and high quality business to join as you will more than likely have a higher opportunity to move up the ranks."
good,"its an ok place to work, the management continuously undermines and micro manages your every move . coworkers are one of the biggest  positives this company has ."
good,"Unfair wages and no room for advancement. Did provide good mileage when traveling to other stores. Overall, did not like the upper level of management and being unappreciative one what one is able to bring to the table."
good,"You punch in do your job, try not to engage in any of the drama, punch out and go home."
good,"I really enjoy the job.  I stay busy, I enjoy the customers.  I just don't like how the managers refuse to work with my schedule.  I work two jobs and specifically requested to work only certain hours so that I could get SOME sleep.  I requested to always have the same days off.  They did for a couple of weeks then they completely messed around with my schedule like they don't even care if I get any sleep or not.  I am a zombie now.  I can't function well at either job and am considering quitting Walmart if they don't take my needs into consideration.  Not a place to work long term if you want to live a healthy and functional life."
good,"no dan un buen respeto al trabajador, no dan la cultura laboral que dicen"
good,I was denied breaks and had lunches cut. I learned how to handle different situations with day-to-day operations. I was given 1-hour lunch breaks and had those shorted multiple time.
good,"Employees are not complimented on their work, unreasonable expectations on workers.  Good relationships with other employees."
good,"Had to use a computer based cash register for clean, fast and friendly customer service. People using monies to buy groceries and other household goods."
good,"It was good at first, I loved my co-workers, and I was good at my job. However the management couldn't seem to get anyone's schedule right. I'd book things off for months in advance, just for that day to come and be called and told I was supposed to be there. The managers were rude and felt as if they were humanly superior."
good,"The staff is great, flexible hours, and a break every two hours if you work a minimum of 6 hours. the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers."
good,"Very poor training processes"
good,"Now the Walmart that I worked at in Bluefield VA was amazing. Loved the people I worked for and with. They where easy to work for. They worked with you if something happened, or your sicks are sick."
good,"It's a retail job - awful customers, bad atmosphere, and pretty unfriendy all around. I still keep in touch with some of my coworkers and my manager was quite friendly and good to work for. But the company of WalMart's poisenous atmosphere was always there."
good,"Need to hire more adults and less kids. Not enough staff, need more caring and stronger management team to run the store. Stricter on drug testing and on the dress code."
good,Solo les importa sacar la productividad sin tomar en cuenta muchos aspectos
good,If your looking for something temporary than work here other than that if you don't have a passion for retail or poor management than i would suggest working else where. sometimes with Walmart it depends on the location and the store but most stores have miserable employees.
good,it was very fun a fairly flexible did not like the management as they were sneaky and underhanded and pulled a lot of illegal stunts that resulted in me leaving this is not a reflection on the franchise just the one location. would work at another any day.
good,Wal-Mart has changed a lot in the past years. I was an assistant manager before leaving. Wal-mart technology has grown tremendously was with the company 14 years. My job was very challenging and sometimes stress was intense.
good,"O problema é com a liderança dos setores."
good,Walmart is ok if you dont mind not asking legitimate questions and then being told that you ask too many questions by management.  the managment team is by far the worst part about working at walmart
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart, but needed to improve myself and better advance my career. It also did not pay for my cost of living or give me the hours that i needed. Also, they didn't allow any overtime."
good,"A typical day included working on the front-end, stocking shelves and assisting customers. The hours were fairly flexible, but hardly any benefits were included while working here"
good,never enough people to unload trucks and stock. This is a fast paced job which I am fine with. Once you are in a certain area that should be what you work. Not areas your not familer with
good,They need to provide more training for associates they do not provide any hands on training and expect you to do really well at your job not a permanent job for most people career advancement is slow if any at all
good,the people at my Walmart gossip about everything that they can think of and the management encourages it even though it is against Walmart company policy. the management also encourages teams to fight and argue with each other
good,"Good place to work for students, hard to move up. They expect you to do 3 people's job for 1 person's pay. They did move their starting pay up, and it is more than what you would be making starting out at any other grocery store. Overall it was a decent place to work, but it is usually a place that people move away from after time because of the lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"The job ia easy, the management is poor. The management all the way up to store manager are friends instead of coworkers. Everything is taken personally, and the inability to go to management about problems with other managers is shameful and nonconfidential."
good,"I mean its a secure job, but is too stressful for the pay you get, has benefits that are ok, but you may not always get the hours you ask for or be able to get all the hours you want."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking and zoning product. I often made trips to the warehouse to aid the receiving crew with unloading trucks. Working at Walmart has taught me how to be a team player and communicate efficiently to properly accomplish tasks. However, although the coworkers maintained a rather hostile environment, management was phenomenal."
good,"walmert is a good cooperation to work in, Even though some of the work was deemed unnecessary according to me. I do feel like walmart is a good started job for students and teens"
good,Walmart is good company to work for and I would recommend it for those needing employment.  As a company it's wages are fair and it's benefits package is acceptable.
good,"A typical day involves lots of zoning, dealing with customers of varying temperaments, and looking busy when there's nothing to do. Co-workers were great and so was the manager I was working under, but time off is a big deal. Only 3 sick days in a 6 month period. They won't hire you full time to give you benefits but you'll work 38 hours. So you get the stress of a full-time job with none of the benefits."
good,Company goals are consistent with market and customer expectation however unreasonable work life balance as well as personal expectation. Local management is not consistent with company beliefs.
good,I learned a few things while working at walmart but not by the managements teaching. They have you sit on a computer and do CBLS ( Computer Based Learning). In my location I had some awesome managers and some very very rude ones.
good,Constantly being called out of department which leads to stealing. Management doesn't care when you tell them about any problems in the department. Will always take customers side even if they are wrong.
good,No benifits not enough pay no room for advancing not enough scheduled working hours the benefits are no near the interview. Need a lot more hours and did not receive the pay quoted
good,"If you need to loose weight, you'll definitely do it while working here. Typically this department is understaffed, so you'll be doing a lot of work meant for more than one person. Expect a lot of heavy lifting."
good,Walmart  has currently raised the wage for working for the company. which is great I feel that the company should start giving more time off for employees
good,"no one ever stays with Walmart due to poor management.."
good,"Fast paced, learning new things daily, teamwork could be better, management and training could be much better, enjoying working with my drivers and sales reps and making sure we have the product we need in store."
good,"Had a nice community feel in the begining  not so much now, business changes seemed redundant. what has been done 5 years ago not relavant now  implement new system, then back to old system, then back to re-invent the last new system. Learned how to lead by example, learned how to build a team. Hardest part was always being gone from Family almost every holiday for 21 years. Most enjoyable part of my job was to watch others grow and become promoted, to mentor others."
good,Stressful and difficult to manage. Not paid enough and often treated poorly by both management and customers. Very hard to find peace working here. Almost constant drama.
good,good and bad has it issues this is a good company with fairly good benefits as well as discount and benefits but it is also not the best because of stress and unfairness
good,"As a cashier at wal-mart, the job is fairly simple and often times your social experience can be enjoyable. However, I did find that at my particular wal-mart, the management team was very unqualified and often times we were left to our own devices when it came to customer problems. The term, ""an employee's motivation is directed related to the sum of interactions with his or her manager"" is definitely very true. The scheduling was often disappointing as well. You NEED to have an open schedule unless a doctor's note is provided and even then the schedule can get it incorrect because whoever deals with the schedule does not manually override the errors. My home life and health appointments often suffered because of this. As a PART-TIME associate I got 38-40 hours a week when six of the eight full-time cashiers rarely received 25 hours, let alone their 40. To put it bluntly, I am very happy I am not employed there anymore."
good,"Una dia pues es de esos desde  que  entras solo concentrado en tus actividades para poder  salir en tu horario aprendí valores éticos a ser responsable puntual su cultura  es buena su paga para empezar es muy baja pero si llegas a tener antigüedad entonces eso mejora ya  que  da  la oportunidad de ser jefe de departamento con capacitación y desarrollo,me gustaba por que estaba cerca de casa,lo difícil es que nunca  salí a mi hora siempre daba  mas  tiempo sin pago  de horas extras"
good,"I only worked at Walmart for four months as a temp but it was clear that most managers have their own way of doing things. There is a slight communication issue among associates that nobody seems to notice or care about. The pay at Walmart was good; I was able to start my adult life with a steady income. I worked second shift (2pm-11pm) for the entirety of the remodel which I didn’t mind. Overall, Walmart is a 3/5 workplace."
good,"Worked at Walmart for over a year. Currently make 11.50 new associates coming in will make 12.10. Pay discrepancies happen all the time, the longer you work there the worst you're treated."
good,"Busy days, not pay enough, no benefits , goof thing they will cross train you to help in different departments, I think advancement was good as well, some management was rude some where nice"
good,didnt really enjoy getting paid every two weeks. management was lazy. costomers can be difficult to deal with. the salary isnt enough to live with. hours arent consistent
good,"I worked for Walmart in the backroom. We are pushed to meet impossible quota and physically stretched too far. I was a worker that wanted to meet every goal set. Therefore, I would unload multiple trucks and then be required to work in one of the my physical departments stocking the freight I had just unloaded. With little training, no support from management and unpredictable team members. I did learn patience, I learned many things about what a good manager should do and learned great ways to handle customers concerns."
good,The best part of working there for night shift would have been the other workers they were nice and grate to get along with they would help you out if needed
good,"While the work environment of Walmart (the jobs needed to be performed, the co-workers, the customers, etc.) is alright enough to be enjoyable at times, the same cannot be said about the management. Granted, not all managers and/or supervisors will fall into this description, but more than enough of them do, enough to give off a strong, negative vibe for how the company as a whole views and treats its employees. Based on my experiences, both as a direct employee and as a third-party worker (under Way To Go Merchandising), Walmart's management tends to be very cold and uncaring towards its employees, treating them as an easily replaceable workforce."
good,"It was alright, just wasn’t the best experience. It was a hard job especially during the summer days, when being out in the sun was a lot to deal with."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and stressful, i learn to watch for fake IDs. In my opinion management could be better they are not very helpful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers."
good,Working at Walmart was a challenge in that they would never give you enough hours.  It was nearly impossible to make enough for bills.  Driving back and forth put wear and tear on vehicle but wiped out any profits from working.
good,"I helped open a new store. The team was a lot of fun. The work was hard but fullfilling. Management was poor and lacked business sense. Unfortunate, considering the enjoyment of the position."
good,"Walmarts management team from my experience is very out of touch with its workers overall. The hardest part of the Job is the physical labor if you are an unloader, but if you are working the meat department the hardest job is managing the rotation of meat while ensuring the shelves are stocked of lunch meats, Hams, and raw meats."
good,"Night started off with shift meeting, was assigned area to work, stock was on sales floor on pallets , broke down and seperated product, then stocked shelves, got along good with most employee during the shift,had no problems with management while on shift"
good,It is work. It really depends on the store. It just kind of seems like everything is going down hill. Wish it wasn't. I wouldn't have to search for a new one right now. I tried to transfer but nobody helped me or even cared about the transfer. So it is just poo.
good,Wal-mart was very fast paced on busy days as a cashier and service desk rep. I think wal-mart is a good place to work it pays well and you're treated pretty fair but they will take up every bit of time you have. The most irritating part of the job as a cashier is if something is priced wrong or doesn't have a tag and you have to wait for a CSM to go and check. I would still be working there if management wasn't such a problem.
good,"This job is an ok starter for someone in high school. For a grown adult, no. Pay's not really that good and they try to compensate for it with discounts on certain products."
good,"Good pany overall, Work life balance a little skewed. Good  compensation for management associates. Training was decent. Opportunity for advancement is there"
good,"It is not a bad place to work, but there is a lack of communication, and planning from management, needs better management. Do not expect a warm greeting from supervisors each day, or compliments on your work.."
good,I enjoyed working with people from different cultures and background and everybody was very friendly. I hope to always have this kind of collaboration and team work in my future jobs.
good,"This job is what you expect from a grocery store: normal pay, average full-time benefits. It is a great job especially when you have limited availability such as their overnight shift."
good,"Walmart was family oriented organization.  Many ideas have change since Sam Walmart.  With many different changes, everyone has to be on the same path.  It is hard to have everyone on that path.  From Corporate to cart pusher."
good,"I worked there for many years gained a lot of experience , positions from back room processes, sales floor, department manager , cashier, customer service manager, accounting. "
good,"a typical day at work the same any time you walk in crowded long waits and not enough employees"
good,"At the beginning It was fun and exciting to work in a different environment and I was getting a lot of hours. Towards the last few months I worked there, they started cutting all of the cashiers hours because they hired too many new ones. I was barely getting 10 hours a week if I was lucky"
good,Competitive and fast paced atmosphere. High turnover among associates.  Strong focus on training and development.  Hard to advance at Co Manager level due to longevity of store managers in roles.
good,Culture does not promote the advancement or success of the individual and sacrifices employees for management gain. Not a place where the associate is considered a part of a team.
good,"I almost died the night I got fired. The weather conditions were horrible and we were to be at work, regardless of any circumstances or weather conditions. This particular winter put a damper on everything. It was a horrible snow storm & after risking me & my children's lives, getting them to the baby-sitter, I found myself overwhelmed from the two crashes that I escaped. Now I'm almost at the sitter & the police insisted that I park and stay in after cars constantly swerved, barely missing each other, because of the storm. By this time, my heart was fluttered, so I stayed in at the sitters house & gave my supervisor notice of what had happened. She understood but needed me & all other workers, because we had ""big-heads"" (corporate) coming the next day. Understood but my life comes first before the company."
good,I work harder than everyone on my team and because of that they make me do every body else’s job too. I get paid the same amount as everyone else who bring a 1/4 of the productivity I bring.
good,"Great experience working at Walmart but I feel that they cater to newer associates. Im currently still an employee there and have been for six years and associates walking in the door make more and have at least 40 hours a week while longtime employees fight for hours to survive,"
good,They don't pay the employees what they should I know smaller corporations that pay better than this giant one. Customers can't even get out of this place in a timely manner with 4 registers open... come on...
good,"overnight stocker, checking produce making sure fresh and ready, feed America, cashier, helping customers find their items, cleaning the meat walls n produce walls"
good,"Walmart is an okay business to work for. but for the amount of work employees do in their 8 hour shift, the money you make is very little. but it is a fun and friendly environment to work in. they train you for your job and makes is simple to learn."
good,always fast paced and expected you to work miracles within time frames. Not enough staff for to much work. work assignment sheets with unaccounted time and not enough hours is the day to get everything done.
good,i like my coworkers but the days start early and are long since they are 12 hour shifts. I only work 3 days a week but by the time my work week is over i feel as though i have already put in 60 hours.
good,management needs improvement overall a good paying job and benefits. They need to cut down the quota that needs to be met which is extremely hard to hit
good,For the most part working at the walmart was ok. They don’t pay enough which is good and a lot of the managers play favorites. Schedule is consistent and they work with you.
good,"I started my job in the Electronics department, and did a lot of cashiering.  I restocked music and movies.  I then went on to open to cell phone area."
good,"given 40 hour weeks in the summer 8 days straight, understaffed and hard working conditions. Many employees there were not interested with their jobs."
good,It was good until alot of military managers began taking over and making the job as hard as possible but  the pay was good and weekend off were provided .
good,"Working for Walmart as an online grocery picker was an okay job. Management wasn’t all that good, but we got things done. There’s a lot of walking involved."
good,"Wal-Mart does not like giving full-time, and they give you as much work as they can without breaking labor laws or giving benefits. They intentionally keep their employees on lower than average wages so they can expand and undercut every other business in the area, and the 10% discount is not on all products."
good,Easy work . Overnights was fun met and worked with great people. Learned from coworkers of future careers. The staff I had made my nights easy to get through everyone worked together because management never wanted to help but was certain to make sure it all got done .
good,"Long hours, like anywhere some very poor leaders.  Pay really well, but so large sometimes they dont really understand what talent they have.  Downsizing corporatly, which is good for the business and shareholders but process of selection is poor and more about who you know."
good,"You learn a lot about sales and customer service, in my period of work they didn't trained you well, but I guess that is not Walmart's fault, they put you on the floor to sale and you have to find a way to make the day, some customers are not respectful but that its not walmart's fault, I did liked it to work there, it was a good experience..."
good,"Everything is A-Ok as long as you fit into their plans. Once you don't, they will create an atmosphere that will eventually exit you from the company one way or another."
good,hire temp workers so they dont have to give benifits. it is an okay job but when your 6 month temp job is over they let you go due to not wanting to make you full-time.
good,I loved working with the front end ... seeing the customers smiled because of the great service that I have provided was everything. the only part of the job I did not like was the customer service managers. did not care for them at all very untrained to do the position that was given to them.
good,"The job as a whole isn't entirely difficult. It takes application and reactive and pro-active planning as well as problem solving but the unethical and unrealistic expectations of the supervisors at my store would wear anyone down over time. A typical day includes cleaning up the mess from the prior shift and positioning inventory in the backroom to be able to stock shelves as well as handle customer concerns. All while trying to maintain a clean and safe workplace. "
good,"Walmart used to be a wonderful place to work. The management has been lapsed for sometime. The morale of that place has been decreasing for sometime. The hours are not that good, and the pay could be more. Know one can live on what they make there."
good,"Después de mucha rotación de personal, el clima laboral es inadecuado, no generalizo pero en la tienda donde labore descuidan mucho a su capital humano"
good,"I don't mind the actual job, but all in all managers and schedules will ruin it all for you. I work in the deli and I'm always scheduled alone and have to beg for lunches or breaks every night."
good,"A stressful workplace because of poor management...working with people who didn't know what they were doing,"
good,Stay clam and cool answer questions clearly dress nicely follow all rules of drug screens and back ground checks .. things will be good good luck to all it is a strong hard company to work for but you will do great !!
good,Everyday can be different some days are slow but most days are fast. Customers treat workers poorly same as managers. You make a lot of great friends and funny memories working there.
good,Could be a good place to work if they didn't make changes constantly. The work environment has shifted from upbeat and fun to stressful and everyone being job scared.
good,Normally when I get to work it’s the busy time so it’s very fast and a lot of moving and helping get customer in and out as quick as need be. I’ve learn a lot over the year I’ve been there not just from co workers but from the customer as well. You learn something new everyday rather it’s related to the job or just in general.
good,The major problems I typically faced was the lack of help and equipment to do my job duties property. Specific managers helped when they could but overall management team members possess poor judgment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people we meet on a daily basis.
good,"Depending on who you are, what you can do, and who you know... this isn't the worst place to work. Just don't be too dependable, or you will find yourself responsible for picking up the slack while others barely work and get paid or promoted."
good,Not a bad working enviroment but they need managment that actually works with you and the training had alot of improvement needed. Plus the hour lunch breaks and no overtime that really puts a damper on things
good,"Loved my job, poor management.  Great diverse culture of people to work with.  The best part of this job was customers.  Hardest of part of the job was Job work/life balance."
good,I loved the environment of Walmart. We worked as a team and I liked the people I loved the people I worked with. The downfall was the pay and hours being up and down.
good,"No different than Sears, Target, Kmart, or any other retail.  Wal-Mart does offer the ability to try different jobs, meet different people, and allow you to move around the country or world if you so desire."
good,Walmart is an ok place to work I have been there three years. we have a pretty good team thats what matters. but at my store the team is falling apart to be honest.
good,"Worst part working here was seeing how bad management was going to be day by day. Between basic favoritism and members of management trying to get people fired/ keeping a useless employees over person opinion, job security was a joke."
good,"Working at Walmart did have it's pros and cons. It's a lot of stocking and dealing with too many managers directing too few employees. It seemed that company policy changed from day to day, manager to manager."
good,Understaffed very much.  Stressful due to additional pressure being placed on management to compensate for understanding.  Corporate initiated a program raising beginning employees wage to $11 per hour but did not give raises to existing employees.  Narrowed the wage gap between management and associates.  This created or at least added to a critical morale problem.
good,"Management are either complacent or powerless to do anything about poor performance from associates. There are a select few that  come to work and apply themselves, but the majority stand around and do nothing. The philosophy among some is ""why should I work so hard when we all get paid the same whether we work hard or not ""."
good,"I do not wish to write a review of this company, due to the recent cut backs at corporate and the myriad of store closings, it would not be a good thing for me to give a review of this company at this time."
good,"I enjoyed my job there. When I started having problems with my back, some of the CSM's did assist me. They even offered my husband employment so I could take care of myself. I would give the management a 4/5 star rating. I enjoyed the people there. They have some of the nicest co workers on board. The hardest part of the job was dealing with high volume customers. When very busy, you needed to take care of every customer as fast as possible."
good,"My entire performance was based on how long a computer said my job should take. The computer was very inconsistent and would say that 4 pallets should take 3 hours and then that 2 pallets would take 6 hours. I had 3 or 4 different managers and they all gave different instructions on how to do my job. I never felt like I was doing the job ""properly."" I was let go because I am white and they let diversity hires stay on for another 2 months who dragged down the entire stocking team."
good,"The good pay is literally the only reason to work there everything else is terrible. the managers think they are better than you, if they don't like you for any reason, personal or otherwise then they will look for reasons to get rid of you."
good,"Walmart is very customer service oriented and management does their best to work with their employees to meet their needs. I enjoy the people I work with, everyone becomes family but I don’t like how inflexible their scheduling system is."
good,"it is a fairly average walmart. not a super center but does the same amount of business as one. expected to learn different positions without actually being trained on how to do them, then denied a raise because you were never trained."
good,"the coworkers were ok to work with, but biggest problem was the store manager. manager would tell subordinates lies and try to have other people to write them up"
good,"Working here is good for a short time period, but they are greedy and pushy telling you that you have to sell credit cards or else (cut hours, fired). They never get you off the register in time for breaks, lunches, and it can be difficult just to get to bathroom."
good,Low wages. Part time hours unless you're management. Almost always have someone looking over your shoulder. Enjoyed working along side many of my non management co workers.
good,Wal Mart is a good place to work if you like the people you work with. The people i worked with was immature and younger than me. My manager had no idea on how to fix a car all he did was stand back and watch you and complain that you took to long to do a oil changes that requiters at least 30 to 45 mins.
good,It's an ok company to work for a lot of it though really depends on your management crew and there ability to communicate. Turn over rate can be high in part due to management.
good,"It was obvious early on why Walmart seems to always be hiring. At first the job culture seemed very healthy and positive, eventually it became more and more apparent that the employees there were still there despite the culture, not because of it. The store is poorly managed with those in the positions of the most responsibility seldom taking care of said responsibilities and the burden of productivity falling on other managers who are already busy enough with their own work. It seems that the higher up in the management chain you get at this Walmart, the less you need to do to earn your paycheck. There are exceptions to this obviously but from my short experience, it was very disappointing. Shout out to the shift managers in the Fulfillment department though, some of the best employees in that whole building."
good,to much to do in each daparment back breaking will take alot of energy out of your day fast paced work environment and the pay was not worth the reward
good,The people you work with are absolutely the best.  It is like a small family on each shift.  The consistency of policy and procedure is lacking.  I have gained a lot of good experience at the ROC that I hope to take with me to my next employer.
good,"-Ring up customers items that they want to purchase, help direct customers to correct isles for certain items, help return merchandise that was returned. "
good,If you like an ever changing job and the unknown if your job will be there tomorrow this is the company that Walmart is now. its long hours and a area that has its ups and downs.  people you work with are like family and its heartbreaking going through a reorg and losing those team member's.  there use to be security now there is not.
good,Couldn't deal with the kids I worked with they took off all the time and bosses didn't do anything about them taking off so when it was raining or very cold out I was outside doing all the work
good,Walmart was a good job when I first started but as the years went bye it got really difficult. management was horrible and it made the store go down hill
good,"Good place for someone's first job or someone that doesn't need anything permanent. A stepping stone until something better comes."
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo divertido, los compañeros son un buen equipo para trabajar y desarrollar las tareas diarias"
good,"I only worked there for a couple of months. The management at the particular store I worked in would degrade every worker, and the only other walmart in my town was owned by my owners own dad. I'm sure it would be a good place to work elsewhere, but sherwood parks walmarts don't have good reputation."
good,"Sales representatives, at Walmart and decent. The management there is difficult to be around when asking them to provide for services. Hopefully they have different management for the Walmart to be improved."
good,"Walmart is a very stressful place to work for. If you are not one of the managers favorites, hardly anything will be done to help you.The other Walmart employees are not very helpful. Most will try and put you down for their own gain."
good,"A typical day at work I was working on lube on cars. Constantly had to work and communicate with others in the shop. Favorite part of the job was being able to get my hands dirty, work on the cars."
good,"They are a decent work place, you earn your ""paid time off"" (you get 1 hour of PTO for every 30 hours you work). They are not understanding of family/medical emergency."
good,"A typical day centers around the customer. We are either behind a register, monitoring self-check out, walking a customer to a specific location, or acting as a personal shopper for one client."
good,"The company teaches great values in your computer-based training but completely fails to uphold those values in day-to-day operations. You will not be appreciated for working hard. No matter how hard you work, your reviews will be the same as your peers who always find a way to do nothing. I refuse to even shop here anymore."
good,We begin the shift by unloading and organizing the truck order.  We then place merchandise on shelves according to the plan-o-gram. We pick merchandise and bin any overstock while remaining compliant with safety standards. I enjoy assisting the Walmart customers and interacting with them.
good,"You were rushed to stock everything you had on your cart even if you were just starting out, one manager in specific talked you down in front of co-workers, typically condesending."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work at but during winter, hours are cut and can't make a living. Wal-Mart has some perks but it depends on sales. Benefits are alright."
good,"I learned discipline and hard work. I enjoyed unloading trucks, processing apparel, and communicating with the public while stocking shelves. The hardest part of the job was stacking pallets and carts. I had a great supervisor but management was unreliable. I would enjoy working this position again with pride."
good,"managers expectations are not what they used to be."
good,If you are second shift and an unloader ots hard work but its so fun with the right team. The store sometimes feed their employees when you meet the status quota set set for tht quarter nd holidays
good,"Wal-Mart does not provide adequate compensation for the stress level of the work, does not treat employees respectfully, and does not provide sufficient hours or wages for the amount of work required of associates. When they provide pay raises or bonuses they reduce hours to nullify costs of any benefits employees receive."
good,Management are promoted based on a written test without any leadership or management skills. Promotions do not happen unless you score high enough on a test that does not have anything to do with management skills.
good,"No work /life balance, had to work sick never wanted to give you days off. like its your fault no one comes to work. The harder you work , its like you get punished"
good,I transferred my job from MI to IN and my pay was cut 10 cent as if that was really hurting them.  That wasn't good enough pay for the job performance I had given.
good,Empresa média para trabalhar e crescer. Pouca valorização pessoal.
good,Long days and management did not stand by their associates. Hard days had good people you work with but favoritism was shown.  The hard workers jus was made to work hard no incentive and no paid holidays
good,I will talk in person but will not post any information about this company. Need to email me or call this is all i will offer you.I cannot offer anymore information but will explain to my new employer
good,Working at Walmart was kind of a good experience. I was able to interact with various different ethic groups daily. I love the constant conversations I was able to have with each individual customer
good,Working here was not all that bad. I would say that the pay was the issue. The distance I had to drive and the pay just did not make it worth my staying there. Management at the time was great as well as my coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, my direct boss was awesome. Corporate culture was horrible, they disregarded their own policies, we had to routinely remind them of HIPPA regulations (worked in the pharmacy)."
good,Work hard and they do care on u giving up your time from your family but if u call in cause I have little one to lay time they will let u go with no remorse
good,"I was the manager for three department.  I was always stressed out, not enough time in my work schedule to complete tasks, sometimes work through my lunch break."
good,OK place to work terrible management. Pay checks are always on time. Lack of help. Always being threatened by management for not moving fast enough. Your fastest pace is never fast enough.
good,"help customers find things, organize and clean front area around cash registers, ring out customers.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with other cashiers that would disappear from their registers or come back late from their breaks or lunch break when things were busy.  Front end supervisors and manages didn't seem to care."
good,"managers dont care about you at all, only good thing is pay. The point system is awful too. it doesn't matter if you had to call out for an emergency or not if you do and you have too many points they WILL fire you. They dont care AT ALL."
good,"Um treinamento de primeira,atendimento para vendas bem forte metas e cumprimento com as recompensas de vendas."
good,"Great entry level job for the young.  However, there is little concern for work/life balance and even less worry about common sense.  I would not consider it for a part time job nor for an experienced worker."
good,Low pay and not enough hours. However the environment was enjoyable and the associates are friendly. I was there for remodel so some of the managers from other stores did not get along with each other which made it difficult for us working under them and just being hired as new employees. Also I received low pay for very hard work.
good,I have seen alot of changes in the  years I have worked for this business. Its all based on store manager an actually feeling like your family an not just a number or another person.
good,Very busy once you arrive and thru out the day it got slower also sometimes given to much work that wasn't able to get thru all of it with in an 8 hour shift
good,Management likes to schedule you 6-7 days concurrent all because the work week ends in the middle of them. I learned that its best to stay to yourself because drama is everywhere.
good,"Do not expect to be appreciated by anyone other than coworkers on your level. Customers are quick to snap. You will enjoy your coworkers though. The people you will work with become life long friends, and the skills you learn there are highly useful in future job endeavors."
good,"Overall it’s seasonal for some people, it’s fast pace and work is good a lot of memorizing and training goes into it and they are picky about wardrobe"
good,anyone can work here. Was pretty boring for me but nice to get a paycheck. Anyone can make this job work for them. Mostly nice people i worked with....
good,"Half Hour doing tasks for managers on arrival"
good,"Empresa dinamica boa de trabalhar , contudo precisa melhorar a remuneração"
good,Walmart was a big experience for me because I met alot of rude people especially management. I'm not going to blast them but I would never ever work for them again. Plus the pay was bad. 9.50 an hour an to overstock at night is no good.
good,I loved working for walmart just didn't feel appreciated they cut hours fit the cashiers every week didn't make enough to cover my bills had to get another job
good,Working at Walmart you have to be prepared to have several job titles at once and getting used to not being able to finish certain job duties due to the lack of associates.
good,It was okay. The managers didn't help when asked questions. Got my sales floor training right away. They wouldn't let me complete computer training for about a good half a year.
good,I go in sign into the necessary equipment so that I can perform my job duties. The hardest part of the job is when a customer order something and we don't have it on the shelf.
good,When I would first get there i would start pushing cart. I had to walk the parking lot and find all the carts so that I could bring them in to the store
good,"Great place to work if you only need to support yourself, other then that it is hard to move up in the company unless you have the years to back you experience is not needed."
good,"I work at Walmart for many years and it's a good company with positive and negative like any other company however, overall it's a good place to work. The negative are a lot of stress and limited job work / life balance however, the compensation for co-manager and higher are good."
good,Good experience overall everyone was pleasant and helpful. Moved alot of freight out of that backroom with my crew and enjoyed working with a great group of people.
good,I had a great time at walmart my hard work got me promoted 3 times .management there really don't care about the associates .but overall it was ok .thank you walmart
good,Well a typical day at work depends on  what your doing inside the store. If your doing stock; your making sure your pulling the right product for your area off the pallet that shipping and receiving has put there that goes on the shelf from your L-cart or rocket cart.Then if your a cashier your ringing people up that are finished with there shopping. Otherwise it's customer service all day helping customers find what they are looking for throughout the store. The most enjoyable part of the job having a AWESOME day keeping smiles on everyone's faces. Turning frowns upside down is the best of all. :-)
good,"It's the same thing day in and day out. You show up, clock in and start working whatever it is you do then clock out. Depending on the shift you work determines how hard a job you have."
good,"Chefia boa, sabe ouvi seus funcionários, muitas oportunidades de aprendizado."
good,"Walmart is a rather good place to work at it just comes down to how hard you work and if you do work hard youre going to get a lot of hours, regardless if you want them or not. That was my biggest issue as a student who is also working I did not want a lot of hours but they kept giving them to me because of my work ethic and ability to get things done, which for a person looking to make good money would be great just not so good for students."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good entry level position and offers room for advancement. Once you get to a salaried position, the amount of hours you will need to put in to be successful leaves little time for anything else"
good,"Walmart still believes in quick turnover of employees.  They want the mentally simple but large amount of work done quickly in most cases and are happy to churn through employees in the belief that they will eventually find a machine out there capable of the task."
good,"Worked as part of a renovation crew for a complete store overhaul. Worked full time nights setting up the store for a grand opening. Moved old fixtures, built new ones, stocked new departments."
good,Working here wasn’t so great due to poor management but make great friends at work help you to have smooth work days along with putting smiles on the customers face .
good,Great company for the benefits not recommend work flow environment. Management not trained properly nor cared about employees needs. Management not trust worthy
good,"Don't expect anything to be done the way the company wishes is to.  Managers each have there own way they want you to do each job, while expecting you to hold to the standards and time limits set forth by the company, without using the company standard methods.  Managers are always the last to learn and adopt any new policies and will take out there aggression at being wrong on their associates."
good,"I had an enjoyable experience while I worked here for this company, I loved the managers we had and I liked how it was during the 3rd shift which was from 10pm-7am. I didn't like however was that you had to work 90 days straight to receive any benefits, the pay was wonderful but I wish they gave more time for breaks."
good,"Wait till the dust settles before joining brick and mortar retail industry.  "
good,"Started as a cashier, but became the gopher. I did 12 jobs with minimum wage salary. If you are a cashier stay a cashier. customer service managers no nothing and are cashiers on power trips."
good,as a CSM I would put each cashier to task and made sure that they got there breaks on time.  I helped them with drawer audits and customer complaints.  I enjoyed working with the public and being able to walk around and help people.
good,"I start off on computer for training. Then I would stock after about 2-3 hours of that. You get hands-on training for like 10 minutes then it's all on you. I'd say the hardest part for an employee that doesn't shop at Walmart a lot would be finding the items you need to stock. The Most enjoyable part was nothing."
good,Worked full time hours for 3 of the 4 years I worked there. Would not make me full time. They refuse to hire on full time. Don't want to pay benefits.
good,"Structured Days"
good,You take the good with the bad. Sometimes things are great sometimes they are not. Corporate layoffs have become more prevalent in the passing years which sometimes creates a Culture of Fear that being said it's a job and they don't pay as terrible as some others
good,"Walmart is good to work at if you like to interact with people. You get the good, the bad, and the occasional ugly. Depending on what location, depends on the management."
good,"Working at Walmart would not be so bad if there was a cohesive management staff that would listen to their associates and that would communicate with one another.  Our quarterly bonuses are basically stolen from us by our management staff and the associates get blamed for everything.  They use the pay as a source of shutting us up, but pay doesn't mean anything if we are being treated unfairly.  No one listens; Management doesn't care and if they can find a reason to fire you, they will!  It just would be a better place to work if management didn't see the associates as pawns to play with and if they would listen to us."
good,Hated working there. They wouldn’t take the time to teach us. Worked there 11 years and never moved up. If managers didn’t like you then you wasn’t going anywhere.
good,On my typical day of work it was exciting. I got to experience new benefits I never had during my years of working. The pay was great. The managers taught me how to handle situations differently then I did before
good,Walmart has very low standards for their employees. Managment isnt very helpful or knowledgable about store policies causing contradictions and idk jngs
good,"Management is crazy. they are blamed for things they can not control. schedules are made incorrectly or employees call out and cause big lines. People come just to yell. There is tons of theft at federal way. The store is huge. supervisors are cool depending. its not too hard to learn any of the positions. there are lots of computer training and shadowing before left on your own. as a cashier if there is a problem after a transaction or the people wont listen or are mad, u can always call supervisors or management to deal with it. I called out all the time. I got 18 points and they called me in. excused a few and sent me to work. came back again a few months later, same thing. finally I was tired of low pay and kept calling out. after 20 they said corporate says bye."
good,The job was working for less then anyone in the store while also doing the most demanding job. Management for my specific area and in the time frame i worked there 4 managers came and left leaving my group of employees hurt in the process. This meant scheduling issues and much more confusion for the stockers. If you are on your last resort then I'd say this is the job for you but if you can get anything but here I'd choose that. The student and work balance was rare and weekends are a must work it took me over 6 months to get one day off a weekend to focus on my studies.
good,"If you like working with little to no staff and unrealistic productivity standards then this is the company for you!  An average day consists of wondering whether or not you will have a full crew of skeleton crew to work your shift. During your day you may have all the supplies you need to complete your task, but be prepared to have to decline service to a customer because you don't have the proper supplies to service their vehicle."
good,"worked as a fresh food associate. overall the job wasn't that bad. The pay was pretty decent, and for the most part, the hours were consistent. I will not recommend working at this particular Walmart superstore to any of my friends or family for the one aspect of management treats you like your nothing, anything goes wrong its always your fault even if you didn't do it or were not even in the store at the time. even when you try to defend yourself they just blow you off."
good,A typical day would be checking out people that have gotten done shopping. The manager at the time was not a nice person. Would not work with you. It was interesting to see all the different types of people and get to talk to them while checking them out
good,"I did learn a lot . I did enjoy the people I worked with, we were like family. The management team at the store I worked at were all about there selves and the employees"
good,We were always understaffed. The lack of knowledge from the managers of what actually needed to be done in the departments made it hard for them to know how much staffing was required.
good,"A typical day varies, no day is completely the same. Sometimes, a lot of the times there isnt enough workers to run the floor, so you are covering more than one area. You gain knowledge of your surrounding areas because you work there so much. When it comes to managers, while they do try to help, Walmart gives them an overwhelming amount of things to complete so they arent really attentive. You might know more about the company and its functions than the managers who are over you. Most enjoyable part of the job is more than likely the people you work with. If you have a nice and fun atmosphere then you usually have a really great store. Most people who are at walmart stay because of the associates and a constant paycheck not because of the company. The hardest part of the job is working every holiday and not having a set schedule. Also just because you are full time doesnt mean youll get 35-40 hours a week. Sometimes youll be given 16. Also most of the time if you do overtime they cut you before the work week ends."
good,"I wouldn't recommend working at Wal-Mart to any of my family or friends ,you are overworked and underpaid and always have to do a job that isn't in your job description to cover someone else"
good,"The job asks for more than it is willing to give. But it does grow to feel normal fast and makes you feel secure, so that you could wind up working there for a long time with little motivation of moving on."
good,"I worked the night shift.  There were a number of people who worked, others did not work too much.  I was always called to other areas after I completed my work, while others really did not work as hard."
good,Walmart is a great work opportunity our store just needed more Associates the only thing is it was a struggle to get my work done and another Associates work done every night
good,the company has gotten away from its core beliefs.The company has downsized to the point it does not have any customer service that is being provided to the customer. They continue to gear themselves in such a way that there will be little to no serve provided in the stores.
good,no place for advancement and hard to ask for days off. 2 paid 15 minuye breaks and an hour lunch but they don't want you to leave the parking lot or go anywhere.
good,loved the people i worked with. made some great friends but management is horrible. walmart doesnt truly care about their employees. overall an ok experience
good,You have to been there a while to do or get anything from Walmart. Management have who they want to work with far as the Schedule. If you have young kids not the place to work want work around schedules..
good,"Would be better if your pay matched your workload. "
good,What I like about Walmart is that it gives you the opportunity to further your career. Its great on a resume and its an awesome job to have for the beginning of your career.
good,Certain things have changed at this company since my employment period there but overall the employees are mostly friendly. Not as understanding about employee concerns with health issues as would be expected of an employer.
good,This retailer is changing daily.  There are many good changes and some bad changes. Management levels are working long hours and the return is little.
good,"Walmart and the idea of what Walmart stands for is a fantastic idea and I think that the founders of the said company had the right Idea."
good,"Walmart has made my work experience easy and fun. I enjoy my job, position and work mates. We have a wonderful working relationship. I would recommend walmart."
good,"walmart was a decent place to work for, lots of hours, high demand, cut hourly hours in spring months and add some around peak times. lot of extra work."
good,"good place to start out , some favortism is showed, work was fun, good fellow associates, upper management was difficult at times. i learned a lot about good customer service., helping fellow coworkers, and achieving goals."
good,Management can very poor and have no compassion. You can meet some phenomenal human beings. Other times some unpleasant customers and employees. A typical work day can be ever changing. Constant changes.
good,"my main gripe about this job is that I've been with it for over 7 months, working 40 hours a week, and not receiving any full time benefits. My position is considered part time by management"
good,Walmart is a very relaxed place to work in just the pay rates are very low for experienced and qualified candidates. But it is a good job for people with less bills and no kids..
good,"•Responsible for assisting the Manager on duty by overseeing the complete functions of the entire store's operations. Directing a staff as large as fifty or more Associates. ... Customer Service Managers are responsible for ensuring the highest level of customer service throughout the entire store."
good,"largest retailers in the world got that way by putting the customer and employee first. sam walton's concept was to put people FIRST. sadly, every day, its fading away."
good,"Due to the continued changes at the company, many are choosing to jump ship. The company has changed over the last 2 to 3 years. Thousands of people have lost jobs and it isn't slowing down. The recent changes are making quite a few people very concerned."
good,For the amount of work I did I was underpaid and under recognized.  I did the job of two people many times and never recieved the full yearly raise.  I didn't feel I would get anywhere with that job and thus they lost a good employee.
good,"Wolves come in sheep clothing.  Can't trust mgmt.  Good days off, poor work life balance, culture is one of family but that is not true."
good,At times we often have to deal with rude managers and Customers but its best just to do your job and stsy humble Customets are always right even though we may disagree with them
good,"Walmart would be a great place to work if you could find a store where long-term associates are willing to learn the new processes and stop doing it the way they want to, thus allowing everyone to be friends. It tends to be sort of hostile otherwise."
good,"If you have an open schedule they'll screw you over wanting you to work a night shift one day then the opening shift just a day later.  If you're more fixed with your schedule you'll do better.  I got $10 dollars an hour which is better than minimum wage but not by much. I'll only work their again if I really have too.  "
good,Poor management for the front of the store but it's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's a very fast paced environment and you have to be quick on your feet but polite.
good,The only complaint is that they really don't care for their employees. If your sick they don't take the time to know if you have gone to see a doctor and if your going to have an excuse. Which they don't take and hurts n the long run
good,"Wal-Mart is one of those places where you go to get started, to get your foot in the door. Definitely did not have the opportunities for advancement, nor was the salary worth the work you put in. Management didn't even bother to learn names, very poor communication."
good,It wasn't a bad place to work but my department was bad management  I worked hard for something not worth working hard for I ran my head off and its very fast passed
good,"While employed at Walmart, I had multiple managers that were very unprofessional in their ""punishments."" For example, one manager started calling me profane names while on the floor; however, she did not get in trouble whatsoever."
good,"Hours are okay as part-time, although I was being worked full-time hours and was not receiving benefits nor was I offered them. Usually no issue with management, although a few are very rude to associates and are sometimes contradicting each other or policies and training."
good,"I love the people I work with, but the mangers are lazy and don't know what they're doing half the time Also make you work harder to pick up the slack"
good,"Quite simply, a job.  No frills.  Not much else to say other than if you show up for your shift, you'll get a paycheck.  Not much of an opportunity for anything else.  Getting full-time schedule was near impossible."
good,"While working for Walmart I noticed a few things, like the fact that the managers were taking all the hours from the people that truly need them. I didn't have that happen to me but my colleagues definitely suffered."
good,"Supervision of associates"
good,Not all workers were treated the same. Some workers were rude and sexist. An okay working environment. I'd always get my job done. Both men and women was treated equally must of the time.
good,"They were unwilling to work around my complex schedule, and after a while I stopped getting hours.  Assistant managers were not great, and working Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Eve should be a crime."
good,"I really enjoyed my job, most of the time its fast paced and that made time go by rapidly. "
good,"The store I worked was a good store. Loved working with the customers and most of the associates, would like to see more accountability towards the hourly management, they seem to do what they want."
good,"Working at Walmart was okay. I worked overnight (10pm to 7 am) and let me tell you... there's hardly any work/life balance because that shift leaves you drained! And on top of it being a long overnight shift, you're on your feet the entire time besides your breaks and lunches. Breaks and lunches were fair, but it sucked having to wait for a manager to tell you when to go. I worked hard consistently and most customers loved me (except for the rude ones of course) and practically all of the managers loved me to so they were fair when letting us go for breaks and lunches. Pay at the time (2014 - 2015) was like $8.75 for overnight I think. It definitely could've been better. After working as a cashier for a while I was moved to zoning and stocking inventory in the cosmetics department a lot. It was pretty fun and relaxed as I was able to do my own thing as long as my pallets were cleared by morning. I wasn't considered full time so there weren't any benefits other than the 10% discount. It's a pretty basic job, not really difficult other than dealing with the long lines as a cashier and handling heavy boxes as a stocker."
good,Most days at work were ok. others not so great. the position that I was employed in demands a lot out of you. it is a physical work environment and constant moving is the overall basis of what we do.
good,"My associates were the reason I came into work every day. "
good,"It just a job. One thing I do enjoy is getting to know a lot of people. The only thing I hate is poor management and communication. I felt like nobody really cared about their job. It got to a point it became unstaffed which puts more work on the cashiers, hard to communicate with managers when you need help, and you always feel like you get blamed for stuff but yet you only have so little power to do anything about it. They barely train you so you are stuck doing work with no clue to what your position is. I absolutely hated this job. Some might feel differently but I choose to be a human being, not a number to them."
good,"Walmart, in general can be a frustrating place to work. Especially around the holidays. The busiest times of the year are the only times you maintain decent hours unless you are full time, unfortunately."
good,The employees at Walmart seems to be mostly temporary like students and people between choice jobs. I was in the wireless department so I only had to work with a select group of customers.
good,Working for walmart consumes all of your time and they are insensitive to you having  to care for your child(ren). The other workers have  bad attitudes due  to customers wanting discounts  on already low prices.
good,"I  liked my associates, no drama but management was very poor. Pay was unfair. Cap 2 did all of Walmart’s work including all shifts positions. I️t wasn’t fair getting paid minimum wage"
good,Good place to work. Horrible pay! Managers were friendly. Training was non existent. Store was poorly organized and under staffed. Made it stressful to fulfill customers needs.
good,horrible upper management. the management expectly one person tp get too much done. they pick favorites. they let some people walk around and do no work while expecting others to constantly to work.
good,only best for temporary job unless you are able to get into management. The scheduling system will not always be flexible and kill hours if you don't have full availability.
good,would be much better if the boss would have treated us more like people than figures on a spreadsheet. i have children so the attendance was a bit difficult for me . you cant miss 3 days in your first 5 months
good,"Management would change general rules day to day never back up decisions company does not backup employee,s don't give steady guidelines change from manager to manager shift to shift"
good,I have worked at Walmart for a long time. I enjoy the enviorment and the people I have met throughout my journey. I like that I can invest in stocks and I enjoy the bonus that we get every month.
good,"Management could have be better, great employees. Don’t get personal with managers or comfortable, always remember they have a job to do st the end of the day."
good,Managers were spread out everywhere and only minimal training was applied to the positions I worked at. There was hardly any balance between job life and school life with a higher demand for work than school.
good,"A typical day at work began with a huddle meeting and delegation of duties that day. Typically we'd unload and sort the daily shipments of merchandise. We'd, then restock the shelves with appropriate groceries. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks and sorting the merchandise. Those boxes and cases were often and some even had broken glass. The culture there was definitely customer service and goal oriented  During my time at Walmart, I learned how to better work and cooperate with a team. I honestly don't remember any fun working there, just work."
good,"The coworkers and work environment was actually alright, the managers lacked humanity and barely knew how to fulfill the obligations of their positions."
good,"I enjoy working here overall. The other associates were nice to work with. If you're full time and they aren't cutting your hours it's fine. The benefits aren't the best. But the quarterly raises were nice, IF they were able to give a decent amount. With the new changes in scheduling and other changes going on in the store, it's become more of a hindrance to work there. Not sure if it's worth staying here to be honest."
good,Need management did take the time to get to know their employees. No consideration for their employees. Uses policy to benefit themselves. Poor people skills.
good,"This place sucked hired me under the pretense that they would be flexible with schedule, due to me beng a student, they were not, and not responsible with HR department"
good,"culture is good but at store level, each is operating differently. I have experienced  or seen favorite treatment shown to associates, also indifference toward over 40 employees , there is a lack of communication and follow up from management, no holding overnight managers/CAP team members for what they fail to accomplish, put  or stock products wherever they want."
good,Only if u need a job and you're in school they're not understanding sick or well. Never give hours and work much more than what you are paid to do there.
good,"Generally, pretty low stress if you're ok at your job. You'll probably be shifted around to understaffed departments which is nice to get out of your assigned one. Though they say you have potential to receive a raise at your three month review, Ive only ever heard that theyve told people ""you can always do better"". If you do receive a raise, itll most likely be after six month, and pretty minimal."
good,Market level management and above set expectations too high on a daily basis. Basic job duties are hard to meet when you are given extra work tasks that take all of your shift and still expected to have basic daily duties complete also.
good,Working at Walmart gave me the opportunity to improve my customer service experience and work ethics and the ability to multitask and work in different teams.
good,"I worked for this company for over 13 years and did not make what I deserved when I left. There have been many changes the past couple years with their pto & raises also that the associates did not benefit from. On a good note, I did have some amazing managers on my journey!"
good,a typical day as a Walmart employee at moutrie store 952 is being told by manage ment that you will work in a area you arn't trained in and when you complain getting writen up for saying as much. on top of that when you do manage to get training it is not on paper do they dont have to pay you for the amount of work you do. you are through back and forth to cover other people but not getting any help.
good,Walmart has really bad management and everyone there is being and cause so much drama isn't an healthy work place. Also so of mangers do things wrong and show you the wrong way and you don't know its wrong way till same manger writes you up.
good,"It was okay, sorta stressful, was given night shift hours over summer break and the hours were just not for me. Not difficult work mainly trying to look busy and get work done."
good,"Wal-Mart is for the retired or the people going to school. In all honesty, i wouldn't recommend this job if your a timid person. wal-mart is fast paced and it really depends on your managers, whether or not you will enjoy your time with the company."
good,I loved my job at times but i have seizures and every time i would have one i would have to come in the next day in pain because i wasn't a loud to call in with out it being taken off . i did managers work without the pay for over two months hoping i would become a manager but they would never give me the job. Finally had to leave because i was tired of doing the work of others and tired of having to work in pain after a seizure.
good,The district manager have lack of communication poor decision-making the company and the people I worked around we're absolutely wonderful I hated watching in the close their doors the customers were amazing watching and come back every year
good,It was easy flowing and fine. I didn't mind the other employees or the costumers. It's like most other retail jobs. You have good days and some not so good days.
good,It has it perks honestly the pay is horrible with the pay they give you I wouldn't recommend going in a regular associate I advise you go in as a supervisor or manager
good,The job itself was fine. Everything else was less than ideal. the front end wasnt as managed as well as it could have been. Too many conflicting policy changes.
good,A typical day at work is dealing with impatient customers.                        I learned how to work on cars and how to take and put on tires.              The management was defiantly could have been better.                           We always kept the workplace clean so we didnt have an injury.             The hardest part of the job was getting the cars out at a decent time.    The most enjoyable part was learning how to change oil and tires and working with great people.
good,The job role was very demanding but nothing to hard to handle. Just wish management showed a little more consideration for the rest of the workers. The associates and the customers are fun to work with.
good,"A typical day at work would involve unloading our daily two trucks, keeping the backroom clean, restocking store shelves, and taking care of whatever problems customers have given any opportunity."
good,"Worked at Walmart for two years some days are good and others are unbearable. The pay is so low I can just barely pay my bills, and I work 40 hours a week, and if anyone has even 5 minutes of OT you either must cut it or be written up. I do enjoy working with most of the associates and most members of management."
good,"Work there is really not that hard if you apply yourself,  However, if you do not kiss butt, disagree with management and are repressed from voicing your opinion, not for you.  Management would rather back customers that are wrong and give them anything they want instead of backing up their employees.  Not allowed to defend yourself and they don't enforce their own rules and policies.  Instead, they discipline their employees for trying to enforce their policies and hate anyone who disagrees with their decisions.  Do not like independent thinkers."
good,"Greet customers, scan and bag groceries.  Cash reconciliation, handling of credit cards and issuing of Money orders.  Occasionally coping of keys.  Answer and redirect incoming calls."
good,"is Walmart what do you want to know? just like customer service. "
good,"since i was the only decorator weekends were hectic, "
good,"Walmart is fine for something temporary, but it will never get you to where you want to be. Don't settle for anything less. You can always do more...."
good,"A typical day of work was constantly walking around the isle of the gardening section and making sure items were in stock. I learned that it is beneficial for me to help more, for advancement of time and productivity. Management was decent, although my manager was rarely around it felt. The workplace culture was very odd for me, the upper-level managers were very encouraging and friendly. While, the workers would play into it, behind closed doors they were rude to each other and had cliques. The hardest part of the job was I did not feel challenged enough, and would result in disappointment for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was unloading the trucks, watering the plants when that time would come, as well as actively engaging the customers and making sure their needs were met."
good,"Well my first month working there was to much of waste of time,so by the first 30 minutes re-cleaning the dish rags so they can be ready for basic countertops,racks, coat hangers, walls, door handles,door knobs, ceilings lights,"
good,"After a year and a half I wanted to move to a different department in the store, provided career preference using the computer,(The preferred way to get you started), wrote on the hiring priority blackboard to let HR know I was interested to find it erased, and let my assistant manager know and she suggested that I didn't hit save on my career preference, which, to be honest was a pretty lame excuse because I had done it several times. "
good,"Wal-mart made too much money not to pay their employees a better wage. The work load was extremely heavy, supervisor piled lots of work on you. It was fine because it kept me busy. I learned to keep your mouth shut and don't ask question. I learned there was a great deal of favortisim. The work culture was not great but the co-workers made it better. The hardest part of the job was trying to make it on the low salary. The most enjoyable was the customers. I enjoyed talking with them and assisting them."
good,Best thing to do is mind your business in this company. They fire people left & right for reasons that vary but some are defiantly unfair. The paycheck in my eyes is not worth all the drama.
good,"Decent benefits due to my department being part of optical we received free eye exams. They were NOT provided by Walmart but by the doctor working at our office. The price for the glass is decent if you have the employee discount however the frames are meh at best. Work hours are flexible and management at least in the store I worked at was fantastic. Overall, I learn A LOT but due to the low pay I decided to move on to green pastures."
good,"I would work for Walmart again, maybe different store would have been a better choice. I traveled to other stores to help with backroom and stocking needs. Walmart paid for travel food and logding made the job interesting."
good,"I prefer better hours like my co-workers, but looking for full time with benifts and and opportunities for advancements the hards part is they move you around alot. The most enjoyable the co worker and when it's time to leave."
good,Working area is full of fun. All the coworkers were friendly. Break time was the best part as every 2 hours there was 15 minutes break and 1 hour full break that makes working very easy.
good,Walmart is a good place to work although they have poor management there and lack of respect for others. I’ve stayed at Walmart for Almost two years and I’ve enjoyed some of my time there but mostly I didn’t.
good,"I was a manager at Wal-Mart for three years. I received a pay increase twice, once was when they raised the minimum wage. I have only been evaluated twice in my three years and only was coaches as an entry-level associate. They are not very selective when it comes to hiring managers and do not do a very good job as evaluating and re-evaluating them as they progress through the business. The higher up the ladder, the less-qualified the managers are. Very few store-level salaried managers are knowledgeable about the basic core principles and standards of their own business at the store level. The pay and benefits are pretty great. It is very stressful in some spots of the store and others are extremely uneventful. Hours are very available and as an entry-level associate, they are not steady. Department managers, support managers, and salaried have steadier hours."
good,"Management is very inconsistent, shifts are extremely inconsistent, been with company for over 8 years and it doesn’t mean anything. Very stressful. Need something more consistent"
good,"A good place to start and can keep a job or move up indefinitely if you are willing to be treated poorly and taken advantage of. The company chooses to keep the wrong people around such as, people with bad work habits and low work ethic. There are hard workers and good people but are out numbered by comers and goers."
good,Buena empresa con buenos propósitos pero pésimo sueldo
good,"Breaking down freight such as frozen diary pallets caping binned products. Facing and zonig products. Labeling, tagging products. Assisting customers with needs to find product. working with multiple ppl from different ethnic groups. Hardest part of job is being under staffed. Management is ok. Most enjoyable part of job is customer service. Learned how to change on-hands to store inventory and operate a baylor."
good,"Set up back room to unload trucks, use of forklift to get pallets, unloaded trucks and sorted the merchandise on correct pallets. Signed in to tasks and completed them in the time allotted. Used rocket and L carts to move merchandise from backroom to sales floor, checked location of merchandise to see if it would go out to the shelves, if not binned items into back steel bins, and finalized thems. Finished all tasks for the day, and cleaned up for the night."
good,I feel that Walmart does not treat their employees with any type of respect. The management at the Walmart I worked at was terrible. I do not recommend working for Walmart unless you have no other options.
good,The hours and paid no good. They work you hard but no money to show for it. The manager only care about the store and customer always right. They show favoritism to employees. Sometime the discounts is no good.
good,"If management didn't act like they were god or tried to take you back to the old slave days, it would be a really good company to work for. When you report the managers to corporate, their attitudes towards you are worse. Most salaried managers don't like working. All that they want to do is give instructions however, most of them can not do the job that they are telling you to do. Nor do they help when you are working short. Salaried managers hire family or family friends to work under them and allow them to relax while others are busting their behinds to make the department successful."
good,This was my first job in high school. It was only for a half a yr and it has completely changed since 2009. I was one of the many who helped the redmodel look it has now.
good,"Assessing the nightly work load"
good,"Walmart is a wonderful career for anyone straight out of high school. Great work for a college student, as they are flexible with hours, and they will help you out with scheduling as much a possible."
good,"The pay is competitive with other retail jobs in the area. The customers were not so bad if you were a sales floor associate, but it was pretty rough if you were a cashier all the time. As a cashier you are kinda stuck at your register until a Customer Service Manager shows up so if a customer is screaming in your face or threatening you, you are expected to stand and take it until the manager shows up. I loved working on the sales floor stocking merchandise, helping customers, and cleaning up my area."
good,Hardest part was figuring out ad matching which they no longer accept.  Second hardest was running the self checkout area.  And last was remembering how to use things like gift cards and wic/ food stamps benefits at checkout.
good,"I enjoyed working with almost all of the customers and most of the employees.  "
good,I like working for Wal-Mart because I meet new people everyday. I learn where everything is located. Customers are really friendly.  The workers help out when they can.
good,"Never have a family emergency, because they don't care why you are out but how you will make it to work on time. "
good,As a store manager in the early 2000s it was a very challenging time for the company. Poor leadership from the CEO. We tried to be our competition instead of being ourselves.
good,Walmart gives no overtime at all same check all year round except for bonuses. Which don't be alot at my store. Rude customers and sometimes the rules are absurd.
good,"They only give you 2 days off per year and you need to use your PTO you earn after 6 months of working there.  If you dont ""cut it"" then you will be let go.  Their production goals in certain jobs are EXTREMELY unreasonable, their management team sucks, they cant keep employees there because of how bad they are treated"
good,You are rushed to help other employees even if you are not finish with your assignment and you still are held accountable to finish your work. and you don't always get help when you have to finish your own assignment.
good,Had a good time at walmart just some things I didn't really agree on the schedules where not so great and didn't really wan to help me on my second job I had with the schedule
good,"working at Walmart is an alright job. there is a good atmosphere. i worked at Walmart on two separate occasions, one as a cap 2 team member, and as a cashier. working as a cap 2 team member was horrible. unloading those big trucks in the heat of the day in the middle of summer really takes its toll on you. working as a cashier is actually really good. there is a good atmosphere of people just trying to make it through. people are better than they seem, and i loved that part of my job, and i would do it again if i was'nt looking for a career ."
good,"Managers will belittle you infront of customers. Customers can be very disrespectful at times, but that is pretty much a given. It is constanly busy so be ready for stress."
good,"What can I say lots of drama due to the fact everyone working there is super young, my store maneger flirted with everyone in sight and the environment was toxic they sell you a idea of culture and beliefs and it isn’t true"
good,An overall good place to work with its ups and down. A friendly work environment. Depending on what manager was scheduled to work that evening leadership would vary. Poor working hours with one one hour break.
good,"People warned me about working at walmart but I didn't listen. Don't get me wrong walmart is not a bad job but I gets BUSY."
good,"Sales floor was always fast paced, however working on front end the time drags by preetty slow. Being a tire and Lube technician you make more and the days go by faster because you are almost always busy, the management is pretty solid at my store as well."
good,I worked in the Housewares Dept. no stress and helped out in the fabric dept. the hours were nights and weekends but for a stay at home mom with a husband working days it worked out for me. the only issue was they were not very flexible with the schedule
good,"Love working here but the Management sucks and is threatening, expect so much to be done in one day at a certain time and you basically lose time with family and your social life"
good,The years I have worked for Wal-Mart have been great. I'm just looking for something more challenging and better pay for my work. Management is slowly going downhill.
good,Management at my location is horrible. They are never on one accord. The store manager only engages once the District and Market Managers do a store visit. The only reason I would honestly recommend employment is because  they don't drug test unless you apply for a management or vehicle operating position.
good,"somewhat hap hazard in who in charge of who interesting when you stay away from supervisors customers lots of fun some very nice some very yucky"
good,I am greatful for the opportunity given to me by walmart and learned a lot of valuable skills during my time with the company. However a poor infrastructure with little to no incentive to excedd minimum expectations causes a low moral amongst the crew which results in lower performance which has greatly influenced my desire to seek new opportunities.
good,"A typical day is fast-paced, yet rewarding. The hardest part of my job was learning the inventory in the backroom, which once I caught on, it was a breeze. My favorite part of the whole experience was the chance to meet people from all walks of life."
good,I would actually go bacc and work at a different walmart. I enjoyed my time there it was very free flowing and everyone basically cared about you and what was goin on
good,"Good products.  Easily sold.  Loved this position in a supervisor role."
good,"poor managment but very fun people to work with. i did wenjoy the discounts only worked half the time , your team mebers are very friendly but will not help unless you ask for hlelp"
good,A typical work day at Walmart is stressful. You never know what you're going to come in and do that day. Management has favoritism. Everything is just unorganized.
good,"The job was easy and fun when you worked with customers, but the employees were more uptight. it was always slow and when things were caught up like sticking or cleaning you would be yelled at for trying to help other areas, or for waiting."
good,"It began as a good place to work, but as good managers and employees left, job satisfaction decreased. There is a lot of drama and gossip. Coworkers smile in your face and talk behind your back."
good,"Love the job, unable to continue because Walmart cannot provide regular work hours or a regular schedule. Most of management is friendly and approachable, however they operate within the confines of a corporate structure.  They are totally inflexible about most things."
good,"Walmart can be ok if you can put up with always working the same schedule always there on weekends and holidays, discounts are good breaks and lunches are mandatory"
good,"Flexible hours all shifts available graveyard days "
good,I really loved my job at Walmart but I felt like I never got to spend time with my family. I loved the associates and what they on a day to day basis to make our customers feel welcome and to make the store look great
good,"A typical day is going to work, making sure breaks and lunches are given. "
good,Working for Walmart as a CSM is nothing other than stressful. You have many different people calling your name. Many cashiers that are not properly trained nor an attitude that needs to be seen by customers. Walmart hires too many young people simply looking to collect a pay check without having to provide any labor.
good,"I am constantly being stressed about time management and the lack of short staff in the department. It's always cold and you have to move very fast. You are not always provided with the equipment to do your job. Management does not have patience with new Associates. You may get looked down or get yelled at for making a mistake. Sometimes (most of the time), you don't have time to get a break and if you do, be prepared to be behind the clock. The upside is that you get an hour lunch, unpaid of course."
good,It was a good when you were in actually in your department getting your stuff done. But you were constantly asked to help other departments and go outside to push carts in. And there were too many managers and they all told you to do something diffrent at the same time. So you always were in the wrong.
good,Its very easy long as you know what you are trained right. Very laid back long as your friends with the the top people if not you just might not get fair with the job.
good,"A typical day consisted of frequent early arrival times for clock in. With this company I got a brief understanding for how quickly foot traffic can change in the course of a day, as I stood at the entrance."
good,"it was a great job when I started but, after 12 managers the stress just became to much. The overall transformation of what was expected went from 10  to 0."
good,"Typical day at work for me included stocking of electronic items, I learned to work with a team.  The management was ok and understanding.  The culture was diversed, the hardest part of the job was trying to get the job completed with lack of associates needed for the entire store."
good,"Walmart is a difficult company to work for sometimes. You MUST push the Walmart Mastercard on customers to sometimes the point of discomfort on both ends. Most of my managers throughout my time there have been intimidating - I personally was threatened by my front-end manager that if I did not pick up my Mastercard sales, my hours would be cut."
good,"Poor management, no real care for employees, just a stressful work environment can make you feel as though you are doing things wrong, to many managers telling you all different things."
good,"I was not trained, Not a friendly team, co-workers knowingly went against regulations when it came to stocking, no communication, was told before hire I could get time off for siblings wedding & after hire was told I had no chance."
good,very hard and stressful job. physically and emotionally stressful. very fast paced and competitive. you only get two twenty minute breaks on a ten hour shift.
good,"While working for Walmart, I decided that since I could not advance in the work place that after 3 years it was time to move on. So I went to work for a company that started me out at a higher pay rate than Walmart."
good,I was accused of things that were not true and when asked to prove it they refused. They bribed me into trying to stay with them after I contacted an attorney.
good,"Managers weren't willing to work with people when it came to recieving the right amount of hours. "
good,"Working for the largest retailer in the USA in an urban setting and a focus store. Fast paced, problem solving and multi tasking was IMPARATIVE DAILY. Between the customer service side of the day, and the constant fires to put out in this retail setting, this store kept all the management team on their toes."
good,"Get to work first thing in the morning and employees are just sour."
good,Good work environment and lots of great people to work with as a team. Discount is good because you can shop at Walmart for many different things. I just wish they had more shifts aviable.
good,"Worked at Platte walmart and no one there knows how to shower or do their job. sucks. the water fountains have rust all over them, the toilets are sticky, and i dont like the way the door guard looked at me everyday."
good,"I did like working for Walmart, I would suggest finding a comfort zone because there is alot to do in Walmart. You could work for for years with no problems if you are in a good environment, however if not under the right management it would be your worst nightmare. And also it is important to know that with any position you get in walmart you will never avoid customers... Every position in a walmart location you will be dealing with customers"
good,"bad manager, who likes going inside Walmart at all? I had to leave that manager was quite disrespectful. I did not stay long enough to get benefits. I know the benefits are good"
good,"I overall liked working there, however it is highly stressful. the most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers, the hardest part was trying to keep the lines down to a minimum when only given a few cashiers to work with."
good,decent pay and horrible insurance and policy are made up as how they want to benefit them and to make them more productive .there are other dc that make more money.
good,"Management team is not on point with communication to their associates (e.g. One manager will tell you to do this, another manager will tell you otherwise). On days where the sales floor is short, the remainder of associates are expected to pick up the slack and overwork themselves. However, it is not like this every day."
good,if you like doing freight in the bakery it's the job for you. I do at least 4 pallets of freight every day and dough for bread is very heavy and this store goes thru a lot of bread.
good,"Demanding workloads and stunningly bad management, not all walmart stores are bad. Some free food is provided during events which is nice, the quarterly bonus is very helpful."
good,"not much help from management, lack of hired employees, bad work hours schedules, not much help from other employees due to poor manager for assigning people with duties and can not help with others"
good,"Go to meeting to receive the line-up of where you will be working, and then, this can change at any given time. At this current location, management does not ""flex-in"" to help with work load(s). Must keep an intense pace throughout the shift. Very hard on your body, even though I am in good physical condition."
good,Did not like the fact that they would promise me alot. And will not go thru the promise. Will try to make me do other associates jobs. Some associates are nice. Others not so nice. They had my schedule twisted... One day i would clock out at midnight. And had to clock in at 7:00 am. the next day.
good,"I was hired to do a totally different job than what I ended up performing. I was actually paid $2 more than others, based on my prior experience, and while it was still worth what they had me doing, it was not what I was hired to do."
good,"Even though you are kept busy, you do get your breaks on time. Your not allowed overtime, and your hours are inconsistent. You can have 20-30 hour weeks and then a whole moth be less than 20. Unfortunatly for my situation I either need more consistant hours or better pay."
good,It is like all other retail just good enough to earn some money but you can't count on it as a career specially if you are educated you will find much better job than working at Walmart.
good,Every day you were told you may lose your job regardless of store conditions and metrics. This happened in the last three years or I would still be there.
good,"Personally my experience with the wal-mart company was not good. I was always worried because my schedule got changed often, and i was not informed. This resulted in me being late several times witch ultimately led to my employment being terminated. also the support managers do nothing to help at all unless they are specifically told to do so. which is infuriating and unacceptable when there are customers that need help and not enough people to handle them."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart.  Customer service.  My coworkers and It was a clean place to work.        ..............................................
good,The managers were very inconsiderate when it came to health and time off. My Co-Workers made work enjoyable and go by fast. There was alot of physical work when stocking.
good,Great place if you a student of someone trying to get through school period. Not really good with benefits or hours being flexible and it’s very hard to take time off here even when sick.
good,"I enjoyed working there as a store standard, getting to know everyone and working hard. I only ended up leaving because a manager harassing me none stop about working more hours and quiting my other job, while also not giving me full time or benefits. If the job had advancement of any kind, would've stayed a bit longer."
good,Management leaves a lot to be desired and you leave work feeling stressed and under appreciated. The money and benefits are not worth the stress and over work and time away from family.
good,"Walmart is a good place to go if you are unemployed or need a second job to earn money to pay bills, buy presents for friends & family, etc. Unless you are able to be ""molded"" as they say, into what they are looking for for a management position, you will be stuck as an associate."
good,"Walmart is a really great company , but its not that well when it comes to managers scheduling employees and hours , they keep everything fresh and new"
good,"There are never enough employees scheduled and too many managers. The managers do not communicate with each other, which causes conflict. We have one Manager telling us to do a task one way and another manager telling us don't do it like that."
good,Walmart not bad place to work actually pretty easy going job stocking shelves .. I honestly didnt really like the pay csause  i found it hard to keep up with paying stuff with such a low pay
good,"I was part of the modular crew, something I didn't know the store had. work was easy and I enjoyed doing it. sucked that you only got paid 9 an hour specially working graveyard."
good,"I loved working at walmart. I didnt want to leave. But their policies on needed time off at unexpected time off was horrible especially when my father was in the hospital at the time. I wish walmart cared more about their employees familes and such. But because of their policies, my being absent or late, was out of their hands. I was in the top 5 for signing up people for walmarts credit cards. Your welcome walmart."
good,On a typical day I ran the front end watching over the cashiers making sure the money drawers balanced and customers were provided for. The front end of the store was my main responsibility. The only thing I did not like about working there was I felt there was never enough help.  They refused to hire cashiers to keep us staffed.
good,a typical workday at walmart was very smooth and fun working with different customers. i acheived more experience in customers service. the harderst part of being on the remodel team was removing and putting the stock shelves back it was kind of challenging. the most enjoyable part working at walmart was the laughs being in a good and fun atmosphere.
good,"I worked here for a few years. I won't mention which store it was however bad management played a big role in why I left. It was an ok job, and stressful."
good,"I experienced social segregation on a very extreme level. It felt extremely difficult to confide in supervisors in fear of being reprimanded for your concerns. When i expressed my concern for my financial stability and my well-being in terms of needing a better schedule and more hours, they in turn cut my hours and began treating me with disrespect."
good,Walmart it's self is not a bad company to work for management makes it hard for associates two years  in I'm not as excited as I was when I first started the company and working two store management is the same. Point system needs work.
good,"A typical work day I go in and check customers out."
good,"The other employees were wonderful. Some stayed friends with me long after I left. The management fired me for calling off 1 time during a temp position, I took off to take my 4 month old daughter to the Hospital as she had a 104 degree fever. But all is well and I left there for a better job"
good,"I worked long hours every day.  My staff hardly came to work, did not do as they were instructed to. Co-managers did not do there jobs correctly.  Very stressful place to work."
good,Not a lot of teamwork or communication no one seems to be o the same page in our area a lot of pointing fingers and no one ever seems to be held accountable for their actions
good,"inst a bad job but i was only there for about a month and had gone through three managers, they all werent the best, the job was simple but managment made it more than what it was."
good,"It is a job if you need to work. They are not willing to work with you if you are going to school, trying to better yourself. Even if you give them  your class schedule 2 months ahead."
good,"Its a good job if you were alone and just graduated Highschool. It was just stressful, everything just feels like everything is on the employee if everything is not done on the right time or done right."
good,"Walmart is a boring job, i'll be honest, you go there and most of the day you just stand there and are bored, its hard to get time off and I do not see myself staying there for too long."
good,Employees are overworked and not fairly compensated by the company. Most employees are struggling with paying their bills because of the lack of decent pay from the company.
good,Its very stressful and not worth it.I would'nt waste my time here especially if your young .Also they dont care about there workers put them to work all the time with out paying them right DONT DO IT.
good,"Ambiente bom para trabalho, aprendi novas funções  dentro da empresa"
good,"Enjoyable parts of job were helping customers and building experience but management takes advantage to put you in every position without proper pay for them and without proper breaks. I easily learned to multitask and great customer service skills along with the experience of being in multiple positions in the company (just without the pay for these positions). Coworkers varied either hard workers or lazy (which is everywhere really, but it was usually the latter here). If you find a reasonable manager and department there are positive aspects and room for advancement but these are hard to find from my previous experiences in this company. Scheduling and coverage were regularly a problem and it was difficult to get proper hours set up according to my needs."
good,"•	Leads the management team in facility operations and communicates with both management and hourly associates about facility operations, merchandising, and the company culture and mission.  Key role and expert in creating optimal front line customer relations, thereby ensuring continued company growth and goal achievement. Oversees the corporate compliance program, functioning as an evaluator of compliance issues/concerns within the facility.  Responsible to help identify and resolve conflict within the workplace.  Initiate, direct, and participate in community outreach programs, and encourage and support associates and managers in serving as good members of the community.  Championing company-sponsored programs, events, and sustainability efforts to associates, customers, and the local community in order to emphasize the facility as part of the community."
good,"Every day is planned out managers really don't work they more of delicate and watch over and order."
good,The management did not work with you and make you feel like you could improve any. I had a time where they had changed my schedule on my and did on tell me and I went in when I was not suppose to have.
good,I loved this job at first then everyone and everything changed. The pay was good and so were the benefits. I was overlooked for job advancement 4 different times because I didn't kiss butt.
good,"While I was at Wal-Mart, the management grew to become worse and worse. It used to be that the assistant managers would work with you to complete tasks, but now they will just stand there and bark orders at you, and then go and sit in their office. The department managers, are extremely nice and work so hard to get things done. While being an associate at my store, I was thrown around in several different departments within in hours. I was hired to work in the lawn and garden department, but I have been a cashier, a toy, housewares, electronics, hardware, and sporting goods associate. Management basically wants you to be able to do everything in the store."
good,"Working at Walmart, is  fun specially when I'm in front of the customer, my supervisors are ok, they really help me if I need help, when I call them, management? if I rate them, I will give them 5 out of 10, because they don't see who are employee who work hard, or who come to work doing nothing, the hard part, is to memorizing the code of the item, my  most enjoyable, is when my customer are happy, and that is my reward for the rest of the Day."
good,"Worked there for almost 8 years.  Company changes every 3 minthss.  Whether its dress code, policy or attendance policy, pay or managers.  Dealing with customers was the best part of the job."
good,"No associate loyalty. Just found out that they cut my job. Only positions available are lower pay grade so I would have to take a cut. As I look around it is not just me, cuts all over. They don't want to work with your availability."
good,Too much favoritism is going and in the store and too many people being treated unfairly. I enjoyed the job because I enjoy cooking. Management treated the good workers poorly and the problem workers good.
good,the manager treat you like garbage theres never enough hours and all the employees do is either complain or complain the the managers about other employees
good,It was an okay job but it did get stressful at times. They worked with my school schedule but management did a bad job at scheduling and some days I would be by myself for hours.
good,I worked for Walmart just under a year.  I like the hard work because I am in the market for a new job as an Electrical Engineer. The skill I learned working with customer I found rewarding and grateful that my service is excellent and satisfying.
good,Great job learned a lot. Would like to go back as long as I am able to. The manager that I had wasn't the best but everyone else was great. Other managers were understanding and helpful.
good,"The work hours are all over the place. If they were upset with you, for whatever reason, they would cut your hours. Not flexible when it came to illness."
good,"I start off my job by making a list of how many associates I have for the day and then check to see the call off list . I then task out each of my associates the tasks for the day on the computer. I then take a walk around the store and look at the status of the sales floor and see if there any problems that need to be addressed. I handle all customer service problems or complaints , I also am able to help in every dept when needed do to the extensive knowledge I have learned through out my time being employed here."
good,the manager are all over the place. they are races and they only hire Spanish people. they gave the job to someone who didn't have no experience over the person who applied for the job
good,"upper management pushed the lesser managers so hard to complete daily and special tasks that they were exhausted at the end of their 10 hour shift, therefore they failed miserably to communicate important details to the oncoming shift managers."
good,"You will not be bored working for this company.  They are forever changing and staying out in front of the competition.  The company is a great place to grow and learn the retail business.  The company culture is amazing and it was implemented to support the employees and everyone that does business with them.  "
good,From my experience the hard working people kept that place going while the managers talked and did the bare minimum to keep their jobs. it wasn't always that the most competent were promoted. Plenty of people could do even less and still keep their jobs. there are good people that work there but most of them are not in charge.
good,"Management was horrible, was never organized, treated people unfairly. My job was an overnight stock associate. My duties were to receive deliveries and ensure that delivery items conform to work orders; Unload merchandise from delivery trucks and open packages to ascertain that the right amount and quality has been received; Stock store shelves with packages after marking them properly and ascertain that labels are clear and visible."
good,I think Walmart should off there employees more than a 10% discount. And there should be more benefits for the workers that have been here more than 5 yrs.
good,I just wish they would consider time and effort for advancement. A typical day at work here is doing a great job. I've learned to mind your business and work
good,I worked there for 8 months and the entire time my hiring manager gave me grief for everything including things that I did not intentionally cause. Such as my register not working and a customer that insisted on carrying a heavy box of wine coolers which they dropped.
good,"Having working in various areas the plus was the customer experience but the downside would be lack of staffing to provide proper merchandising, general upkeep and availability to be there for customers."
good,"I have had good and bad experiences while working for walmart. I have missed a lot of holidays and birthdays amongst other family events due to their poor, uncaring schedules."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with unprofessional and uncaring members of management. I've learned that I enjoy working with the public, however I don't enjoy being treated unfairly and being underpaid. Being required to do several different jobs, but only receiving pay for one job is absurd."
good,Above minimum wage start but abysmal raises and poor health insurance options. No merit raises and with the corporate culture no true feelings of being appreciated for your work. Just a cog in a soulless machine. Not recommended for long term employment.
good,Retail business is hard. Walmart provides more benefits than most in this space. Training and competence is hard to find as people move up the ladder. All things are of the highest priority so hard workers burn out fast.
good,A great place to gain experience and possibly advance in your career if you are at a location where management wants to see its employees grow. Great place to interact with a diverse group of customers and employees
good,"Walmart is an ok place to start out ifits your first job or if you really need help, everyone is semi friendly and will work together as a team, but the pay is random because you schedule is constantly changing"
good,You can’t make a career at Walmart! It was so hard for me to get a stable schedule and I was considered part-time when I was working almost 40 hours per week. That way Walmart doesn’t have to pay for benefits.
good,"like helping customer find what they need, kept shelf stock for gust, greeting guest, shortes part of day was always lunch, helping guest put bags back in cart after pursurce item"
good,"It was a very stressful place to work, hours not guaranteed and the shift was too early. Very unprofessional coworkers. Managers don't know how to communicate."
good,"Working for Walmart was stressful everyday, especially when I was pregnant. They said they have flexible schedules but they don't which made it very hard for me to make it to work on certain days being a single mother and pregnant. Some managers would be understanding while others took every chance they could get to make your shift very difficult. Walmart doesn't think about their employees as much as they say they do and that's not all Walmart's or managers but it does make the company look bad as a whole."
good,Interesting place to work.you meet alot of different people and get really food at counting and typing. You learn how to deal with people face to face on a daily basis.
good,"I would like to say that management is definitely one sided and unwilling to deal with issues that arise. I feel that people get promoted there based on gender, race and sexuality, which is very illegal. The hardest part of my job is the scheduling because our schedules jump all over the page. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy."
good,"En general la empresa está bien, cuenta con sus políticas de trabajo bien establecidas, aún que no tienes oportunidad de crecer lo suficiente."
good,"Working hour from 7:30 to 5:30. Are you kidding me? And claim your self as a tech company? Seriously? And another thing, why there are so many Indian workers? contractors and associates. Free coffee is good. But it's not a good place to work and not even comparable with those leading tech company in silicon valley. Make your way out ASAP, even though the salary is decent."
good,The demands of a Wal-Mart distribution center are difficult for most people. The bottom line mindset of the management teams leads to a culture of fear among many assiciates.
good,I usually worked 2-11 you get 2 15 minute paid breaks and an hour unpaid lunch. the hardest part of the job is the customers who are mean. i learned how to cashier and cartpush.
good,"And some nice and fun co-workers. Very small yearly hourly raise. Uneducated managers/supervisors with no communication skills. But, some of them do have morals and people skills."
good,Es una empresa que te brinda aprendizaje en general
good,Walmart was kind of like a roller coaster ride I did stay for quite a while. Walmart says they are family oriented but they are not that is a lie. They dp lots of charitable things tho
good,Difficult to plan life when schedules are changed weekly.  Hours have been cut back to 10 per week.  Breaks get overlooked for cashiers but the CSM's never miss a break.
good,"Empresa bem dinâmica gostei de trabalhar , benefícios muito importante o plano de saúde,faz toda a diferença."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work with moderate  manager support, and with  fast paced training. will be great for a quick learner if you are not afraid to put in physical work."
good,"Uma empresa dinâmica que proporciona aprendizado diário,mas com muito poucos funcionários então acaba sobrecarregando os demais."
good,Made lots of friends. Store manager didnt like you would fire you. Store manager only lookeed out for her self. Hard to have holiday time with family.
good,The Management at the Maple Ridge Store are very easy to work with. It makes the day much easier and fun. The Store location kept me on my toes. There was rarely a dull moment.
good,The work environment was ok at best. The management was poor and biased to other workers. From this job I did learn how to preform tasks from behind and get the task done. The hardest part about the job was dealing with poor workers.
good,Slow pace work environment with lackluster management and not much room for advancement. Managers are friendly but not very goal oriented. Most are more worried about the task just getting done rather than the quality of the people and product
good,"I stocked shelves, cashiered, and worked in Fabrics, and it provided a decent pay for decent hours for the time I was there.  The hours were not set and the schedule changed constantly and it was never a boring place to be."
good,"Some departments are better than others, but overall it pays the bills and highly motivated people can move up if they wish. The discount is helpful, especially during the holidays."
good,"Not enough effort from co workers and some managers,not enough motivation,always short handed and most co workers stressed out cause not enough help for every department for short deadlines."
good,"On a typical day I would help customers with their needs, stock the shelves and zone the area. I would float from the inside area to the shop. In the shop I would pull vehicles to be  serviced into the bay areas, along with preforming the curiosity checks. I also helped stock the shop area for supplies. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what day or shift I would be scheduled in a timely manor. I was unable to make plans with my family or friends.The best part was meeting the people I worked with. Along with some of the customers that I had to opportunity to meet."
good,I loved my team when I worked for Walmart. Everyone worked together and knew what needed to be done for the most part. Pay is kinda ridiculous for the work load though. Other then that its a great place to work
good,I learned how to manage multiple departments while over seeing the operation of the whole store.  I also was involved with engaging employees to meet company standards.
good,"Scheduling would bounce between opening to closing and change without notice. Management had little respect for the hourly associates, and rarely helped them when they needed it. There was little advancement opportunities within the store. The other associates were positive to work with and loved eachother"
good,It's an open opportunity to help and to serve people. The job allows me to make contact with people learning their needs then providing the help they need. Also having to strategize to make the business function with great quantity and quality. Pleasing customers in a pleasant environment! Having paperwork accurate which helps the store achieve high t ratings.
good,"I've worked at two Walmart facilities and I honestly preferred my first experience, it was more family oriented and welcoming than the second Walmart I worked for, at this store I wasn't able to move forward, management was horrible, would not recommend that store to anyone but I do love Walmart in general looking forward to seeing another store"
good,"As a walmart associate you must multitask and be able to be flexible in all aspects: from hours and the ability to jump from department to department. Morning shifts in the electronics department you get your drawer, count your cash. Work on inventory and whatever leftover freight is waiting for you. In electronics you cover electronics, connection center, photo, and site to store/ layaway. First shift includes almost all management available. Second shift arrives around 11-2. Their job is usually customer service and zoning, and at the end of the night working freight is almost always expected."
good,"I gave Walmart almost 10 years of my life. I honestly enjoyed my job. Wish the salary could have been a little higher especially for the number of years I was there for. You hear many bad things about Walmart but after 4 stores, it's what you make of it."
good,too micromanaged horrible managers. most people over you would end not even actually being managers. just everyone trying to tell everyone what to do.
good,"I liked working at walmart until the last couple years. Then the layoffs came, and keep coming. Teams are slashed and the remaining associates are left to pick up the work leading to heavy workloads, tight deadlines, and high stress. Work life balance is preached but not followed."
good,"Great Pharmacy Staff, Enjoyed working with all of them. Would have stayed if pay was better. Working with the public was sometimes challanging but overall liked the job."
good,"no es equitativo, sin atención a faltantes en el trabajo"
good,In the beginning it was the best job to work at until we change management  this when everything took a turned. We started getting treated like we not part of the store they have their picks favoritism new hire coming in making more money then the ones that been there for years. They getting manager position over us. While we train them.
good,"The work is often clear and straight forward, at least after the first few weeks, depending on who you're learning from. Be prepared to ask a lot of questions from your supervisors and fellow associates as there won't often be someone around to help make sure you know what you're doing. "
good,It's a decent place to work but if you are a female you have to work twice as hard for half the pay. It is part of the culture and management condones it.
good,The Mangers at Georgia ave Walmart are rude does not want to do their job has no consideration for others.The work is easy depends on what you are doing I was a sales associate all I really had to do was stock and zone make sure everything was neat and in order and basically help the customers with whatever they needed.
good,Not interested in commenting on this section. As this is not a fair evaluation from a former employee who has left the company years ago. It won't be a a correct assessment.
good,the truth of the matter is that Walmart is not a very great place to work if you are a part time student they do not care about the fact that you are a student and require you to close 3 sometimes 4 times a week and as full-time student I find it hard to do so since I wake up at around 5 everyday to get to uni and start my school day. they are very unfair with the way they treat their employees.
good,I learned very good communication skills and customer service. I learned a lot of respect. The management was terrible and they do not treat the employees the same.
good,"Muito tranquila, bom ambiente de trabalho. Pagamento em dia."
good,"My store was completely disorganized, on the sales floor and in the back. Some managers do not care if you are over worked. Some department mangers get their title in their heads and starts acting unreasonable. Although, Ive met some great people from all across the world and not all the managers are complete jerks.  This job is great for students because they allow you to have a flexible schedule. It all depends on the store, I heard and feel my Walmart was the worst in the state."
good,If you like to be busy during work this is a great place unless you are an overnight cashier it gets slow most of the night but if you are a stocker you can keep busy all night.
good,Work 12 + hours a day . Lack of training . They tell you to great customers and be respectful but they aren't. I enjoyed the associates and the customers. the hardest part was always being the one called in when others don't show or wont answer their phones
good,"When I started it was fun, my last store manager was unfair and not willing to listen. I was never informed of changes and he made promises he could not keep"
good,Working at Walmart is horrible. I would only recommend it if you have nothing else and really need the money. The management sucks they only help you out if you help them out. When home office comes they change their attitude and act like they care and like the store is always clean. They are racist what one associate can get away with the other can't. They show favoritism. You work like a slave and you work is unappreciated they pay is poor the raise sucks. They act like they are family oriented but they aren't. You could be in the hospital or you child or mother could be almost dead and they still want you to come to work. Smh don't work for Walmart they suck!!!!!
good,Most enjoyable part of job was dealing with the public. Most people are very nice. Hardest part of the job was getting money when you needed it to make change for your customers.
good,"The work environment, is very stressful, I worked there for three years without any job  advancements. I am a hard worker but it seemed that management has  favorites, to  promote. It was a good first job experience, would not recommend for a  career place.  Overall if you're just looking for a paycheck it's questionable if you even want to work there."
good,"I don't feel that the cashiers should be responsible for getting customers to sign up for credit cards. I feel that if a customer wants to apply, they would so on their own."
good,"On the overnight shift, you are given certain tasks to complete within a certain time frame. Walmart has computer learning modules which are consistent throughout the company, for all employees. Sometimes the actual hands-on training can be lacking. There are managers who help you with your work, and managers who just give directives. Walmart purports to be a fair company, with opportunity for everyone to advance, if they want, but in reality, only a select hand-picked few actually get to move up. There are many cliques. I found the expectations to be unreasonably high, with management demanding more tasks be completed than were probable or possible. I did get to make some friends there."
good,It came to my attention that there were many unethical things going on between certain members of management and the staff they supervised. Often times certain policies were overlooked because of the favoritism between the manager and employee. This would ostracized other employees in difficult positions and prevented quality associates from moving up as they lost the opportunity to employees who so often made mistakes that it was joke.
good,"Never enough labor hours to go around for all the jobs needing to get done. Its the story of that old adage: ""We've been doing so much with so little for so long, that we are now qualified to do everything with nothing."""
good,"The job is great its just the management they dont no how to speak to people's,its some really nice people's,i gave them 4 1/2 years and im very unhappy there"
good,"Work hard , this company wants a lot done in a short time in a work day , it's changed to on the sales floor so everyone can be put anywhere ... knowledge is good but the work load is a lot"
good,an endless amount of tasks to fulfill. management demanding all your work to be done but giving you no help when you have more work than time possible to finish..over night stocking is very demanding.
good,I loved being a cashier and talking with the customers or assisting them in their needs.  I was quick and accurate with my job.  I left there do to poor management and even though they say they have a open door policy they truly don't
good,It was never right no matter what it is that you did. There is no such thing as family holiday time with your family due to mandated working. Overall atmosphere makes you not enjoy any holiday any longer.
good,they work you very hard which is ok but the chance for advancement is only some.I really enjoy the customers and coworkers. management team lacks good communication skills
good,The call outs are ridiculous it don't cover your kids being in the hospital or being sick  I stick shelf and work in a timely manner to get the work done
good,There is a lack if consistent management.  Rules are followed on a case by case basis.  Long term employment is not a guarantee. Long term associates have a target on their backs.
good,"Managers lack organization most of the time.  They have you do one thing than turn around and tell you do something else before you finish what you are doing."
good,Walmart is a fun place to work. Customers can be very rude at times. Lack of hours and management is not on the same page. For the amount of money Walmart makes the associates don't get paid good enough.
good,They are constantly cutting hours. You are expected to do the job of two people or more and then deal with reshops/returns. Bonuses get cut but management gets their full share.
good,"The worst part was the overly pushy management, always checking up and telling you to go faster but never actually helping out with the work. The ones who did actually help out had other problems with favoritism and harassment of their workers."
good,"Stressful environment., long hours, inadequately staffed, high expectations, under paid associates, unflexible scheduling, lack of support from upper management,"
good,I. Love learning new things abd meeting bew people and I like my job very much. However I wish I more money for all the work they wabt you to do. The coustomers are great and I love helpibg them find the things they. need
good,"The job started out perfectly fine, but as time went on they cut corners and demanded more work then we could deliver.  As the work piled up, management grew progressively worse. Job security doesn't exist, and the chances for advancement are few & far between."
good,"my typical day at work was pretty good"
good,I was an overnight Stocker at Walmart I enjoyed the hours. I worked in the domestic area every night. I also worked in the furniture area every night. At the end of the night we would all go help in foods. That was the busiest section of the Walmart.
good,"This job is okay, if you need extra money, but with the kind of management I wouldn't recommend staying for long. It's provided you do every job there even though you were hired for one job only, and they do not want to raise your pay for the work you do."
good,At first Walmart was a great company to work for but then the wrong type of management and workers were hired and customers were nasty not all but more than half due to ignorant managers and employees. Also you get degraded as a human and I do not stand for that.
good,"had nightly meetings, most of the time, managers expected too much out of employees, they had a timing system, where they timed all of the jobs that had to be done in a certain amount of time, with the amount of merchandise that needed to be stocked on the floor in each department, sometimes I had to work by myself to do the job. I ended up getting fired, because they said that I was too slow."
good,"falta de organización con el personal, falta de comunicación entre gerentes"
good,The job is fast paced and can stressful. But at times can be fun it all depends on who you are working with and the supervisor and manager on that shift.........
good,"My time employed with Wal Mart the training was the best I've been involved in after leaving Kroger,Piggly Wiggly food stores. Gave me an opportunity to grow as a manager."
good,The hardest part of the job was working nights. Some of the management sucked and some people goofed off while others did the task at hand and then had to help them do there job on top of mine.
good,I loved what I was doing as an employee but the managment just lacked in many areas . If managment was doing there job I would have never quit. Everyone is always trying to get someone in trouble or fired.
good,I liked my coworker's. The hour's were ok for the time. The pay was terrible. Plenty of work to be done so I was always busy. Quick room for advancement just not with great pay.
good,My nightshift was hard to get along with the others. management was the worse experience I had ever had with any place I have ever worked for. Most enjoyable part was going on lunch.
good,Is a good place for a high schooler to start or a grad looking for some extra work while going to school. Nothing good or bad to say about the job. Typical stocking/associate job.
good,"I worked at the Wal Mart on 31st in Lawrence, KS. The communication among management has gone downhill tremendously. The store was short staffed so I was pulled in various directions doing various jobs. I enjoyed the people I worked with, managers did not hover over me while I worked,and the annual raises, however, I will not be working for Wal Mart again."
good,"É uma boa empresa para quem esta começando a trabalhar e ou quem esta precisando de qualquer tipo de trabalho... Sendo um bom colega, terás sempre bons colegas a volta para lhe ajudar!"
good,"I was a sales associate in the housewares department. My job was to provide customer service, keeping products properly placed on the shelves, and to maintain the inventory of the department. I have learned  more about task-management while working here, along with being solution-oriented. However, I have started to develop back pains from the strenuous work that goes into stocking. I was expected to constantly lift heavy objects above my head like microwaves and vacuums. Since they were short staffed, my back injury could not be noticed as a legitimate reason to not lift heavy objects. My coworkers were not as capable of lifting things as I was, and a lot of my coworkers constantly complained on a regular bases about how insensitive and apathetic management can be. This job kept me on my feet a lot, which is the main part I liked about it. There was always something to do."
good,"Favoritism is all ruling in this company, no room for advancement if your not a manager favorite. The key to success in retail is be as fake as you can be otherwise you will not get very far."
good,With the right managers it can be a good place to work at. You will learn a lot and you can stay with the company and work your way up. All in all it is an ok place to work.
good,there are days that are slow and other days that we are balls on a ping pong table. We have good days and bad days (just like any place). You just need the right people.
good,Wasn't getting the full time hours I was hired for. When asked about more hours I felt like I was just pushed off. So I'm looking for a different job else were
good,It wouldn't be so bad if they treated you fairly & the management wasn't so horrible.. No matter how much you do they expect 100x more than that. Besides that some of your coworkers become more family.
good,Bad place to try to transfer jobs and hard to make your way up the chain. Made lots of new friends working there. Pay was always on time no had an issue on my checks.
good,This is the truth of Walmart the company is great the store management is poorly trained and if they were trained as well as the associates were in how to do the job I believe they would be wonderful. They have gotten away with alot in certain stores and should be reviewed in business ethics the reason the get away with what they do is the heads up from other stores and they ask all to put up a false front and that gets them by.
good,a typical day in walmart is hectic you usually jump right into a bunch of drama and csm yelling at cashier cause their stressed out due to the lack of registers open and massive lines growing customers start to complain meaning managers are on the walkies loosing their minds.
good,"As a former employee of the place, I can say there is some good there. Most of the staff are good and do their jobs accordingly. Others, perhaps not as much. I would suggest, if one is to apply for them, to get themselves prepared. It may be good for some, but not all looking for work."
good,Walmart is a great place to learn as you have the opportunity to learn so much in the logistics field which will be a great value to take with you as you move forward
good,"It was a good job "
good,"A typical work day is very busy in my position, and at times challenging which I like. At times the store becomes stressful, at which time you really have to tighten the reigns. I enjoy pleasing the customer and would like to see overall store structure improve."
good,This job is stressful and having to work 12 hrs and five days a week overnight is too much!  I am to the point I can no longer do this job due to wanting to do more with my family!
good,"It's a decent place to work, management isn't the best. Moving up in the company is based on favoritism. Work to pay ratio is awful. Staff is pretty decent though."
good,Every thing was always micro managed they wanted everything done yesterday and were mad if you tried to help others it was not a team environment at all
good,"its ok, they gave me too many hours, didn't really respect my time, but the CSMs and coworkers were awesome, A really high ratio of people leaving to people coming in,though."
good,"In the first 4 months of me working for Walmart, the pay and management were wonderful they worked with me on my hours, and I had a guaranteed 40hrs each week. Time went on and my hours started to decrease to barely 30 hrs on a two week period and once I told management about the issue,they acted concerned but never fixed it, no matter how much I complained."
good,"I was part time and worked mostly evenings along side a co worker. "
good,"the days were a little repetitive"
good,Walmart was ok but it was very slow paced and the people I worked with were very rude. My favorite part of the job was helping customers and seeing them smile after.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and the people I worked with. Every day I went to work there was always something to do and kept myself busy. I also worked in other departments to help them out.
good,I enjoyed working here when I did. Management was iffy sometimes. But ended up getting fired for leaving station to ask for help while I was pregnant.
good,"I would have loved working for Wal mart, but there was always people not working.  I'm the type of person that like team work, at on certain shifts, some people just don't like to work."
good,Overall it was a good job to meet my basic needs but overnight schedule was hard to adjust to and transportation became problem so ultimately I had to leave . Seasonal also .
good,Awesome place to work but the managers are hard to work with. Managers talk to you any type of way. I enjoyed the work just not the hassle from managers.
good,"Normal hours"
good,"As a cashier was a great learning to interact with the public, in a fast and efficient way the visit to sams club and get the customer to feel invited back to the store."
good,"An exciting fast-paced position. Most days are spent merchandising and managing inventory.  Planning is essential, but often takes a backseat to putting out fires. Assistant managers are responsible for hiring, which is difficult in the current economy with low retail wages.  Although a new assistants have about 30 paid days off, the position is salary and it is difficult to take advantage of that time. "
good,Working in retail can be hectic. Working at Walmart is ten times more than that. The management at my location cared not about their employees or customers. They only cared about what would be going in their pockets. There is not true way to increase your knowledge and move up.
good,The management team for any Walmart is going to be lacking in communications. There might be one good one out of 4 or so. Good luck in trying to find a good
good,"You hear stories from former employees about working for the company, some true, some are just bitter lies. My time with the company has been mixed. I've had points where it was great, others where it seemed like the worst place in the world. It's all on the area you work in and the people you work with."
good,"Walmart has a culture of working very hard and putting the customer first.  It has a formula that works very well for traditional big box retail.  It's struggling to be successful in e-commerce, but is making logical moves to strengthen e-market presence."
good,They worked you like a dog and payed just over minimum wage.  I worked with a lot of great people. We were like a family. We had fun even on the hardest days.
good,I had to work nights which was great because less people to help. The members treat you just like family. What I didn't like about working there was that you have to work there for 3 months to get your benefits also even if you work there a really long time you won't get a raise like most companies. Over all I wouldn't recommend it.
good,"There was no work life balance, had to stay until all tasks in all areas were complete due to other employees not completing their tasks in their areas"
good,"I have worked at Wal-mart for just over four years now. I was a photo lab associate, then I transferred stores, to which I became an electronics associate. Now I am a Customer Experience Associate. "
good,Working at walmart was an okay job. I wouldn't make it a career. I worked there as a cashier. they were flexible with changing my hours once i started college. The hours were 8 hour shifts with an hour unpaid break.
good,"I learned a lot during the training, and I'm grateful for the skills I picked up there. Everyone was fairly nice, save for a few managers, but my schedule wasn't very respected (I was frequently put down for more hours than I said I was available to work) and sometimes forgotten about by managers for my breaks and clock outs."
good,"They have 4 or 5 different managers telling you as many different ways to do your job.  And none of them have done your job.  Constantly riding us about how long it took to unload the truck, but never had suggestions on improving our time."
good,"Trabalho excessivo, além da forma precária de locomoção dos funcionários."
good,"This was my first employment after getting out of the Marine Corps, so culture shock was setting in very badly, and this job was not a good first one for a veteran freshly separated from the service because there is no camaraderie there among the employees, no picnics or anything like that to build cohesion, which is what I was used to in the Marine Corps.  The work itself was relatively easy, but required more planning than I was accustomed to, since I had never worked in the retail industry before that point.  So if you're someone that has worked in retail before, Wal-Mart isn't too bad, it's a giant company, so upper management isn't accessible at the corporate level really, the general manager was fair, but not real nice or courteous to the employees under him, but for a retail job, it wasn't too horrible, just not the right fit for me fresh out of the Marine Corps."
good,Working at Walmart was stressful. Crazy work hours some days you have to close just to be up early in the morning at work again. Management was not professional what so ever. A lot of favoritism. If you are single and can function with anything this job is for you.
good,It really has gone from bad to worst. You couldn't climb the ladder unless you puckered up to them. It's turn to more of an in-between job then somewhere to have a career.
good,The company keeps changing things up & moving product on customers. Always makes you wonder if you will get moved to another section of store. Was nice to interact with customers.
good,The company used to be about making their associates and families happy and feel included but now it seems less care of associates and their families more about the money.
good,"My experience will be very different than others, it honestly all depends on where you work. My Wal-Mart experience was sucky but i made good friends out of it. It was just my dept. Manager she was very rude and disrespectful"
good,management is horrible they have no respect for their emplyee at all they are just completely rude the csm pick on you and make you feel uncomfortable
good,"Store Manager had no previous experience working in a retail store,"
good,"probably the hardest job within the warehouse and still for the same pay as everyone else. Back breaking work, easily compared to a 12hour gym session with only 3 short breaks and maintaining the same intensity throughout the day."
good,"Management dont fight for their hard working employees and the management team is on a buddy system."
good,When you sell a product choose the customer to personalize it how they want also as well as every choice. The more you have like they want it the more you will sell.
good,"This company have changed, but for the worst.  Customers and employees don't count.  Only the botton line. It was a joy seeing and working with my co workers.  We was like a family.  The customers was a pleasure everyday. The regular ones, who knew us by name, the new ones we meet and earned their loyalty of returning to shop with us because of the great experience they had."
good,This job is better for teenagers beginning in the workforce. As a part-time job its ok until something better comes along. The pay should be more for all the standing and fast paced work that you have to do. Management should care more about their appearance and employees more.
good,Work was stressful. Learned useful skills. Management at the time was efficient. The culture wants you to be positive and a go getter. Hardest part of the job was doing three times the work seeing no monetary increase. Most enjoyable part for me was fulfilling request for customers.
good,"Unorganized at times, didn't follow state minor working laws. I enjoyed working at this establishment until I had to leave due to moving cities. I put in my two weeks and was fired the next day. I am now unable to apply to another walmart for 30 days."
good,"Although, they pay good. They use that to cover up that they treat their employees horribly. Their Politics are in place so that they can cover up what they haven't offered an  employee which is respect for work life balance."
good,It was nice to work at walmart. Fun place to work at walmart. But some times it get real busy to deal with it. Long lines and short of cashiers make it real busy.
good,"when I arrived at work I would get my trash bin and empty all the trash clean all the bathrooms, clean the windows, sweep outside and around the store and whatever else I was told to do. There wasn't anything to learn management was very poor there was no one to go to and handle a problem. the enjoyable part of the day was went I left."
good,Walmart has changed and is not as employee friendly any longer.  There are standards that should be met by all employees however you can see that standards for one group of people are far higher than for others.  I do not find that management appreciates how hard you work and seem to benefit those that don't do the same amount of work.
good,Good place to work. People not so good. Pay was ok and a ok environment. Management was lacking and showed favoritism. But the job it self was good and money was ok just the people wasn't the best
good,Only did seasonal labor for them and i was a cashier. The time that i worked there it wasn't so bad. The only thing that got you is when someone called in or anything they told you that you had to stay over.
good,Unless your in a click or suck up to management they look for reasons to terminate you. I was let go do to a gift card with $.86 on it given to me by a family member. took a month for them to dig that up.  If it were that serious I would of been gone before the week was up.
good,"Walmart was a good job for me. It was my first actuall grocery job. My typical day at work consisted of customers always complaining about something, which I don't blame them. I learned to have a lot of patience with everyone and learn to not let another person steal my happiness. I enjoyed my co workers."
good,Employees are expected to work like a machine.  Not enough staffing with employees constantly calling out.  Co-workers do not help each other out and only look out for themselves.  Wide disparity; low paying wages.
good,Wasnt a place i like to work again. I dodnt like the hour s and they dont pay enough fpr the labor u doing. Bit i was able to manage and fimd a way to make it manage able.
good,It's been a long time since I've worked there. I did not like the hours. I am a morning person and prefer to get to work early and leave before diner.
good,"Worked 6 days a week, back then the pay was only $7.60 so it wasnt much had to work alot of hours to make a decent check. the management there wasnt too great- over worked and underpaid."
good,They dont train their management staff. You never know if your working until the day before. Management is never there when u need them. Unless your cool with the store manager they will fire you for petty things and make it so that theres nothing u can do about it
good,A typical day involved pushing carts unloading truck and ringing on the register. Management was very demanding. The job was enjoyable in the beginning.
good,"Personally- Walmart totally supported me in my quest to enroll in school. Supported my need for exams and pre grad work."
good,Good place to work if you have been there for at least 5 yrs.  Hardest part of job is doing the work of 2 or 3 every night because of short staffing every night.
good,They are promoting people on looks rather than knowledge of the job that they perform. Most of the managers are young and mouthy. Had taken a decline in overall customer satisfaction
good,"Working at Walmart, you were always guaranteed to put in a hard day of work. It was a challenge managing to take care of our customers and keep your area up to work standards when understaffed, but somehow it got done. I loved my coworkers and managers, they were so personable and understanding. They were definitely the best part of the job!"
good,What I enjoy at Walmart is the customers that I meet. People in general are friendly. Some of the costumers don't seem friendly but who knows what their day has been like. I love it when I can make someone smile. I enjoy working with my co workers. I like my job but some of the things that go on bother me.
good,"Not the worst company in the world, really depends on your team and location. Hardest part of the job is telling people they need to keep their availability completely open and yet only schedule them part time to save benefits."
good,"Start off with a meeting. "
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart I enjoyed talking with all the customers and seeing them leave happy the only bad thing was management racial profiling and favoritism
good,I've work 8 years with the company and was never offered full time position even after 3 people left my position on my shift. Took them a year to hire 1 person to replace the 3.
good,"Management was poor, Organization was poor, a typical day at work boring and stressful, What I learned was how to use a zamboni, hardest part of the job was getting along with other workers"
good,It was a good experience for me. I learned how to get tasks done in a certain amount of time. I worked the majority of my shift without help from other employees. I enjoyed the learning experience but I'm a team player.
good,Good job for making a pay check. Very stressful when you have to do your job then get called to do someone else job then get penalized for not getting your job done
good,"You come in and clock in then you go to one of the management to get your task for the day. the only problem is that they don't like communication, so you have no clue what to do at the end of the day."
good,"Would have a short brief meeting then go about to our area to take the freight from pallet and put it on the shelf for customers . If the shelf was full then we would put it back on the pallet . I've learned that it takes a lot of communication to be in retail . The managers were friendly always helping someone . The hardest part of the job was understanding sum of the employees , example  some are from another country . The most enjoyable part of the job was learning who you could trust and who you couldn't trust ."
good,"Muchos tratos preferenciales entre supervisores y asociados, poca oportunidad de crecimiento en base a meritos. Si eres amigo de los supervisores/asistentes, te dan la plaza asi no tengas los conocimientos y/o meritos para ello. Los asociados de recursos humanos no tienen conocimiento de etica laboral y no son pro empleados. No hay estabilidad laboral ya que pueden hacer lo que sea para despedirte."
good,"I've learned how to work be a great cashier, sales associate and also how things should be done as being on cap team 2. I enjoy working for wal mart, I just think management could be a little better."
good,Walmart demands more than can be given. Then will make you feel bad about not being able to work past your limits when not required. They will treat you badly until you quit or stop caring and don't work to the best of your ability so that they fire you.
good,"Discount,free breaks good benefits and etc. Walmart is a big company that offers a lot of benefits. Its very fun to work with, a lot of customer services being provided by associate"
good,"The management there is completely incompetent and nobody really cares. They will not train you, they also fail to fully explain any of the benefits/time keeping/important peripheral stuff. The way it works at that specific store must be learned on your own- and you will not be trained. You will be walking around with a vest not knowing what to do. If you're fragile, you will, like me, spend a lot of time crying in the bathroom shaking in an anxiety attack. It goes beyond awkward- it's torturous. Training and Personnel literally are just glad they collect a paycheck- they don't actually do anything to help you. If you ask them, they tell you to do the wrong thing and then get you in trouble. Nobody knows what they are doing. Nobody wants to work there. Everybody thinks they are some kind of hard worker and likes to boast about all the years and different jobs they've done."
good,It could be a great job depending on your mentality and work ethic. The management isn't really that good but it comes from the higher management that isn't in the store handing down requirements that mostly won't be met. If you are able to deal with the unsteadiness of management then it is a fairly decent job.
good,"My experience wasn't the best. I had a pervert for a supervisor, and the higher team of management did nothing about  it. Pay rate should be higher as well."
good,Not really a understanding job if you have small kids good with the hrs the pay sucks if you like standing all day in one spot this is the place for you rude management and rude customers does
good,A typical day is very busy so you have to be good with multitasking and not being overwhelmed with your work. You have to respect customers and work associates to the fullest extent.
good,"The work environment at Wal-mart isn't to bad. Its all about how you make your day go and who you allow to affect your attitude towards working that day. Management is pretty bad there. They walk by without speaking, they try to talk down to you as in your beneath them and that you don't matter. The associates you work along side of is the most enjoyable part of the day. When you get along with every person you work with it makes for a great day at work."
good,"Not a job you can rely on for long, it is very physical, more than should be expected for any one person. Time off it hard to get, and it is very easy to be penalized."
good,Working here was great when I started. The raises where more and based on how hard of a working you are. The schedule was decent because our two days were back to back.Once the new system was established our raises dropped to twenty cents and everyone got the same thing.There extremely strict about not passing overtime.I enjoy working here but after 5 years of experience they haven't helped me grow to a hire position.
good,Was a steady fun place to work very interactive with people on a regular basis Management was ok the assistant managers were helpful but the store manager was very unkind and demanding at all times.
good,"Walmart is a good company, just isn't for me.Good management who work hard to make sure you are comfortable in your job and how you do it. Long hours of just standing around doing the same thing day after day. No consistent schedule."
good,"Typical day at work involved coming in to day time employees leaving with large lines.  It would be me and maybe 1-3 others doing the same amount 10 would.  Then when it slowed down i would have to either stay by a register and make the front look neat, or i would have to organize the left over products costumers did not want to buy and put them back onto the shelf."
good,Es una tienda en donde el ambiente laboral no se vive
good,Walmart is a fast paced work environment with different elements of customer service involved and it can become more than what is expected. The managers tend to be consistently under pressure and that makes everyone uncomfortable. If they had higher than competitive wages the job functions and expectations would balance themselves out. It is a great place to be if one enjoys customer service though!
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of balancing the cash/coupons per register each day.  Receiving and depositing money from the bank truck."
good,"The job is demanding. I was the only person that showed up consistently, so most of the time I was the only stocker for the night shift. Supervisor called every day on my off days asking that I come in."
good,nothing is good enough. you can make the store millions of dollars and they would still put you down and say you are not doing enough. Managers never helped and wouldn't send anyone to help you then would scream at you if merchandise wasnt done even if you have no staff.
good,I learned at Wal-Mart the best service is when your friendly and quick. The hardest part is I working while pregnant. It was hard the first few days but I got the hang.
good,Work ten hours a day for three days. Job is to put loose freight into proper boxes. We make sure our work area is clean and all boxes are empty before leaving the building.
good,"Good associates, friendly atmosphere."
good,"I did not like this job, mostly because of the hours. I was on the night shift and it did not work well with my child's schedule......................"
good,i would wake up get on the bus go to work i would fold clothes stock and unload trucks i would go on break after 4 hours of work then go back to work and go home afterwards
good,"Books over part time hours, no full time benefits . Favoritism and lax punishment for favorites . Immensely stressful workplace, I've anonymously been given a nasty note that seemed very misdirected. Always scrambling to help customers even though it should be done with ease, not stress and having to constantly struggle with rushes."
good,"at the store I work for management is unethical and isn't family oriented like they say they are. This company use to be an amazing place to work. they used to care about their associates and took care of them, unfortunately they have lost sight of who actually maintains their stores."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you need a job and don't want to be out getting into any trouble. Working at Walmart will give you a lot of job opportunity when trying to further your career.
good,"Our store was tiny, so there was very few opportunities for advancement. I loved my fellow co-workers, and most of management was decent, but after nine years without any chance for a supervisor position, it was time to move on."
good,This company allows for an employee to try many different position and starts at different type of job types within retail. However it does not allow for many mistakes to be made or for said mistakes to be over come in a positive out come for both customer and employee. It is very concerned with the bottom line and has gone away from Sam Walton original ideals of both the company and employee are very important. It makes it very hard to have a family and work at the same time.
good,"The management cares nothing for the workers under them, only that the job gets done. Which isn't necessarily a problem, it just generally makes a hostile work environment when workers don't feel heard or acknowledged."
good,"The work was ok, but the management is terrible. They only cared about themselves and would not help you in any way possible unless it affected them or their job."
good,"Walmart is good company to work for if you are not ambitious and just need a source of income. They do not pay good compare to similar jobs, but there are opportunities for advancement and moving around in the company. The worst aspect is the job culture is awful. Barely a day goes by that you won't hate your job."
good,This job is intended as a starter job for kids or students. It was not the job for me as I felt I was overqualified for the position and should have been placed in a leadership role to be most effective.
good,"manager bad so i did not like the job much. i did answering phones, it was easy but i would not recommend becoming a cashier. hardest part was rude customers on phone. most enjoyable was company celebrations"
good,"None of the mgt is on the same page, there is alot of favoritisim going on this this particular store.  not sure about the other stores.  Definitely not enough help at all.  The dept mgrs only work 630-330 and noone on the floor after that.  I dont recomend working for this store."
good,A typical work day is meeting daily with project team and business stakeholders. Great knowledge base of experienced developers. Culture different from most. Lack of communication from business to development hurts in completing user stories on scheduled roll outs. Best part about role meeting different people with unique backgrounds.
good,"what more do you want to know? it's pretty self explanatory we've all shopped there just watch the employees do you want to do their job? if yes go for it! if not, run."
good,"i liked working for Walmart, I liked what I did. We were like a family and everyone knew each other and got a long and then we started getting these new, young managers who don't know their jobs and all they care about us the money. They will look you in the eye and tell you what you want to hear just to get what they want."
good,I unloaded the truck. I learned hard work. Managers did not make me feel wanted. Not a team culture. Intense physical labor.   coworkers were friends.
good,Buen ambiente entre compañeros muy poca o nula promoción
good,If you want to work where there is way more work and less people then this is the job for you. Want you to stay over but no overtime that take the time from your regular schedule shift.
good,"- relaxed work environment "
good,My experience at Walmart hasn't been the most pleasant . I feel under appreciated and over worked.That's why I'm currently looking for work elsewhere .
good,"At the time when I worked at my Walmart facility, there were not enough carts to keep both sides of the building full at the same time. The part I hated the most was getting a write up for missing my scheduled lunch period. I was told specifically by management themselves that I could not take my lunch until both sides of the building were full of carts."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers. The job itself was easy. It is the mental stress that weights you down. I am sure there are people who enjoy their jobs with Walmart but for me I could not make it a permanent career.
good,"All day everyday everything is in demand. At a sprint pace the entire shift. Time management must be perfect. The customers are expecting an associate to be at their best as well as their supervisor. Plenty of opportunities to obtain experience and further education in the business world. I think the saying is ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"""
good,"I would not recommend this company for many people. You need to be strictly a company person to want to work for them. Though for some, that's a perfect match, but not me. I wanted more in life."
good,A typical at work wasn't too bad. As a Deli Associate you slice deli meats and cheeses. You are also required to cook Hot Bar food as well as the rotisserie chicken. In the Deli you also get experience in making party trays as well as subs.
good,Walmart was full of opportunities to make a customer have a great day. I worked there during the holiday season and it was great seeing all the children dressed for pictures. This was also during some of the busiest times.
good,If you are looking for a part time job this is the best way to go. People are great to work with and always have a good day. Would go back any time to work.
good,the job place is great and its has it up and downs. The people are nice and always helping each other. I enjoyed the hour lunches. The day went by fast
good,"My employment with Walmart lasted 7 months. During those 7 months I was given a pay increase and a department change. Although I was very thankful for the opportunity, I didn't get the hours I expected."
good,Rules are not kept constant across management. Relatively easy work to do when available. Very boring when no customer around. Can be very long tedious hours. Easy first time job. Good for students because they work around your school schedule.
good,Management are not always professional and do not have any regard towards your work/home life balance. They have great benefits that are affordable for everyone.
good,"Part of the safety team."
good,Stressful & too demanding on a daily basis. Managers will give you impossible notes to complete & use them  to issue coachings to associates. Retaliation measures are used against associates . There are not enough employees in the entire store to help the customers or the Department Managers. Poor scheduling and decision making causes a  huge impact on the operation and store sales.
good,The company in general is a very good company but the management and other workers were awful. The overall experience with the people that worked there was awful. I loved helping the people. I loved the pay and the hours but the people at the store ruined it for me.
good,A typical day at work is I stock items up on the shelf. An enjoyable part of the job is the Customer Service. The hardest part of the job is there is no fixed schedule so you do not know when you are working. The management is a mix between good and bad. The workplace culture is good there.
good,"At my first store in Moore, Oklahoma, my peers and managers became friends and family. They were kind, insightful, and helpful. They cared about each other, even new hires. They made sure everyone was comfortable and knew that they had someone to talk to if they needed someone. It was such a homely experience to work there that even after I moved, I would stop in when I was in town and give them a rundown of my life. "
good,"Poor management, terrible benefits/compensation. Unrealistic workload for compensation offered. Terrible scheduling flexibility. Stressful work environment"
good,"Se maneja un alto nivel de estrés al estar bajo un esquema de trabajo bajo presión, ademas cuenta la sucursal para cual se te asigna, no se puede lograr un equilibrio con el aspecto personal y el desarrollo como persona. Difícilmente se da el reconocimiento laboral y el desarrollo dentro de la empresa no se hace como debiera ser, en la base de talento, que según se crea después de valorar las habilidades, experiencia, escolaridad, etc. Las decisiones no son tomadas en base al desempeño laboral y resultados, pareciera que se realizan a dedazo."
good,"Electronic Gemeni Use, Load and Unload of trucks , Module build, Display Build and use, Inventory keep , also Floor Stocking when necessary any and all stoor requirments"
good,"the job was a little bit stressful.too many supervisor."
good,Was not to bad paid my bills some of the people where nice and then you have the mean ones and makes you want to take your vest off and go to town  but you need to make money
good,"A typical day at walmart can be stressful for some. But, i have learned great customer service and the management was great. the hardest part of the Job was keeping happy and positive for the next customer to be helped."
good,I worked there a short time and didnt really care for the store manager at the time. Always super shorthanded on employees and still expected the same work to be done of 2 people on a one man show.
good,Dont really remeber cause it was a summer postion  but I do refer i loved the product and the people I worked with always easy going and fun to.work with .
good,Throughout the day cashiers ring up the items of the customers and bag them while trying to provide great customer service. I have learned how to deal with people and their many types of attitudes. The management team was horrible and could care less about their employees. They thrived on giving workers minimal hours in order to receive a greater bonus check. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude people all day. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,Good working environment.  Most get over looked when opportunity has opened up. Management some times won't take time to listen to an employee. Alot of the time one gets the run around.
good,The culture is something that is now missing however the pay here has been raised.  This is a good company to start your work experience with.  This becomes more stressful the higher you move up in the company.
good,"Very hard to be a salaried manager with a family, not much of a work/life balance. Hours and time spent in the building when not scheduled is demanding. Opportunities for advancement could be improved. Since the base salary was raised the compensation is competitive. Vacation time is great depending on your tenure with the company."
good,"Walmart, overall, is a good company, however, the Distribution Center often goes through employees and management quickly.  If you work afternoon or weekend shifts, you will not get any hours above 30-35 per week.  The pay is great, but if you drive more than 25 miles one way to get there, it's not worth it.  They often send you home right after you get to work because there isn't enough work.  The management team, some of them, are great, however, others are horrible.  They spread false rumors about employees, write you up for every little thing and are quick to send you home.  You don't make enough in your paychecks to pay for insurance, much less contribute to 401k."
good,My typical night at work was never set in stone it didn't matter what i would be expecting to be doing there was always something different to be done. Although the way things were planned made things slightly more difficult some nights we always managed to come together as a team at the end of the night. It is a very disciplined workplace.
good,my store location had lots of potential to serve a larger amount of the general population. Prices were competitve and my produce section was always kept clean.
good,it really be a lot of discrimination and favoritism happening also hard workers get overlooked and took for granted. I've been with the company for 3 1/2 years
good,"Pagan poco y exigen mucho, solo buscan su bien y no el bien de sus empleados."
good,"I love my job in the bakery. Because of the lack of staffing, I get to enjoy all aspects of the job. I have enjoyed working, learning, filling in for the various roles- donuts, cakes, bread and rolls, freight, inventory. I enjoy the challenge of learning to be as efficient as possible. The aspects I most enjoy are when I am an extra person and I get to help my coworkers complete their tasks. Cake decorating is my absolute favorite, and I wish I could have more opportunity to do so."
good,"im just looking for a new field and with better pay and hours.. I receive anywhere fom 22 to 26 hours per week, were not allowed to get over time. I make 10.71 per hour and im a custeomer service /money center rep"
good,"Good environment to learn basic skills in, tires, oil changes, and batteries. Pay is ok starting but raises are usually only about 2%. Some members of management are good others are just a pain."
good,"i learned how to do price checks, touched up on my stocking skills. learned how to do price checks,  cleaned the dressing rooms, put clothes away on shelves"
good,"Not a good environment. Lot of negative people. Feel like you being rushed to do everything. Not so friendly people. So you have to be careful, and know how to speak up."
good,You are expected to stay busy for your whole shift. the pros is that you get two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. The major con is that they don't offer OT and are expected to take advantage of government assistance to make ends meet.
good,I did not feel that management really treated employees fairly. I did not think management appreciated all the hard work that I did. There could have been better communication.
good,Great job to work at if your in school. They will work will your school schedule. But you might have a lot of 4 hour shifts throughout your work week.
good,Great p;ace to work love it ! I have learned how to deal with customers on a regular bases. I am working a help position at Photo. Lab customers come in with phones and need help getting pictures off of their phones. I have to work with them to get the pictures off of their phones.
good,"Though the work is doable and the benefits are fine, the management team makes it hard to want to go to work each day. The best part of the job is honestly the customers, I would work every day to make sure every customer was happy."
good,"I would never recommend anyone to work at a Walmart in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. This Walmart was only concerned with the employees they liked and had things in common with ,other wise they treated you like trash."
good,I would only recommend working at Walmart if you've got the ability to crack under pressure. I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody that has a difficult time standing for long hours at a time.
good,"Management is very disrespectful. They don't care about what's going on in your life, they only care about what you can do for them. They don't care how hard you're working, or making your associates work, they expect you to push even harder. They yell at you like you are a child and then tell you  have to have respect for the individual when you yell back."
good,"work environment could be in better conditions , the commodore in the office is stable from day to day , the pay could be of a living wage , its good for someone just entering the work force."
good,"A fun job if you like people and respect your fellow workers.  Otherwise, a job with low pay and  challenging situations, the result of chronic understaffing at all positions.  Management is good at some locations, even excellent; older stores get less talented managers, as a rule.  As a manager, I loved the power I had to improve my employees workday, and they responded by providing world-class service to the customers.  It was a total win-win situation at that particular location!  Other locations were not as well managed, and the employees and customers suffered under a regime that focused on fear and intimidation."
good,Alright company to work for. Can move up pretty fast if u want to thru the company. I love my experience working for them I learn a lot from the workplace
good,Ok if you are needing something right away but be prepared for always being short staffed. Some managers are helpful. While others are harder to get along with
good,"The management at Walmart is seriously lacking, corporate is attempting to make changes, however supervisors refuse to give clear instruction, they skipped my,as well as a few other employees formal training, and instead put us right on the floor. Sometimes you are even given incorrect instructions, that later lead to you being reprimanded. Most employees are kept part-time to avoid requiring to provide them with benefits, unless they take a second job there or have been on a few years. Many of the supervisors do not delegate work properly, so employees must but in over time almost every day to get the work done, and will be reprimanded if they refuse to on a regular basis. "
good,"They do not know how to treat customers or employees. Only thing I liked about the job was the friends I made from there. Other than that, absolutely awful."
good,i am part time in Walmart Canada worked as a cashier plus (CSM). As i usually use to work weekends and it was really a fast paced job as you always have a long line of customer waiting to checkout and scanning never stops.
good,Una empresa la cual no se puede progresar ya que no hay promociones y tampoco dejan hacer horas extras .
good,"If you can lift and don't get tired of picking up, moving, and setting things up then it'll be a piece of cake. Along with that, basically instead of being that one person that is too lazy to find things for themselves you become the person on the reciprocating end of that making that job a little annoying."
good,Very demanding job but enjoyable if you enjoy staying busy. Very fair when it comes to providing evaluations and raises. Walmart is a popular place for customers to shop
good,A typical day consist of you running around doing your list and helping customer at the same time. Management with this company was not acceptable. Didn't understand the importance of making it happen for are customers and letting them be satisfied when they leave the store vs. not satisfied with unable to find their products. Management responsible in helping employer when needed in any situation of a conflict and act upon it.
good,"Overall I do enjoy working here though I have been passed up on many well deserved promotions simply because I'm not friends with the right people, not because of lack of experience for those positions. Associates have to put up with a lot of poor treatment from customers but we do always get our breaks and lunches when we need them."
good,"They constantly cut hours and help, but always adding more responsibility. They expect your life to revolve around the company. The store manager can take vacation when ever but they have so many weeks of the year that they won't let the rest of us take a vacation. We can't even have Thanksgiving off to be with family because of the sales. We end up workng split shift on that day which adds up to being most of the day."
good,"New position all the time. Consistent schedule. Steady hours, flexible schedule. Fun people to work with. Enjoyed co-workers. Always out before 11pm. Learned new things."
good,Working at Walmart overnight was a struggle sometimes but my co-workers always made it worth it. Fast paced job so I was never bored. Definitely a work out during the holidays!
good,"well its walmart, so I guess its good if management likes you. Some of the management will help and train you but a lot of it is just hands on experience."
good,"Be prepared to be treated unfairly.  The environment is best described as hostile.  However, I did make many friendships with co-workers due to our shared hatred of our jobs.  At times, working at Walmart can be fun.  The most positive thing I gained from this job was the friendships I made with co-workers."
good,"A fast paced working environment, hard to get assistance when needed if you are at the Cashier position.  This makes it hard to stay customer focused at times since customers do not like to wait.  I enjoyed working in lay away and the coding departments since there is variety in the work and you do not stay in one place."
good,I spent two years at Walmart and I have learned a lot of things over those two years that I believe will help me later in life. I hope to put all of what I have learned into a new job
good,"I guess it all depends where you get the job. Walmart is strange. Managers don't really care why you missed work, including big untimely events such as death or hospital visits."
good,"Productive work culture, fast paced but fun. Friendly co-workers. Nice management  accompanied with good incentives. .................................."
good,Really enjoyed Walmart at first but the people I worked with were unprofessional and rowdy always wanted to fight and get nasty with other associates other then that I liked working at Walmart
good,Helping customers on a day to day basis is very easy. The hardest part about working at Wal-mart is the management. They have this power hungry attitude with them that makes working there a nightmare. The only good thing about working at wal-mart is the pay advancements yearly and the associates working with you.
good,"My first job after high school. Not bad, but not great, either. I wasn't looking for a long term job, just something to get my feet wet. I was a cashier. That's about it. Here a customer, there a customer, everywhere a customer."
good,"All that is required of you to keep your job here is to show up on time, do your job and do not steal.  Unfortunately at WalMart you are just a number.  You are easily hired and easily fired."
good,"I am thankful for what I learned at Walmart. Things like skills with difficult customers, organizational skills, and what its like to work under management. Aside from those lessons it was a job. It was tiring, payed less than the usual work deserved, and required patience to deal with irritating customers."
good,sometimes its okay and other nights it all about certain people gets stressfull. like it when I first started out now I kind of like it don't get much sleep
good,"Based in my experience and the experiences of other people I know that work/worked here "
good,The hardest part of working for Walmart was the management. There were so many managers from different areas always bein transferred or fired. It was hard to keep up with who to listen to.
good,"Working for Walmart was okay, the pay and the hours wasn't all that but it got the job done. And helped me feed my family, at the end of the day I'd recommend it to anybody."
good,"for the last 3 years I've been employ at Walmart the help me maintain my need little bit."
good,"Walmart can be a good or bad place just depend what you make of it. You can move up in positions, and have job security. Can be stressful with the different people shopping there but coworkers were great."
good,"Learned a lot here. Learned how to manage a floor and handle conflicts. "
good,"Register duties"
good,"Physically the job isn't difficult, it's the management. While customer service is stated as the highest of standards its the employee relations that are seriously lacking."
good,At walmart every can grow and become manager. That's why we have lot of poor management skills. Then many people lost the passion of work down here...
good,The job is easy but the customers are rude and the managers and supervisors will work you to death will standing around for hours gossiping and talking about absolutely nothing... I hated that job!!!!
good,This job was stressful while I was pregnant.  Leaving this position was one of the best things that could have happened to me at the time.  I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone.
good,The company has this new program that you have to pass in order to get a raise and it does not allow the extra time that is needed if you have problems with how fast you can perform your job without having to go to the doctors saying that you can not perform as fast as others that are the same age.
good,"I straightened shelves. Helped customers. stocked shelves. Didn't feel like there was room for advancement. They wanted everyone trained as a cashier, but I was always overlooked and never got trained. It was kind of fun working in the Toy department, but felt the management was all about numbers and didn't care much for their employees."
good,"There is no real personal connection with the management, often times no level of understanding about medical or personal issues, management does not try to effectively work with employees to solve problems"
good,Wal-Mart Corporate was a nice environment to be a part of. They are a company of changes. Changes to policies and procedures are basically daily. They want the employee to be adaptable to change. The management needs more stability and to be more aware of the procedures as well.
good,Management is the worst part about working for wal mart. They really have no idea how to run a store. At point during my employment management had me doing their job for them. I went under paid and eventually left the company to find something better.
good,Walmart was a decent job for me coming out of high school but i didn't feel like i could get any real advancement in the career field because of a strong union and having to have had a great amount of time spent in the workplace to advance.
good,My experience with the company is that the turn over rate of employees is so high that they do not care about the individual. A typical day of work involves a disorganized detail of tasks that are subject to change.
good,Be prepard to do alot of work i liked working there with the coworkers there good people i would work there again if i was out of a job but other than that just be there on time
good,"I assist customers and help them find the right product."
good,"stayed busy with the amount of customers coming through the checkout lines and the amount of food to be stocked on the shelves. loved some of my fellow employees,but just like any job, there are employees that you just dont see eye to eye with"
good,El trabajo fue tranquilo se contaba con bastante personal.
good,"Worked there for roughly a month. Management sucks and doesn't treat you right. I was the bike assembler, and they didn't care about quality, just quantity. And I was pulled around the store thus hampering my performance."
good,"Working at Walmart can be stressful specially when your co-workers aren't around to help out. The customers can be really rude sometimes, but as long as you don't let it get to you its fine."
good,"Almost everyone was amazing, including the CSMs. There was, however, one CSM (the head) that was outrageously rude and insulting with everyone. Later on this rubbed onto an associate that was hired for CSM."
good,"The overall business was really nice to work in. However potential to move up in the company is somewhat limited, so once you start as an orderfiller you can expect to be locked into the position for at least 3-4 years if not longer."
good,"many times there are conflicts between written policy and expectations"
good,Working at Walmart is one of the jobs I have enjoyed least. Moving up is nearly impossible depending on department. I was a cashier so advancing wasn't a big thing. We barely get any benefits. You have to work there for 6 months to just receive a discount. Getting time off is hard and your work hours are never the same.
good,"Not a great place to work. Poor management, long hours, way too much work for one person. The weight of the boxes you are expected to pick up is more than someone should have to do"
good,"My immediate Optical center manager made it extremely difficult to properly do my job or to remain at that particular location! The ""then"" store manager was greatly appreciated."
good,"The management weren't very nice to me. I worked hours after my shift was over, just to be treated badly. stocked selves repeatedly"
good,"Wouldn't make this my career. Managers won't help with too much. But it is a starting option. And the pay isn't terrible if you do finally get full time position.  Like I said not awful, but not a career for me."
good,"As part of Front End Ops, I like meeting customers and helping them. The view management had was more store focused which sometimes rubbed against giving focus on customers. I worked to be friendly and helpful while complying with strict rules of my position. I would constantly test myself to memorize item numbers and descriptions to make the purchase for the customer go smoothly. "
good,"If implemented right, workplace culture would be outstanding. Jewelry is a less physical demanding department, however it requires a lot of attention due to the nature of the merchandise ."
good,"the people were great, the management were great. there are no raises and no chance of advancement. the work was easy even tho there was a deadline each night."
good,A typical work day is to come clock in the time clock will tell you will you will be for the evening.  You check into your assigned task and complete it as accurately as possible in the expected time frame.
good,The only thing that working here is good for is the fact that they give you money. It's a good place to start working if you're young to get your toes wet but I wouldn't recommend working here long term.
good,"Management needs to fixed shelf life of item need to be fixed a lot of playing favorites for promotions.  Managers being hired that don't want to learn or help out.  I never had to do open door policy until I started here, I filed three times. No cashier help.  No custodial help.  I live up the street so I wait till lunch to go to the bathroom if possible and then when you need to go  to the restroom or home there is no coverage."
good,"My time at Walmart was a time of highs and lows. I did learn a lot from working there like customer service, stocking merchandise, and how to work in a team environment. But it also had it's bad parts miss communication, false time limits, and pressure to finish faster to go help others."
good,"This business, like many others, is good for high school kids and college kids trying to make a buck or two.  Advancement is possible, but the pay scale is terrible as you advance.  As a manager I didn't even get paid $10 an hour (back in 2011).  "
good,Was promised advancement several times and never got it. It was just a job to pay the bills and get through school. It taught me how to be a quick and speedy cashier.
good,"Most of the employees are ok. The discount is nice, and it's easy to get time off in an emergency, however there is a lot of ""double standards"" It's not what you do that counts but who you know."
good,Managers were flexible and understanding about my school schedule. There is little incentive to work your way further up in the company and management does not lead by example.
good,Walmart is a okay place to work at if your still saving money up to go to college but to keep as a career no. It has its ups and downs. Management okay. The pay is good though but. Still feel like Walmart doesn't take care of you.
good,Really wished they would try and show their employees more love as if they care about us working there. I also wish they follow the proper steps and rules as they suppose too!
good,Never enough people to do the job. No real benefits and substandard pay. No communication between managers and supervisors. Constant changes in ordering and inventory.
good,When I first began to work at Walmart is when I enjoyed my job everyday. When I transferred locations I didn't care for management. Bad way of doing things.
good,Morale was low at Walmart not a lot of positive communication between employees only negative ones. Managers seem lost on the daily task that was provided to us.
good,I loved working a walmart its very clean always alot of business there and alot to do i was a cashier at walmart but i would go back if i could but this time i would work in a department i love moving up in any job that i work at
good,"All personnel in a management roll should have some training before they assume that roll. Bad decisions made by inexperienced leaders.  Not to the fault of their own just following company guidelines, but they were unable to handle an follow-up questions or situation which came up."
good,They fire you for any problem they have with you. You get there and get assigned an isle. you stock then zone the isles. If your isle is not completed on time you will get in trouble.
good,"When i worked at Wal-Mart as a greeter,i hated it because i wanted to do more than just greet people,i wanted to interact with them more since I'm a people person."
good,"Not what you think. Low pay. Poor employee morale. Management OK, but not too concerned with employee productivity. Too much focus on making a buck instead of quality customer service. No incentives for employees to do more than what job entails."
good,"Empresa com.deficiencia na parte de infraestrutura,e em todo seu sistema, dificuldade muito grande na lojistas."
good,walmart wasn't exactly the best place to work for many reasons that are far too numerous to mention but it was a job and i did learn new things so i won't forget my time there.
good,"Managers were varied. Some good, some bad. Co workers were fantastic, but there was no wiggle room for emergency situations, illnesses, or extra customer service"
good,"They have you work in other departments whenever needed without being asked. The pay isn't great and the work you like a dog. The store manager is fair to the employees but the management under him doesn't even know his employees that have been there 15-20+ years and doesn't treat them fair. The hardest part of the job was having too many customers at once waiting on you and you're the only one on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding merchandise that the customers want, hearing that you made their day and answering their questions."
good,I guess cause im a energetc and friendly person it was not so much my environment. You dont really get that welcome feeling when you walk into those doors. The work itself was easy.  They couldnt manage to ever get my work schedule right. I was hired and working at another job which they knew about but still manage to give me hours to work on days i worked at my other job.
good,"My main job is in apparel, but i am also experienced in Jewelry, electronics, home living, and cashier.  A typical day can have me in several different departments and also at the register as  cashier.  I have learned in retail it is alot like dealing with people on the phone as I have done for many years, you have to have patience and not take things personally"
good,Procedures and protocol not followed. Not enough workers doing freight. To much stock is left in back room. Need bigger workforce at night to complete ALL stocking.
good,"Alright if you don't mind hard work, with little pay. I have been working for Walmart for over 3 years and am making the same pay as workers that are being hired today. On top of that I have a total of 6 years retail experience to get just above min wage. what a joke."
good,Walmart is a tough job because you have to do many things. I was a truck unloader and unloaded about one to three trucks a day. It was a tough job and felt like we should of got paid more for what we did.
good,Work your butt off with little to no financial gain. Highly understaffed. No benefits offered to part time employees and few full time positions available. Was hired on as part time worked full time hours with no benefits.
good,it was ok it was good pay decent hours not to stressful easy going co workers management was decent not a bad place to start working overall not a bad place to work
good,This is a stressful work environment where your safety is not a concern for management. You are part of a corporation and there is no team work going on in this environment.
good,Wal-mart is a job. Thats all it is. Not a career. The managment is horrible. There is no culture. Hardest part? trying to find things to do to kill 8 hours of your day. Most enjoyable would be i got to interact with lots of different people
good,I was able to learn about Logistics and how they process their orders. The management team is ok but need work.  I suggest Management get more involved in their employees.
good,"Some of the Management Team is unfriendly and unprofessional. They do not speak, when you talk to them on a professional basis they do not give eye contact, or they have you follow them around the store talking."
good,"Nice job, they say they are flexible with hours witch is true to a extent. There is always something to do so you stay busy. The management can be rather rude at times. but overall its a nice job"
good,"Been working for walmart for 8 yrs, they don't want to give full time, benefits are decent if you can afford it, you get advancement in the company if you are well liked by management, you have to watch your back and walk on egg shells, cut hrs in the summer."
good,"Most management was great, at first. I was put in the position I really wanted, and excelled at my job. Eventually, I was offered training for a department manager position, but felt like I was put on the back burner after a while."
good,"to much drama, management staff seems not to care about the issues that employees have, other than that the job is great, works with ant kind of schedule you give them,"
good,I did not enjoy my summer job at Walmart. I did enjoy the fact that I was able to work with a diverse group of people but I do not believe I was utilized to my full potential.
good,"Good first or second job hard to making a living working there cause of the pay, coworkers for the most part were great, hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers that wouldn't be pleased no matter what you did."
good,Felder Service is a good place to work especially if you like working with older people. A typical day at work will go great but its like all the time you have to work by yourself and you will have other team members around. I've learned no matter what go on keep your job going. Management was bad. She showed a lot of favoritism toward certain workers. The workplace culture was very slow and relaxed. The most enjoyable part about this job is working with the elderly.
good,"I learn a lot from one day at work at Walmart. Sometimes it can get overwhelming, but having great employees to work with make it worth the hard times. Management sometimes make me feel very confused, i can do one thing and then it is wrong. I understand things are constantly changing, but communication is something that needs to be work on. Overall,management are approachable an nice to work with."
good,"Please be sure you keep a back up plan at all times. With this much change in recent years, you don't know when you will be laid off. Always have in mind that you are the only one there for your own career development."
good,Not a great place to work. Management is biased towards certain employees. Not great benefits or compensation. Overall bit a recommended place to work.
good,"This company is good for people that don't have a flexible schedule. because you can work in so many different departments, where they can accommodate to your needs. there is room to grow."
good,"•	Assist customers as needed. "
good,Stocking shelves zoning assisting customers price changes helping co-workers keep their areas neat n organized and shelves stocked answered phones ran cash register ran the site to store program.
good,"Apart from the busy weekend chaos, it is manageable with the right leaders. Most of the managers at Walmart treat employees like slaves and not like people. They are not very understanding or compassionate, and are always down your back about the simplest things. Apart from management, open weekend availability is a must, which can be tough when trying to balance life at the same time. "
good,This is for me a rough company to work for. If you do only moderate work from day one it's not so bad but if the managers see that you are willing to go above and beyond they will exploit and abuse it.
good,Walmart was ok to work at but managers were pushy and disrespectful and didn't help until the very last minute. the support managers were lazy and based your performance on employees who have been there for 10 plus years.
good,It was simple to pick up on the mandatory skills but difficult to work with management at times. After i mentioned needing to switch to day shift they were not willimg to work with me
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, i love meeting new people. I learned how to multitask in a fast paced environment. There wasnt really a hard part of my job, for me at least."
good,working at walmart was a very great experience for it opened my eyes to the management world and to the retail world. i was happy to be have put the store together with my store family it was all so new but also very informational.
good,While Walmart is fundamentally a great place to work the people are horrible and the management is very biased. There is alot of shady activity that is simply ignored by upper management.
good,it was   productive for the most part there were some inconsistencies with management seems was not communicating to well with employees and not very direct with their orders.
good,I actually really enjoy working with my co workers in the store.  The training is all done on a computer and you will be lucky if you get any hands training on the floor.
good,I was very let down by the Associates of store #2121. I had a great time working for walmart. Although there were those who were very unhappy with their jobs and should have found another or have been removed from the work enviroment all together.
good,Poor management made for a toxic work environment where the demands of the job became increasingly difficult because other shifts refused to do their part to make the whole store work efficiently
good,The customer were very great to be with and even some of the workers. But it wasn't the same for the boss or the managers on duty when my friend and I work there.
good,I enjoyed. My time with company. Was able to learn New skills and meet great people's this hob help my people. Skill. An management skills. Thank you.
good,It was a good run for me. I had fun with the co workers and it takes forever for them to give you a raise . Management was switched every month and didn't know which direction they were heading.
good,"It was a great job until i switched to day shift and everything started to go downhill from there."
good,I loved working with the customers and overall loved my job. The back up from management and the ability to make decisions that bettered myself and others was very lacking. Management rarely backed us up and did not provide adequate resources to train and execute decisions properly. This job really taught me how to balance many different things at one time and how to problem solve effectively. I loved the fast paced enviroment and the ability to make a difference.
good,To say this was my first job i cant complain its was an source of income in school and my co workers did make it fun everyday at work never a dull moment
good,a regular day at wal-mart would be considered as a fast- paced daily environment. during holidays and the beginning of the month is usually the busiest.
good,"Easy job, not too much workflow. . . .management was not too bad. Great place for someone who needs a second job. Flexible schedules that help so much."
good,".. Advising you to not milk the clock, but they neglected people on their breaks.  Required to take a lunch, but penalized if you are over or under your time, yet were disturbed during breaks, or lunches with customer calls.  "
good,"At Walmart nothing would got done, always behind, employee's rude to customers."
good,"My job is an excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways.How to embrace new technology, how to Communicating takes work and Health insurance and retirement"
good,Sometimes the job can be overwhelming. This definitely a job where your coworkers make it great. They do give you space to grow and they do give chances and at times the proper training.
good,Its a good job for beginners. People have been working there for so long. Benefits are good. Promotions are good. Management can be better. Overall its fine.
good,"A typical day at work it is very busy answering phones, talking to insurances, unloading boxes with merchandise , putting it way, assisting patients, confirming appointment, prescreening patients, helping patients with glasses and contacts, and performing great customer service. I have learned a lot the 10 years I have been there, learned  how to cashier, work customer service, and optical education. Workplace culture can be intense but it is okay. The hardest part of the job is doing well but sometimes are not appreciated for the work you have done to help assist the company. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people for all different walks of life."
good,"Would be good first time job for those just starting out. Learned some good customer service skills. Good diversity, and for some, opportunities for advancement."
good,"Lack of management and empathy is one of the biggest downfalls in this company. I have not had any direct contact with other managers besides my own since I work in the pharmacy. However, the way I see some employees are being treated is horrible. My typical day at work includes assisting the pharmacist with daily duties such as filling prescriptions, billing insurance claims and manage inventory. The most enjoyable part of working is interacting with customers and making someone smile. The hardest part is seeing employees come to work unhappy and devalued."
good,A typical day at work is usually pretty fun and relaxed love my co workers they are like family. Multiple oppurtunities to advance with the company have learned a lot about how retail works . Hardest part of the job would be the lack of pay I feel employees are not paid what they are worth.
good,I felt like the computer training was way too much and there wasn't nearly enough hands on training. I thought the employees seemed miserable and management didn't help. Management was always extremely stressed and had a very blaming attitude.
good,Work you like a dog and then lay off a bunch of people in January. Very high expectations but not near enough time in the day to get the work done.  They talk a lot about work/life balance but it's all talk.
good,"Even though I learned a lot and made ton of good friends working at Wal-Mart, my experience was not all that great .Management was not fair and a little bias. At one point in time I had to contact cooperate and inform them of the unfair treatment. They did not seem sanctified with jobs well done. Also when it came to customers and how we dealt with them they could never give us correct procedures. Some management would bend rules and would cause an issue for me resulting in some type of consequence. Overall I did learn a lot and it really helped me improve my customer service skills but there were a lot of adjustments that could've been made."
good,I liked working there I started as just a temp walmart dot com associate that was trained as a cashier and then moved to the one place I feel at home the electronics sales because I know more about electronics then I do about other things But the management don't take care of their responsibilities which in turn costed me my job Yes was my doing but could have been prevented if they did what was told in orientation Our attendance marks were set at 4 for new hires but they said that If you get close to the limit They will Have a couching and tell you if one more you can get let go I called out sick twice because of flu and late a few times by ONE minute because of road conditions and rather then a couching like they said would happen I had no clue how many I had and they pulled me into office and let me go rather than doing what they should have done according to the orientation.
good,"Decent place to work for, gives good hours but not consistent. Wants you to have open availability and be able to work around the clock however for someone with kids that is unrealistic."
good,"It can be a good place to work if you work in the right stores. When I started I worked in a great store, where management was nice and helpful, but when I moved to a new city the management was rude and were almost always condescending while talking to any associate. So depending on the store and management it can be an ok place to work."
good,"Wal-Mart had a very interesting work environment. There were also very diverse and interesting customer queries, requests, and issues that needed to be handled."
good,"Overall, I'd say working here has been ok. I've met some wonderful people & have gained some valuable experience doing something I enjoy in assembling bikes, furniture & grills for display & for customers."
good,It was a learning experience. Customer service has helped me with a lot jobs after walmart. I love working with and around people. It was a lot good and bad days.
good,"I like working with the people around me, I love the interaction between customers. The only reason I did not continue working here is there was no room for advancement, I could never switch to another position and there was never any communication between management and myself unless it was telling me to do something specific. I worked there for 6 months getting paid 9$/hour. I was told I would move up to 10$ and hour after I finished my computer training but they never let anybody do their training."
good,I would never recommend any one unless you really need a job to work here they slave you and don't pay Yu any attention they don't care ab their workers that's why they pay so much.
good,The whole time i worked there i did my best and worked fast. As an overnight stocker you have to go fast. You only have four days to learn what to do. The first full shift they team you up with someone but the second day your on your own and if you aren't fast enough they'll pull you aside and tell you that. They expect you to know where everything is the minute you start working. Working electronics and door greeting were the only good parts of working there. They treat there employees like very poorly. For instance I looked at my schedule for the next 3 weeks one time and wasn't scheduled for a whole week. I brought it up to a supervisor who did nothing about it so I brought it up to another supervisor who again did nothing about it. It wasn't until I was waiting for the store manager that my third supervisor came up to me and finally got me scheduled for the week I wasn't scheduled. Basically don't bother getting a job with them. They don't care about there employees or customers.
good,It's ok for a startup job for a young person.  But long term I would not recommend staying.  Health insurance provided is a huge plus.  Pay is below market.  Would not recommend.
good,if Walmart would pay there reg employees better they would have better workers that stay longer. also if they were trained better customers would be happer
good,"Management tends to be very unhelpful, but it varies from store to store. Can be fun but it all depends on coworkers and if you like what you do or not. Not a lot of room for advancement."
good,When I use to work here all the managers would let there position get to their heads. They would yell at us if we didn't have enough time or worker to finish a job. I was also the youngest in my department and my coworkers started to use age discrimination towards me.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. However, it's unfortunate that if you are coached and ask to see any video recording of any incidents they do not allow it."
good,never working there again. the organization was pretty bad. i never got the proper time off. you are paid to do a completely different job than what you are paid for.
good,Fairly fast paced environment made the time pass quickly. Most co-workers complained regularly about having low moral and little recognition. As long as I ignored them and did my job I enjoyed it.
good,"I am part of the Modular Team and a typical day at the job is changing shelves, cleaning the shelves, and getting rid of the deleted merchandise in order to put the new and profitable merchandise on the shelves."
good,Walmart is a good starter job but overall they fail at properly training their staff. It's hard to get full time and you will never have a consistent schedule unless you are a department manager. I would not consider making walmart a long term employment.
good,"Low Pay, Medical Benefits.. Lots of People, very unfair practices, at least when i was working there.. No one cared it was like a bunch of mindless sheep and Zombies roaming around."
good,This job makes you feel as if your working on a plantation. Everyone is cliques up. Management talks to you as if your nothing. They allow other employees to bully others. If you go to management with a complaint more than likely they will get rid of you.
good,"Customers are very rude and management does nothing about it. Management will also tell you one thing and customers another so customers get mad at you. Walmart never has enough cashiers, so its rare to get a break on time."
good,"Keep looking... I will not appraise or bash but advise to cut your losses. My experience was not unpleasant,  I advanced . The chain of command was not followed and there was no open door policy. You may be pulled into areas you have no idea what youre doing there due to lack of staff."
good,"my day was to recieve and put away dairy products, when other department personel did not show i was moved to that department to put products away. example for frozen food, meats, produce"
good,"Being an employee of Walmart, I would say taught me a lot about typical work environments. The culture was very individualistic in the sense, everyone was focused on exceeding as an individual rather than as a collective."
good,"typical work day was busy"
good,"Aprendí a ser atento con los clientes y brindar un buen servicio, además de que aprendí a resolver los problemas que se me presentaban en el transcurso de los hechos en el menor tiempo posible"
good,"I enjoy working with people on a project or assigned tasks. "
good,A typical day at Wal-mart starts with opening the self-checkouts. Most days are steady business and then there are some days that it's crazy busy. Most of the managers are nice to work with. The hardest part of the job is when all of the self-checkouts are full and you are trying to watch a customer whose cart is full while also keeping an eye on the other checkouts to ensure nobody is stealing. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and speaking with the regular customers.
good,They are well organized and great with change. The employees are respectful and know what their doing. The management could use a little work on showing their employees a bit more respect but other then that they are a great organization.
good,"I like dealing with  most of the customers. I have learned a lot about the different dept. especially the paint and hardware dept, I knew nothing about paint  when I started there 4 yrs ago. the management team verys like all work places   hardest part of job is being nice and friendly to rude people.  I really enjoy helping people"
good,"I worked for 2 Wal-Marts and a Sam's Club. It was my impression that the Managers were over-worked and then they came down on us. No awards, no words of encouragement. Their policy is something like: ""If you're still here, consider that reward enough."""
good,"My career path at WalMart has taught me quite a bit. I started out in the meat department part time and now a maintenance associate full time. My managers were pretty upset that I wanted to leave the meat department, because I was the one that got all the highest sales in the department. Now, I am known to keep the store at its cleanest. M most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers and even associates around the store. I love that I have knowledge about how to do multiple jobs around the store. I have even had to help a new manager learn how to do her own job by showing her what all she is required to do."
good,"It is a solid starting job, but not a career. Management moved you along quickly and set you loose on the job after two days of training. They claimed lots of benefits but they rarely actually applied to a majority of employees."
good,"My typical day is returing items from customers, what i learned is that the management and be very slow sometimes when you need their help when it comes fine to helping a customer. the hardest thing is how rude some managers can be"
good,"The location I was employed at was not organized at all. The management team could have been better, but that was only the location I was at.  I can say that working there enhanced my people skills."
good,"Typical day at work was as expected, you work"
good,Staff meetings.  Stocked every night.  Worked overnight so never any time to have a personal life.  Worked with all kinds of different people and a good learning experience for my first real job.
good,"The culture of the store was always busy and go, go, go. I learned how to efficiently clean the deli dishes and how to prepare food that would't make the costumers sick. I would slice meat and cheese, stock shelves, fry food, clean utensils and dishes, and serve costumers. There were times where the costumers would get angry with myself of my coworkers but costumer service is what Walmart prides itself on so we always went above and beyond for the costumer."
good,"Good for students looking for part time work, very flexible shifts and hours. Management can be unprofessional (lack of training). Associates are dropped into departments with very little training, need to be quick to learn/catch on"
good,Should hire people that are qualified as managers and regional  managers over professional departments and those should make sure all under their leadership too are trained to do the job hired to do.
good,Devem ter mais funcionários assim não ficaria tão cansativo para os outros
good,"a typical day consisted of assisting costumers, and pushing merchandise to the floor management was understanding of home conditions over all the work conditions and management were rather nice"
good,When I get to work I down stack my freight by areas and then work it. When I'm on the floor stocking I have to check dates and rotate the items by the dates and pull the products that are out of date. Guess the worst part of my job is they do not pay enough for what we do. I can honestly say retail is not a great place to work. The most I have enjoyed there is the new friends I have made. They are always cutting hours and when you're living pay check to pay check you can't afford that
good,It's a nice work environment but management is out of place most of the time. The mornings are best but afternoons are terrible. Front of the store is good except employ parking is always dirty compared to rest of the lot.
good,A good job other than the slow times. the work is very boring and menataunous. Competive pay and decent benefits. Good schedule flexablity. Management can lack communication.
good,"aprendes mucho en la atención al cliente si llega molesto tu encuentras la manera de como calmarlo ofreciéndole las promociones que estén en ese momento, tratar de ponerse en su lugar para entenderlo muy bien lo que quiere y necesite. La parte mas difícil son los días de quincena cuando se llena demasiado la tienda, ya que te hablan por todos lados y te exigen agilizar tu cobro."
good,"There is a lot of opportunity for people who work hard and try to achieve it. "
good,The management is terrible. they do not care. my coworkers are the only reason other than pay that I did not quit. very few management actually gave a helping hand when needed
good,"Quite honestly I enjoyed my time at Walmart, I believe I was just at the wrong store where myself and some other employees were not given adequate room and a chance to grow. Favortism played a big part in my leaving the company and a store manager who wasn't ready to be in that position."
good,"Training is Mostly done by computer. Depending on which store you work at, Management can be horrible. Lots of repeat work. You finish a task the way one manager told you, then later you are doing again the way a higher one tells you. Management plays favorites A LOT. . Recently known to fire people for no reason, sometimes even illegally. You do however get a raise once a year, and the scheduling is fairly flexible. and starting pay is not too bad."
good,"As I spend 8 hours a night on my feet cleaning a Neighborhood Walmart I typically end up bored as I've long since heard all the songs they play throughout the night. Since Market managers seem to cycle in and out every couple of months, I'm constantly expected to perform more and more tasks than usual yet still leave no later than 7AM."
good,"The company is good to work for, although certain areas offer little room for advancement without post-secondary education attainment."
good,It was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to.stock many areas. It was great getting to help all of our customers find what they needed.
good,"a typical day is usually slow during the mornings unless it is a holiday. by noon it gets very busy until about closing. management is ok, scheduling is weird, either you get a large amount of hours or barley enough. Going on break on time is a hassle, its rare that you get on break on time. the hardest part of the job is getting through the rush of the day and rude customers, and there are a lot."
good,Interacting with associates and members to create a friendly environment is part of the daily routine. The management is separated from the associates and it shows in how things are handled on many levels. A great company for internal promotions.
good,learned that they say they treat you like family but when you need them the most they see you as just an other associate. I also learned that if you didn't speak a certain language then you weren't going to get a promotion or move up in the company. The hardest part about the job was having to stand all day and having your feet hurt at the end of your shift.
good,Set up for the truck handle pallet jacks and pallets unloading frat off the truck stack up the boxes take them To the Floor stock and zone the area ..
good,"Overall not a really bad job they give you plenty of breaks really and an hour lunch, 10 percent discount on certain items and a raise every year you work there"
good,Started off easy and went harder and harder with less workers in my department making it harder on the rest of us and got to the point where it was ridiculous for the pay.
good,"Days were not too bad, I learned how to accurately pick products and deliver them to loading stations. I feel the way the warehouse was set up was more or less dysfunctional overall."
good,"Managers ignore you, You are overworked, Never recognized for achievements, Below average employees get promoted over exceptional ones, the turnover rate should speak for itself"
good,Attendance policy and point system is the hardest thing to deal with. Miss to many days you get fired.  I've learned how to be confident and be dependable.
good,fast paced and irrate customers. tested my patience and customer service skills and i made it through successfully. due to new programs being implemented and the lack of training on such programs adapting was difficult.
good,"The management is questionable. They hire pretty much anyone to be a customer service manager, mostly people with no experience and not too good with customers. The other co-workers are great and fun people to work with. For the most part, when it comes to scheduling, they are fair unless they want you to open up your availability, then they short your hours. I was a full time student while working, and when it was time for exams, they were pretty understanding and tried their best to give me those days off and give me time to study. Depending on what managers I went to, my issues were solved quickly. Just make sure you have a pretty decent relationship with a higher manager or two and you will be ok."
good,works for walmart 7 and a half yrs mangement did not know how to do there job. Sold fire arms mixed paint unloaded trucks inventory control specialist our ics.
good,Does not have any compassion for single parents who have to work to take care of home while also taking care of home. In order to make sure your customers are being treated good you have to treat your associates the same way.
good,"Wal-Mart is excellent for teens or students trying to earn a little extra money. It is, in no way, a career that can pay the bills."
good,Good part time job.  Worked around my schedule. Should pay more to night and weekend workers. Should offer bigger discounts to employees.  Everyone was very nice.
good,"Not the worst place I have worked. I have years of management experience but, BUT, I cannot get a management position. Was told I need to ""put"" my time in.  Doesn't seem like a good business model to me. "
good,"Just a another day at the office basically, i have learn basic customer service, and how to work safe, management need a little straighten up, they don't really put in much effort to help associates, but overall not bad, workplace culture is pretty okay, the job is not hard, unless certain amount of people doesn't shows up for work, so its just extra work that is going to take a lot more time to be done, most enjoyable part of the job is when everybody is present and ready to work."
good,"Had fun working there but store ,assistant, management needs to be a lot better the job isn't hard to do its just the pay, and they expect you to do anything and everything but don't want to pay. That's with any job I think."
good,"I need more hours in order to be able to support my family and they aren't able to give me that, I don't appreciate the way some of the management is with their staff. I would like a better work environment for myself."
good,Walmart has been a good experience for me and i got the opportunity to interact with a number of interesting customers and build relationships. The pay is not as good as expected but I got to learn about the mechanism behind running a superstore.
good,"It was okay, it was my first job but the managers were not following protocol and it was so much unethical business going on there. It was my first and last fast food job."
good,"The studio was a great place to work, some days extremely fun, others very boring.  The business changed and they began demanding people be conned into packages that they didn't want nor could afford. We we not allowed to be creative nor bring in items that were not part of the usual package.  I learned that kids and families are hard to make smile all at once, but sometimes the best shots were the ones that were destined for the trash."
good,Era prevenir cualquier tipo de robo por parte del personal como de los clientes
good,"Everyone is paid the same rate of pay on the shop floor but the type of work a person does is not taken into account. Some roles involve only light manual work where other roles the work is heavy manual but all roles are considered to be equal for pay purposes."
good,Walmart can be a hit or miss. You may get a team of great workers and great management or you may not. My management seemed to work with schedules fairly well. Sometimes when the managers change you might get a bad apple. However the thing that is horrible is the way customers treat associates. I've literally been called every name under the sun and there not really much you can do about it. Plus walmart is really cheap about getting employees supplies like pens
good,"Mostly out of retirement personnel, offering minimal job flexibility to single younger parents with children and next to impossible to relocate to other stores."
good,They were very unorganized and dysfunctional. Management was given to whoever knew what they were doing or had more time in. I learned how to use PLE and more warehouse procedures but they don't respect their employees.
good,"My job was to stock food in the freeze, on the shelves, sweep the floor, and help customers as needed. I like working at Walmart. The manager staff was not respectful."
good,I have worked for Walmart for several years and have not had the opportunity to advance but was pushed to work late nights instead.
good,"do not work for this company"
good,On the daily i would clock in ill go over an see what produce i would be pulling today an then clean work area trash bad produce. My responsibility was to make sure nothing but the fresh's of the fresh was on the sales floor.
good,"The people were ok, The managers and supervisors never showed up when requested. Due to the remodel barely had any items customers were looking for. Cut back on hours so everyone worked less than 30 hours a week."
good,"A typical day at work , meeting new people , nice environment.  But I also learned that everyone is not your friend.  I came to do my job not to make friends"
good,The majority of the time I worked there we did not have a department manager. The dairy/frozen associates were expected to do the work of the ms and their normal duties but also got pulled to other departments.
good,Great opportunity for advancement if you know all the things it takes to get there. Many different jobs you can do while working for the same company.
good,"I  didn't have much chances to work my way up the ladder, but, it was a good fast paced job to get me off and running. I'm not ashamed of it and I can honestly say it was the best way to get me into working full time."
good,"Loved my morning hours but hated that the managers said schedules were made 2 weeks in advance and then ask you to stay longer, come in on days off, or not give you a requested day off even if asked a month in advanced."
good,"other than the crazy policy of the point system they have its a  decent place to work. best paying entry level job, keeps you busy.               The management team is not all the best."
good,"started off great, but i had no idea i wouldn't be getting any benefits and less than 40 hours a week. if gotten close to 40 hours the would make you take off of work because the don't like paying over time and do not want to give there employees benefits"
good,The nature of work had a very fast phase. A lot of turn over on associates and a lot of unhappy associates. But I met a lot of associate who worked with walmart for more than ten years. But they are the ones who are not aiming for carreer development.
good,Working at walmart was a great experience. I learned how to work in very busy/pressuring environment. My memory skills became greater as I had to learn different codes for different products. I always kept a happy smile on even when I wasn't receiving the same from the customer. Made the best of ever day and worked as hard as I could to show what I was worth to the company.
good,The flexible scheduling is really all it offers for part time workers. if you want to advance financially you have to become a manager and have completely open availability.
good,it was pretty good most days it like the job and the people i worded around there was great leadership there best walmart ive been in
good,"Same thing, different day. management is very nagging and does not seem to care. Hours can be nice depending on job title. Advancement is easy if you have good work ethic."
good,"The job itself wasn't difficult. It was the management team, they always usually make or break a job. They would say one thing but totally mean another."
good,"the atmosphere as soon as you walk in is negative. managers only care about themselves, and there is a lot of drama. very little benefits now that the wages went up. you will not get many hours."
good,cap team 2 was my position and it was a very routine which was unload a trailer of merch. and place it in a designated area. After that   you are responsible for stocking assigned isle.
good,I learned how to be a cashier also I learned how do deal with customers and make them happy if they was happy with there visit.
good,this store is very unorganized. The management is never able to help customers and co workers. The only good thing about this store is the energy from the good co workers and some customers
good,"Management didn't really listen like their open door policy promises, wasn't accommodated for with my disabilities. Other than that, average job helping customers in garden center."
good,"I worked in the connection center activating lines of service, and helped out in the photo lab, electronics, toys, and the .com department.  This was at the dawn of the smartphone age and the 4 person department averaged 80-90 activations per month during the early years (2008-2010).  I learned about manipulating inventory, activating lines of service and dealing with major carriers. The support I received was stellar.  Walmart support and carrier support was responsible for this.  The hardest part was not being able to complete the activation for the customer due to them not having the credit rating required and therefore having to put down an excessive down payment, or just the fact that their contract had not been fulfilled. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction I derived from seeing them walk out having had a pleasant experience."
good,"work is very rewarding. always get a mixed expectation of what, when, and who needs to be doing what depending on which manager is giving direction."
good,"You don't get good hours or benefits, and with all the new rules it makes it miserable to work there, but it did pay the bills."
good,Employee moral was the lowest that it could ever be. Managers there were rude and unprofessional. Everyday was a nightmare and you were lucky if you were able to clock out at the end of your shift in a positive mood.
good,I worked the sales floor  while I was working here and I had a good time with it. Im usually pretty good with people so it was a breeze. They were pretty bad about picking favorites and messing up our schedules but it wasn't half bad working there
good,"Always provided me with hours, which was great. As a cashier, training was easy and not rushed. It was a very simple and easy job. The people working there varied in age, which was great."
good,Managers where not the greatest at their jobs in the fact that they too much from one person. The people I worked with where great people.
good,The staff was great. The hardest part was there wasn't enough staff and people always came back late on there breaks. I enjoyed seeing all the customers and helping them in what they needed.
good,Walmart was a good place to work until the Assistant Manager was changed. The new Asst Mang. had no idea how to make the Deli more productive workers were overworked.
good,I loved the discounts that you get working for this company gets you. Everyone works as a team here as well. We work hard and have fun at the same time.
good,It wasn't glamorous so I can't really sugar coat nor would I. it was a tough job with not a lot of appreciation for the work you did if any at all but it taught me a lot about being on a team and working well with others regardless if you like them or not.
good,Job was not too bad at first start butbecame difficult with drama and management would not do anything. Working with the customers was great an rewarding.
good,I loved working for Walmart for many many reasons. I love to be busy and Walmart has always been my job security. Working there for many years I have made new family members. Most long term associates establish great relationships with each other and are always willing to help each other out. I have had the opportunity to work in 7 positions in the 2 stores I have worked at. I love knowledge and always open to learning new things and Walmart always gave that opportunity.
good,"Productive and co workers became family, as well as the customers."
good,Working here was not always been the best but it was worth it. We had good hard working managers that made sure all business work was complete while showing respect to all of the workers. We also mad okay money so it was pretty good.
good,"The people working there are all fairly nice and friendly enough. However, a severe lack of communication among departments and between managers and hourly workers can make it a very unpleasant place to work."
good,It was an okay place to work. Management didn't care much about the employees. Training was quick and fast paced. Hours seemed to drag on .
good,I worked for Wal-Mart twice.  The first time started out great.  But then I had a co-worker who stabbed me in the back several times and management did nothing.  My second go around was great.  Everyone was great to work with.
good,Working third shift gets easier day by day. The management is honestly the worst I have experienced. The heavy lifting makes for a great workout. You feel you have achieved something by the end of your shift. You're always in an upbeat pace getting things done by a certain deadline. The hardest part of the job was dealing with Management and their sarcastic comments. They always have this attitude as if they are bigger and better than everyone around them. My experience working third shift at Walmart brought me back to high school again. I hated high school.
good,"Working on-site at Walmart has not been the best of experiences. I have learned a lot about corporate campaigns, but the Marketing processes are not concrete and it is difficult to work with some marketers and their Operations team."
good,Working for such a large corporation you find yourself constantly working on different tasks. One day you make be on cashier duties while other days you are changing the prices. It  definitely keeps one busy.
good,"worked as a TLE sales associate ,made a lot of friends. Did not like it when the co-mgrs. over ride policies that you have to work under .like when a customer say I bought this battery for my welding machine .it worked to days and quit working.i want anther one.we tell the customer  everstrart batterys don't go in welding machines they only go in auto/trucks. co-mgrs. tell you to swap it out."
good,"They grey you IN and things go well for a while and then starts the tomfoolery ie, schedules, pay rates and nonsense.  They aren't about the employees."
good,Es una buena empresa pero me parece que debido a las preferencias entre asociados llamense jefaturas y colaboradores es muy difícil ascender para los colaboradores q no cuentan con esa preferencia**
good,"Store 1414 is not the place to work for, there is a lot of internal corruption. Regardless of your daily assignments, an associate will always do more, which is fine, however you will never be appreciated. Each member of management will give you non corresponding jobs to do, there is little to no communication between management so they will never be on the same page. Most fellow co-workers seem sad and unmotivated because of managements demeaning attitude. The hardest part of my job was struggling to complete a shift with 2 people, where there should of been 11 or a minimum of 8. The most enjoyable part of my job however was being able to always satisfy my customers, I am an attentive employee and like to see people happy. When a customer had a smile on there face, that is what always let me know I did my job right. Working with my team was enjoyable as well, they are a good group of people and together we always did our best to get tasks done."
good,"Es una empres enorme, con políticas de desarrollo para el empleado muy buenas, claro si se llevaran acabo, el salario considero que podría ser mejor"
good,"The customers tend to call you horrible names and make fun of any sort of disability; however the managers doors are always open weather you have to vent or cry. I enjoy the openness that the managers have with the employees; we may not always like what they have to say but it's always to just help and improve yourself as an employee/ person. The hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with the name calling from customers and having to wait for a CSM to come and help (Depending on the time and day). I have learned that even if people are at their rudest, they come back again and again because you handled the situation; and did the appropriate actions when it got out of hand. Pretty much your typical day will start with clocking in at the time punch, and you head to your post (or department) and go down your list of things that need to be done (depending on what time you're working). If you're working over 6 hours you get two 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch. You answer questions, and call a CSM for complaints that you can't handle or you personally feel the customer was wronged. You then finish up your day with either leaving your post (or department), or wait for the next shift to come and take over and clock out."
good,This company isn't that good when it comes to communication and organization. unless your well known by management its difficult to move up in the company. Raises are cents to the dollar.
good,I worked there a few months because i was over worked and not paid enough. I didnt feel as thought management cared for their employees. The supervisor i had would have a mad look on her face everyday.
good,"Job duties are not to hard and easy to accomplish. Management was not to caring for there employees, stocked shelves and cleaned assigned areas, didn't learn much."
good,"A typical day at Walmart consists of meeting a lot of customers helping any customer that come with in 10 foot radius,managing the front end cashiers making sure breaks and lunches are given on time, Auditing 1 register for each hour we work, Doing cashier observation making sure each cashier if following the correct guidelines when ringing up a customer at the end of the night we are to go around the store and remove all money from the registers  "
good,"Not a very good store to work at, walmart isn't to bad of a company to work for, but this store has some major management issues for one it's a constant battle to just do your job, having to do everyone else's at the same time your trying to do yours help from management is waiting for 30mins to just show up its just crazy all the time."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, I enjoyed dealing with the customers, management was unbearable, they never assisted when we need assistance. All they did was dish out orders and never wanted to assist when the front end need help."
good,"Loss prevention specialists conduct surveillance, detain people who are attempting to shoplift, and watch for dishonest behavior or activities by store employees. Loss prevention specialists are necessary for any retailer that strives to minimize theft in the store"
good,"they have bad human resourse and policies"
good,"Nice place to work, staff friendly and helpful. Walmart is always busy with sales. Time flys at work .Alot of Part time jobs, vs Full time positions. Steady job."
good,"It was a decent place to work, if you were in need of a job. Very limited career potential. There is a lot of cross training involved and  a high expectation of being accountable for duties you were not trained for, mostly because of short-staffing,"
good,"Always pressure by managers."
good,I don't like my job because ofhow im treated they suck and i dont like the way rhey trest me there. Who knows maybe itll get better some days are better than other and sometimes i dont mind going to eork sometimes i dont wanna be there.
good,Strick on attendance even if you have a very valid reason for absence . Management had a lot of slackage .. They were never really on the same page as each other.
good,300 employees compete for very few full-time positions when they become available.  Management constantly rides you to work faster by threatening job.
good,"Productive and fun but the managment was horrible the give u hours based on favoritism. Overall i enjoy customer service work being able to meet new people even if i never see them again,"
good,"While the company has some perks, the overall atmosphere is one of reward those who put forward a nice face and put forth the minimum of effort while reprimanding those who actually put forth the effort to make sure everything is done correctly, all while paying the associates just above the bare minimum."
good,Nothing extravagant it was temporary and payed the bills. I was mostly in the deli where the veterans barely did anything and the new people worked too hard. Management was barely present but definitely worked hard whenever they were.
good,Working at walmart I gained a lot of customer service experience. They taught me that customer satisfaction is the number key to great customer service.
good,"They where unfair, unprofessional, and did not communicate well with their employees. My supervisor showed whenever he wanted. I feel that they should be more assertive and act like they're willing to help."
good,"after moving departments to get away from csm's that was causing drama, i trained two new people and then was fired. told to reapply in 30 days. i only had a few days left til my evaluation which would of gave me a raise and a bonus."
good,A good place to work for going though college but sometime have you working late when you have school early the next day. The managers always expect more than what you get paid for and take all the credit for the work
good,It was a good experience for me to work at i had a lot of great people to work with and learned alot of different experiences there at walmart supercenter.
good,"The  Heard  part about working there is having to get along with people who don't appreciate you.  The customer can sometimes be very rude. Getting everything done in a thinly matter, by your self because the managers don't have much respect for there  associates."
good,"I was always about an hour early to work. When I got onto the floor I was technical support for the self checkout system. I approved transactions and assisted customer with their checkouts. "
good,"Though Walmart can be very comfortable to work for, certain aspects of being employed there are less than satisfactory. They frequently schedule employees for three and four hour days, without any means of justification other than, home office has only allotted a certain number of hours."
good,overall a good place to work.i met some great people that i call family and ive me some not so great ones too .some of the mangers that are there should be mangers
good,"Enjoyed working there kept busy all day to pass the time.  Management was helpful,co-workers took the time listen.The most enjoyable part was operating the fork lift."
good,overall good money and experience full time benefits and compensation good hours management speaks with you directly if necessary  sometimes too much drama dealing with coworkers
good,"I really loved how they allowed me to chase after my baby in transfers across stores. But, that family culture is truly fake.  You are only loved as far as they can throw you, unless you can tattle-tale."
good,"Buen ambient laboral"
good,"Worked the night life for almost six years. Management at the store level was overall good at both stores I worked at as I started in Central City, KY. Home office doesn't care about their workers as every year they seem to take more away from their  workers who have been with the company for years. No more holiday pay, forced to work thanksgiving but that schedule doesn't come out until that week so you can't make plans. No holiday pay any more, took away the Sunday premium from those who had been grandfathered into that. Constantly understaffed, and often worked areas outside of job description. The team always seemed to come together and get the job done, often surprising our managers as we'd have twice as much freight as hours to accomplish it according to the system. Management would often throw freight right alongside us."
good,"Upper management lacks qualifications or intelligence to properly conduct stores and company."
good,"The Walmart management was good, I can't really complain. The Policy makers are the ones to blame. I loved the environment and my coworkers. The amount of work that they wanted from each individual person is asinine. Unstable work hours made it hard to plan paychecks."
good,"Walmart é uma grande empresa, com enormes oportunidades de crescimento e desenvolvimento."
good,Loved this job. Would have stayed if they would have paid better and covered shifts better. The cashiers that I supervised liked working with me and I them
good,"A day working at Walmart would be quite stressful for me. I would get there, sign in, get straight to work, all on day one. I got no form of training for it and had to learn by watching my coworkers (I worked in Apparel). The management wasn't very supportive, but then again I was too busy trying to keep up and make sense of everything while doing my best to my job properly. My coworkers were nice, but couldn't really help me when I needed it most (Walmart is a very busy place). The hard part of my job was simply trying to do my job right while dealing with more stress then I could handle and trying to help customers asking me the location of things I didn't know the locations of."
good,"I worked at walmart for10 years the management did not care for the customers or employees. I am handicapped at first the worked with me .They say they hire handicaps but the don't want to work with us.I had to go to the EEOC, to be able to walk with a basket  the approved it. Walmart did not like it, they were harassing me to stop using the basket. I was fired because I said no,  you have to be a part of the click."
good,"too many managers, causing a bunch of different views on one matter or projects, when you do have a good manager its one of the things that keep you there , but they move manager shifts every quarter"
good,"Can be a very hard and physical job at time which is  not always a bad thing. Try not let others  work ethics  get to you . Management are  not always fare. Love working with many coworker consider many as friend now. Not saying anything to other that are not doing there job.  When the job is finished and it look good, you accomplished a lot. It make you feel good."
good,"If you do not speak out against the company, you will succeed.  Open-door policy means - tell us what we want to hear.  Complaints against policy (even if stated nicely and are relevant) may backfire."
good,Having to stand for hours on end with no break or the opportunity to sit down did a number on my back.  A lot was expected of everyone without the proper pay to compensate.
good,I enjoyed the work I did. But everything was unorganized. Nobody wanted to take responsibility for the work that wasn't being done. I would be more than happy to working with Walmart again if it was for one that has its ducks in a row.
good,"People are really nice and good team work, but chances for advancement are low. Great learning for customer service but not much use for own personal skills"
good,"Typical nights include down-stacking pallets ensuring correct product placement, and delegating tasks for assistance working efficiently."
good,I enjoy my time working at Walmart super center it's a good company to work for til the new change  affected the pay. Meaning no holiday pay no overtime.
good,I enjoyed helping people and handling their billing issues for cell phone companies. The management I worked with some of them were very nice others were very dis-respectable of the co-workers.
good,I didn't like working at that job not only it was a bad area. But I felt my managers didn't handle the situations how they were suppose too
good,"Depending on management, Walmart can be an easy job as long as you get your work done. For the most part, your coworkers are easy to work with as long as you communicate with them."
good,"The job it's self is not bad, felt good getting so much done by the end of shift.  Pay is awful.  Was hurt on job.  They made me work in the cart area at night ( with the lights off) after their doctor gave me muscle relaxants and wrote me up because I fell asleep."
good,Company focus is on saving people money so they can live better. Company culture is based in Servant Leadership and supporting our associates.
good,"In a typical day as the night shift receiver i am responsible for all deliveries which include bread, milk, eggs, chips, pop ect. Making sure the back room is clean and up to Wal Marts standards. Stocking shelves, maintaining communication with management on deliveries are also part of my job. I have a good relationship with my co workers , and management does their best to provide support and training when needed. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i got all my tasks done correctly and safely each night. The worst part of the job is the difficulty in moving upward in the company."
good,The company has gone from a family-first company to a company-first type of company.  There is no such thing as work/life balance. The management team is overworked and under appreciated.
good,Advancement at SCM was pretty much predetermined and not based on your work performance. It was frustrating for many members who worked hard and did not gain recognition or advancement. Management advancement was based on who you knew.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for when you have store management that takes your ideas into consideration. Typical work day for a department manager includes shelf availability paper work, top stock tasks, price changes, stocking shelves, and running a register."
good,Walmart is a busy place to work. There are always things that need to be taken care of in the store so always stay alert. Be friendly to customers and remember they're always right.
good,Typical day consists of checking customers out on a register and reorganizing the sales floor. Hardest part of the job is the variety of managers. Priority lists for differing managers are different and you will sometime be stuck between two managers who want you to do different activities at the same time.
good,"Todos os dias era um dia bom de trabalhar. Aprendi a lidar com o publico e como deixar o cliente tentado com as mercadorias, fazendo com que as leve mesmo não sendo o seu interesse. A direção era ótima. Os colegas de trabalhos são o padrão mesmo, uns satisfeitos com a empresa e outros não. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era a compensação de horas extras, mas nada que me desmotivasse. A parte mais agradável era que nunca era monótono de se trabalhar. Com o contato direto com o cliente, o dia passava rápido."
good,"*Upper management lacks respect when speaking to other salaried management employees and hourly associates. "
good,Working at Walmart help me realize that not every job is for everyone. If you can not put your all in to the job you are doing you are working in the wrong field.
good,"It was a place that had a decent amount of work, but it seemed understaffed and workers were quite often pulled to thin with requirements."
good,A typical day was hard. We were often short staffed and didn't often receive help. Management was not very attentive and often left a lot of slack for employees to pick up.
good,"You maybe job coded for one thing and may never work in that department for the whole week, where ever they need you they are going to put you. They seem always understaffed. Some managers will work with you and others expect you to do your job, the next persons job and then what ever else they ask you to do. but then say no over time."
good,Wal-Mart is a stagnant company in which it is very difficult to move up and advance to build on valuable self-qualities. You are not challenged on a daily basis with tasks.
good,It was something I liked doing and enjoyed. But the managers and department managers wasn't involved with the employees as they should have. Wasn't always on time.
good,"This job isn't that bad.  Some days are calm and some days are absolutely terrible.  If we are ever low staffed, the managers try sending out other employees and they refuse.  Depending on which location you are at, your fellow employees will make your job difficult."
good,"I was a new assistant manager and had little retail experience; however, my associates were very welcoming.  I have learned to be a team player and treat all of my associates and other management with respect.  It allows for your work experience to be a better one.  I have, also, learned you MUST keep a paper trail and ensure all management and associates are on the same page."
good,"Is a really good place to work, good benefits, and good environment but is a terrible comunication with Management tours employees to many managers to many directions."
good,Co workers were great to be around and the customers were great mot of the time but the management didn't care about what was going on they didn't want to  deal with the problems that you needed to take care of like go to court
good,"I would get to work and have to search for a manager before hoping on a register. Then clean the register and belt, turn on the light and start checking out the customers. Sometimes the customers would be very nice and hold conversation, others would just ignore me and leave. While working at Walmart, I learned how to count change fast, how to properly handle difficult situations, how to work self service and identify problems. I didn't have any difficulties in my job, but the most enjoyable part of my job was watching my satisfactied customers giving me compliments to my manager and seeing my regular customers everyday."
good,"not a place to make a carrer its too much work for very little pay, management doesn't now suppot you and will throw you under the bus to protect their interest"
good,"each day you get to work they will talk about routine or processes.  But these routines and job processes are altered every day.  Sometimes 2/3 of the way through the day, with the expectation of still getting everything done.  Working with the employees was a positive.  But having the possibility of any outside manager come walking in and changing your work direction happened to often"
good,The store that I am currently working at is reducing hours; no room for advancement; management is not consistent and does not stand by their word.
good,Great starter job for right out of high school. Teaches you the work environment you don't want to have as a career. Your fellow floor crew are good to work with.
good,"A good place to work, but not paid enough to make a career out of the position or within the company. It would beneficial if there were more options to move up within the company."
good,"If you're looking for a company where you have the opportunity to advance than this is not the company for you. If you are a hard worker and continuously are told to take on more and more work, do not fret because it doesn't matter how much you do, it won't be appreciated and the person who slacks will always win. The problem with Walmart is that they don't show care towards there workers and they take advantage of them."
good,"A typical day at work was based on dealing with customers and employees for all walks of life, also stalking the shelves from the previous day. Some co-workers were great others not so much."
good,"To me, this was more or less a job than a possible ""career"". For Wal-Mart, the pay was good for the most part and management was phenomenal."
good,They focus on one thing at a time and do not maintain settings in computers allowing yrs of incorrect performance data of their  from their stores . They spend 70% of their time looking at the video footage of the employees looking for reasons to coach and not  managing the store and the associates
good,"The most difficult part of the job was the constant shuffling of management that they forced on us while I worked there. We had no clear line of communication about who our designated assistant manager was, what our tasks were, or how we should perform said tasks. For a few months, we did not have an assistant manager. Our shift (4 A.M. - 1 P.M.) also overlapped the end of the night shift and the beginning of the day shift, meaning we had two sets of managers to respond to every day who wanted different tasks accomplished that almost always conflicted with each other. I was always on good terms with all the managers, but with them not being on good terms with each other, it made work difficult."
good,"Os dias de trabalho são bem movimentados, a carga horaria é bem pesada, tenho ótimos colegas, adquiri experiência como operadora de caixa, é um lugar agradável de trabalhar."
good,"I did cashiering I helped customers"
good,Stocking and putting away of produce with little to no help was no walk in the park. Management was not the best when it came to delegating appropriate assisting with the position.
good,"Management team was not knowledable of processes and procedures."
good,just could not work the hours. have to be there a year before you get insurance. they pick your hours and if you can not work them they can not use you.
good,"laid back job, multi tasking involved, stocking from ABC order was the toughest part of the job cause you are timed to get it done slicing meat was my best act on the job or assisting customers"
good,"team work All the time "
good,"I really hated this job because I felt like nothing but a number, I didn't feel important. I kept the job as long as I did because it was a guaranteed paycheck with decent hours."
good,Walmart was an ok place to work. However it did not leave any time for family or schoolwork so that is the reason that I left. I did learn excellent organization skills due to the fact that all areas I supervised needed to be clean and organized multiple times daily.
good,The manager played favorites and fired everyone who had problems with her friend and her friend's family. The work environment was always hostile. I would never work there again unless the manager left.
good,Wal-mart is a great stepping stone company. Depending on your performance and the professionalism of management you will be able to advance. It can be a bad place but you are almost guaranteed great hours.
good,Walmart a good company to work for I have enjoyed my time there but it not the career I want to have when I have to work all hours it had to get ur body on a schedule
good,But overall a great place to work. You get to meet a lot of great customers. You get to help the elderly people. Get to interact with kids. The kids are great
good,"I had the job when i was still in school and it was good money at the time but the bosses were very strict and never let me have any time off to catch up on schooling,"
good,Nao tenho o que falar.. apenas achei um lugar razoavel de se trabalhar.
good,Working over night and not aloowed to have two comsecutive days is a problem if you have children it dose not give you efficent time to handle your resposibilities as a parent
good,It's was okay of a job there are things that could be better but that's with any job....definitely this giant of a corporation definitely should do a lot more
good,Rotating door of managers at this location and no communication between management and associates. it makes going to work unpleasant and depressing
good,Walmart is an alright place to work. It really just depends on what part of the store you desire to work at. It is very easy to move up if you bring determination and dress professional. I was to move up to a customer service manager in half a year of working there if it wasn't for a relative being a manager at the same store so I had to be a customer service associate. The real downfall of Walmart and with their customer service is that the managers expect you to follow policy but will overrule policy and make you look ignorant. They put you in situations to fail and get coached. You only get three before being fired. The managers are allowed to add tweaks to the policy and if you don't follow them it won't work out for you. My store has some really amazing managers but some that aren't which is normal. I recommend anyone who wants to work at Walmart to not work in the front end unless you really have a great costumer service attitude.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. The job was not complicated and I was good at it. Management is lacking which makes it hard on the employees, which in turn is why I left Walmart."
good,"A typical day at work for me could only be described as hectic and stressful. Although through this experience I have learned how to properly ice and decorate cakes, this is not what I ever imagined for a bakery."
good,The managers are all over the place and there is no direction and no one ever has plans for anything. I really would like to see more hiring within the store as well as promoting because I see alot of externals getting hired on when we have people within the store ready for promotions.
good,"co workers and my managers were nice everybody,was very respectful towards each other. We all made sure to help each other out when it was needed. Working for Walmart Canada had its ups and its downs, what I mean by that is that at time's you would get customers who were very respectable towards you and than you would have some who were nothing but rude and obnoxious. In customer service you have to know how to deal with both and in a very formal manor."
good,"Boa de trabalhar, mas muito sem organização, não tínhamos muito espaço para mostrar o trabalho e ser promovido."
good,It wasn't my favorite place to work at but it wasn't the worst. There was a lot of drama between the co-workers and management.
good,your schelue is never consit the pay is so low most employees are on welfare or driving cars that can barely make it to work bonus are sad some of the mangers are compeltly not understanding
good,Walmart is competitive in a salary point of view but you are never anything special no matter how hard you work. They do not seemed concerned with the actual person or anything happening in their lives
good,"Once clocking in, the pace was fairly fast paced in the pharmacy.  There was nearly always clients waiting in line to be served and phone calls that needed to be answered and redirected.  Prescriptions that had been filled need to be placed correctly in order to locate it quickly once the patient came to pick it up.  Friendly and informative service was always expected and given with the expectation the pharmacy technician would provide information within their scope of practice and refer more advance information (i.e. patient counseling on medications) to the pharmacist.  My co-workers were hard worker and worked together well while I was there and management was actively involved in the day to day activities within the pharmacy.  The most difficult aspect of the job was dealing with aggressive and rude customers.  I learned that keeping calm, listening, and treating the patient respectively was helpful in helping to calm down and upset customer and enabled me to work with them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was continuing to learn new information on medications, their usages, and other aspects of a pharmacy technician position."
good,"a typical day at walmart distribution center was very challenging "
good,"Management doesn't care about you or how you feel. If you complain, it's in one ear & out the other. They're not very understanding, and never have been the past 1.5 years I've been there."
good,"mal ambiente de trabajo,no se precupan por los trabajadores ,solo les importya sobresalir en el trabajo a costa de todo sin importarles si tienen buen ambiente o no,la gran mayoria de los compa;eros inventaban chismes y un jefe desde que llegue nada le paracia de mi hasta que me hizo renunciar,lo mas dificil fue el ambiente con mis compa;eros,lo que mas me gusto trabajar en horarios rolados"
good,"Constantly moving around on your feet and being followed by managers is exactly what to expect here. Managers are not the best, but they do what it takes to get the job done each and every day. Fellow associates were amazing, yet some very hard working and other not so much, over all a good experience and i learned a lot over the year and a half at the company."
good,Great pay. Excellent benefits. Good hours. I loved the employee discount card. Friendly people. Clean work environment. I would work there again if possible.
good,"I think i've put so much hours at work then being at home with my 2 sons. Being inside the pharmacy makes me look more professional and i enjoy my job,"
good,"A typical day consists of ""doing more with less"", less personnel, less tools, less time to complete everything. The hourly associates are great. Being in management I was able to stay in my facilities 14-17hrs per day to complete everything needed. No overtime and no thank you's or good job. I never asked for public recognition only that my annual review reflect my work ethic."
good,"They don't really help you emotionally. They put a lot on you, my stress level is through the roof. I'm a cashier. I wouldn't mind the stress, but they don't really benefit you much at all."
good,"This job started out fun, but, management changed and they became more mean, not strict and wanting people to do their jobs, that I understand, this is more of I do not like you so I will talk about you; make your life miserable while your here until you either step down or quite, and that is coming from one manager in particular."
good,"You meet great people & I loved doing my job everyday but management was HORRIBLE.  I wouldn't mind going back but not with the new rules they have not for walmart in general but the rules they made up for that specific walmart. As well because of the management, they have favorites and flirt with employees under them and do favors for those favorite people. They also make you come back early from your breaks then when its not busy and you ask to get a couple more minutes of your break since you were forced to come back so early they will tell you no. Higher ups like assistant managers are the worst they never try to help you or give you a chance;"
good,"No life balance at all. Work ethic is frustrated. Store Manangement had a lack of organization skill, their attitude to associate is bad never grateful."
good,Too many changes made. Than they make more. Sometimes it would go back to the old way. They did not take associate feedback consideration into account as well.
good,Working dircetly with  customers was good I am just looking for a higher position in a company. The environment of the company wasn't a good working one. It was a lot of people that was In charge that didn't reall no what they where doing.
good,"Working for Wal-Mart, it actually was a great opportunity for me to learn patience, responsibility, and discipline. The hardest part of my job was trying to make it through the night, since it was my very first night shift job. The most enjoyable part was the feeling of personal satisfaction after getting the job done, sometimes with a team effort."
good,The associates work together as a team which helps a lot the associates are willing to help each other and cover different departments when they need to
good,You get in trouble for doing too much or too little.  They are never satisfied with how hard you work.  In a typical day of being a Courtesy Associate it is your job to gather carts from the parking lot and return them to the doors.  If you work too hard/fast you get in trouble and if you don't do it fast enough you get in trouble.  It is a lose lose situation.
good,The duties were strenuous and hard at times but enjoying the company events and and finish products that were put together in the furniture department.
good,"Wal-Mart is what you make of it."
good,We are usually not scheduled enough people to get the job done so we are always backed up. If we need management they take at least an hour to come and help with a customer problem or situation and then the customer becomes upset and angry.
good,It was pretty easy. I liked my co workers and some managers were better than others just like any other work place. They work really good with your availability.
good,"A empresa tinha até uma boa cultura, entretanto é desgastante trabalhar de domingo a domingo como são nos hipermercados."
good,"If any spills I would clean for a safe Environment for co works and customers , asked if they need help make sure they get help and they find everything that is need. Love working with people and seeing them happy"
good,"Is so very hard and stressful. You never finish at time because you have do everything by yourself. I learned to survive, the co-workers is awesome. The management listen to you and sometimes help you."
good,"Decent money yet favoritism, training was adequate Working was fun yet challenging when lines of customers came. Management was decent, strict but nice."
good,"i cannot comment on how working for walmart was due to confidentiality, you must learn how you like it. everyone is different. you can like it or love it."
good,"First hand experience of working with people of little or no formal background in assigned position."
good,"At this location a typical day began with preparing the cleaning cart, an item that we used to hold all necessary bathroom sanitation supplies. Afterwards I would sanitize the restrooms, one by one, coming back every 2 hours to check on the rooms, cleaning again if necessary, and every 4 hours to sanitize the room all over again. In between the routine, I would empty trash receptacles and take care of recycling throughout the facility. The only deviation from this routine, would be when a customer created any kind of spill or mess; or when a customer needed assistance. I didn't learn much from this job, minus the basics of sanitation. The management was very hands off, staying to themselves in a single section of the building, and difficult to find if not there. Co-workers were decent, easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job was the disrespect certain managers and coworkers gave the position. The most enjoyable part was customer interaction."
good,One person required to do the job of at least three other people.  The time off is hard to get approved.  They are always short handed and the customers are always upset because of it.
good,"I enjoy the work well enough.  It's kind of mind numbing, but I've become quite good at my job.  This has afforded me some leniency with management.  Co-works are great for the most part.  Good people just trying to get by.  My supervisor is amazing.  Probably my favorite part of working with this company.  Management is tyrannical at best.  Downright evil at worst.  There is little to no communication between departments/upper management.  Absolutely miserable environment that breeds indifference and smashes any sense of self worth.  If you can tolerate the oppression, and make yourself somewhat essential to the process, you might get by.  DO NOT TAKE PROMOTIONS!  Last 3 supervisors they promoted were driven off within months.  They seem more concerned with blaming someone than they are with fixing the problem.  Unrealistic expectations, and hostile management abound.  But if you're just looking for a job to pay the bills, this is always an option."
good,"great customer service, and to work fast and safe pace also working as team with co workers and creating a nice environment for customers. And the best and most important thing is great customer service at Wal-mart."
good,Very busy work environment due to it being a retail job. Hard to get time off when needed. Attendance and flexibility is a must with company. Some managers are reasonable when explained your personal situation so be sure to communicate with them often.
good,I have gained the ability to work with different people and provide the same services no matter what. Its good feeling to provide services that satisfy people needs.
good,"Store Management not professional. No room for career advancement, and no full-time. My co-workers were great but not appreciated"
good,"When I first started at Walmart I loved the company that Sam Walton built. Going to work everyday was like going to see family and it felt like management and associates cared about their store, fellow associates, and customers.  "
good,They treat you bad and talk to you how ever they want to and they don't pay enough for the labor there asking you to do . they do allow you take take days off.
good,Enjoyed my time at Wal-mart working in the meat department. Worked with some great people. Ended up leaving because at the time they had a policy of not hiring anyone full-time and I was not making enough money part-time for it to be worth my time.
good,Always being pushed to work harder to fix other peoples mistakes. Managers are never satisfied with the work progress because the amount of freight in the backroom was too much for one shift to handle.
good,"I worked on the sales floor and outside in Carts while I worked there for 3 school years. I liked how everyone works as a team to get things done. Most of the employees are good people and work together to get things done. Management, for the most part, is good."
good,The typical work day was good because you came to work checked the notice for the day and worked your assignments and helped customers where they needed help. But to be honest the management team wasn't the best. Anyone can see the favoritism between management and surtant associates. Daily jobs that are handed down from the higher management team aren't assignments that have a high priority to the business but most of the time it is only the appearance of the store that they work on. I do understand that the appearance of the store is important to bring back customers but when the customer can't find what they are looking for and than can't find someone to help them or find an associate that gives them an attitude than the customer won't want to come back even if it looks nice. Working for that Walmart has taught me to always make sure that my job is down before taking a new job and making sure that my department runs smuth throw the day. If anyone needs help in the team work around the problem and fix it. I really have to say I enjoyed working with the team I was with in the department I liked and after some time we had everything down to almost perfection. We even were recognised as the most efficient team in that Walmart at that time.
good,I enjoyed being able to talk to customers and give advise when asked.  Was glad I could give directions to  various departments.
good,working at walmart was a bad experience the managers were very poor to the staff the they had no sympathy for peoples lives
good,it was a good place to work but they wouldn't let anybody go up in the ladder they had a buddy system that worked for the people in charge but not everybody else
good,"i currently work as an overnight customer service manager. Providing great customer service to my customers is my top priority. I work a fast pace daily. I make sure each cashier is on top of their daily tasks, while making sure the store is clean.The job becomes difficult when experiencing short staff. Our store is a huge store and when I complete my job I feel rewarded."
good,The hardest part of the job was unprofessional management. I learned a lot about customer service and loved working with the public.
good,"Wal-Mart is a fun and challenging place to work. However growth within the company is stagnant. I work in several departments because there are not enough employees scheduled to cover high traffic areas. When understaffed, customers often get frustrated because of poor customer service and long wait time for assistance. Management is always slow to respond when paged by associates. Coworkers are always willing to help and there is strong emphasis on teamwork."
good,"jefes prepotentes, no respetan horario laboral.... "
good,This was my first full-time employment position.  The company as a whole back then was extremely helpful.
good,I was attending college but i required more hours so it was difficult liking the place when you only worked once a week. also management was very vague on the equipment. I learned never to apply to a walmart ever again. also every one was pretty nice but you could tell that they dreaded the job.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is poor management, unorganized store, and no team effort from the employees."
good,"It was kind of a okay day sometimes and it was very rude managers and customers, it  really wasnt for me to work there the hardest part of the job was one manager tell you to do this and another one would come tell u do another thing so confused there and the enjoyable part there was nothing."
good,"Typically, you are overwhelmed and never get everything done.  From the moment my shift starts until I leave, I am running and still behind.  It leaves a bit of failure with you.  The company manages with an exception rule.  They point out what you do not get done verses the 100 things you did get done.  It takes some getting used to."
good,If you only need to work for a year this is the place for you. Shortly after your annual review expect to be let go regardless of how well you did. Management is vindictive and one of their main goals is to fire anyone before they can make more money. Be prepared for a unproven reason to be fired and your bonus check to be shorted every quarter. Oh yeah nobody receives unemployment after working here.
good,"I've meet a lot of new and good people from working here. But the advancement they promise is false. I have been working here for 3 years now and haven't even been approached by management about a different position. I qualify in every way but never confronted. When I ask about certain positions they say nothing is open at the moment. And the next day they have a interview scheduled for that same position. "
good,While I am appreciative for being employed with this company for the many years that I have; career advancement opportunities and individual career development of employees needs to be greatly improved.
good,"Kept the fewest people there possible. Work load too much. Work you late, then bring you in really early. Keeps you worn out. Demanded too much. Wouldn't listen to any complaints - didn't care."
good,had some trouble working out my hours and days with my schooling so i ended up leaving there was a large amount of darma between different workers the mangment was horrible
good,"Generally an 8 hr. shift. Over the years I learned a lot about retail and merchandizing. I had a good relationship with all coworkers"
good,you work sometimes 3 different departments alone. managers take long time to respond to pages. policy changes to often.
good,Great company to start out. It gives you the experience you need to look for something better in the customer service field. It's just a job. Nothing promising if you do not like retail.
good,"My typical work day was returning or exchanging items for customers handling complaints, when I worked in customer service and when i worked in money center i would handle bill payments, money transferred, and check cashing. I would also help as a cashier, a phone operator, a fitting room attendant ,training and I also helped watch the front end for the CSM's when needed.  "
good,"A typical day at work for me is very versatile. Since it is a small store, many associates are placed in departments that are not their own. It can get busy, and the hardest part of the job would be maintaining a fast pace at a busy hour. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers that are respectful and friendly, because not all of them are. My co-workers are not life-long friends by any means. However, they are very helpful when help is needed."
good,"It's a job, It's a paycheck. The best part of my day is seeing associates that are my friends.  The most enjoyable part of my day is clocking out to go home."
good,"A typical day was just to unload trucks and bring them to the floor after a certain time. I learned that not all managers will be nice to you even if you're a good worker and that some people just are so impatient. Management was terrible , they didn't know what they were doing well for the most part. Co-workers complained too much and some of them were so lazy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the impatient and lazy co-workers. The most enjoyable part was seeing happy customers"
good,checar el personal dentro dela tienda  dar rondines  aprendi a operar monitores   cosa q no sabia  el tran}bajo esta bien solo q el sueldo no es competitivo
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has been an experience. The shoppers are messy and leave items laying around the registers. I enjoy working with people and on a surface level a simple smile, eye contact and greeting helps to enhance the customer and employee experience."
good,"Operava o caixa e atendimento ao publico. Aprendi a me comunicar melhor, como eu trabalhava no caixa eu tive que me relacionar com o clientes com informação e cadastro de clientes. Como é um mercado muito grande tinha muita pressão, mas sempre atenciosos. "
good,"co workers were competitive over credit sales. commissions were good. management couldve been more organized and less patronizing to employees that were minors. not that stressful, always remember to ask your manager to deal with customers for you"
good,"Walmart is a hostile employer. Breaks were never scheduled, I was asked to stay at work past the end of my shift because the supervisor failed to plan for a relief for my postition. Toilet breaks were virtually impossible to take. The work load was greatly increased physically after I started working."
good,el super era super bueno el ambiente   pero no respetaban la colaciones los jefes mm no eran buenos con los trabajadores
good,Various different jobs and the opportunity to learn something new was there if desired . Its not what you know its who you know.
good,"I worked as a courtesy associate and I was required to push carts, often there were to many to push for just two people working."
good,"I have currently gotten terminated from Walmart after being there for 10.5 years and through my experience is if you have bad management then you have bad communication. I enjoyed working for the company as a whole but as of the management team from my main store they make that store a hostile work place. But in other words their was a lot of favoritism shown. And Wal-Mart claims to be a ""family-oriented"" based company but they are not. They have no consideration if your children or your self is sick with doctor notes they still terminate you."
good,The middle management is good but the upper management only looks out for themselves. The CAP System was a bad idea and still is a bad idea.
good,"If you like working hard, getting paid little and continually being passed over for promotion, Walmart is for you!"
good,"Night stocking was the same every night. The only things that changed were where you were assigned and if there was a change in  employees. "
good,"It's a good place to work the coworkers from different places makes us to be a better person at the point that teach us how to do a team work and make all done at the end of the day. The hardest part its when an employee try to exchange or move out to another department if you don't have any help or a good friendship with the management is like they don't see you on the list, they don't treat everybody the same they have their favorite people."
good,"I wish some of the members of management would be more considerate of their employee's lives. Overall, I love my job, just there are some I wish I did not have to deal with."
good,This is a retail environment that will allow for two options. You can opt to just get by and fit in to the crowds and that is ok with Walmart. The other option is to work hard and achieve everything you have the aptitude to achieve. It then becomes hard work but there is a reward at the end of the tunnel.
good,on a typical day i would clock in say good morning to everyone go to my assigned area scan and pull the picks out of the bins until i have got all my picks out and on carts then i would take the carts to the floor and work them then count and take the overstock to the backroom if i get done early i would ask management for further task or help other associates then make sure my area and all my task are done before i clock out i learned alot working with different people and managers i loved management for the most part alot of them were down to earth some had bad attitudes i just did my job and followed directions the hardest part was moving state to state the most enjoyable part was the customers i loved to make and see every customer i came in contact with smile
good,"I hated my job, it was the same routine everyday with no help. The management was lacking and rude. The employees however were more helpful then management."
good,The reason they are receiving a low rating is because i was fired for injuring myself at the workplace. They offered me more hours as needed
good,"When I walk in the door I make sure I say hi to everyone. I find out were I am going to work, i get prepped for that job, find out if their is any supplies I need to get, then I work with whom ever I am working with. As the day goes on I work where ever help is needed and that's what makes work fun and less stressful. The hardest part is trying to get everything done on time when you don't have the people so you are multitasking, although I love multitasking. I like it when everyone has a good day at work it always makes everyone leave with a smile on their face"
good,"It was not bad overall. I had learned alot through the years of being at Walmart and was good work experience in a fast paced environment. My average day would be unloading trucks, stocking hardware/food and unloading skids"
good,"THe company overall isn't as bad as it's reputation--but it quite nearly is. Advancement is tooth and nail, intentionally so, even though there are an excess of opportunities for promotions. Raises were recently set at a fixed rate that is lower than it used to be. Few of the workers are given full time, even after a decade of employment. Hours are randomized by a computer--the same computer that will fire you, by the way. FOr example, if you have more than nine ""points"" of absences in a rolling six month period, you're fired by the computer. Even if those points are due to management filing things incorrectly. Like not applying sick or vacation time to your absences, or even if you hit ""clock out"" on the time clock instead of ""going to lunch""."
good,Hours vary from one day to the next. The only way to get close to a set schedule is if you're a student and can close almost every night.
good,"Taking into consideration every Wal-Mart is different, I can't speak for the company as a whole. But, the Wal-Mart I spent six years at was an interesting experience to say the least. Typically we were short handed and every day was a struggle for even the best employee. Constantly changing corporate regulations didn't make things much easier. Combine that with upper management mumbling profanities about the front end over the walkie talkie and it makes for a less than hospitable experience. At least most of the coworkers were friendly and willing to help."
good,"It is a very demanding workplace. You come in walk to the back and put your stuff away and get yourself prepared for your shift. When you get to the front you clock in and you get assigned a register by a manager. Its always busy and in the store which gives you little time to take a breather. The customers are always getting upset because of long lines and not enough registers open. This pressures you into working faster and harder just so there is less unhappy customers. The co-workers were the best part of the job because whenever one of us needed help, another employee would be there to give that help."
good,"working for walmart is everything you'd expect. Very souless work but very steady also. It also had a highschool feel to it, where you had to be in the right crowd of friends or you had no chance of moving up the ladder, no matter your work ethic."
good,You never knew what kind of person you were going to be dealing with next. I liked my CSM he was honest and fair. It was a very large place and not much time . I spent all day on my feet and maybe lunch sitting down. I was cashier of the month and got two raises in one week because my drawer was on the penny.
good,Pretty routine from one day to the next. I really don't have much to say. Retail was not my ideal type or work. I have nothing further to add to what I have already said about this.
good,"poor communication between management. If not careful, you could be thrown under the bus for someone's mistake or lack of attention to detail."
good,"Foi meu primeiro emprego, baixo salário,mas não é uma empresa difícil de trabalhar,vivi bons momentos e obtive vários aprendizados."
good,"la empresa de walmart ayuda a promover el servicio atencion al cliente a ese punto le asingo la calificacion de bueno."
good,When I worked at wal-mart at first I thought it was great. Than I realized the customer is the last thing on their mind. They wanted me to act the same towards customers.
good,"Managers constantly belittled you and talk to you like you were in an idiot everyday. I worked there for 4 years and learned every single position in the store to almost perfection and then applied for over 25 different management positions and was denied all of them for the most idiotic reasons. i remember one time i applied for a temporary management position that was designed to help give associates with no management experience the tools and experience to be able to have better luck being considered for advancement. I interviewed and they told me that i didn't get the job because i had no management experience. I simply asked them why that was a factor when the position was designed specifically to help give management experience, the manager got very upset and gave me a write up. Don't ever work for this company unless your exhausted of all options."
good,Walmart is just not the type of place I liked to work at. The employee/management structure was terrible. They don't treat or take care of the employees very well.
good,"Overall a good  job to have.  But, pay and compensation was seriously  lacking and supervision was poor  for the  most part. Adequate  hours  per week were seriously lacking for a good paycheck. I could not afford to continue to work there and I did not like the culture they had toward customers.."
good,"overall good learning experience, "
good,Having Great Work Ethic is Everything !!! You'll get head having a good head on your shoulders ! Never be afraid to take risk
good,walmart was an ok company to work for the only downside to it all was having to work 3rd shift and work 15 hour days on holidays
good,"Working here gave me a fun working experience and learning the necessary tools to move on in my career."
good,"A typical day at walmart in recieving would consist of unloading merchandise from trucks, and stacking it on pallets to be later wrapped and sent out to the sales floor."
good,"* cashier"
good,"Very demanding on your body, if you can handle the aches and pains then good for you but not for me. Working long hours but only get two 15 minute breaks is not enough. Production is a big part of the job and you cant meet it then you're out the door."
good,"wait on customers for their medicine,,,,,,,,,having patience with the public no matter if they are wrong,,,,some are teams players,,no staff to help with lines of customers and no breaks..gaining the confidence of the customers with their medicine...meeting and engaging with different nationalities."
good,A typical night at work would start with scanning your badge at a terminal to find what your tasks will be for the night.  You go to that area and prep the carts and pallets of freight that has been semi-sorted for that aisle/area.  After that it is pretty much stocking and helping customers as you go. But you have a small amount of time to finish the task at hand before going to your next task.  Some nights you have 1 task other nights it can be many more depending on how much freight has come in by truck that night.  It is hard work but in my opinion rewarding to finish a task and being able to feel you did a excellent job.  One may think that not many people shop for groceries at 3 a.m. in the morning but they do and helping them is the best part of my job!  The hardest part of the job I would say is not being able to help a customer find a product they need.
good,"buena comunicacion con jefe inmediato, buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Overall a good place to work, although management needs to pay more attention to their staffs wants and needs. There has to be room to expand your goals, management does not listen to your goals and does not help you reach any goals to move up in positions."
good,"As long as one is able to fly under the radar or not make waves the likelihood of being able to remain employed are high; however if one has a preference to adhere to the policies and regulations as written, it is inevitable that one will encounter difficulties."
good,"The work isn't terrible, but there is a lot of special treatment, scheduling issues. Require you to take your break at a certain time, but you don't always have someone there to relive you so you get behind. make you cut your hours if you work over instead of allowing overtime."
good,"un dia de trabajo es normal, lo rutinario aveces aburrido por que no nuevas ideas y si las hay no las valoran, aprendí muchas cosas como trabajar en equipo, trabajar a presión, y a manejar herramientas de trabajo"
good,"Can be a frustrating place to work if you are not proficient in customer service skills. Managers are often rude and tend not to care about there employees as individuals. However, the hours are very flexible and is perfect for a student or someone looking for a second job."
good,when u come in they would say get on register llike there ur children not to me but i seen it done multiple times management can care less about anyone.hardest part was dealing with the invornment it was not good. best part was the job was pretty easy to do i like customer service.
good,The managers is so rude and disrespectful. The job itself was very easy but the managers is the reason why employees quit.
good,"My experience at Walmart GSS-NA was very poor and stressful. Management ran things without honesty and integrity, and did not handle people or problems in a respectful manner. Every one on the team was micromanaged to the point of insanity. If you were not favored by the work flow or the supervisor, then you were looked over and regarded as unintelligent. "
good,Hours are good for a Department manager  6:30am to 4:00 pm work one weekend a month depending on what dept. you work in. You can move around in diffrent  dept. after 6 months of being in one dept.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with the company. My only complaint would be that they seem to let their best employees go, when they should be promoted instead."
good,"Overall Walmart is not a terrible place to work, over the past month I have been treated poorly, not only by other associates on my team, but by management as well. "
good,"Although i liked working there, every little mistake i made i got penalize for it. So as time progressed i kinda lost my touch of loving to work there, so i kinda quit/ got fired the next time i got wrote up agin"
good,"bom o dia tipico normal para mim que gosto de trabalhar com publico , e normal a correia os pcos de encher o mercado e logo esvaziar , bom jah tinha muita experiemcia de outros mercados , mas posso dizer que eu aprendi a lidar com cheques nesta empresa coisa que  não havia trabalhado antes,a gerencia deixava um pouco a desejar pelo fato de não tomar uma atitude mais energetica com alguns assuntos,colegas exepcionais  não ha o que dizer , a parte mais dificiel acho que não havia pois é uma tarefa conciderada por mim facil, o termino do dia de trabalho q todos se uniam para conversar e ir para casa."
good,"I work every weekends. The coworkers are cordial. Management can sometimes be unprofessional and rude.However, I learned alot from this company such as how to work a register, good customer service skills, patience, and how to operate a multiline phone. The hardest part of the job I would say is when it gets really busy which is on black friday other than that its a fairly easy job if you can multitask very well."
good,While working at walmart as an unloader you truly learn what Manuel labor is. Especially if your team is suppose to be 20 people and you only have 4 to do the job. Management never coordinated it was awful
good,Eu aprendi que organização é tudo dentro da empresa e clima com pessoal de trabalho era bom
good,"A typical night at work would consist of doing a job that was designed for 3 people to do, but you would be by yourself.Always under staffed to the point there would only be 2 people to clean a whole 220,000 sqft by themselves. You could take all the required testing to advance in management but not be given opportunities"
good,"The Job is excellent in all departments except Deli, or department 80, which happens to be where I was placed, its poorly managed, schedules are flawed, turnover is extremely high due to the lack of overall structure and staffing being incomplete, in other words we would be held responsible for problems that were ultimately stemming from being understaffed but it was still the workers fault even when they show up everyday on time and complete every task, they'd change protocols daily and not tell you about it and allow you take the rap for it."
good,A lot of hard work with great rewards. Takes a while to learn the job what it contains what is acceptable and what isn't. Your coworkers are a lot of help.
good,I want to be treated fairly.Walmart did not take care of me very well.A fellow employee was sabotaging the cart machines because i was faster.
good,"Wal Mart is a good company to work for, IF you have a good management team, which is very hard to come across. taught me a lot."
good,"An average day was pretty exciting you never know what crazy things you would see through the drive-thru or even what walks inside. Working in customer service you can make anyones days just with a smile. But there is also a down side making the times and hot food for everyone. Being on your toes at all times, from the GM breathing down your neck making sure you don't have someones food wrong or the occasional rude customer complaining they didn't get ketchup."
good,"Working with Walmart has been a great experience for me. It's time for me to make a change however and move on, to learn something new."
good,"Pros to working for Walmart; fast environment, the customers can be nice. Everyone is there for one thing only..To get in and get out."
good,"Typically I'd work alone every shift, sometimes a manager would stop by the store to make sure things were running smoothly. Generally I would take around 15-30 passport photos a day, varying from a gun licence, to an immigration card. "
good,This job was a great job with great co workers that I loved getting to know. All the new workers and old were drawn to me. I was the light of the place. The hardest part of the job is when being sick your excused days or none of that mattered so days were counted against you and most likely you would get fired.
good,"The physical job itself was great, same with co-workers. Poor lower management and odd hours make it hard to stay but it can happen. Not much room for growth but wages are fair even at low end employment."
good,"Work was hard, they dont value you at all.You would work 3-4 department by yourself and still be asked why you where not with your own department."
good,"They work around school schedules really easily, will give you more hours if you ask, it's a pretty easy job so long as you have a bit of common sense."
good,working at walmart was nice but the people working there had a bad attitude that never seemed to go away. it was fun because I got to push myself to work harder.
good,"One works with people (both a pro and a con), on their feet & concrete floor all day, may eventually have plantar fasciitis, does monotonous work, very little active, energetic, and mobile work."
good,"Wal-mart is a start up just to cover the general essentials of the typical day to day life. Management will give workers overtime but in the end will not approve the pay for the hours you worked, the give you work loads that are not under your job description."
good,"binning over stock freight in the back room after it had been stocked on the sales floor. time management "
good,Jobs was good . Company did not understand that your family is supposed to come first. everyone got along. many opportunities to advance if you put your family on back burner
good,I came to work everyday to get my job done. Some days was better then others. The job was difficult at first but I caught on extremely quick.
good,not a fun place to work for very very strict slightest thing get you written up. does like its workers taking off any time for personal or medical like every one to work almost 24/7.
good,"the environment is inviting at first, the associates all seem to welcome newcomers despite the turnover rate. most of the workers who have been there an extended period shuffle around doing the bare minimum like a pre-programmed human husk. micromanagement seems to be the only thing that reaches through to the associates, typically with negative energy but positive outcome."
good,"enjoyed meeting new people, and helping customers when needed, learned alot about how systems work and handling debit/credit transaction, proper way to count money back to customers"
good,"Walmart was good place for me to work because i was surrounded by friends most of the time. However there was very little space for advancement because the management was very unorganized and efficient. I learned many things from working there such as, time management, efficiency and hard work.The hardest part of the job was the constant ranting from the managers, however there was also a good side to working there which was helping customers out and working with some of my close friends."
good,"I would clock in and wash my hands. Then I would get my orders together and start on my orders. After my work is finished I would clean up.My co-workers was entertaining. I learned lots of new things.The hardest part of the job was standing all day long. I would do extra things sometimes and do ordinary and exotic cakes like different types of doggies,characters and more. The people was impressed but I was very creative with my work."
good,a typical day at work can vary from overburdened with more notes than you can handle on top of your normal routines to a quiet fast paced day in which everything runs more smoothly than you could imagine; however a long standing problem is a lack of communication from Assistant Manager levels down the chain.
good,"On a typical dat at work a few employees would get all the work load while other wandered off in the store and did nothing. I learned that old employees are intimidated by new over achieving employees. Management did not mange the employees well and there was favoritism. Overall the job was not difficult, anyone with basic skills would be competent. Most of the job experience was negative due to bad management and lazy co-workers."
good,"boa convivência"
good,"Typical day involved much stress, especially with the lack of proper staffing. I found it difficult to do my job with the tools and the staffing I had. Maintaining a good flow on the front end between lack of cashiers, cart pushers, customer service, and floor associates. The bare minimum and less being scheduled at most times. Having to give up cashiers to cover other areas as needed leaving us short at the checkouts. Not enough sales associates on the floor able to help cover checkouts and other areas as needed. Little help from Management most times, especially at night, when things got hectic and I felt that we needed a duplicate of myself to handle things. I learned that it is possible I am not cut out for such a position. Most of my coworkers were great as individuals, fun, caring. Many of my staff were young however and that came with extra issues. I loved the fair amount of freedom to my position as far as running around, getting things done in an order I saw fit. I loved being the one that everyone looked to for help and being able to voice my opinions, give out tips, etc. I loved being able to learn so many different things and feeling like an asset."
good,Home office and the management team need to get involve on the day in day out basis so they know what associates go through.
good,"You have to keep up a fast pace, lift heavy boxes and items. Pack them neatly and safely and load them on the truck neatly. It was a fun work place because of the people but very stressful because of management wanted you to complete unobtainable goals with not enough resources to complete. They offer and encourage advancement opportunities. I had a chance to be a Manager 3 times but I was too ill to accept it. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding the items. I was the one that could always find the items that no one else could. The hardest part was not being able to complete fulfillment and packing because of the fast pace you have to keep up with heavy items and meet your numbers as well."
good,I used to run 3 departments a night. completing 27 hours of work within a 7 hour shift. It was a lot of manual labor. I could not handle the amount of stress this company put on me while working. I had to leave for medical reasons.
good,"Working at walmart was fun at first. But then it ended up me doing most of the morning clean up for half the morning, while having to balance putting product out on the shelf."
good,the managers at Walmart are not friendly and they think they are too good to even do there own job.  Never got any help on the floor cause they were always in there offices.
good,"Shows me a lot of confirmations with my professional imaginations. Learned, or confirmed myself, that either if you are quiet or speak out loud/respond, it still causes problems. Management is like whatever; it all depends on the type of person. Co-workers are nice or just do what has to be done w/o socializing. I don't think there's an ""enjoyable"" part on this job, but the hardest part are the customers."
good,"Fast paced work place, must manage time carefully to accomplish tasks, I found it hard to enjoy any personal time with hours being so inconsistent, hour cuts caused financial hardship."
good,"The job doesn't pay much, but doesn't expect much either.  The hours are strict and structured with constant supervision."
good,"-Management was never on the same page."
good,"Walmart suffers from a severe lack of communication, and does not realize what it is to be Loss Prevention, and management will always try yo act as Loss Prevention."
good,Good place to work if your in high school. No room for advancement and lack of leadership in management. They no longer accept sick notes from Doctors or hospitals and penalize you for trying to take care of your health.
good,We go in and we do our job. My 3 days off with my disabled partner is the best part for me. We have a clean canteen with good food.
good,"Customer service "
good,"A Typical day at work was to clock in, work at my register, greet customers and to make their day a a little bit better than when they came in. I learned how to communicate with an upset customer and  how to work a register at walmart. The most enjoyable part of this job was making people happy, and if they are not to try and make their day a little better you never no what they had to do to get were they are."
good,"Walmart is made up of all kinds of diversity. Made many friends and was asked if I wanted to be promoted. My answer was of course NO since promotions mean all shifts to work and I am not willing to work nights. "
good,no comment. i have nothing really to say beside some co works were great people. the store could been a little more organized and better time managed
good,"I worked over nights and I worked hard and I feel like I got under paid. I didn't appreciate the management team because I feel like  they just push everyone around. I was doing the stocking in the clothing and shoe departments, I did like my fellow co-workers, they were always so helpful and they made sure that we all worked as a team to get things done on time. The assignments are all timed. It seemed like there was never enough time to do the massive amount of work that was assigned."
good,"Inventory control and warehouse distribution. Unloading of trucks where hours were mainly seasonal. Management not always easy to work with, and constant changing management styles."
good,"Poor Advancement opportunities, and poor benefits provided by Wal-Mart. Would frequently cut hours without notice to employees, and would rarely provide job security."
good,It's a great experience working there you meet new people everyday and it's a pretty easy going job. Overall I must say the job is not bad it's the pay is why I want to leave.
good,Learned a variety of work related experiences throughout the store. Management varies from one store to another. A high amount of inconsistency between varying members of management. Hardest part of job was completing everything that each different manager asked of you and sometimes given conflicting directions from several different people. Many associates are favored over others and not necessarily because of the favored associates work ethics or ability. Promotions do not always occur by most qualified. I loved helping my customers have an awesome shopping experience and would go above and beyond to try and correct a bad situation so the customer would leave on a good note.
good,Great place to interact with individuals and provide great customer service. Working in a fast paced environment providing great customer service to customers.
good,"Typical day is supervising the front end and making sure the customers have an ultimate shopping experience and receive the best customer service. This position also includes supervision of a separate fuel station operation. I also have the responsibility of the Cashiers, Maintenance personnel and Cart Return associates.I handle the daily schedule for their break and meal times. Also, ongoing training new and current employees, coaching, corrective action and annual reviews. My other areas of responsibility are security and safety within the store."
good,The store was run well with both great work ethic and lots of dedicated workers to perform any task given at any time. Managers made sure all were completing said tasks.
good,"My primary reason for leaving Walmart DC was because of the blatantly unfair distribution of work assignments & how help was given to favorites of the super on a regular basis, as were hardest labor assignments given too often to same individuals...more than circumstance!"
good,"A typical work day at Walmart for a Cart Pusher is them constantly yelling at you to bring in more carts than possible even with multiple workers helping cause of the shear amount of customers on a day per day biases. You had to bring in only 20 carts at a time while an average of 25-30 carts went back out into the lot, while you also needed to assist customers with their items if they was unable to take them to their car themselves which was because they was normally elderly or handicapped. If the main maintenance workers needed assistance then you needed to give them a helping hand by stopping what you needed to do an help them out. The hardest part of the job was the rule set of only able to be allowed to bring in 20 carts at a time while helping everyone else with their job, and customers taking out between 25-30 cart into the lot as it was always a constant struggle to keep up.The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly the customers.They was always more than happy when you went out of your way an above the needed requirements to help them on their way an it normally gave them a smile and/or a happy step to their walk. The co-workers there was more than nice an knew the struggle of what was needing to be done as everyone was always busy an in a bit of a rush to have ends meet, but yet they was always willing to try an help if they could find a few minutes if not only seconds to help you knowing you'd do the same for them."
good,"All the stories you hear about Walmart's benefits, pay, and hiring are all true.  The pay was below what I could afford, the ability to get a raise and move up within the company is dismal, the ability to move laterally in the company is difficult, and there are no benefits unless you're a salaried member of management (which you won't be because they are constantly moving the ones they have around so they don't have to hire more).  There is a LARGE turn-around in employees because they expect you to do the job of 3 people, and they want it done in 4 hours.  Oh, and don't expect much help from the assistant managers.  Two or three are good and will actually get down and help you out; the rest just walk around and yell at you for not doing your job well/fast/hard enough."
good,Wal-Mart is in need of professional managers that have good customer service skills. Knowledge of customer services relation
good,worked random hours. impossible to make full time. lucky if you got 30hrs a week. lots of drama and managers. I liked some of my co-workers. some of the customers you come across are very rude.
good,"I worked for Walmart for the past 3 years, and I enjoyed my time there until I decided that I needed a career, not just a job. The pay is ok for retail, but the management was very unorganized."
good,managers need to do better job of listening to people that bring up safety issues in the work place. my coworkers was okay for the most part when they was in good moods about coming to work. managers have no clue on how to work with people that want a safer work place.
good,el ambiente  laboral era muy bueno pero las oportunidades muy escasas pero en general la empresa puede mejorar si cambian la forma de como la manejan
good,"If you are a full-time associate, there will be hardly enough time to indulge in activities outside of work. Compensation is fare, sort of. You can be there one day and gone the next. Advancement can be done if you suck up to the right person or at least this was the case at this Walmart. Management was running around lost like a chicken with its head cut off. The job culture is amazing, various types of ethnicities."
good,Working at Wal Mart one gets to meet different types of people. It was a fun place to work. The only thing I would say was hard was all the difference mangers.
good,A typical day at work would consist of coming in a 10 having our nightly meeting to get us motivate to work. Meet up with fellow coworkers who were awesome during my time working there; go over the plan for the night to get the job done. If your work well together as a team you can get much accomplished. Management wasn't great but we worked together to meet our nightly goals. The hardest part about working at Walmart; I would have to say coming in ready to work and your truck don't get there till midnight and there 13 to 20 pallets on the truck for your department and you have to stock it all out before you get at 6 in the morning.
good,10 years with the company.  It has been a roller coaster ride since day one.  Crazy holiday season but that is retail for you!!
good,"A typical day at work : assembling bikes and Operating Equipment , Consolidation of inventory, and customer service. "
good,Management needs to be more educated with employees issues and follow up with what they say they are going to do to handle issues.
good,"Most people are happy to work at Walmart because they have no idea they could do better, they are grateful for what they are getting. They don't know they should be paid better and get better benefits. A typical day was showing up to work at 8am and working through to 8pm helping customers with their automotive needs. Making sure my staff is meeting their customer needs and filling in where we are shorthanded. Placing orders for new inventory and checking what is on hand. Resolving customer issues satisfactorily"
good,"It was fast pace job, with heavy lifting."
good,"ok working environment"
good,Walmart was very eye opening and a great stepping stone into the retail Pharmacy world. It has many lessons to teach you if you're the  type to learn and grow
good,We have a high volume of work and no help at all from management on giving more hours or other employees to help and if you don't finish the work you get call out and some time you may go long hours without your break or just no break so you can finish all the work or get it almost everything done.
good,"help customers find desired items, cash checks, return items, sell money orders, ring customers items for total sale, bag items"
good,The pay is not very good for the amount of work that is required to do the job successfully. There are quarterly benefits if the store meets a certain criteria. Advancement opportunities come up around once or twice a year. The work is never ending and work is mandatory on the holidays. Vacation time is not earned for full time employees until they reach a year. Part time employees have to reach two years. Communication was never and issue.
good,the only issue i had was the manager. when i left she refused to give me my check and screamed at me in front of customers. But other then that i enjoyed it
good,"I learned how to work a cash register, work at the customer service center and process online orders. I learned how to stock and make the customers happy."
good,"I worked as a service desk associate at Walmart. A typical day was hectic. I was responsible for returning items, cashing checks, printing money orders, sending money via MoneyGram, assisting customers pay their bills, and occasionally being a cashier when the lines at the check out where too long. I learned how  to run the service desk and process returns and all other functions of the service desk. I learned how to search for receipts on the computer and check to see if we have items we have in stock. I directed customers to the correct departments where the items they wanted were located. I answered the phone and answered questions and transferred the calls accordingly.  To be honest I feel that the management structure, at least at my store, was far from the best that I have ever experience. They had favorites amongst  the employees and those were given preferential schedules. They were not there for their employees. If you went to them with concerns or if you had an idea of how something could be made easier you were ignored. Members of management would walk past as you as you were being verbally abused by customers. Overall it was not a good company to work for. The best part of the job I would have to say was some of the co-workers that I met while there. They became some of my closest friends and we are still good friends to this day."
good,"This was a good job at the time. But it didn't fit me. "
good,"• Cash checks and pay out money after verifying that signatures are correct, that written and numerical amounts agree, and that accounts have sufficient funds."
good,"As overnight cashier, expect to only be off the register when someone comes to relieve you for breaks.. Day shift doesn't clean anything but you best have it sparkle for them. Management has no clue how to help you with issues."
good,"It seemed like a day-to-day job and not really like a career. The company employs an ""open door"" policy for inner-office disputes, but during my time there, a lot of people would get fired for using it to resolve conflicts. They do offer insurance benefits with employment packages for full-time employees, but they like to stick with hiring a lot of temporary employees to cut back on costs."
good,i was a temporary worker so did not get to spend longer time at this palce. it was not that bad. the pay was okay. they were friendly and the management were approachable
good,Really easy to get along with coworkers. normally was asked to perform multiple duties outside of my job description and pulled into other departments to help out. management was not willing to increase hours from part time would be my main complaint.
good,Wal-Mart was a ok job to work at but the management sucked and thought they were better then the rest of the staff. You would sometimes get Harassed by management. The pay sucked
good,"My hard work is not valued at this store... Get talked down too, and get no help from management about moving up in the company."
good,Its ok if you are retired  the pay is very low  and a lot is expected for the pay. All position are partime very few fulltime   but i enjoyed the people i worked with and made a lot of friends for life.
good,I work for a vendor who supports Wal-Mart's network infrastructure. Management could use some help but all in all a good company.
good,"Work shifts could start out in the department you had been assigned to, but at any time you could be pulled from your department and sent to another department for assistance, then would be criticized for not finishing original department assignment not being completed within your shift.  No benefits were offered at all.  Management was not involved with employees as effectively as they should have been.  Very little communication with employees as far as work status.  Not a positive environment to work in."
good,"The work was very physical,but I believe you should put out(work),what you're getting paid for.I enjoyed the good times I had with my co-workers.A long time ago the company had lots of fun events.A few of the manager were real good workers and did not mine joining in to help sometimes.On a rough day we made it easy because everyone had a little fun and at the same time,getting the job done.I learned that as you age,the body do too and sometimes you may have to settle for less to help preserve your health.All and all,I really enjoyed my time there,but when it""s time to move,you have to move on."
good,Had to clean up after everyone else. Never met the needs for working mothers and never adjusted for pregnant mothers. My co workers were a bunch of slackers who left their messes for someone else to clean up. I hated this job and I'm glad to be gone.
good,my typical day was already determined  and i did get retail experience the management was ok. i like my co workers . the hardest part of the job was completing all my tasks at times the most enjoyable part was the friendships of coworkers.
good,"I really liked working at Walmart.  I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it.  It was fast paced and very challenging to meet deadlines.  I found that you need a very good work ethic and a love for being efficient and for service to be good at any job, including stocking shelves!  I loved working in various departments and depending on the manager on shift, I was moved around quite a bit.  I loved the Health and Beauty, Food and the Pharmacy departments the best.  The hardest for me was working in apparel mainly because of understaffing in that department.  Unlike other departments I stocked in, I was left with a sense of lack of accomplishment because goals where not met.    I also feel that the manager's attitude affect employees and job culture. I had two managers who worked on different days.  I worked very well with one manager who saw my strengths and my strong work ethic.  The other manager seemed to play favorites and kept me in a department where I felt ill equipped and not supported. It played a major part in the reason why I had to leave Walmart.  "
good,I reviewed Wal-Mart the way I did because they do not have the best management there. They do not always do their job the way they are suppose to do.
good,"long days and nights,learned alot about the transportation industry,helpful coworkers,learned to drive in bad weather, and go places I've never been."
good,"It was what I expected.  They ask a lot of their employees and expect a lot. Nothing I couldn't handle but if you're not use to it, it can be stressful."
good,"I didn't stay at this pharmacy very long because it was too far from my home.  There were a few unreliable people, but the issue was taken care of.  Busy pharmacy."
good,Responsible for the gm side of the business. hiring firing caching ordering p&l shrink. Inventory level control feature management and merchandising
good,"stock products"
good,"Never received my breaks on time"
good,"A typical day would be to place all cash drawers in each register, make sure all monies are counted, logged in, and audit all night sales.  Management was sometimes accessible to employees.  There was no hard part to the job.  Must be a people person as I was with amazing customer service skills."
good,"walmart pharmacy is a good but bad place to work. its like any other job at walmart. you have  to deal with sometimes inpatient and unhappy customers, some though are good customers. it is hectic and at times super stressful but the people you work with make all the difference and some made it hard to deal with a day at work while others made it worth while."
good,walmart was fun  i  stock grocey check dates got along with my co workers my pay was good i was full time we also got bonus every year
good,"Walmart is a pretty good place to work, if you don't have many goals of going anywhere. There is very little room for advancement and when there are available positions, they typically go to the Assistant Manager's favorite (the butt-kissers.) My very first day of the job, I was not greeted nor were there instructions, a manager, or coworker in sight. I had to tag someone down from a different department to ask what I should do. Then, the manager had the audacity to get mad at me by how I was working, which was simply folding clothes; of course, after leaving me at work by myself which no instructions. I basically taught myself everything within a few weeks and became the manager's first choice when it came to things. If you take this job and you're on the sales floor, be prepared to hear MANY DIFFERENT instructions by multiple managers! Also, be prepared to teach yourself almost everything. It's a good job for people who don't mind grinding! If you're used to getting everything handed to you, this shouldn't be your first choice."
good,"Walmart is a great company. I think its safe to say some people don't practice what they preach & I'm all about fairness, understanding & progress."
good,Great place to work and great co-workers.  The management is great and very understanding.  My skills greatly improved working here.
good,"After working at Walmart for some time, i have come to learn that the work environment isn't that of an actual ""work place."" It has its up and down moments in all fields such as managerial decision making and stocking but overall is a decent place to work."
good,"Working for Wal-mart is an ok place to work. The health insurance is not good at all. The deductible is almost $3,000 and the out of pocket is $6,050."
good,Difficult to go to school and maintain a work life balance. Had to focus on either work or school not both. Employees were good to work with.
good,I learned how to use a telzon and how to do inventory management.  The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks within the deadline that would be provided. My co-workers was amazing and hard working.The only issue I had at the time was some of the managers at the time.
good,"It began well for me, but then the work piled on and the pay did not increase like they promised it would.  I work my butt off for only $12 / hr and am a Dept. Manager too!  Benefits are not too bad though, get the whole standard package of benefits."
good,I have seen alot of unethical practices at Wal-Mart over the 2 plus years that I had worked there.  I saw amazing people passed over for promotion because managers wanted to promote within their own culture.  I also saw managers have inappropriate relationships with hourly employees sales associates. If I was writing a drama I would start at Wal-Mart it is its own little Payten Place.  Drama Drama Drama
good,"most of the staff is excellent to work with. Management has few issue"
good,"I love being apart of the Wal-mart family. There are things that should be fixed within the management and scheduling procedure. I love  working with my day to day coworkers, but there were scheduling issues that conflicted with my school progress."
good,Wal-mart was the best and worst job I ever had. I learned customer service from both the merchant side as well as the customer side. I learned how to value the fact that the customer could have gone somewhere else but they decided to do business with you. So what that ment to me was that I needed to take care of them the same way that I desired to be treated. The hardest part of the job was the customers at times as well as management not backing you up and changing your schedule a lot. The most enjoyable part was learning something new and training my associates to do the same so that we were all on the same page.
good,"Walmart is not as bad a place as the rap it tends to get in the media. It's just not necessary the place for everybody. I was never meant to be a lifer at Wal-Mart, it provide for my family at the time."
good,I used to love this job but changes in management and unfulfilled promises of improvement and advancement along with other things has made this company hard to enjoy working for.
good,"Management thinks Walmart is God's gift to this green earth and you are lucky to work there. Aside from that, typical day is show up and stand at the register and ring people through. Occasionally cover people's breaks at the fitting room or fold clothes if the front is slow. Co-workers are nice and helpful. Hardest part of the job is waiting 20 minutes for a CSM to bring you quarters because they're too busy goofing around at the service desk. Most enjoyable is nice customers."
good,Just a regular working environment. Though you get learn some basics if you are not distracted by some regular job environment politics.
good,"Particularmente uma experiencia exaustiva, mas positiva no aprendizado direcionado ao relacionamento de pessoas."
good,"Reciprocal and repetitive labor that is too dependent on all shifts to get one job done; furthermore, the numbers matter, personal development is absent, and the politics are expected, but the red tape prevents leaders from improving the store severely. Walmart's training plan for leaders is not practiced but mandatory to learn. Ultimately, it depends on the personnel, but the company could be better."
good,I got full time hours when I was in high school and when I asked for full time upon graduating I got less hours then I did when I was in school.
good,Different ways to learn about  different electronics also was able to learn diffferent departments and able to learn different roles . I learned how to calm customers down when their upset and not able to find what they are looking for. Overall good experience with dealing with hand on customer services
good,I really enjoy the job and co-workers. There are some stressful days. It's almost impossible to get full-time here. At times I feel like there is no direction from management. I do feel like they don't schedule enough  associates.
good,"It really depends on your boss. If you get a good one it won't be bad, if you don't this place will ruin your life really really badly."
good,Everyday i learn something new wether it be from associates or customers. Being able to watch over the price of basic food is a big factor for my grocery. Having to deal with tough customers is one of the challenging part. Knowing that i can perform the duties and responsibilities of my higher superior makes me more determine to seek more challenging work.
good,"Able to move around in the store. All positions available to you if you worked for it. Long hours, weekends and holidays, but that's retail."
good,"Managed all the cash transactions in my workplace. Checked the daily cash balance. Interacted with the customers that come to the counter. Solved all their cash related queries. Checked for the price of products, and any discounts or offers. Received coupons and deducting the said amount from the customers. Organized work and maintaining the accounting records."
good,"My co-workers were very prompt and excelled at their job. Due to the negative energy that was created of the unrealistic goals that was put on the employees made things a little difficult, but I always stood to the tasks that were given and completed them in a timely manner. Overall the staff was great."
good,At this job one will experience the heavy flow of customer traffic and learn patience and how to deal with unruly individuals.  I genuinely enjoy working with customers.
good,great place to work management  lacked skills to keep  associates happy. i loved all my colleagues and was friends with most of them. the environment was safe most of the times
good,I took this job because I was desperate. managers treat you like as a child. pay isn't worth it and they throw hissy fits when you want to go to a different department. after 2 months I was fed up.
good,"I really enjoyed my time here,but it wasn't taking me where i needed or wanted to be. The team i was apart of was excellent and really self managed. We tackled tasks extremely quick and were well gelled together. There was really no sight of advancement that i seeked."
good,The hours were a killer unless you like to be up all night but the environment was relaxing and most of the workers were friendly as well as management. Only bad thing it's hard to switch from overnight shift to day shift but not vice versa.
good,Managers are not well trained. Do not give you enough time to get a task complete and most of the time will give you an hour task 15 minutes before you have to leave. Will expect you to stay and if you don't they will coach you.
good,"Great experience while working with many different people in my community. There are lots of rules and policies that must be followed, but growing up playing sports it becomes second nature to stay with team and follow rules. Wal-Mart gets very busy at times which makes it difficult to finish the job, but hard work and determination always gets me through. From unloading the truck to stocking everything afterwards, the best job i have is helping the people who come to shop everyday."
good,the managers are terrible if a new employee comes in they will cut the older employees hours to a day a week and are very rude
good,"the work is pretty easy, just have to be prepared for customers asking off the wall questions. Walmart doesn't pay enough for all the work that you have to do. really dont have any good benefits"
good,A typical day is good.You learn how to work hard and with others. It is a great working enviroment and i enjoy working with the customers .
good,The Walmart management team does not appreciate any of the work that their associates do for them. They make you work ridiculous hours for very little pay and when you need a manager they are either no where to be found or take a half hour to show up.
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job is working with my associates and taking care of my department. Hardest part is trying to get three days work done in one day. Management, well, there is some that are great and some that has no business being in that position. My typical day is pretty much non stop, freight, paperwork, scanning, ordering, building features, and then the management notes. Helping other areas when they need help, even when it means my area doesn't get done at all. I've learned that no matter how hard it gets and how demanding the managers are, I love what I do and I'm always satisfied of my daily accomplishments."
good,"Loved my Job overall , It was nice to come to work, I worked at two different locations.  Management communication is not  the greatest though at the last store I worked at and treble politics."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great corporation to work for, but the hourly employees are not paid fairly well. I understand the cost of living in Texas, but minimum wage for you employees should be re-evaluated. Also managers should promote prepare hourly associates to promote to manager level in the future."
good,"Fast pace, people friendly workplace have to keep moving that's a good thing the management could use a bit of work some times stressful but productive."
good,"My typical day in Wal- Mart can include busy schedule running the cash register, waiting on multiple customer through out the day. Working in three different departments at one time. One thing I learn is to be better at multi-tasking better."
good,The work place feel is more like a slave factory and isn' t for those who are looking for a balanced work style. Also they do not provide any type of benefits
good,"Didn't like working in the deli, Manager, supervisor, & employees took me for granted, said that I wasn't working hard enough even though I told them I was trying my best at the level of work I was at. The only thing I looked forward to was my paycheck. I got along better with the CUSTOMERS than the employees where I worked in that section."
good,"Varying work hours, terrible management, no option of overtime whatsoever. Bi-weekly pay, good amount of breaks, hard to become permanent."
good,It was a good place to work. They were easy to work for and with. I would recomend them to anyone who wanted to work in customer serivce.
good,"Typically we are the ones that are in charge of restocking shelves for the next day and our night moves quickly. We put out the most freight between all shifts and must take breaks and lunches in a timely manner. We are expected to have our hands in our work without looking around much but speaking to our customers and smiling even though we are generally exhausted because of our schedule of over nights we manage all tasks. We are overworked because we work in a skeleton crew with no new hires in our future and are usually in charge of more that 1 person should have to handle. If we are behind our boss will scream and yell or write us up.      "
good,the company is more worried about how quick the work is done rather than how well the products are accessible for the customer. poor detail with rotation. A person who prides themselves on their job would not be happy with this job.
good,"Realización de junta informativa, recorrido en unidad para detectar oportunidades, salida a volantear para cubrir vacantes, atención a candidatos que se presentan en unidad y vía telefónica; atención a empleados, revisión de registros de empleados, así como tiempo extra, revisión de planes de capacitación. Captura de incapacidades, formatos ST7, etc. en sistema. Informar a Gerencia de oportunidades en unidad, programas de capacitación etc."
good,"fast paced work environment, for the most part the employees are fast, friendly and efficient. I truly enjoy our regular customers that come in to visit."
good,the management is understanding but also unorganized. A typical day at work is very smooth. It is always something to do so it keeps  you busy.
good,typical day at work basic learned how to lift and stock managers were ok some co workers were ok hardest thing to do there was lifting every day heavy stuff most enjoyable was going home
good,"Great store, friendly staff, and busy industry. Staff takes their jobs serious, and customers in consideration. Making the customers is our job, performer excellent customer service is the key."
good,Now that Walmart is going back to basics the beginning of the day starts out with sorting through the leftovers of what third shift wasn't able to complete and figure out what to do with the merchandise. After that we work our new freight that is delivered that day and then we move on to paper work/price changes which follows out the rest of the day.
good,The have the department managers work harder then the sales reps with little acknowledgement.  Some of the managers were great but many were not. promotions not made on merit but on favoritisim
good,"The work and pay are ok, but the employees barely seem to care about their jobs and management is purely reactionary. The company isn't bad and I think that it may be just that store is this way with its employees."
good,Managers would listen but not follow thru with what they where saying if an issue came up. I learned more responsibility being there and how to handle stuff on my own. I had a few co workers who would really help me and respect me where as others not so much. Hardest part of my job was management and disrespectful co workers. I loved getting to work on cakes and create a master piece that customers loved.
good,"After 31/2 years of work there I can say that the pay is not getting better at 40 cents a year raises, no matter how good your work review. Plus they seem to only give promotions to people who are young and have no disabilities.  I like the people because we are all in this together, and even most management people are good. The company sucks, schedules are all over the place (2-10 Friday -back at 7 am Sat) and never any guaranteed hours per paycheck. There's never enough people to do the work properly and give good customer service, and hours are getting cut again. It's sad because this could be a great place to work if the company would give people full time and better wages."
good,Fast paced environment with lots to learn.  The hardest part of this job is servicing the whole store alone with 31 checkouts.  With lots of staff and new people joining every week or month its hard to keep track.  The most enjoyable part of my day is working with my colleagues and learning new tasks.
good,you never get to do your job because you are constantly pulled to another department and then get in trouble for not being in the right departments.
good,"Aprendi a me comunicar mais com as pessoas , aprendi também um pouco de como ser um líder , pois no Walmart as vezes exercia a função de um , quando era necessário , peguei muita experiencia e creio eu que vai ser muito importante para minha carreira profissional."
good,"Fun workplace, helped me learn how to communicate and work well with others of clashing opinions. Promotions seemed to be based on how much you were liked, rather than how capable you were."
good,"replenish items on shelf"
good,"The typical day starts with checking your activites and then completeing them in a timely matter. I learned how to process returns, put away new merchandise, set up and take down displays, and many more things. The management is okay. Some managers are better than others. My zone manager was the nicest person and would help you put I you needed it. My co-workers are nice enough. I was in a group of ten girls and two boys, things could get nasty with attitudes. The hardest part of my job was putting away a bunch of carts of stuff away in the time required. This was hard because I was still being called to do other tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to get to know my co-workers."
good,Walmart have no organization or job security for employees.Is a learning experience with a steep learning curve. Talking to customer make the experience fulfilling.
good,"when i first started  there the company was good to work for but since they restucerd the company has started going down hill the managment seems like they don;t care, there are to many mangers that arent need and the staff is ran thin in almost every department in that store and it has been like that since the food side opened and probably even before that"
good,"I liked working here and just needed help where things were to be"
good,"A gratefully easy job to get with unforgettable coworkers. The managers really make or break how good or bad the job experience can be. If you have a bad manager, you're going to have a nightmarish time. If you have a good manager, it hardly feels like work."
good,I was able to take time off for exam times so that was really a benefit of working at Walmart. They were easy going. I was not very much pleased by management. I had worked there for a very long time yet some managers still did not know my name. This made me felt not important within the workplace and it came to show that Walmart does not care about their employees.
good,"Easy job, it's not as bad as people make it seem. Co-Workers are great and most people will switch schedules with you if they can. Management takes advantage and is on a serious power trip. The hardest part of the job is pretty much not getting too bored. The best part is meeting new people and getting regulars that come to see you specifically."
good,"Requires a lot of duties, but overall, I enjoy working with a company that stays busy. You build friendly relationships with supervisors, co-workers, and customers."
good,A typical day at wok can consist of many things. I enjoy the day to day challenges because its different people everyday and never the same case. The hardest part of the job is being able to multi-task and keep up with the new and improved laws and regulations involving the pharmacy and the patients well-being.
good,"While working at Walmart I learned a lot about team work, how to deal with various personalities in management, my coworkers and customers. I learned how to better my interpersonal skills to better serve customers and make sure the customer truly does come first."
good,"A typical day differs but its a great first job, not as much so for an experienced worker. The employees are amazing. The hardest part of the job is trying to get all your tasks done in one day."
good,"Everyday i would sign in, grab a tel-zone, go put up the returns of my section, then scan the items that needed refilled, went and picked the items from the back, put them on the shelve, and binned the overstock. I would then go back to the sales floor and make sure everything was zoned and make sure if any new picks hit for me to shelf. All while helping any customers i saw. Helping customers and seeing the smile on their face when helped the correct way was the most enjoyable part of the job, the hardest part was trying to manage your time wisely while also helping customers."
good,Working nights is always a tough endeavor. Management doesnt appreciate our work. At least not in anyway than a fake smile and a handshake.
good,"en ideales la empresa es muy buena, la gente en los mando superiores es la equivocada ya que le falta preparacion para el trato correcto de sus subordinados este incidente proviene desde gerencia hasta llegar al empleado con menor rango"
good,A fast pace environment that has a lot of customers coming and going. I learned that there are a lot of rules. Management was not as good as most people hope for. They seemed like they didn't care. Some of my co-workers were nice I actually became friends with them and they worked hard. Others didn't care about anything except work. There wasn't a hard part of my job. I could handle everything that they threw at me. The most enjoyable part of the day was when I went home.
good,If you have the coverage in all departments a great place to work.The co workers have alot of tenure which can be good and bad. The hardest thing about the job is not having enough associates to serve the customer
good,"Keeping fresh fruit and vegetables available for customers, and helping them out with whatever they need. Remove all old or out of date product daily."
good,"The good managers, the ones that care about you as an individual always ends up transferring out to another store. Once new management comes in they have to establish themselves by having a big dick slinging contest by being douche bags and delegating tedious tasks. There is a constant of back biting and people continuously digging a hole for the next person. Truly crab in a brawl type of environment. The money has been rolling in and everybody seems to get a raise. Regardless of job performance everyone gets a pay increase."
good,A problem that I experience while working here was that it seemed to me that each assistant manager had their own way of doing things and no two were alike.  What one manager would tell you about accomplishing a task would differ from the next.  There was very little consistency.
good,"Always busy, Can Advance to different positions. You meet different type of people. Hardest part of the job is the customers, you have to be polite and patient to deal with them."
good,"I've been employed with Walmart Stores Inc. for 3 years and 5 months. I've enjoyed my time there for the most part. I've made good friends there. However the time for change is well overdue."
good,"I didn't know what department I would be working until 2nd interview."
good,"Typical day at work included being worked to the bone. As a department manager I was forced to work outside in the storage units in the middle of summer because management claimed they could not hire more associates. I had 2 associates for all of my departments which included paper goods, health and beauty aids, pets, chemicals, front end, candy, pharmacy and stationery. Store manager was very nice and tried to help as best he could but the system sucked and you definitely don't get paid enough as a manager to do all of the work they require."
good,walmart is not a great place to work for. the management our always yelling at their employees. they fire full timers that make over $12/hr.advancing never happens to those who are qulified for it. overall i would not recommand anyone to apply their
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for especially if you shop there for merchandise, it can be busy at times and a little hectic but it is tolerable management there helps as best they could but during busy times it would be a little hard for them to get to you to assist in a snap of fingers."
good,"If you want a great place to work, Wal-Mart is not it. They are not employee friendly or family friendly. Horrible place to work."
good,"Wal-Mart has taught me many skills I did not possess when I first started. That first few months I was wide-eyed and new to the companies lingo and terminologies, the use of equipment, and the fast paced hard work. Eventually I became accustomed to the everyday life at Wal-Mart, but as time progressed doing the same routine began to nibble at my soul until I felt empty. "
good,"I loved the work as well as the cleaning itself. I am a neat and tidy person. I would do a detailed clean for all rooms assigned too. mopping, dusting, sweeping, trash and linen removable, bathroom sinks floors and walls. I was able to chat with patients and getting to know them better helped me to be more understanding to my job functions."
good,"I loved my coworkers, I learned a lot about customer services and handling a small team. We all work hard due to our limitations of help and time. Best part about the job  you were always busy with customers or helping other employees."
good,wal-mart offers great experience for a shop setting as the shop was always busy but with that said the upper management has no clue how to run a shop. While promoting bad behavior and penalizing   good work habits
good,At Walmart you will be trained to work any position in the store if you are a hard worker. The pay is low and the hours are 32 or less. Employees got a pay raise to $9.00 an hour but your hours were reduced. The customers are usually fantastic and most managers are afraid of the person they report to. Bottom line Walmart is all about big profits by paying low wages
good,"This job was plainly just to get some experience added onto my resume and to pick up some extra money while I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life. It was a decent job but pushing carts out in the hot sun, pouring rain, or icy snow was totally not worth $7.25 an hour."
good,"I liked the job persay, but certain managers had favorites, and they don't try to hide it, some employees who tried to do things correctly seemed to get in trouble, more than those who fall asleep on the job, and don't follow direction as they should."
good,"Even though walmart was fun to work at, I feel they are not fair when assigning work and over time. if deptpartment managers would work extra days in a payday they wouldnt pay overtime they would let them pick an extra day off instead."
good,"I believe that the staff and management at this facility is the best that I have seen since the ARMY. The co workers and management were very close and they all seemed to listen to each other even when their opinions were not coinciding. When things needed to be fixed, management asked for our thoughts and actually put them to use. My daily job entailed stocking shelves during the over night hours."
good,"A typical work day consisted of getting assigned an area of the store to complete during my shift. (7 - 9 hours) Generally work independently but sometimes with one other person. most often your designated area was done long before your shift was over unless very rarely that was a lot to do. I learned about how working  with other people is often times more efficient. Management can be nice, and other times not so nice. My coworkers were really nice and friendly, they made the experience better than i had anticipated."
good,"Walmart is Notorious for it's workplace practices-underpaying employees and even contracting with companies outside of the country which pay employees substandard wages. The company when headed by Sam Walton had a culture of ""Servant Leadership"" which should be adopted by all companies in America. Evidently this culture has changed with his passing because I have had a number of poor experiences as a customer at Walmart since I was employed there."
good,"I would open/close register, cash out customers, maintain a clean area. I learned to work at a fast pace. Management could try to work more with college students. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part working at Walmart was juggling college and working full/part time. Enjoyable part of the job meeting new people."
good,I loved my job here as a pharmacy tech. I love helping others with what they needed and also doing my job. Loved the job but not the managment
good,Hard to fully catch on before the managers are throwing you out on the floor alone. You are always backed up and can never breathe.
good,"In theory, Walmart's mottos are what every company should be. However, the 'open-door policy' is a joke, and they intend to pay you as little as possible for any position. The current system allows for a lot of leeway in upper management, which allows them to delegate all tasks and responsibilities to anyone but themselves."
good,"not a place to work if you want to advance"
good,Great place for someone in desperate need of a job. Many nice and friendly people but there are a few higher ups with nasty attitudes. Workload is pretty easy depending on where you work.Enjoyed meeting new people. Random hour cuts are very typical.
good,I liked it working at walmart you learn a lot and find out how the work force will be like some day they give you three strike before they fire you which i like cause they are trying to train you and show you not to be late for work
good,I liked working in the electronics area. but I never could get along with the many many many managers that they have. way too many chiefs not enough Indians....
good,"i liked working there for time being. I had fun. i was promoted with in 5 months of being there. as long you do the work expected and be on time, the job is fairly easy."
good,"My time was cut short at Wal-Mart due to being let go after Lawn and Garden season was over.  While there, I had a blast, however the management itself was a joke.  Be prepared to feel like in high school all over again, that is how the atmosphere is."
good,"Hardest part of being a walmart manager is the work load is so demanding that it is impossible to complete all of your tasks during your regular shift so then you have to put in many hours to be able to stay on tasks and due dates.  This results"
good,"Worked me like a dog, was dragged out of my job due to health complications even after warnings given to management about what the work was doing to my health... Was working on my feet with both heels fractured and both plantar facsia's torn, was still not allowed to sit when needed (worked at the fitting room and jewelry depts.). Store management was completely uncompromising and was terrible to work for. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work here."
good,"Working at Walmart had it's pros and cons. Working overnights was easy money, your on your feet all day, and you make close friends with other coworkers(most). It's like a family. Some managers played favorites, and people were clearly treated differently than others. Managers and supports sometimes said innapropriate things to coworkers or let people get away with screaming and yelling and doing nothing, while others were kept on a tight rope. It was a decent job."
good,well my typical day would start off really well and end up being bad when i am finished management often made you miss your lunch and or break periods and would often schedule you 8 hours away from next shift.
good,"Good job out of college"
good,"The jobs I performed weren't really all that bad at all.  If you have even just a moderate work ethic you'll get through any day with ease.  I never disliked working here, but if it was my career I would probably have disliked it more.  People can be moved around (up or down) arbitrarily, and some of the people are just generally incompetent.  If I had been there for an extended period I would've eventually been frustrated by how lazy and apathetic people here can be, while I worked to the best of my abilities.  However, as a part-time temporary job, I was able to put on blinders and just toil away each day pretty happily."
good,"The Walmart location in Cedar Hill, TX was an unprofessional work environment due to the hiring methods of the most recent managers."
good,"I don't know if any other Walmarts are the same as the one I worked at back in Camden, Tennessee, but what I do know that is that sales associates and cashiers don't make enough for the amount of work we do.  "
good,"I would be showered with a list of work and deadlines with little to no assistance from management and/or associates. The work itself was not difficult but the amount provided was overwhelming."
good,Would not recommend working for this company unless you need part time work. Poor communication from management concerning new corporate policies.
good,"I was always active, always busy.  I enjoyed this part of my job very much.  Learned how to operate a fork lift.  It was difficult trying to get my job finished while other employees kept asking me to stop what I was doing to help them to their jobs."
good,Co-workers are great to get along with. Higher management on the other hand are more complicated. It's like the do not understand where you are coming from.
good,Work was great until I started working on the sales floor. The manager wanted me to do manager work with sales associate pay. Coworkers were great and very helpful. Pharmacy staff was amazing. Sad that I had to leave them.
good,"There i started out as a cashier but in a week i was offered a job as CSM customer serivce manager for front end. I would assist all cashiers throughout the store, give change do refunds work customer service desk. At night collect all funds and close out all registers throughout the store. The only bad thing was for two weeks i had to work 15 hour days, i became real sick so was forced to stop working."
good,"I loved interacting with customers, being at work was a pleasure most of the time but management wasn't really caring about their employees when time off was needed which resulted in resignation. They were not compassionate if time was needed for school or family, they made you work, which resulted in more resignation. But when we received a new store manager than became better, she appreciated the employees more, with food, drinks, and snacks in the break room, she was more appreciative."
good,"I liked what I did but struggled working overnights. personally it wasn't for me and it didn't work with my life. I tried to switch to days ,but management wouldn't help me"
good,Workplace was very busy and stressful. The hardest part of the job was at the rx drop off window at times you were there alone expected to take the rx do data entry give a time when rx would be done when the filling station is backed up and handle at least 20 people in line
good,"I have had a few positions while working for Wal-Mart. With my current positions I come into work at 5 a.m. and count the money, checks and sales from the previous day. After separating and accounting for all registers I enter each one into the computer and make the deposits. In the afternoon I set up all the registers for the next day and do paperwork. If I am finished early I help out in other departments by doing go backs or zoning the area and make it look presentable. "
good,The Wal-Mart that I worked in wasn't that great because the employers didn't care about the employees and would fire them whenever someone made a mistake. The budget was cut down because the new management wanted to try something they had been doing in Vancouver.
good,"At Walmart my day would be keeping our meat wall;s and freezer bunkers  filled with product,I would help with truck unloading when they came in.I would finish up with the cleaning procedure's and preparation for the next day.During  holiday seasons I help set up the display's and try to make sure we kept a good stock available."
good,"Wal-mart is a great place to work so long as you don't take on any higher up jobs. I loved it here till I became a manager, then it became a living nightmare."
good,"A typical day would be working the cash register. I learned good customer service skills. Management was not that great, I asked for my hours to not be so late because I was still in high school. They never changed my hours. I loved working with my co-workers. The hardest part would be dealing with bad hours."
good,"Management is mediocre but overall they get the job done. "
good,"A typical day at work is severing customers , using slicers to cut meat/ cheese the customers ask for. Also i serve customers that want  salads and hot foods that i cook and fry. As a deli associate i am responsible for cooking rotisserie chickens and baking pizza's. Since i am a closer my duties are to clean ovens , fryer's , slicers , scales , wash dishes and other equipment that we use.  "
good,Wal-Mart  is a places that they only look out for them self. They really don't like it if you haft to miss even if you in the hospital they still expect you to be there.
good,Working in customer service i had to listen to customer feed back and also handle large amounts of cash for cashing payroll checks.
good,"its a job that I loved to do. Helping customers to find what they needed or locate an item was highlights of the job. I learned a lot about inventory control, warehouse management, and customer wants and needs.  Some management skills were needed because you were expected to take care of your customers needs and management didn't want to be bothered with small TIME CONSUMING debates of price differences.  Some Co Workers were not trained or crossed trained in different departments properly so a lot of customers found it frustrating to find people to help them.  I hope that changes.  Most enjoyable part of the job was my everyday frequent customers. They know you by name, kiss you hello, ask how's the family and really truly are happy to see you and thankful for the service you do and show them on a daily or frequent basis. I wish Wal-Mart the best. I feel its a great company with MANAGMENT problems."
good,Not a very friendly Manager. Co-workers have all come and gone. I really enjoy retail and would like to continue just not in Walmart.
good,Most of the management and employees are good but they have some that need to be sifted out because they have bad morale. The policies and procedures are good. A great company that provides room for upward movement.
good,"not a bad job but schedule is through weekend so no overtime. cussed out at times for circumstances beyond control.No Saturdays"
good,"Look in the news. Enough Said. They have their good days and other times they have bad days, just depends what store you work at and their attitude towards working."
good,"buena en el hambiente de respeto laboral, consolidada, con salario oportuno, y estructura administrativa solida, equipamento de seguridad deficiente, R.H. deficiente, poca promocion laboral."
good,If you start with walmart dont plan on staying too long... slowly benefits are being taken away and walmart dont care about there workers
good,"Wal-Mart used to be a fun job, different experiences everyday.  That was until they did away with my position and started hiring people part time so they would not have to pay benefits."
good,"A typical day at work.  I would show up and make sure that I have all the information I need to make sure my day is smooth and goes as it should.  I would touch bases with my TL and make sure we were on the same page regarding what it was I needed to work on as a CSR.  I would make sure that throughout the day this is something I focused on, as I wanted to make sure I adapt the best customer service skills.  I learned that listening, and being patient with customers can really help any user and make things easier on everyone.  I have also learned that there are many ways to prevent Supervisor calls, as I feel most are very unnecessary for most cases."
good,Overall hard to get clear answers to questions or hands on training.  Very fast paced and hectic seem to be more interested in quick not great work.
good,Walmart was not my type of job the management was not very helpfull.  My coworkers were not the best but some where decent.  Advancement in walmart was almost impossible.  It takes 1 yr to become full time associate.  Benefits wre not avaliable unless you are a full time employe.
good,"On more than 1 occasion I was told to work 'off-the-clock.' When I presented this to the higher management, I was placed in a different part of the store with no knowledge of where products went, then I was punished for working too slow."
good,"-Typical work days were repetitive but were expected as so, i would more often then not find myself running in circles due to management demanding different task be done without allowing original task to be complete. Most days ended up with loads of work to be done tomorrow because of management demanding i stop my current task to do another."
good,I enjoyed working with the public and learning about retail. They really need to work on the employee relations though. I stocked freight and rotated stock and worked with customers to find what they needed and all with a smile on my face just to be told that they couldn't switch my position when I could no longer do the lifting
good,the company cares only about the value of a dollar not the employees. they refuse to hire anyone full time and provide them and their family with adequate insurance. they make all employees work every weekend until they say something
good,"unload trucks , pull pallets stock shelves clean up help other ppl in there work areas also would have to unload the garden truck with the fork lift"
good,"Learned several ways that phone companies use to determine charges for accounts."
good,Good pay but maxes out in 2-3 years. benefits are ok. the hours aren't the greatest but the pay can make up for it. management is ok in some department some take it to the head to much tho
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, mas a politica é que deixa a desejar, a direção da empresa e que a estraga. O lado bom é que não atrasa o salário, pelo contrario ate antecipa o pagamento. A parte ruim é mesmo a politica de crescimento, pelo menos na loja que eu trabalhava, precisava puchar muito o saco  pra ser promovido, participei de três recrutamento interno e não fui aprovado e nenhum. Pois não era puxa saco e nem baba ovo."
good,if you come in early lie i do your ob is basically to clean up overnight mess and start working in your department the managers wot bother you as long as your out of sight and doing what your supposed to be doing
good,It was a good job for a beginner. The pay was not enough to help a family on. I learned a lot about loss prevention and how to work in an environment like this.
good,"Porém havia dificuldades em organização, da Gerência ao estabelecimento."
good,"Walmart is now a numbers company and no longer a family or loyal to the associate company. 15 years of service and in 2 years all washed away,"
good,It is not worth your time or energy working at Walmart. There are other jobs that pay more and have better work environments.
good,"Few benefits, completely random work hours with no stability. Coworkers were fine, as was direct management within the store, but as a whole the company does not care much about its workers."
good,"I worked at 2 different locations: an established Supercenter"
good,Its a good job to have. My customer service skills are improving everyday. Management does a poor job and I'm not sure if this is every Walmart or only the Walmart that i am currently employed at. I love my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is downstacking the truck when it comes in with thousands of pounds of freight.
good,"I straightened up clothing, sometimes ran a register, answered the fitting room phone, ran the jewelry counter. It wasn't to bad but they do not train employees very well. You pretty much learn as you go."
good,not much to say wasn't there long enough. really enjoyed the co-workers everyone was helpful. not paid enough to deal with the demanding public.
good,"work hard too hard, serve too many people, get paid bottom of the barrel wages, expensive healthcare, equipment outdated, medicaid nightmare, unfair bosses, favoritism."
good,"A day of work at Wal-Mart is pretty straight forward, you are assigned a area of work through ""my guide"" and  you are to complete those task before your shifts ends."
good,"Walmart wasn't a bad job, but they were unorganized, and underemployed for the job I had."
good,"I assisted team members in breaking down pallets of merchandise, sorting for placement on the isles for stocking. I assisted in maintaining the cleanliness of the store environment using safety standards as required. I retrieved shopping carts from the parking lot as required. I learned how to assist customers in a friendly manner to locate items as needed. I had multiple management personalities that I worked with to receive appropriate instructions from. I enjoyed working with my co-workers in accomplishing our tasks. The hardest part of my job was achieving the time limits of breaking down the pallets. I was easily caught up in the details. I'm looking forward to accomplishing that type of requirement in the future. I enjoyed being successful in providing satisfaction to any customer I encountered and assisted."
good,easy job doing odd things around the store to make it look good. management was horrible and had no idea how to run a store.
good,"It was a job that i needed at the time. I was to answer phones, file and even clean at times. I was not a hard just but it was what I needed while in school"
good,"The work to employee ratio is completely unbalanced, Some workers get away with doing next to nothing and prospering while others do all the work and struggle to advance."
good,"I learnt many things at walmart. i managed the front end, work electronics and paint, photo lab, fully cash trained, trained in fashion and costumer service. typical day at work on the floor was to service costumers and get out as much stock as possible. as the csm making sure my cashiers had what they needed for fast efficient service. my coo workers were great. the mangers were rude, sneaky and kept moving everyone around no one stayed in the same place for long. hardest part of my job was to please the mangers. I worked in photo lab and our passport photos weren't working or the stock wasn't order i tried to inform mangers but they had no worries about that department. i dealt with rude costumers but anything they said to me the mangers said worst.  I love working with people i got along with all my co workers and i made many costumers happy."
good,Walmart is a great job for college students.  They will work around your school schedule. It requires you to do a lot but does not pay accordingly.  No health benefits included unless you are full time worker.  Often can get extra hours if needed.
good,"at the time that i worked there the pay was just a little above min wage the, management could care less about you and the facilities were old and in need of repair...or at least a face lift. since then changes in all those areas have been made but I'm still not sure if i would work there again."
good,"This is a job I would recommend to few. The freedoms that being an AP associate granted were nice, but the policies that must be followed allowed for little creative thought or action."
good,"At this job, the best thing to do is to be to work on time and do your job and keep up with what you do, you will also need to learn how to work with people and coworkers."
good,"Typical day at work requires standing for 10 hours, picking cases while being timed. No advancement, no cross training until you've been there over ten years and that's hand picked by management, they picked the same people for all cross training."
good,"Manage always expect for things to get done no matter how much time you got, and sometimes more that one manager will ask you to something when you already have other tasks that have not been completed."
good,they treat me good and i do them a good job there are some employees that don't pull  their weight  and some some that think they know everything
good,Takes a long time to try to get full time to get benefits. you can work really late one night and have to work early the next morning. very poor management.
good,I liked working at Walmart but they didn't work with me about my schedule. It was very hot in the shop with no ac. My co-workers were lazy and never got their jobs done. The tire guy would come and I was the only one to pull in tires.
good,"A good place to work while looking for more work. The co-workers are very helpful, as Sam Walton would have wanted, but the management staff did not appreciate the associates they had around them. I would still work for other Walmart, as I have in the past, but not that store."
good,"Working for Walmart was tolerable until we had a new supervisor take over about a year ago.He was obsessive, compulsive, and only interested in his own advancement. He cut tech. hrs. to the point that it compromised safety and convenience for the customers. "
good,"I go to work clock in go outside and bring in carts from the lot and make sure the carts stay available for our customers. I enjoy working with my co-workers we get each other through the day. My manager is a great lady I enjoy working for her."
good,"Wal-Mart's management is not caring at all. They do not care whether you have a family emergency, you're in the hospital, sick or simply just cannot make it into work. You will never be excused for missing work even if your provide a doctors note. You will be written up .  A typical day ay work as a cashier you ring up customers who sometimes have issues with merchandise and will need upper managements assistance. Not only will customers be upset with you about things you have no control over but management will get mad at you for calling them to your register to further assist customers. Overall the job is okay because they give you the hours you request but the people are just terrible."
good,"I ensure customers have a satisfactory shopping experience, as well as find as make sure they find everything they are looking for."
good,"Very Productive, No communication amongst Overnight assistant Managers. Most Times Help is NOT available when needed. A Tough enviornment to work at times. I'm A VERY dedicated hardworking asscociate at Walmart. Frozen Department most times by myself."
good,"Retail is a job that you either love it or hate it.  I was with WalMart for 12 years and just got burned out of retail management."
good,"While working at Walmart, I learned how to use the cash register and help customers by answering their questions and helping them find things, etc. The hardest part of the job was standing for hours at a register, and helping rude customers. My coworkers were nice for the most part, but I found that they loved to spread rumors about other coworkers. My manager was nice even though he refused to give me me more hours."
good,"Busy"
good,I liked working at Walmart as a cashier because I would interact with customers. I learned how to deal with different personalities. Management was not that good.
good,I enjoyed this job cause I got to interact with people on a daily bases.  I left this job so I could go back to school and further myself in the work force.
good,"I did not enjoy my time at Walmart. The management was not the best, CSMs had favorites, did not fully care on how you felt and sexist. Just not one of the best places to work."
good,great compensation.  the customers were the best part of the job.  after 5 years of not working there i still have customers come up to me in the store asking for my recommendations on what they need or what is the best product for their needs.
good,"Morning shifts begin with clearing out and straightening up the bay area of any missed trash, loose carts, or left behind merchandise from the prior night. This immediately transfers into clearing and realigning cart corrals in the parking lot."
good,"fun putting store together, hard work but enjoyable.  After store opened, very little communication between managers and with employees. Lacked organization, instruction"
good,"Customer Service                                                                            Checked Out Customers"
good,Worked there while I was attending college. Not horrible but definitely was ready to leave when I finished college.  Made several friends within the company and learned a lot about management.
good,"As large as WalMart, being the second of the largest businesses in the US, it is one of the most in-consistent workplaces I've ever worked. The work and the expectancy of the work done is way too much for the pay. The company has since made a public announcement that WalMart will be increasing their previous pay rate beginning April1 for the new hires, bu the existing associates has to be gradually upgraded to what their pay grade will be.The adjustment supposedly should be completed by January 2015. How fair is that? "
good,i loved working herer i worked for this company on two seperate occasions wal mart has the right idea but their stores are ran by individual managers that run it their way and ignore company policy
good,The work was constant and kept me on my toes. Most of my co-workers were very nice and friendly people. Although the management lacked in problem solving and time management.
good,"The hardest part of this job was dealing with irate customers who would cross the line because they would push the limits of throwing items, threatening bodily harm and even spitting."
good,Management is pressured to reach goals which enter fear  with store compliance and safety which is a concern for the employees.
good,"A general day at Walmart consisted of drama and hustle. Some of the employees were amazing to work with, while others were a hand full. Some Managers are there to earn a living and demand an associate to clean up where they fell down. While others praised you on the smallest achievement. Depending on what department and what store a person works for depends on how organized and willing the managers were willing to work with an employees schedule (i.e) schooling, life style, children activities after school, vacation, etc."
good,The day begins with me ordering merchandise for department in order to keep sales up. Management is kind of everywhere no one is ever really on the same page so it makes for a stressful work environment.
good,en un dia de trabajo se empiza por revisar las ventas del dia anterior asi como analizar cada departamento a cargo para tomar decisiones. se realiza recorrido por las áreas para ir detectando las oportunidades a corregir y empezar a trabajar las rutinas
good,Great job but low pay for the work you do also had a long commute.  I would love to stay but could not due to pay. Loved working with the people that came in.  Seems like you got to know all of the shoppers.
good,"Pulling freight out to the sales floor with a pallet jack and stocking shelves, creating displays and helping customers. I do not recommend this place to work. They treat the employees unfairly and with disrespect. Pay is poor for the labor involved especially since it is a multi billion dollar company. I did not enjoy working at this place at all and will not recommend it, even for shopping."
good,"Very slow at first, picks up during mid-day. I learned how to do Layaway and learned alot about pictures, recieving from the back, unloading trucks, and selling and mixing paint. Co-workers are very friendly. Hardest part is the online where you can't fix orders. Enjoyable part is making people happy!"
good,"A typical day started at 4pm, we would set up the back room for unloading the truck. Placing pallets in the appropriate areas for freight coming off the truck. We bring in the rail in to slide freight down the line. Some one would go into the trailer and place each individual item on the line and push it down. Once the item in question was on the line it was taken off to the appropriate pallet, representing sections of the store, lawn and garden, electronics, apparel, pets, etc. Once the truck had been cleared of freight, the rail was taken out and typically we'd go to break. After a fifteen minute break we would usually split the crew up, some working on sorting freight and apparel, and the rest going to the grocery back room to help them unload their truck. Once it was 8pm we took an hour lunch and came back at 9pm. At nine we had to pull out all the pallets to deliver the sorted freight to the specified departments for overnight stockers to work. Once all freight was brought out, we would clean up the back, and move any back stock out of the way for overnight pickers. Depending on the needs of the day we would then either help the Inventory Management team with picks, or the stockers with their freight. Every Saturday and Tuesday we would do a pallet truck, filling one of the empty trailers with extra pallets the store had accumulated. We were also responsible for making cardboard and plastic bales. Work day typically ended at 12am or 1am.  Management was hit or miss. Some managers worked with us and others felt like they just made the job harder. We were frequently asked"
good,"The work benefits were good, the management would often go out of their departments to get others to do the work their people were supposed to do, who were getting paid to sit in the back room, while others do their work.  There was little or no room for advancement, and the managers won't do anything to help when short on manpower, just stand and watch."
good,"A typical day at work would start with aa number of customers in need of help."
good,A lot of moving around and confusing work. Managers don't keep up with co-works work. You have to keep up with the pace in work day to day.
good,"Walmart like all company's are made by their employees, their employees, must be willing to work with another, I have had no problem in this aspect in any company that I have worked at, because I understand we must work as a team, to accomplish the greater goals the company desires of us..Their is no I in team, but the individual must focused his energies to accomplish his goals, in order to come together with the rest of his fellow men and women to accomplish the overall store or company goals."
good,Typical day in stocking is pretty self Explanatory. not much to learn except making sure you rotate product within perishable items. Management is not around much but very particular. co-workers are encouraged to help when done with their assigned section. Hardest part of the job is the hours and scheduling. only thing i enjoyed at this job was the set breaks and lunches.
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  We would alwyas have something to do and always on the go. It was a good paying job and they always had extra hours to give away.
good,"It was a very hard job for someone my age and over weight after spending 12 years long hauling.  Instead of driving the truck I was now unloading 53 foot trailers by hand one box at a time.  They say max 50 lbs but some weighed up to 150lbs. after that was done and everything was stacked on pallets ( usually 12 feet high) according to department we used hand pallet jacks to pull them out to each dept. for the night shift to stock shelves. I learned never to give up and if I just kept going I would not only get through my shift but lost 65lbs. What I enjoyed most was my co-workers, most 25 years younger than me, they never treated me like they thought I couldn't do the job.  And as far as I know, I still hold the record at Westbank WalMart for unloading a trailer the fastest."
good,"Cart round up dominates the majority of the work day, causing position to be an outside position. Always at the mercy of weather."
good,Lots of interaction with customers. Always busy either on the floor or in the backroom. Awesome co-workers and some great managers.
good,"A typical day as an unloader consists of coming in to a short staffed crew and being expected to do the impossible without the proper help. A good unloader crew at the store I was at would consist of 5 people, one on the truck unloading and 4 others taking merchandise off the line and palletizing it by department. On any given day, we were lucky to have 2-3 unloaders and were expected to unloaded a 3000-4000 piece truck in less than 2 hours. Management wouldn't allow us to take breaks at the same time, so instead of stopping the unloading process for 15 minutes they would slow it extremely for 45 minutes or more at times. You are unable to come up with ideas on how to make things more efficient because management will write you up, ""coach you"", for any out of the box thinking, mainly because it makes them look bad. The work itself is fairly fun and great for keeping you in shape. But when it comes to any chance of advancement, there is none unless you suck at the job you were hired for, If you are good at the job they will refuse to advance you in the company because then they would be losing a person in a position that can actually do the job. So my advice to anyone thinking about working for Walmart would be do the job but don't put your heart into it, and if all works the way it did in my store you will be management in no time."
good,On a daily basis had to set up to receive trucks full of inventory that have to be separated onto different pallet. Usually lasting 2 hours and 30 minutes. Additional work of breaking down break packs. A very physical job. The work Is hard. The staff is very decent. So pulling pushing and standing and moving...
good,they expect a lot from you since day one your asked to accomplish a task in a time frame before you start another one hour lunch and two breaks also you have to make sure your prices are up to date along with if the product is still set their.
good,"Wal-Mart is a fun place to work.  I enjoy the people I work with.  Only thing is they ask how many hours or days you wanna work and they work you way over more than you want.  I also do not like working every Friday, Saturday and Sunday with long hours after working a 40 hr full-time job."
good,"constant on your feet job"
good,Good job if you like to get pushed around. The management is horrible. I quit working there because of faluse information. They had me working until ten and then coming back in at 5 am.
good,I like working for this company but management was never really on the same page and it seemed once you got to a certain level that they became lazy and didn't put in the effort they used too.
good,"I leaned that Walmart in stettler  is not a good place to work, the managers don't care  and the walmart  MasterCards   I didn't like having to ask every customer or we would get yelled at like if they wanted it they would ask since there's signs every where with it.  Not being given day off when requested month or more in advance working. Late. I would never work at walmart again. Especially not for minimum wage."
good,"Management is not the best and there is definite favoritism within the company. As for associates, all are friendly and help you when it is needed. It's extremely difficult to move up and scheduling of weekly hours are no stable at all. You must check your schedule almost on an everyday basis to schedule any other plans in your regular life. There's little resources given that allow you to do your job efficiently which is a large setback. Management will also schedule you on days you say you are not available on a regular basis which is extremely frustrating. Management also gives unrealistic time frames to complete tasks which also is very stressful and frustrating."
good,Greeting customers and taking a detailed inventory also restocking shelves maintaining aquariums. Management maintained a professional environment for employees. The hardest part of the job is standing for entire shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others and the learning experience I received.
good,"This job was not the best job of all. When you were presumed at boring you would be manager and  then they tell you that they can not give it to you do , to the fact that they gave it to someone else who family member was a seasoned upper management."
good,"It is hard to say too many great things about the workplace of Walmart in Upper Sandsuky.  It is very productive and most workers get along with one another...but beneath it all you fell a bit of a toxic atmosphere during the 3rd shift.  People are always irritable at one another, managers tell one shift one thing and then change their ""views"" for another, and everyone feels that they are being pushed in every direction.  It isn't the worst place to work, but it becomes very stressful very fast."
good,It was always hard to get your breaks on time. Management always seemed to be waiting for you to make a mistake. The co-workers were nice and enjoyed having conversations with customers
good,"Walmart was a job when I needed one."
good,Its was great when I first started  but as management keep changing it became something else work wasn't enjoyable anymore
good,A typical day at Walmart. The workers are friendly and helpful. The management staff is not that good they don't help at all i asked if any full time positions where open and if i could advance to them and they laughed in my face. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.
good,"Worked as a cashier and stock shelves around the registers.  My co-workers were fun to work with on third shift. The hardest part of my job was working on third shift, because I have always worked on first."
good,"Enjoyed the diverse array of customers I was able to serve, the fast paced environment and team work demonstrated by co-workers."
good,"Motivated self-starter with proven experience providing customized service to meet individual needs."
good,"Rude customers were to be expected, however, rude management, unprofessional language at work, unclean work place, unfair breaks/days off were a surprise."
good,"walmart is one of the worst places i have worked for by far. the co workers are great, management was pretty bad. some customers where nasty and others where nice. walmart doesn't supply uniforms that they demand that you have or else you would be terminated. you can follow the rules to a t but get intruble anyways, you can work your butt off and streach your self to work 3 diff department and work 14 hr shift and just try your best for them but they wont do anything for you."
good,Most work days i am left with work from last shift that i need to take care of before i leave.  Management can be very droll and slow to respond when help is needed also don't seem to know what they are doing as well.
good,"Though my time at wal-mart was short, and honestly I did regret some aspects, I did love working there. I met many interesting people and It made me grow more as a person. The co-workers there will be the sweetest people you ever meet, and for the most part, the customers were very pleasant to be around."
good,"To get to work and complete any task assigned to me."
good,"my first job so far in this country. like the management,espially the team work like a cohesive unit.everthing i like except salary."
good,"I gained many of years of customer service and managerial experience.  After a while, there wasn't anymore room for growth with the company.  Corporate wise, management was excellent. Store level, management was horrible. No teamwork or communication.  It was always a pleasure making sure customers left the establishment happy and willing to comeback."
good,"A typical was pulling pallets of product onto the floor and stocking shelves, refrigerators and freezers."
good,"A typical day at work involved providing customer service, performing point of sale operations and accepting multiple forms of payment, cleaning my work area and stocking my work area."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas, digitação, notas fiscais, atendimento ao público, comunicação e trabalho em equipe."
good,Keep the work area clean and sanitary. Stay alert and attentive while talking to customers and working as you are handling dangerous equipment when cutting the meat
good,Ok place to work. No room to advance and hours regularly cut short.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of helping customers, putting things back where they belong, answering questions, and interacting with different members of the staff. I learned how to handle different customers, how to diffuse certain situations, and work multiple cash registers. My coworkers were great. Some of them made me look forward to coming to work. There wasn't any really hard parts of being a cashier as long as you knew what you were doing."
good,I started my day most of the time putting up clothes returns. What I learned at this job was to always ask questions if your not 100% sure on something. Management was ok. My co-worker were difficult at times but we stuck together and helped each other a lot. The hardest part of this job was working crazy hours. The most enjoyable thing was that all employees got a 10% discount card which you could use on all your purchases and getting compliments from satisfied customers
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work; the pay and some of the supervisors wasn't what i expected them to be.
good,"* Checking phone calls messages appointments and meeting new customers a typical day"
good,"Tive a oportunidade para aprender sistema,como atender fornecedor e clientes"
good,Wal-Mart is a fun place to work at because you interact with diverse people and that is enjoyable for me. I learn new things daily involving retail. Management has shown a lack of interest in who I am. I say this because the Store Manager or Asst. Manager have not made an effort for an introduction. I think the hardest part of the job is lifting items that are too heavy. The lower level managers are helpful and know who I am. Wal-Mart is huge and I think the managers need more help with their daily tasks.
good,Is an ok place to work. Can get descent hours if you are willing to work them. seems to not care about the lower level workers. understaffed and people are never scheduled on a consistent schedule. is a ok company just a stressful work place. have some good co-workers and some bad. the hardest part is working when we are understaffed(which is often) the most enjoyable is the hour lunch break.
good,A typical day at walmart is getting to know new people and personalities everyday. I learned that being a cashier you have to understand that you are the last person the customer will see so you have to leave a lasting impression. I work with many different coworkers and they are a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of my job is letting a customer know that we are out of stock on products that they request. the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers.
good,"a typical day : egt there at 5 am empty donut case wash donut case wash trays bake donuts glaze them package them put them out do dishes go to lunch come back take trash and organic out wash floor do pull for next day and go home.."
good,"What I learned working at Wal-Mart is the only way to become heard is to voice your opinions to management; keep to yourself at all times. Work is work, keep your personal life stories to family and friends outside of work. A job is something that is business orientated, you must be professional and ignore persistent gossip, because thats all it is are rumors and unimportant stories that will hold you back, so I learned to push through that, and because of that I became a better worker, to the point where i was offered a promotion as a Customer Service Rep."
good,Don't go to Walmart to work if u go to school if u go on break they still put u in the hours that u would usually work there's hardly room for advance because they don't want you to I go to school and I can't work extra hours because I go to school its just unheard of and y work for a company that does not want u
good,working at wal mart was a great experience ...the management sucked a little they acted like they didnt care about their worker but in general if it wasnt for the workers there wouldnt be a wal mart.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is when you have a happy customer.
good,"typical day was hard on us cashiers because their weren't enough cashier employees on each shift, so lines were long and customers getting upset"
good,"If you are looking for long term employment that gives medical benefits, go someplace else. If you need a part time job while you go to school or just need a little extra money, this might be a good option. They are very flexible with hours, but don't pay much. Praise isn't given, so just expect everyone that works here to be a bit fed up of the lack of acknowledgement."
good,"I was told I would be working in the Deli, but then at the interview was told they needed me urgently in the Produce Dept., so I agreed to try it. I loved the work I performed as a Produce Associate, but unfortunately I was not physically able to continue to perform my duties due to unforeseen lifting restrictions; and eventually I was going to have to find a job paying a higher wage as I was not able to meet my basic financial needs. Otherwise, the location I worked at was a great place to work, everyone was friendly, felt like a family atmosphere. I do feel like they weren't open to correcting some of the operations that were ""broken"" that would have made the job easier and more efficient/profitable. New management came in shortly before I left and I would predict some positive changes. Most of management was always kind and helpful, but I did ask for a transfer into a different department a few weeks into my job after realizing I had lifting restrictions and they were never able to transfer me. This puzzled me as I witnessed many other employees getting transfers and adjustments during the few months of my employment there for health or restriction reasons."
good,Provided very good customer service skills and productivity and organizational skills.  Also experienced various department operation while working with such a large corporation.
good,"A typical day would consist of pulling out backstock for stocking employees to work, managing inventory, and working on side projects. While working at Walmart I learned that there was always something to be done and that from the start of your shift till the end you will always be busy. The management team as well as my coworkers were always friendly even if there was disagreement on things."
good,"Typical days at work consisted of anything and everything. Planning from our management team was poor and unacceptable. Unrealistic goals were set for each department and never met. As leads, the fault would cover our report with the company in filth and blame. I would often train an entire team of temporary labor union workers on how to carry-out tasks, only to find out they were only contracted for a portion of the night. Communication seemed to improve throughout the light season and later decline as the year progressed. My co-workers were never steady hires and constantly replaced. The hardest part of the job was maintaining my team's moral throughout the night and walking into work with a smile and positive outlook. What I took with me from this experience was to never take a well-oiled machine (company) for granted."
good,It was very challenging. The managers are very mean. I hate working at Walmart. It was like you never can do anything right.
good,"It's a decent job to have, just very annoying waiting for management to help you solve a customer's problem.  Also they do not give you enough rewards for all the hard work you do each day"
good,"I cant think of anything I enjoyed about this job, I got treated like dirt. and finally got fired for something that was not even my fault. there company is to corporate and they don't care about your needs and just want there money."
good,"A typical day at wal-mart would be signing on to a register waiting on customers and cashing them out, with you occasional ""red lining"" and cleaning of the aisles."
good,"A typical work day would be me clocking in as soon as I arrive.  I would then scan my work badge so I can be assigned to a register, and then make my way to that particular register.  I would then log onto that register and began to check out customers.  Depending on the amount of hours I've been scheduled to work determines the remainder of my day.  Some days I'll take an hour lunch break, and some days I'll only take a fifteen minute break.  Then when its time for me to end my work day and clock out, I clean around my register, sweep, and change the trash bag.  I then clock out and throw my trash away and go home.  The best part of my job is the people I work with.  Unless I'm sick, I often have fun at work.  Management sucks.  When there are big events (holidays, black friday) going on at the store, there is no type of control or order.  We as cashiers try and do our best to keep things under control, but I just feel things could be handled in a much better way.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude inconsiderate customers.  They often catch attitudes when things don't go their way, such as long lines, or items being in the wrong spot on the sales floor and ringing up more than they expected."
good,"Is a nice place to star but definitely is not good in benefits specially if you are part-time like me. Sometimes they don't treat fair all the employees, in general is not too bad but not a place to work for long time."
good,"Normally work 6-8 hour shifts. You are taught how to operate a quickart machine, and pumptruck. Often times, workers have to cover   other departments due to lack of employees. Long winters are very difficult to cope with, store standards have the most freedom in the store."
good,"worked in jewelry sales. learned how to repair watches, pierce ears and engrave. no benefits and very little raises."
good,"Praying all the way to work -Daily-"
good,"This is a job where I worked overnight.  During those hours no one would hardly be in the building.  My job was to make sure all of the restrooms were clean, i had to sweep and mop aisles, I had to strip and wax the floors as needed, empty all trash cans, take trash out to dumpster and put boxes in compactor."
good,"I was only there for temp work with the management team.  The people are mostly nice.  However, they have so many demands placed on them by corporate that it is tough for them to focus on any one issue for more than a few minutes.  For the work demands I feel that the management team and associates are terribly underpaid."
good,"I get to work and then I would punch in and get to the receiving area.  I would get my equipment for the day. Go out on the floor and start pulling product from the features on the floor to the main aisles.  I then would get all the empty space filled with all different products.  I would also attend to customers and other areas in the store."
good,I think the job over all was ok only thing was the manger did want to change my hours
good,This company was basically good only for the health benefits.
good,the job at walmart had good and bad things many rules changed a lot and not everyone was on the same page and one person would tell you to do something while another would tell you to do something else.
good,The employees I worked with were all hard workers and the company made sure we took all our breaks.  I was able to rotate into multiple departments and my organizational skills were much appreciated especially in the health and beauty area as well as in the toy and hardware departments.
good,Walmart.  Largest company in the world.  Excels at productivity and execution with limited resources.
good,"Working at WalMart was very difficult but it, and God's strength, helped me become the outstanding customer service representative that I am today. Despite my low ratings of this job I did work with some very incredible co-workers and managers who helped me get through the rough spots every day."
good,"Easy to do, poor hours, customers can be more aggressive, managers work on moral"
good,It's fun place to work. I enjoy working with some of the associate. And some are Ok you know you cannot expect everyone to be good. but the company is good company.
good,"I work from 11:pm to 8:00am Wednesday through Sunday. I get 1 hour for lunch and I get 2 fifteen minute breaks, I pick up empty pallets and cardboard trash from the sales floor all night, then sweep the floor from 6:00 to 8:00am. The hardest part is lifting the heavy wooden pallets and all the walking that I have to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is  I get to see all the new stuff as soon as it comes in."
good,"It was a great work place if you loved helping people find things that they needed/ wanted. But when it came to management, they treated you like dirt and called you rude names."
good,"Would have been better with more professional, interpersonal management."
good,"A typical day involved listening to customer concerns and queries, and helping the management team with the goals they were given by the head office. Even though i was not part of the management team technically, i was given the responsibility of managing other employees on a constant basis. This taught me how to effectively deal with employees to maximize their output. I also learned how a retail store operates in a very detailed manner. There were some similar ambitious minded co-workers, but there were also workers who always showed up with a negative attitude. Overall they were all friendly once given the time. The hardest part of the job was advancing in the company because favoritism weighed more than performance and work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job was that because of my work ethic and performance i was always called work extra shift and stay long hours. I enjoyed working 2-3 weeks in a row without a day off because of the positive impact i felt i was having on the workplace."
good,I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone who is looking for advancement or job security. It is an okay company to work for as a temporary associate or for part time work for college students.
good,"Most of our day consisted of restocking shelves and organizing the back room. Also helping customers when needed."
good,"Working for Walmart isn't as bad as people make it however, prepared for poor work ethics among coworkers, unhelpful managers, and disrespectful customers. Often, I worked hard there but only to secure my job, not to move up. In order to move up the average time to get into a higher position, depends on if the position is available, if you're qualified, and must get approved by management to make sure that someone else can fill your old position. In other words, unless you're willing to work for the company for 10+ years, go to college and get a management degree in 2 years and find a better job."
good,"Typical work day at wal-mart. Very stressful , if things are not done the right way. You are not told, and then you get yelled at about it later when it becomes a issue."
good,"Providing customer service, food preparation, involvement in team oriented staff. Providing service with a friendly smile and positive outlook."
good,"Maintain the customer service and checkout area for prompt & accurate processing of customer orders in a fast-paced environment."
good,"This review was already submitted in an earlier submission."
good,"Co workers were friendly, easy to get along with."
good,A typical day work is being able to be very flexible and able to switch roles with anything that needs to be done. I have learned how to manage several people and to make sure they are taken care of. If you take care of your associates they will take care of you. Watching several different types of management styles I have learned what works best and what doesn't work. I've also learned that every generation needs to be approached differently. I have learned a lot from my fellow coworkers on simple things like how to balance your very busy days to your very slow days. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent in the days worked and the crazy hours and trying to balance home life. I really enjoy being a manager and able to take care of my associates and making sure the customers are taking care of and happy before they leave the store.
good,"work in below freezing temperatures"
good,"From my years as a manager at walmart Ive noticed that every store is different.  Some stores will treat there associates like slaves and others actually appreciate them..  Its like the have fazes,  My store was great up until we had several management changes.  Then in our daily meetings we would have a manager tell us how replaceable we are and constant threats.  She then started to fire works that have been there 5-10+ years simply because they didn't get along or see eye to eye although they were working as hard as they could.  She started to put pressure on me as well by making my job literally impossible to complete.  She also had been in trouble a lot by corporate.  Honestly it just depends but overall its not too bad."
good,"When I needed a job, Wal-Mart was the only employer willing to give me a chance. It is helping me stay focused on my initial task of wanting to get a better job. "
good,They don't pay enough compared to their competition and most managers don't care about their employees. most of the things they say in the beginning are not true
good,aprender sobre sistemas y  manejo de caja.. no habia parte dificil
good,The only thing that was disturbing to me was how cashiers were treated when minor mistakes were made and how they terminated employees and how they treat former employees in regards to having important documentation filled out.
good,"Wal-Mart is a high paced, busy corporation. The pharmacy especially."
good,"Como jefe de recibo, limpiar área de trabajo, recibir y contar mercancia contra factura o remisión, dar de alta la mercancía en el inventario y pasar información a sistemas para programar pago, aprendí a recibir mercancía, trato con proveedores, elaborar cambios de precio, planogramas, rotación de mercancia, reportes de ventas, resolver problemas y dudas de los clientes, facturar a los clientes en el sistema, la dirección de gerencia variable, gerentes muy comprometidos otros no tanto, aplican la ley del miedo, buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros en trabajo de equipo, lo mas difícil darle gusto a todos los jefes que tiene uno, en general me gustaba mucho todo lo que hacia."
good,"They treat their contractors like dirt. Poor management, poor vision. The people were the only highlight of my day. I will never take a contract position unless it is a temp to hire."
good,"To me, working at Walmart is a pretty good, I really enjoyed that it gets busy on and off throughout the day. I didn't learn much at Walmart since they pretty much didn't train me at all except for the job I did which was pushing carts. The management is the worst part about Walmart, they would lie about everything and go after the ones that work hard while letting those who don't do anything get away with everything. Another con about the management is that they would always target someone that they did not like, and when I worked there, I was that target and was constantly jumped by the management, making me extremely nervous and scared. There was no hard part about the job except that you have to keep working or you'll get behind, the job itself was very easy and very enjoyable. The most enjoyable part about working there is the co workers who make working there enjoyable. I would recommend working here if you really need a job, but won't recommend it because of the management"
good,"it was an ok work place,  lack of management. "
good,"A typical day at Walmart in produce would be you come in, stock and cull sales floor. whatever you cull, you bring to back produce room and you claims or donate it out. Then, you have to take the claims outside to compost bins. You also have to clean back room, take cardboard and trash out, and then you stock and break down pallets rest of your shift. I learned a lot about produce and how to tell when it is getting bad before it starts to rot. Management was on you, they make sure that the people in the fresh departments are always doing what they need to do, and that the sales floor is always stocked with presentable produce. The hardest part would have to be keeping up with stocking the floor when the store is busy, while doing everything else you need to do. The most enjoyable part would be helping and interacting with customers."
good,My experience working at Walmart was average it wasn't what I expected at all. I liked the job working in electronics helping and activating phones was what I like to do I met some great people there at Walmart  and the customers was fair but the only problem with the job was the Management was horrible they was not  professional .
good,"i didnt really like the job. on a typical day i would be doing three jobs all at the same time. i would be working a cashier, pushing carts, and working the customer service desk."
good,"The store has truly changed since my relatives were working with the company. I was with WalMart for 3 years, and throughout all three, I can say I lost interest more and more every year. There were some managers that took their jobs like they should with care and great understanding as how to mix life outside of work and being at work together. Others just seemed to be there for a check and could care less about their employees and their feelings. I really wouldn't recommend anyone to work at a WalMart store just off of my experience alone, but I can't say that is true about every WalMart store in the world. I recommend if that is your last option but look into it and discuss it with someone who works there ahead of trying."
good,management wasn't what i would have expected but overall not horrible place of employment
good,"On a typical day, my department (electronics) is severely understaffed. Due to the lack of employees, we (my coworkers and I) are required to basically run the entire back of the store (departments including but not limited to: stationary, photo lab, hardware/paint counter, sporting goods/ammo case). It is very stressful and very frustrating. My coworker(s) and I make the best of any situation and often times find ourselves leaning on one another for support. The management as a whole could be better. They are often unappreciative, disrespectful, and condescending. Individually, each manager is an almost completely different person and seem to be much more understanding and easy to talk to. I'd say the ""hardest"" part of the job is when you are asked to do a different thing, by a different manager, every 5 minutes. You then have to decide which task is ""more important"" or which manager you're less likely to get in trouble with if you don't complete the assignment. The problem with management is their failure to communicate with each other."
good,Typical day can be either fast paced and hectic or extremely face paced and overly tiring. Management is no help with even the simplest task or questions. You learn patience dealing with customers who favorite question is can i have a discount on that. Some coworkers work their butts off while others simply are just their for a pay check. then of course the hardest working associates are the ones that always get in trouble cause upper management feels threatened by people that get the job done.
good,"I have worked for this company for 5 years its hard to move up, its all on who you know not how hard you work."
good,I have worked for two different locations and there is nothing done differently. The employees are needed to help the company function each day but the company only takes employees for granted
good,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart I would say is a bit overwhelming and fast paced. It's always a busy environment, especially on weekends. Since working at Wal-Mart, I've learned patience, and how to multi-task. I answer and transfer phone calls, pay bills, and handle returns/exchanges during the day. Management at walmart are very unorganized and inconsistent. I'll never have the same manager as time goes by. I would say my co-workers are very friendly and I get along with everyone. The hardest part about my job is being short staffed. I get frustrated when I'm alone all day doing everything by myself. I never show my frustration. I always have a energetic work attitude and work my hardest. What I enjoy most about my job is helping customers, making customers happy, and customers with positive attitudes. It makes my day even better."
good,"I liked working in the photo lab and connection center."
good,"I Loved my position. I Worked with some great people. I enjoyed the customers, many whom returned year after year. We had a lot of ongoing safety training. Some good perks."
good,"Being a cashier was okay."
good,"Really poor in training associates"
good,"Allowed flexible work schedule so it'd accommodate my class schedule.  Never given opportunity to advance or change job.  Utterly boring job as you can imagine.  Co-workers are nice.  Management is ok, but prone to adding little annoyances to everyone's jobs and seems oblivious to the little things that need to be changed to improve workers' and customers' store experience."
good,Vey high stress job with little work life balance due to all the seasons/holidays.
good,work in general motors section and worked with fun people. sometimes over worked and supervisors played favorites with other employees. did not distribute work amount evenly.
good,Running the cash register and dealing with customers were the highlight of the job.  Always trying to help when I could.  The hardest part was trying to get people quickly through the line but also being efficient.
good,"Instead of having enough people working in the store at night, they require more out of each associate."
good,"Under staffed and poor management"
good,A typical day would be my team come in and start setting up to work on the truck. Sometimes waiting on management to open doors for us to receive the pallets needed or to let drivers in and out. The hardest part of the job was slacking co-workers and management giving us unrealistic time tables to get things done when we were short handed. I enjoyed my job when I know I helped someone with something they could not find or needed help getting.
good,"I worked there for two and a half years and with two raises and going to graveyard, I was making 9.95 an hour. The benefits are not horrible and the store has a good family feel that I really liked and will miss. But I got sick of feeling taken advantage of."
good,Management needs to improve on looking at the employees as a person and not as a number.
good,Use as a stepping stone to get to a better job. Staying here long term is really tough.
good,Open door policy was never enforced. CO-Workers were somewhat difficult because proper training was not put into place. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and building connections with customers
good,At Walmart we move mountains in a day. Our high sales volume keeps freight moving quickly and we move quickly with that. If you can't keep up this is not the place for you. You will be asked to do more than you think possible so you have to learn how to cut corners and give results. We are frequently understaffed so prepare to cover all areas of the store while maintaining your own. If you do not have open availability do not seek employment here. You will not be given hours. This is not a family friendly business. You can move up quickly but it comes at a price. You will start out at minimum wage with yearly pay increases averaging at 40cents an hour.
good,The job was fine but dealing with the management to the workers were the hardest part of me working there.
good,Back then it was not a good place to work.that was because the people in charge was not very professional they were not polite and no manners
good,Wal-Mart was a great place to work they treated me fairly.Working there and meeting new people and learning responsibility. The employees was fun to work with and the place kept me busy. if I ever need anything my supervisors was always there to help me. That basically how to explain my experience at Wal-Mart.
good,"When I started working at Walmart, I actually loved my job. As time went on, I started noticing things that didn't make it a desirable place to work. Good workers are over-worked, and poor workers are under-worked. Didn't seem like management cared about their employees or their issues.  Rules were constantly changing, and didn't really know from one week to another how it was going to be, or how they wanted things done. Disorganized. Best part of job was the people. I did  learn a lot of things from working for Walmart. I learned to use a pallet jack, walkie stacker, about inventory, how to stock freight, safety, and how to read labels. As frustrating the job was at times, I still enjoyed working at Walmart."
good,I worked for this company i was Dept Manager for produce dept i worked hard and my boss who hired me he was very happy with my work
good,"The company has change over the years, more concentrated in profit then their employees."
good,"back room stock associate.  loading and unloading merchandise."
good,It's a good job for college students but not for someone who is trying to make a living
good,but the company rules are not employ freindly. to many managers not alot of regular employs
good,"Have to meet production standards regardless of quantity of freight ."
good,"Once clocked in and one's station one would attend to costumers needs as fast and friendly as could be. Worked between three stations the kitchen, water station and deli station. The day consist of rushing in attending to costumers and keeping a clean safe environment for costumers,"
good,Their outlook on safety is not right and their treatment towards their workers is very iffy.
good,Not bad but I have worked in better situations.  No room for advancement. Some benefits are good such as top notch eye insurance etc.  Work all weeknends and most afternoons and evenings.  Does'nt promote family life very well.
good,"I was  a department manager for 5 departments(small).I I was to display and re arrange my area each time the orders came down for change, I daily changed prices  up and down, I kept my area clean  of trash and misplaced items, I ran a register,I did promotional announcements and helped others to do their work when I could."
good,The overnight shift proved difficult on my social life but I was able to go to school in the morning after I got off so that worked well.
good,"I worked as a cashier, assisting  customers with purchasing their  items whether it was in the customer service, the money center, or the lay-a-way department."
good,ok place to work. works around my schedule. people are nice to work witj
good,get an area to work and stocked. new ways how different each company is. most management were good but few were not very understanding
good,"I quit my job at Wal-mart because there was lack of open mindedness. As well as a rough ridge of certain management. The management seems to think they're better than certain people and don't really listen. They make up situations and lie. Cause unnecessary drama. Issues. "
good,"Constant schedule changes after posted."
good,"Being a sales associate at walmart was both rewarding and taxing. I dont mind the hard work or the clientele, what I did not like was the lack of care from management. Felt no reason to move up, not that there was much ""moving up"""
good,The job is steady and always on your feet. Co workers are lazy and don't help. Management pulls you to many different areas to help others. 7 years with refusal of weekends off.
good,"I didn't mind working for them, it is dead end but pays the bills. its very stressful at times and a lot is asked of you for little pay. good job for highschool student. enough said...."
good,"At my job site at walmart, Sioux Falls, SD there is entertainment for employees. It is only work and work and work."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. The job is demanding, but not too difficult. You understand exactly what your job requires and expects of you. They grant appropriate break times, and are usually flexible about requests about work hours."
good,"Its was very strict only 3 call ins per six months. No overtime ever, I would have to close the deli four days a week by myself. No employee appreciation. Great pay need more hands on training."
good,"After working for this company for 2 years I was fed up. The management is never on the same page and at one word from a customer your opinion doesn't matter. The management never takes the associates side and the workers are sometimes even coached for customers false lies. "
good,Empresa tranquila boa de trabalhar e aprender novas profissões
good,"Good place to work, Team oriented , fast pace and you are fully equipped with all the necessary training to stay  competitive in the retail sales."
good,Overall job was very good to work except poor management. Management did not assure their good communicaton skills or open door policy.
good,"I worked there as a cashier and a service desk associate. Many times I was told that I was going to be moved to a dept manager, then it was take the time off to concentrate on school and when I reapplied, they said they wouldn't hire me back because my last name had changed. Which it has been the same last name for the last 18 moths that I had been working there. I didn't understand that, but then I guess its really not a company that I want to work for."
good,"Come into work at 10pm 5 days a week start my shift by checking my myguide task then going outside and grabbing 4-7 baskets to break down my work in the aisles i would be doing the work in go grab gemini hand scanner then go see how many pallets i would have to do that night usually 5 to 7 pallets of work. I would try to finish at least 1 and half pallets before our first break which was at 12am. I would come back from break try to finish at least 2 pallets before lunch break which was at 2 am work hard to finish, then I would go to lunch break. Come back and try to do at least 1 and a half to 2 pallets before my next break which was at 5 am by then if i have 1 pallet left or none i would zone my aisle put go back items in baskets empty my card board into the bailer and put the baskets back before 6am when the store is about to open after that I would keep zoning my asile until it is time to clock out and go home."
good,"I had worked for Wal-Mart on a part-time basis from September 2007 to April 2008 in the electronics, Connections, and photo lab departments.  The pay was better than I anticipated, considering what I have always heard about Wal-Mart.  However, the overall culture of the company is as bad as people say, and maybe worse."
good,it was everyone for themselves and drama no one wanted to help anyone and people didn't do there jobs maintenance did more then there job description
good,was a nice place to work went in from 2 in the afternoon till 1 at night
good,it was a fun work place at 1st but then they had me doing to much work for one person to do.
good,"I will miss the associates I worked with. I learned a lot about working in the retail industry while I was there. Management wasn't that great, they never gave us the help we needed, always short staffed. The hardest part of the job was always being short staffed and not being able to get my work completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing excellent customer service and making the customers happy!"
good,"Low pay, inconsistent schedule, inconsistent shifts, plenty to do, nice hour lunch."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart. We had a wonderful overnight crew with the exception of the management. I learned how to stock in a retail store and how to use the cash registers.
good,"some people get hired on as ""full-time""- 40hrs. a wk but then will only be scheduled 32hrs a wk. then at times you would have ""part-time"" associates that only want the minimum hrs. to work and management will want to schedule them at 32 + hrs a wk.  Stressful place to work because there is favoritism at the location I work at, if you weren't the ""flavor of the wk"" forget about it.  management when I was there was alright, but I understand that things have gone south and struggle to maintain any type of consistency much less communication about time off for associates or things that have been discussed and decided with other members of management."
good,"On any typical workday, I could count on varied and challenging task to fill my day.  I found many of my co-workers to be helpful and informative in regards to the varies duties assigned to me.  The hardest part of my day was meeting the time constraints imposed by management in contrast the the task assigned.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and my co-workers."
good,"I loved working at Walmart because of all the different people it allowed me to interact with. However, in my experience Walmart doesn't want to help promote within their store."
good,"Various duties on a daily basis"
good,"Wal-Mart as a company was a good place to work for, but the management team in the particular location I was working were some of the hardest people to deal with. In my opinion it seemed like they lost all their humanity. They did not care about their associates and their everyday life. I understood that it was a business and things need to  run smoothly but all in the same I have been managing almost every place I have been employed and I know if you take care of your people they will take care of you and I did not receive that being employed at Wal-Mart."
good,OK job. Employees are ok. Management varied from supervisor to supervisor. Good experience but would definitely not a job to make a career out of.
good,"lots of work"
good,crazy schedule not enough time with family not a good place to grow and im in management a lot of responsibility and little pay
good,"good place to work good schedule, they work with you. customers are great. coworkers are a team"
good,"Difficult to advance, and a lot of drama between co workers. Not bad but not really great either."
good,"Hard day."
good,I worked as an hourly supervisor for Walmart for over 6 years and really loved the entire experience when Walmart was still a smaller company and was more focused on the customers. Now as Walmart has grown it seems as if the only focus of the entire company is to make money. There is no longer any feeling of appreciation for it's employees or customers. The best part of the job was the co-workers and the customers. We all did everything we could to bring a smile to each others faces and a great overall experience to the day. The hardest part was trying to follow the direction of management that didn't really have an idea of what directions to give. I learned that I am  meant to be with a company that is going to encourage me to strive to make the customer truly happy because that is when I always go home with a smile and wake up with that same smile to begin the next day.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace work environment of the job. I learned you  have to create your own system to get the job done. Team work is a must when working on a line. Management can give you good tips on how to do your job more efficiently if you ask. The way you treat your coworkers is the way they will treat you. The hardest part of the job is making sure you don't spend to much time on one thing. The most enjoyable part of the job is meetings every day attended before you go out on the floor to go to work. Company parties around the holidays.
good,At work there where up days and down days. The management was fairly younger people and not very organized. At time they would display leadership and sometimes they would seemed unsure about certain important decisions. My co worker where okay I would say great. My job was not hard anything i was asked to do I learned fast and excelled at every task given.
good,"I liked working here, the people were very friendly, it was only temp work but it did get me in shape."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart can either be pretty amazing, like it was for me (on most days) or pretty terrible. I've heard of numerous horror stories about this company. As a ""sales associate,"" however, working for Wal-Mart was so easy, that I could have done it in my sleep. Seriously. All I had to do was to make sure every item when on the shelf.. in it's correct spot while answering about a million customer questions at once."
good,"not bad place for your first job"
good,A typical day/night at work is fast-paced. I learn that are different ways to do stuff to make it easier to get your work done faster. Management is ok. There are some that couple be a little better at what they are supposed to do. Coworkers are amazing. They make you feel right at home. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done quickly. The best part is all the different conversations all of the coworkers have.
good,There seems to be a disconnect between corporate and the local level. Sales and service could be greatly increased as well as a decrease in loss with a few minor changes. Suggestions made
good,Full of customer service co-workers are great I enjoy the customers
good,"Not a Good place to work for. I have been treated really badly from the management, The customers like to steal alot of the products."
good,"i love my job to help others, but feel it deserves a higher pay and my hours fluctuate too much. sometimes i get close to 40 hours and sometimes i get 20.  also, management doesn't always back you up and support you when needed."
good,"Overall, i worked there for the time of Christmas to help out, when I was there, i was working as an assembly. So all i had to do was build bikes and displays, which most of the time i would get done with my job and end up with nothing to do from time to time."
good,"A typical day would involve being around customer throughout your whole work shift. Cash handling in the money department of the store. The most enjoyed part of the job was mainly the customer interaction depending on the mood of the customer/ overall satisfaction of their service. I also enjoyed working with such friendly and caring co workers they always cared about the mood of whomever they are working with. While working at Wal-Mart, in the time I was there I learned a lot as far as store operation, inventory receiving, Money Center; which involved cashing checks, internationally/local wire money, and other cash handling services. Also learned returns and exchanges, customer service department."
good,A typical day at walmart consist of working hard everyday all day by ensuring that the store is always ready and presentable for the consumers that come and shop at our store. from the store mananger all the way down to the associates we ensure that all the consumers that come and shop at our store have the best experience ever by answering any questions that they may have or assist them with getting things down from the upper shelves and lastly making sure that the product that they are looking for is always in stock.
good,"The company isn't that bad, just the store I worked in. spent seven years in the comapny and 4 of them with the store I was last in. Never once was I ever concidered for other positions, no matter how many times I applied for them. I was never respected for my abilities or hard work. I left the company due to the death of my mother and I am caring for my widowed father and helping with his issues. I would work for walmart again, just not in the store I was in. The job itself was very demanding, but kept me in work shape, I loved all my fellow co-workers no matter if they had any issues with me or not. I learned how to stock, merchindise and assist customers in anyway I could. I was trianed on power lifting equipment, but not a forklift."
good,Walmart was at once a good company to work for but over the years there has been a decline in how they treat their employees and its show to the customers.
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me was coming in at 10 pm and getting on the cash register for 2 hours then heading to clean/sort thru customer service."
good,"When I First started I was excited because I had heard so many great things about working there and soon as I got hired I found out it wasn't, they made you do your work and other jobs that was not in your job description and when you asked for a rise in pay to do two or three different jobs in one day they would say no. the workers was great we help each other through the day but other a period of time the work became frustrating and annoying and it made me not want to come in some days, you couldn't call out from work and not be penalized for it if you had a reason you couldn't bring in doctors notes or files stating you was sick or in the emergency room they did not accept them or want to see them. overall the pay for the amount of work and frustration did not match even a little bit and benefits was poor."
good,A typical day at work will consist of processing transactions and dealing with customers complaining to you about their experience shopping there and how unsatisfied they are.
good,"The management of Wal-mart for the most part... should not be managers. They are poorly trained, and have very poor employee relations. They don't care anything about the employee, and will not under any circumstance defend their number one customer. And because of this attitude, and because they generally treat the staff badly, leads to poor performance from the floor staff as well as poor customer service. This in turn leads to very high turn out rate for staff."
good,Jobs are always available but the pay is low and the work is not equal.  Some stores run less like a corporation leading to management favoritism and overall lack of dependability.  Almost every job below management is part-time.
good,It was a valuable life lesson for me. I definitely think that Walmart is a good opportunity and job for the masses just trying to get by.
good,"I would not suggest this particular job to somebody who is supporting a family. Scheduling and hours are all over the place. You may never have the same days off, or sometimes you might close, usually until ten or eleven o'clock at night, and may have to be back at work at, say, ten or eleven the next morning. Sometimes, earlier than that. Hard work and determination largely goes unnoticed. You do, however, get raises every year. And after your first year, you can opt to purchase stock in the company."
good,"Management members were rude, and inconciderate. The pay was decent."
good,"Management isn't that great. Pay is horrible barely above minimum wage for some jobs that are getting paid double else where. Although, easy to become employeed and most jobs are easy."
good,A typical day at work is moderately busy and fast pace. I learned more about customer service while i have been there. The management team is reliable. I get along with all of my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is staying focused when it gets very busy and you have to deal with agitated customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that im always meeting new people and talking to new people.
good,working at Walmart was a good place to start to gain experience in customer service. the people there were good. management was usually never there to help but when they are they will help you when they can.
good,I would write service orders. help check out customers. i would also help them decide on the services they needed. I would run keys out to the shop. sometime when i was outside service writting i would pull in cars and line them in order in which they need to be done. i would call management if need for a customer or if something needed to be unlocked
good,It was a little negative there and people was mostly for there self and they didn't respect there wokers
good,"The employment, job benefits, and work was alright and a typical job for a young teenager."
good,"My typical days at walmart consisted of folding and organizing  clothes,stocking tables and shelves, put clothes where they belonged, and answered the phones when needed to. Management was not the best. They are suppose to be a leader showing you what they want but at walmart they lacked that they never showed us leadership. What i disliked was that they wanted us to follow their rules which was not a big deal it was the whole fact of the management would break the rules that they wanted from their staff and mostly do it in front of staff. Hardest part of the job is to do what the managers wanted because they would tell you one thing and then turn around and change what they wanted. enjoyable part was getting  to meet others from different departments at lunches and or breaks."
good,Typical day at work includes running the register and stocking and restocking shelves and keeping the work area clean
good,I was in high school when I worked at wal mart and I really enjoyed my job. I loved the customers and employees. My only issue was the hours I had to work during school.
good,"A typical day at work was quite boring but I would never the boredom stop me in my tracks. I was usually the daily cart attendant unless if my boss need me for something else."
good,Working for Walmart I received a lot of opportunity and learned alot from them.  When I first started for Walmart in 1988 it was a great company to work for.  The past few years Walmart has become more political and less about there employees.  I am a people person and that is one of the biggest things that attracted me to moving up within Walmart.
good,"alot of work underpaid, managers talk to you like kids, store has morale issues. no room for advancement managers write you up to keep you from transferring and getting promoted"
good,load trucks with pallets of scrap metal shelves and counters move tear down and rebuild counters shelving units and restocking shelves and counters.
good,"Siempre te exigen, te exigen y nunca te apoyan a ti, a ellos les importas poco y nunca te dan recompensas"
good,"Every day at work I try and help people out as much as possible and give patients advice on medicine,Some days I am the only cashier theres lack of team work in the pharmacy so basically I work alone and still get every thing done,I love working under pressure and staying busy.Theres not much hard things about my job other then doing will call and hoping everything gets done by the end of the night.I learn new skills everyday on the job.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help my customers and co workers and just making my customers better and being there for them when they need help.Im a people person and love being around peopl"
good,I learned that they like to rush the backroom associate's to eat their job done which is sometimes is impossible without breaking merchandise. They also makes changes without informing the workers that it will effect and it makes the job harder.
good,This is fast-paced environment that changes quickly. Adapting to the changes are exciting and challenging. You must make sound decisions to ensure task completion and customer satisfaction. I brought into the workplace a philosophy of lean manufacturing that worked well with some of the processes and made a positive change in the retail environment.
good,"Walmart was a descent place to work, but disciplinary action against those who were doing wrong was never taken. Harassment is not taken seriously and a lot of gossip between employees and management."
good,"Es un trabajo muy pesado.Con un sueldo muy bajo. Es conveniente cuando estas estudiando.Aprendes a tratar y hablar al cliente.La gerencia es buena hay lideres reales hay desarrollo pero es muy bajo el sueldo. Lo mas dificil lograr las metas con las pocas herramientas que te dan,  lo que mas me gusto que los empleados te tratan como  familia ."
good,assist  customers with purchases and  any other   duties  as  assigned
good,"Walmart has good opportunities, but their work ethics isn't for everyone. Corporate cut hours to the bone, but expects a full shift of work to be done in a timely manner. With the work the company places on their employees, they need to up the money. "
good,I loved the drs I worked although some of the management through walmart wasn't the greatest.
good,I was a cashier.  I enjoyed the work and meeting lots of people.
good,"A typical workday at Walmart was always the same.  You get there, unload merchandise, take trash to the back, then you try and find something to do until a customer needs you.  I learned a lot about working with lawn and garden tools, and about working with other people in different areas of the world.  My co-workers were pretty great.  They were there to help when I would need it, and they made sure that you were taken care of.  The hardest part of my job was having to learn new ways of doing things in other ways that may be more efficient.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with a lot of different people."
good,"To begin, I was hired on for a season position at the largest Walmart on this side of the state of Michigan.  "
good,"Working for this store was extremely stressful. The store manager at the time was very unpleasant to almost everyone. Associates and managers rarely worked together cohesively to achieve a common goal; people spent more time being cut-throat in order to advance themselves instead of helping each other. I worked extremely long hours and even worked on my days off because I was on salary. "
good,Walmart is not really one of the company's that a person can grow with if you do not have any type of college degree's.
good,the management are unaware of problems within the work environment and are unwilling to take steps to fix the issue the proper way
good,"i like working for walmart , you dont always get the best fedd back from managers but is ok for a temp job . striving towards better opportunites"
good,"The job entailed traveling to seven walmarts and scan 302 items in supercenters.  You were given 4 hours to do this, and that made it hard because different set up in every store.  I, traveled miami to pompano beach all week."
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering calls from customers, finding out the problem, then solving the issue."
good,"I enjoy giving superior customer service so I love the job. I just wish it paid more, and the benefits take a while."
good,"A typical day at work would include providing customers with excellent customer service, and ensuring they get everything they want and need. I learned that the customer is always right. Management did not treat their employees very well, they were very ungrateful. Co-workers were very nice to work with and worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the schedule 3pm to 12am..not  a good schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on the customer's face."
good,its generally an interesting place to work at. I work overnights so not bothered by customers is good too.
good,Wal-Mart could be a better place to work if they offered more in pay and benefits for all employees
good,"Pues llegar acomodar la bodega limpiar para empezar a bajar el camion."
good,"realizar recorridos , checar equipo de tarbajo , , revisar bitacoras para mantenimiento a maquinas"
good,"Easy work just frustrating task."
good,I was a supervisor of a 15 man crew who hand unloaded the trucks and stacked product on pallets. Then we would pull the product to the sales floor and stock the product.
good,"Not enough benefits and not enough job security, long hours and little pay."
good,I held the title as a cashier but I worked other positions that paid higher but I did not receive the pay. This job is not for someone who wants advancement.
good,That large companies don't always look out for their employees.
good,being a cashier at walmart you are always busy. They never have enough cashiers so they put a lot of work on you.
good,Workplace alright with flexible availabilities and plenty of ob security. Management borders on insanity.
good,"The people, my co-workers, were great people to work with but the place as a whole wasn't. I had to do strenuous work and for the pay rate wasn't worth it at all. We could play music to help use keep up leaving use bored while we were trying to reach crazy goals. It was always crowded especially since we kept getting more products. it wasn't enjoyable at all. If you absolutely cant get a job then try it, but if you can explore those options."
good,"o gerenciamento muito a desejar. mas trabalhar nela foi uma escola,que nos faz se sentir preparado para qualquer outra empresa."
good,They tried to work with me about my schedule. You can always get promotions.
good,"Coming in at 8pm starting with a walk through. After this i will go to the managers office,talking to my supervisor getting the reviews from the store manager about the pros and cons of the entire grocery side and paper goods and chemicals....Then I go to the floor by this time my first truck is in, I unload it  and get it to the floor before the employees clock in. All the rest of the morning I walk around and supervise the employees but at the same time I'm doing my list of duties I have to do also while overseeing others..But I learned a lot more about being more patient with others.The co workers were ok for the most part. The hardest part of it is getting everything done on time before the store manager walks through the store."
good,I'm not so sure if this works with most other Walmarts around but the one i worked wasn't very bad most days. The thing about mine was how I was treated based on what shift I was on. Another was how most managers were very lazy. I was forced to stay over on several occasions to get something done that a manager couldnt finish.
good,Wasn't that good of a job. management was too inadequate and would mistreat the workers.
good,"Every day was different and the store worked as a team to complete daily projects led by the assistant managers. A typical day at worked included several area and store meetings as well as follow up area walks and plans for the following day. Reviews and research on paperwork in claims, accounting, and upc as well as management paperwork reviewed daily. The hardest part of the job was the management schedule and routine. The best part of the job was the ability at that level of management  to help customers and associates with any issues or needs as a team and work together to form outcomes."
good,senior management create a hostile work place to prevent growth
good,A typical day at work would be to greet the associates that you supervise in the workplace and others.  I will receive my notes from management at about 11 am to finish by 4 o'clock.  The hardest part of the job is to finish 100 or less notes with no help by the time I leave for the day.
good,What I really liked about wal mart was the fact it was always busy time went by fast and it was always something to do. I can honestly say it was a fun enviroment I met new people everyday and also enjoyed seeing my regulars. The hardest part about the job was accepting the pay when you worked harder.
good,"a day working @ the old Wal-Mart was very busy, and sometimes challenging in the photo lab with short staffing, and troubleshooting but fun. I learned customer service and patience. Management was pretty helpful. My co workers were awesome. Hardest part of the job was troubleshooting computer issues while being short of help. I realy enjoyed helping people."
good,"A typical day at work is the usual.  We start work at 10pm, go to our morning meeting, waste time going over info that very little affects us. Go to our assigned departments and have more hrs of work than it is possible to complete in an 8hr shift.  Despite doing things that are within their job purview, management continuously hounds most associates asking why aren't you done yet, etc. etc. Most of my co-workers aren't to bad, it is just the ones that have been at the company for some time that feel like they are entitled when they are just as plain jane as the rest of us."
good,heavy and fast paced work. co- workers are nice.  all in all not a bad place to work. need some improvements.
good,"I opened customer service in the morning, Counted my drawer. helped customers with returns and doing Money Gram. At the end of shift. counted out drawer...."
good,"It was an ""ok"" place to work. The fellow employees were very helpful and patient to the new guy . I learned alot with training with my fellow employees,versus the computer test or upper management. "
good,"Selling merchandise was a big part in my day, i learned costumer service skills and simply how to communicate with associates."
good,Good place to get your feet wet when starting a job for the first time. A lot of learning and fast paced.
good,I enjoy the fellow colleagues that I work with at Wal-Mart very much. They make the job entertaining & keep you going..
good,i work for the people who shop @ walmart.and that part of my job i look forward to.yet as employee i am only part-time and i wish to find full time employment helping and serving others.
good,"Wasn't too hard of a job, co-workers were fun. Management was alright. Walmart gives a lot of hours to work."
good,First job i ever had. Could of been worse. The manager i had at the time was sloppy and lazy.
good,A great place to work with great people always willing to help.
good,"A typical day at work extremely busy. Love being productive. "
good,The job was easy the people were very nice but the hours were not very good
good,"Standing in the same spot for 8 hours is terrible. "
good,The work day normally starts fast-pace which is great because its always task that need to be completed. Customers arrive to get their  vehicles serviced and I compute the information into the computer to print out the invoice. Retail demands a lot of customer interaction but I enjoyed helping other people. Management and associates are constantly changing which may be a good and bad thing.
good,"Overall , great "" stepping stone"" job. You will learn to deal with different types of customers and difficult situations. 8 hours shifts included , 2 hours then a 15 minute break. 1.5 hours then and hour lunch, 2 more hours another 15 minute break and your shift might be over."
good,In all the jobs i did for this company they felt i was not fast enough to fill there ideas
good,"This job was just another day at work, they did not work with my hours for college so I had to quit.. I was very disappointed."
good,The coworkers there were GREAT to work with.  Upper management was not so great.  They will tell you that they are going to do something but not follow through with what you were told that they were going to do.  If you do work here keep track of your hours because I was shorted out of MOST of the overtime hours that I worked during the holidays.
good,"Wal-Mart is a very big company, and all big companies are the same in many respects. You are easily replaced."
good,"The management at Wal-Mart were demanding in availability. Also, they made it 'mandatory' to show up for work in the winter, regardless of where employees lived and might not have been able to get out due to severe snow weather. I felt attendance in such weather should be on an individual basis, as geographic's vary widely from person to person."
good,Walmart was not a very good workplace. Although it is fast-paced and there is always something to do; it is also not challenging and treatment is poor.
good,Coworkers were great to work with.  Enjoyed working with the customers.  I am afraid to say the most if not all the rumors about how Walmart treats their  employees are true.  Benefits are not great and cost to much out of paycheck.
good,"Too many employees working at one time in the pharmacy, too crowded and loud. I learned to be calm in hectic and stressful situations."
good,"Sometimes a typical day requires maximum effort to accomplish assigned tasks. Other days if you finish, you are sent to another department to help someone not able to finish, all dependent on scheduled incoming freight that varies seasonally especially during Christmas season.  Time management is essential to complete expected work duties.  Management often changes so it's difficult to judge their view of your job performance. Co-workers are often helpful when you are new with some exceptions that just let you struggle along.  Hardest part is learning the duties as they often change daily.  Most enjoyable part is satisfaction of doing job well."
good,"the coworkers are generally nice and easy to get along with. management tries to help as much as they can. one manager in particular was well known for not liking anyone and giving everyone a hard time. i was required to have a perfect zone(put away reshops, clean trash bins and conveyor belts, pull everything forward on the shelves, etc.) and my coworkers would say that the zone was the best they had seen but the manager would say that i didnt zone. that is just one example. but she was the only bad seed among the rest of the managers."
good,"there was a feeling of community, teamwork, managers weren't afraid to pitch in."
good,"The job was okay. Easy money if you like to work with people. The store manager was pretty nice, so were some of the ZMS.."
good,"Worked as a cashier, when things were slow they would make cashiers push in the carts from the parking lot, not much can be said."
good,"Low pay , mistreated by admin managers, rarely recognized , co-worker where wonderful & I loved most of my daily work duties & customers , I miss it , just not the  pay. plus I didn't receive my second year raise. the manager laugh at me for thinking I would get one bc of work related injury I was gone surgery leave for 2 months. there was a lot of misfortunes but I did love working independently in my department & always ALWAYS having something to do ."
good,walmart helped me to grow as a person. it taught me that patience will always be the main source to whatever you want in life. it also taught me that it doesn't take much to make someone else's day!
good,"A day at Walmart can be stressful at times. You have to meet the needs of not only the managers but also customers. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with customers who show no respect to you but just having to keep a smile on your face and stay positive by knowing that the next person in line is always a different person. There is also a lot of ups to working in retail. There are some people that put a lot of things in perspective about my life. The customers that support the cashiers make us feel as though they understand, and good can come out of a bad situation."
good,I felt invisible working for such a large company. I feel that not enough importance was placed on the employees and their needs.
good,"a typical day consists of, stocking the front cooler for guest, mixing icings, icing cakes and cupcakes."
good,"Very hard to keep a job"
good,"I learned a lot about retail and cashier responsibilities"
good,I hated working here. Nothing was good about the experience except a few coworkers that I became friends with.
good,"Daily tasks consist of preparing the work area for the stock, and filling the shelves and a neat and timely manner. I enjoy the people I work with and get along with just about everyone. In my opinion the management time is not effective in their task and duties. They lack communication with other management and other sales associates."
good,I would help in the daily set up of the deli I would deal with many different customers. I took orders and people would show up late for their orders and have an issue with it and I would help make it better and make everything good again for them to take the order.
good,Not a terrible place to work. Good start job for a high school student learning responsibility.
good,"did not like the overnight hours, management were very hateful and rude, they didn't promote customer service at all. they made us go out in all weather conditions to bring in shoping carts"
good,there benefits are no good and they don't treat their employees right
good,Cashier at Sam's Club and then transferred to the Meat room as a stocker for Walmart.
good,"a typical day at walmart, is meeting and greeting different  people and making them feel good so they can come back again and shop. some of the management are not friendly and don't appreciate the employees. Some time they seldom speak and they walk right past you. the co-workers are very nice and helpful. There is nothing hard about the job, the best part is seeing and meeting new people."
good,"ok for part time employment, nice benefits discounts, and bonuses are quarterly, constant conflict in schedule and hours shifts"
good,Gained tons of knowledge about electronic items. Customers were always pleased with my service.
good,horrible the people are unfriendly the management do not know how to run there business some co-workers are friendly the hardest part of the job was dealing with the unkind people i did not enjoy being there
good,A typical day at work would be very hectic and busy. I learned how to deal with different customer situations. Management was very friendly and understanding and helped me whenever I needed their help. Co-workers were very easy to get along with. Everyone there got along with one another very well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate and rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a lot of people that I knew and meeting new people.
good,"Managers in Wal-Mart pick favorites, reguardless of how hard you work. The conditions are not the best either."
good,No comment at this time. I may share more during a job interview.
good,I really enjoyed working there and the people you were able to meet.  I have kept their friend ship. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for eight hours a day.
good,"A typical day starts with noticing what is already wrong with your work station and knowing that this is going to be a problem everyday, the amount of angry customers you must deal with on a day to day can be a bit much for some people. Your co-workers are usually in the same boat as you so they are easy to get along with."
good,"It's a good job to keep you afloat and pay your bills, but not always the best job for advancement. It takes a long while to advance in the company. Not all management is nice, but that's with every job. The company is like most others, in that some aspects don't line up the way expected, but overall a good company. I give it 3 stars only because I'm looking for a steady job that allows more time with my family, and one that accepts doctor's notes in case I'm sick or have to have surgery, etc."
good,"good place to start as a teen, but not a career choice. very demanding retailer so could get lots of overtime"
good,"I was a cashier. I dealt with payments from customers, I was also a sales associate. I helped customers with questions regarding certain products on the sales floor."
good,Cashing out customers. Learned customer service goes a long way. Management wasn't the best but i lived. Co workers were awesome for the most part. hardest thing is that it was third shift. Enjoyed that there were customers that really would grow on you.
good,Very fast paced fun place to work.  Great associates to work with.
good,"Great place to gain customer service skills, very friendly coworkers, management had flexibility with scheduling although slow with productivity. My experience was that the management wasn't stable."
good,"a typical day at work - boring"
good,"store. then go home. Learned how to do cashiering, stocking. Co workers were good, did not really interact too much when working. Hardest part of the job would be having to be in departments you didn't understand to much. the most enjoyable would be the fast pace."
good,I enjoyed remodeling more than working in the store. There were way to many managers that only wanted you to do what that manager said. The co-workers were very rude and did not want to work. The hardest part of the job was doing everything that others were supposed to do.
good,"*cashier, worked with money, price adjustment, and customer service."
good,"*Wal-Mart is a busy, bustling place so there's always work to be done. I liked that aspect of it. "
good,I Never Will Go Back There And Work If It Was The Last Job Standing.
good,I don't really know what you want me to say about Wal-mart. It is a grocery store. I stocked water there.
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, porem não é o meu perfil."
good,Demands of department managers were not reasonable for the pay given.
good,I worked there for almost a year. they over work you and they don't pay enough for all the work they have you do.
good,I start the day by cleaning and organizing over 5 department with very little or no help.  I'm always on top of customer service.  Bosses don't treat you with respect or allow you to advance in the company.
good,"Everyday I was expected to do everything, if I didnt the store would fail. I often caught myself doing the work of 4 people."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is interacting each and everyday with customers. A bright smile and great attitude can brightens someone's day. The hardest part of this job is trying to balance the hours and trying to have a life outside of the workplace. The vast majority of my co-workers are fun to work with; they keep my day going. The management there is not all that great. They show little compassion for their employees. They are sometimes quite rude and unconcerned about certain matters. The lessons I have learned from Wal-Mart are to be courteous to everyone you meet and greet and always smile.
good,"very flexible with hours, however if you need time off, its a pain."
good,ok place to work if your a college student. not much room for advancement.
good,"Come in and get chewed out for the night before in an evening meeting. Get assigned to what you are to be doing that night. Get carts for trash, down stack freight, unload truck if it was not already done. Not to work here again. Needs a lot of improvement in their management and communication. Co-workers were enjoyable to work with. Everything in the building, but mostly supposed allowed time for freight and the amount of stress is the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part would have to be no need for a gym, you will lose weight and that they cook Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner for the staff."
good,Instructions were easy to follow. I enjoyed my job overall. I learned a lot about the workforce from working at WalMart
good,"A typical day at work would consist of performing warehouse duties, providing a safe work environment and excellent customer service. I had a decent management team & excellent coworkers. The hardest part of the my job was during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people you interact with."
good,"I believe the company is a great company but, at the time I was employed I believe the company was gong through some difficulties."
good,Although I performed to the best of my ability I quit because I was not overly please with the job security (reduction in hours) I received. I was never really sure who my supervisor was while working there.
good,Hung and sorted clothing. Cashier and customer support. Love the team work between co-workers and supervisors
good,Could have paid more. Parttime did not receive benafits. I liked working here.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships and interactions with the patients.  I worked with the same department manager during my employment but the corporate market management changed.   Necessary training of new support staff.
good,"Associates I worked with were like family.  On holidays Wal-Mart would provide great free dinners and also treats during the week if we were accident free or had done just a great job that week.  "
good,"Lidar com clientes é uma tarefa difícil, você se desdobra para poder atende-lo da melhor forma e nem sempre consegue agradar."
good,"some days were busy where u could only take a 15 minute break.I learned the retail and inventory and general matinence of cars,co-workers some were great are some not so great. Hardest part of the job there wasen't really any.The quarterly bonuses"
good,"I worked hard for the company and promoted quickly.  However, for the most part what you read about working for this company is true."
good,"A typical day for me would be inventorying stock, assisting customers and associates, stocking shelves, ordering freight, doing price changes and setting mods."
good,"A typical day at work was going in and getting on a register and making sure every customer leaves satisfied and are wanting to come back again. I learned money handling skills, more customer service skills and how to use the money gram system. My co-workers were good to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that just come in already in a bad mood and are in a hurry."
good,they are good people to work for but the management is not all that good they could do a whole lot better and then more people would stay and work there alot longer
good,the most enjoyable part of working for Walmart was the informal relationship I developed with co-workers.
good,"I start my day at work gathering the carts I will need determined how much freight we have to downstack. Second, I stock the freight and do the picks that are required to do before 3 in the morning. Lastly, after running freight we bin the excess merchandise into bins and zone our departments. I learn about always being on my toes, especially when the holidays are coming up and/or when people call off to get the job done. My co-workers can be extremely immature and about drama, the selective few are about teamwork. The hardest part of the job is doing ""extra"" when another co-worker refuses to do it or when all shifts can't work together. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am good at what I do, and have impressed many managers."
good,"High turnover was disappointing, with associates and management alike. Made getting comfortable with your surroundings and job more difficult. Communication between the managers was always distorted, making management communication with associates very confusing. Associates are often faced with the tough decision of who to follow orders from when one leader gives orders to do a task and then another gives orders to override previous orders. It becomes discouraging as well when you are confronted by one leader or another for doing exactly as you are told. While muti-tasking is great way to challenge yourself and keep things moving, physically being in two places at one time is scientifically impossible."
good,"I have done everything from baking the bread, to making the donuts, to stocking, to packaging of everything  mark downs to donations to ordering and inventory I have my serve safe for colorado."
good,liked work. no benefits good co workers hardest standing in same spot for 6-8 hous
good,"Though Wal-mart is not a bad place to shop at, working there is another story. However, this also depends on the store that you work. Mine has managers that don't do their job, less than adequate working conditions and high levels of favoritism."
good,"When I started working at Wal-Mart, the store was brand new and everyone seemed to enjoy working their. After a few months, that euphoric feeling wore off as customers were not coming in as much, management was not very good at communicating projects and jobs to associates, and hours got cut for mostly everyone. I worked in the produce department and although that was your primary function, they make you cross train with all surrounding departments, which allow you to learn new things. The people you work with were either very good at what they do, or was just plain lazy. The only part I enjoyed about my job was when I worked the evening shift by myself so I was allowed to work and get everything done like I wanted."
good,I was able to learn better time management and the ability to multitask very well.
good,"Meu primeiro emprego onde entrei como embaladora e depois fui promovida como caixa, aprendi o trabalho em equipe pois na época não exitia qualidade de vida."
good,"U just a number in that place. It don' matter how much You know,  but who U know if U are managers pet You got it made."
good,I do like my job but Im no longer work there anymore ... The most enjoyed is doing the Mod teams for All Registers / candy aisle which I do Enjoyed the most ... we all learn the best on the registers ..managements was good .. I work overnite shifts for 17 months and I kinda of miss everyone but it time for me to find a better rates of jobs
good,"My head department managers didn't teach me the things I needed to know to do my job during training. I had no idea I was missing things, information or didn't do the tasks I was ""assigned"" because no one informed me. I would be scheduled to work yet no one wrote in my Myguide so I wasn't aware what I was suppose to work on. Sometimes my department managers weren't even there and the other managers didn't even know I was working. I had to learn how to work the label maker and scanner from co workers because I was never trained to work them from my managers."
good,Majority of co workers were very helpful. Was told it was family friendly but did not allow time off when needed.
good,This was a terrible place to work. management was terrible .  I knew one manager that was stealing every day and was just an all out rude person wal mart was a terrible place to work.
good,"i worked in apparel so i would clock in and go to the womens department(my area) put away new merchandise, return unwanted merchandise. i would keep an eye on the jewelry counter if nobody was scheduled or on break."
good,i was really good at my job i wouldwant to work as a cashier again
good,During the time I worked here I was paid slightly above minimum wage for being in a Specialist position. The medical benefits were not worth getting and the raises were minimal (about $0.10 to $0.25 a year).
good,Management needs to work on their communication skills and have better training in treating employees with respect.
good,"it was ok to work there I guess, even the overnight crew wasn't really treated fairly but among us co-worker we make it fun."
good,"I worked  in the electronics department. I typically showed and sold TVs, phones, videos games and many other electronics. I had to explain the electronic devices to customers. One guy said to me one time, ""to many chiefs and not enough Indians."" That explains the management. You can have four managers telling you to do five different things cause they don't how to do it and their is no one else around. The hardest part of the job was being overwhelmed with customers and no one helping you. Some people can be very unreasonable. However, sometimes I liked it helped someone out."
good,I worked in many departments but mainly did Customer Service work.
good,I worked with great people. we all kinda clicked instantly. I really enjoyed working there.
good,store manager was not very good or friendly. Like being friendly with all here employees
good,I was a cashier and I did my job well. I would do my job and then try to help others. I quit after a was called a little b-word by the manager above me and then I quit that night. I learned from this job that not all people are nice to their employees.
good,"Start at 5 am prepping, preparing and stocking our pre made food cases. Pulling all of the expired food from shelves and marking them out of the system to ensure inventory was current. I have gained a great deal of knowledge on how to run both a bakery and deli. My co-workers ((well some in particular)) make it very difficult to get through a day. This could be because of attitude, lack of motivation or just an immature exuding of behaviors. Most co-workers make you feel welcome and a part of a team. Hardest part of the job would be to have everything done by 7 am along with trying to keep the work place areas clean and organized when not in the facility."
good,"A typical day at work has you starting by joining the team meeting.  You then go to your area and greet customers, stock shelves and rearrange displays. "
good,"Wal-Mart was the job I held when I was Attending school at "
good,Walmart isn't concerned with anything aside from getting their product moved. They put little concern into their employees.
good,"Hard at juggling every department alone. Poor management, along with great amounts of miscommunication."
good,"Nightly stocking of merchandise and unloading freight."
good,"Started at 6am, unloaded inventory from trucks, stocked freezer then stocked shelves. Most of my co-workers were great, Management was not so great. Hardest part of my job that I really disliked was being in the freezer so much. Loved workin around all the different people/customers."
good,Wal-mart was an awesome job gave opportunity to cross train in different departments learn new things..
good,"A regular day working at Wal-mart, the feelings can be neutral, fun at times, and depressing. About 60% of the staff, employees, are very lazy and its very frustrating to see when your a hard worker. The work is quite easy but the quantity is often huge, and the time is short. I truely enjoyed working there, but the hardest part of my experience was to work very hard for a small pay. My years of experience in this field should have given me a great starting pay, but I was basically looked at as a new hire, with no experience, getting minimum wage. Although I was suspected to work with my years of experience. Very unfair. I did learn alot of things dealing with the company and how to operate certain machines. All in all, I would not recommend this job to ANY new hires, without the knowledge on how this store operates."
good,"not enough workers, management need to be a  little more professional."
good,The people that work there tend to be good people but the management has no idea what their doing. I worked at two locations over 1000 miles away from each other and it's no better. They don't care about their associates. they pay well and by policy it's not a bad place but you better know policy or you will be eaten alive by those who do not follow it.
good,if your going to college during the week you can still make decent money by working just weekends
good,"I would start out bringing product to the floor and work it into a place.Then, I would straighten signs and clean and zone product. After, I would fill out on the computer paperwork about the tasks that I completed and or was about to.I learned better people skills and learned how to properly sell product to a customer.The management was ok, they were all different minded people so it was hard to decided what to do because you would get a billion different answers. Also, they were horribly unorganized.My co-workers were the nicest and kindest old ladies ever, they were great workers and human beings.The hardest part of the job not being able to answer a customers question.The most enjoyable part was the people and being involved with store events and my co-workers."
good,"Go into work and put money in drawer.  No one speaks unless spoken to.  I have learned that there are a lot of people that you can not trust.  Management will work with you if it is convenient for them.  The hardest part of the job is having to deal with 5 or more supervisors and customers that think you owe them something."
good,placer de la marchandise et travailler physiquement toute la nuit resume mes journée de travail j'adore l'emploie pour l'avancement qu'il nous procure.
good,"Walmart was an nice experience even though it was only temporary . While working at walmart I did learn how to work in the deli make and filling orders some for weddings, banquets, etc. The most enjoyable part while working at walmart was hands on dealing and helping customers."
good,"The evening shift day is typically a busy one, The former supervisor for the cashiers was a huge pain! It's very difficult to get in touch with management when it comes to sitting down and talking with them around the holidays because they are so busy."
good,it was horrible i was doing a three person job all on my own n no matter what part of management i talk to they never fixed it and they never gave the raise they offered to me and refused to fix it.
good,To me this was a very fun place to work until you start having people back stab you for doing a job well done.  Some of the management would just use you and start to talk done to you. I on the other hand would take a negative situation and dry to make everything postie for the days work.
good,Love meeting new and different people and the change that requires me to learn new task.
good,Walmart lets just say was an ok place to work. Management was ok i just wish they would interact more with not only the customers but the employees as well. My coworkers were awsome they were hard workers. The hardest part off the job I would have to say was understanding what u were suppose to do with so many managers they were never on the same page. My most enjoyable part was the customers u never new what to expect from them.
good,People on the graveyard shift are not asked to advance and are often overlooked when promotions become available. Management never has anything positive to say. They always find something wrong with whatever you did. They now time your task. Put you on a production based schedule but don't pay you for the more tasks you complete. I've been there 8 years and the raises are all ridiculous. The average raise is .40 cents a year. Who can live off of that? I want to start a family and buy my own house. I can't do that with the chump change I make at walmart.
good,"Working with Wal-Mart has good and bad things altogether. Lately they have been cutting major hours. Some people have families to feed and take care of, with hours being cut people are leaving to find better everyday. It is changing and I personally believe Sam Walton wouldn't be happy with the way it is being ran now."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customers and fixing shelves
good,"My typical work day start with me filling the floor and cake case, then making cake orders for the costumers. While doing that I assist costumers with any questions they have. At the end of the day I clean the table tops and clean the floors, then take the trash out. I have learn how to make different designs for cakes, to talk to costumers, and work in close work places with others. The management is kind of difficult but some of them are easier to talk to."
good,A typical day included working at a check out station and restocking and organizing products throughout the store.  I learned how to run a cash register at Walmart wile maintaining good customer service skills.  My co-workers were all friendly people that made the job much more enjoyable.  The most difficult part of the job was staying friendly when customers were rude.  The most enjoyable part of the job was probably getting to interact with a lot of different people on a day to day basis.
good,worked as a cashier for awhile then got moved to evening shifts where i worked the entire store floor in the back. was good experience in customer service and learned alot
good,"enjoyed working there, but too much outside influence from main store."
good,"I like the people but Wal-Mart will give something to you then take it back. Plus I believe they are one of the cheapest billion dollar company I have ever see when it comes to their employees well least the one I go to. The customers and some of the employees are what make my day enjoyable, sometimes it feels like I'm working hard for nothing. Management, they are great sometimes I mean hey will come out and help sometimes and f course Wal-Mart isn't a place where you would be able to support yourself let alone your family with. What really made me mad the other day is when they wanted to train me for the service desk and everyone knows you get paid more money but then my manager told me that its only about 30 cents extra and it has to be your permanent position, for example if I'm a cashier and I am mainly a cashier and I help out at the service desk occasionally I will not receive the 30 cent raise. Of course this other incident that happed yesterday was after me and another employee were finished getting carts which we always do even though its nowhere in our job description and hey have cart pushers who are always calling out. Anyway when we came in from outside our customer service manager gave us a slip for doing a good job and you need 3 in order to get 10 dollars cash for a free lunch but he told us that it went down to 7 dollars and that we had to buy out own lunch then take the receipt to the service desk to prove that you bought lunch and they will give you the money back."
good,"Protocol is ignored unless regional management is around. Forced to do things that break safety codes and could get me fired by management. People steal others lunches and other items whenever they feel they have the opportunity. They tell you that you need to talk to someone about advancing or joining the management program and then you never see that person or they put you off. Other managers try to blame their crews mistakes on our crew on a regular basis. I must say that I have worked at another Wal-Mart and it was nothing like this one, none of this would have been allowed or tolerated."
good,Walmart is a good place to work for people who have conflicting day to day schedules. The work is not that hard but the pay is not great.
good,Was not able to move forward in the work place. Unloaded trucks and took supplies to the sales floor.
good,"Must have the ability to multitask and jump in to help where ever help is needed, there is a high demand for flexibility.  The customers can make the day better, I love to greet them and assist them with what they are looking for in the store."
good,"I can't say all parts of my job was bad, I met a lot of great people while working there. However, management was a bit lacking, and working in the rain and snow wasn't fun for minimum wage. There would be several days which there would only by one or two cart associates to work for the entire day, and asking management for them to send out help would land no results. The best part of my job had to be meeting new people and working with minimal supervision."
good,horrible place to work . managers arent repremanded for any wrongs they do towards employees. no abscense is excused so if you have sickly children look forward to getting written up for attendance.
good,"Managed over cashiers and service desk, assist with any customer’s complaints and questions, coach associates when appropriate, make sure money podium is correct and balanced, evaluate cashiers, assign cashier to registers, assist with raises, schedule and hold cashier and service desk meetings, and train new associates."
good,"I had the best customers; I loved meeting new people and helping someone find what they needed. What made me the most happiest is when I would have a customer or two come back to walmart and find me so I can help them again. I enjoyed all of my co workers as well. We all helped one another out when needed. My feelings towards management is debatable. "
good,"too many changes within the company forcing employee benefits to dwindle as well as the opportunities available. Not friendly with school schedules, not willing to work with family schedules unless you have FMLA and they are forced. They are however, very open to suggestions, and there are several caring customer based employees and managers."
good,I picked ordered and also loaded trailers and also help other Departments. My co-workers were okay. Hardest part of the job was picking up a very heavy items and putting it on a empty pallet.
good,I mainly did customer service. I learned about some of the different medications and procedures working in the Pharmacy. I Also became HIPPA trained. I mostly focused on my patients and getting them checked out in a timely professional manner.
good,After clocking in go to area assigned make sure everything is cleaned up and picked up off the floor. Learn to be quick about accessing info for customer and if you don't know ask. The hardest part is trying to come to a happy medium for some customers and regain trust for them to be a repeat customer. Most enjoyable thing is able to find exactly what the customer is looking for initially.
good,"The store had wonderful associates (co-workers) however, the managarial staff was horrible and lack real management skills.  They push to work long hours with little help and value none of your concerns to make your work day more effective."
good,Ofereci oportunidade de crescimento.Varias seleções internas dentro da empresa
good,This is a great place to work for those who are seeking part-time positions.
good,When I first started working for this specific Wal-Mart I was excited for the numerous opportunities Wal-Mart gives its employees. I was pushed back by the lack of education which soon trickled into the lack of respect some managers showed to employees. This has been the biggest test of my life because of work ethic amongst management and my fellow co-workers. I have learned different techniques as an associate to encourage in order to ensure the job was done. I have learned to become a leader and allow my co-workers to follow in hopes to build my character as a future manager and authority figure. 
good,"Stocked produce unloaded and put in appropriate areas in storage and on the floor. Liked the work and many of my co-workers, but demands and management style was not supportive or appreciative. Felt like a number."
good,"a typical day at wal mart. slow paste at times. multiple managers, spread out directions."
good,"Okay company, Good customer service experience gained, management was slack, often had to do their job duities while they relax in the back room... co-workers were great, no problems getting along with anyone. hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, but it was good experience. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting off. "
good,"i have nothing to say about walmart at all typical day at work"
good,A typical day at work was busy. I learned everything I could learn. Management could be improved. My co-workers worked hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,I enjoy working for this company and any cons are towards the individuals I deal with directly and not Wal - Mart in its entirety . Management could be better . They actually hire from within before hiring any outside managers to do a job that someone who started with the company could easily do. Pay is decent and raises are frequent. It'll be a year since I have been with the company in October and I've gotten two raises already . It's a nice job for a young adult or teenager with little bills or just needing to work for some extra cash. It is manageable and it is doable . Any and all jobs are going to have negative connotations but overall I enjoy my time at Wal Mart .   
good,"Managers are not organzied. They are given too much responsibility that they can't handle. Hours are not given to those who are not liked by staff. Horrible work coniditions. Fun at the beginning, but later you will notice the rude and annoyed managers. This is from a cashier perspective. "
good,I enjoyed my customers the most at Wal-mart. I came in contact with a lot of diferent people from all different backgrounds.
good,"During the short time while working at Wal-Mart, there were many clicks within the company. No communication between departments and lack of concern for the employee. There is no recourse for the unruly customers which verbally abused the employees. Due to the high volume of customers, the need to push items through so many an hour was stressed and sometimes over pushed. "
good,"working at Wal-Mart I had to learn and learn very quickly.  I gained valued skills related to retail operations.  I gained leadership, management, inventory, and other skills that were needed to run the operations of  the world's largest retail establishment."
good,A typical day at work or school is to have fun but also get the task done and done right the first time. I think the hardest part of work is when a co-worker or classmate isn't doing or helping with anything. The enjoyable part is when stuff get done and done right.
good,"working at the Saginaw Texas Wal-Mart is stressful as an overnight employee because we are constantly being rushed to get the job done. the employees there are underpaid & the store is undermanned because they cannot keep employees & the few good experienced employees that we have either end up quitting or getting fired. our jobs are constantly threatened & we often times have to work on more than one isle, a task which can prove to be difficult considering that an employee might have from 12 hours to 50 hours worth of freight to throw, were only scheduled for 8 hours, 7 overtime is not allowed. im great full to have a job because it pays my bills, but i was a welder before this job and don't plan to stay here much longer."
good,"Working in store management at Walmart is a thankless and stressful position.  Long hours and a lot of responsibility without the staffing required to meet Upper Managements expectations.   Corporate and Regional Management tend to ""Micro Manage"" all aspects of store activities in a generic way with little regard or interest in allowing you to get the goals accomplished and still meet  customer service expectations.  Oh and by the way....ABSOLUTELY ZERO job security!"
good,"n/a"
good,"Heavy workload"
good,"It was my first job out of high school.  I was tasked with collecting shopping carts.  It was nice on a sunny day, miserable on a rainy day.  I couldn't get inside and therefore found employment elsewhere."
good,It just never felt like a family and the customers were rude.
good,"management lacking, not family oriented, not the company the original owner started out as."
good,Come in do your job to the best of your ability with the tools proved. Some days it would be hard to get the tools to do your job. If you would go to a management to ask for the tools to do your job more then likely you would have to wait or go looking for to tools to do your job. The hardest part of the job would be the management team would give you different directions every time the right hand never knew what the left hand was doing. So at times this could be really frustrating getting put in the right directions for the job that needed to get done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other associates working as a team to get the job done. 
good,"good co-workers, management has bad attitude a work day is up and down a lot of double working. I didn't really learn much and hardest part of the job is the arrogance of management"
good,"Walmart would not have been such a bad place to work at if it wasn't for the management. They seem to have a tendency to hire/promote the biggest a-holes in the industry. Favoritism is a major problem as well, as they seem to hire the ""pretty people"" instead of the ones who can actually do the job better. "
good,Overall A decent place to work. Customer service as a team was poor. Management is poor. Not very Organized 
good,Every morning we ran fraight. We waited on customers and did our jobs. My supervisor was easy going and it was nice to work with the group of people that I worked with. The learning experience that I got was day to day. Everyday was a different day and everyday was a good day. There was no hard part everything just fell into place. 
good,I enjoy my co-workers and meeting lots of new people.  I learned to work a cash register and got experience working with and handling money.  
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consist of many different managers without the title. Everyone want to have a voice although, at the wrong time and in the wrong position. I learned that you have to be a team in order to finish work assigned to me, and my fellow associates. Management never use their open door policy. It is very useless to talk to a manager. The hardest part of my job is actually doing my job and more than expected and still being at fault for other actions due to favoritism. the most enjoyable part of my job is working over night."
good,customers were the reason I came to work everyday. Good incentives and great pay
good,A typical day of work consisted of mainly assisting customers thru out the day. I learned to be patient and always remain calm during any situation. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with fun co-workers who made the day easier and fun.
good,"I worked 3rd shift in mantience I buffed floors. "
good,Working in the pharmacy was a great place to work. The pharmacy crew was the best. We would always have a good time whether it was a bad day or not we always seemed to keep a smile on our face. I'm a happy person and the last thing I would want is for someone to see me in a bad mood. I loved the customers that we had and the ones that were the regulars I knew by name and face. Overall I had a great experience working for the pharmacy. 
good,Productive and learned a lot about merchandising and grocery business. 
good,"The company is great its just the people or management you have to deal. Associates will advance to management who first start there, but the veterans stay in the same position. There is no FAIRNESS, You gotta know people or kiss up to others in order to get promoted or not get written up. You only get a .40 raise after a year, you get vacation time after 2 years, also when you use your sick hours they are held against you towards your attendance, as well as leaving early if you are sick."
good,Poor salary and advancement opportunities. Good culture but the way they limited people to shorter hours and paid us so little was a negative.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers and the customers.
good,"Okay to work for loved the girls I work with on third shift. Typical day like any other day check em out, cash their checks, and smile and wave."
good,The work was easy but there is a lot of favoritism when it comes to the managers and employees. 
good,sometimes fun. lift with your legs not back. Good management. fun working partners. Unloading items is the hardest part and the most enjoyable parts are the stocking.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you don't have kids. Walmart says that they are a family oriented business but that isn't true its very hard to get days off after you request them way in advance. Majority of the people that work at walmart are nice,fun, and just good to be around. When it comes to management, they weren't to fast to fix things that needed to be fixed, nor good at giving compliments just quick to point out the bad things."
good,"Typical work day consisted of stocking shelves. I learned about organizational skills. About management, i didn't get along to well with management which is why i chose to get another job. Co-workers, i had co-workers but my job was mainly a ""solo"" job. The hardest part was working almost everyday with no time to have to myself. The most enjoyable part was the checks."
good,Thirteen years at walmart and (at most recent store atleast) if you were not blessed by the store manager raises and promotions were almost no existant
good,"Wal-Mart use to be a good company to work for. That was when people cared about each other and not bonuses.  A typical day includes you doing your job and three more people, because they will not hire to fill the shifts. Also, they are cutting hours so the associates can not finish there jobs. I have to manage my area and make sure things are getting done even if I have to step in to do them. The management team can not do any to improve the problems because of the directions from home office in AR. My co-workers are stressed out because no one listens to their concerns, and they do not have enough hours or money to pay their bills. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help make a change with all the associates at Wal-Mart. At this moment I do not have an enjoyable part of the job, it just have to be done to make a living."
good,I enjoyed my job and the fast pace. I always had task to complete and always stayed busy. Walmart is based on family values but unfourtnately the store I worked for did not follow through with those. I never felt like I was part of a team. People I worked for seemed to be more concerned with themselves and not being a team player. Im all about team work and trying to help my fellow team members and that's the type of environment I would like to work in.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashing out customers with their purchases. Helping customers locate items in the store. Various cleaning and stocking duties."
good,"The work environment is fast paced and the shifts go by quickly, but you have to have a thick skin because customers can be rude. Management doesn't back up any decisions you make, they don't follow the policies the company sets. Other co-workers are nice, friendly people. Strong bonds form between everyone, we keep each other sane. "
good,mostly management is pretty bad. co-workers can be great but a lot of drama most days. 
good," I have to say that after working for five and a half years for the company that most of the time it was a pretty decent place to work. The associates that I managed were often comical and easy to work with they made the day fly by and we all managed to keep a smile on our faces. "
good,"Very stressful, less oppurtunites for growth, flexible hours"
good,"I got to interact with many different people (customers) all the time which I enjoyed."
good,Generally a good place to work.  Descent work environment for the most part.  Management was well.  Job duties where quite easy.
good,The coworkers were great but the management aren't really that caring.
good,"They expect a lot from people. It is easy to advance, but it is not a easy place to stay at. But I have learned a lot on dealing with customers and employees. "
good,"Good for part time job. Do not expect a considerable amount of hours to work or overly competent managers, but if you do your job no matter how simple or mundane it may be it will be an easy ride."
good,Have worked there a year and trying to pile on the workload. Stock merchandise on shelves within allotted time period.
good,"For the most a tyoical day at work was very productive, management relied on one to two people to take care of the department so their was always plenty of work! As far as management i believe their their was more ""chefs"" than ""indians"", by the end of your shift it was still tons of work to do. If you where seen attending to customers and helping for too long they considered the asscoicate to be just standing around talking. Over the almost five years i have seen this company rid associates that really enjoyed working for the company. i have seen associates of 15+ years get terminated due to attendance. what happen to apreciating a loyal genuine worker, the hardest part of this job was accepting the way things was done and the way workers was being treated. the best part of this job was for certain the customers. while their they really made me feel good about my work, and seen the little things i did for my department that management overlooked."
good,"Unfortunately the bad did outweigh the good, I loved my coworkers and most of the customers, but the management was not as good as it could have been."
good,"Gave a good overall experience working with people.  The management was poor with a few exceptions, but was ultimately only a summer job."
good,Tough day to day expectations.  Too many collectables daily.  Upper management not very realistic about time frames.
good,The deli is a fast pace work environment where paying attention to the details is a must. Teamwork helps the day along smoothly. The hardest part of the job is not having enough staff present to cover all positions whn closing the department down. Costomer satisfaction is definately the most enjoyable part of each day.
good,A typical day at work is busy. I enjoy the co workers that I get to work with on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers I get to meet. 
good,"My area's of responsibility are the front end.  This includes all front end cash registers, the service desk/money center, cart pushers, and maintenance personnel.  I also am responsible for any cash register in any area of the store including pharmacy and making management decisions on customer problems."
good,"worked as directed under circumstances that were difficult including management, weather and customers"
good,"they were tight wads. No one was allowed overtime ever and my department was the HARDEST working Department. trained in all aspects of the store from running a register to mixing paint , cutting keys, getting products from bike racks and cases, Stocking HEAVY car batteries and automotive products, hunting and fishing licenses, OIL CHANGES tires, car work. ya there isnt anything TLE did not do. where as some employees stayed in one area IE cashier. or Toy Dept."
good,"Bathed, brushed teeth, cut nails and maintained clean work environment. I learned that no matter how pleasant you are with animals you still can get bitten. I learned the importance of paying attention to details. When you don't pay attention to all the details then you can leave some customers unsatisfied. The hardest part of the job is to get bite by dogs. The most enjoyable part of the job is to hear a customer tell your manager that you are doing a great job."
good,"i Performed several job duties during a typical shift, I often stock shelves, price changes, and organize displays. I assisted customers with a variety of request including sales and decisions. i really enjoyed working with the customers. "
good,"Basically my job is to make sure all the new freight is stocked every night. I am being timed every night and I am suppose to finish my work within that time frame. Managers do a walk-around to make sure you will finish on time. After you are done with your department the manager will send you to help co-workers in another department or find another task for you. Management is not fair, not easy to move up in the company. Most people do not really enjoy being there. Too much freight per each department every night. Managers try to rush you every night. Managers always want you to do other tasks not in your job description. "
good,"Prepare income taxes."
good,"Advancement opportunities do exist. The co-workers are typically good people. However, sometimes you do get an over-whelming sense of insecurity in the stability of your job.  "
good,"se llegaba se buscaban los pendiente de el otro turno, se capturaban     las facturas de los proveedores así como se liberaban sus POD para darles su salida rápida, así como también se goleaban sus folios para pago a proveedor y así todo el turno.  "
good,">Typical day at work is every day"
good,management treat people horrible giving u attitude always
good,i deal with rude people but i handle it well. i do cash cridt and deibt
good,Rh le falta mas capacitacion en todos los temas incluyendo sicologia y relaciones interpersonales
good,"profundice mi experiencia en caja, entre otras actividades como atender el buffet, la reposicion de mercaderias. Me gusto mucho trabajar en un supermercado donde era muy concurrido lo malo fue que al entrar por agencia, no tenia posibilidad de efectivizacion."
good,Walmart is a company that is good to work for in the start but once you have worked there for a certain period of time there is a lot of favoratism and no room for advancement as a pharmacy technician.
good,this a good job to start working for but the pay is not equal to the job
good,"Although Wal-Mart was not the place I wanted to have a career in I lasted almost 10 years there. I loved working with many of my co-workers including management. The problem is when you are working in retail, your availability needs to be open as much as possible so that you are able to meet the needs of the customers. This was where my problem began to occur. If you are a person that is raising a family, going to school, and working full time this might not be a good place for you. I can say that I have gained a lot of experience working for this company and there is room to grow if you are a hard worker with great customer service skills, have the ability to learn new things, and have the time available to meet the needs of the store. The benefits that are offered are good for a full time worker and you wouldn't expect that from a retail store."
good,Walmart is a great job for employees who are just starting out in life. if you can last long enough to make your way up the ladder it has benefits to reaching that goal. the hardest part of the job is balancing work and life.
good,"This happened to be one of the nicer WalMart locations I had been in due to the friendly people, clean environment, and welcome atmosphere. It took me eleven months to find this part time Deli position at WalMart, due to recession, and I was very thankful to just get up and go to work every day, instead of looking for work and making nothing. Because of this, I stayed there for a year...keeping my eyes open. There was a lot of work involved, and I now have a whole different respect for any retail worker. The pay was very low, and the workloads could be amazing at times. Still, I was thankful. Because I worked in the Deli, pay was llittle bit more. (Food Safety purposes)"
good,Bad management. But I love how close we work with many different people and gave me the knowledge on many different things in retail.
good,"My typical day in frozen/dairy, since my store combined the two and has ONE department manager over both areas, consists of: stocking moo juice and downstacking milk pallets, stocking eggs, stocking picks-products that are empty on store shelf- stocking dairy freight and binning it, stocking frozen freight if I'm the only department associate there or if it's necessary to help out."
good,The first few years I worked there it was great. When managers switched it got really tough. It was a steady paycheck. I the hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 5-8 hours a day.
good,"No geral é uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, dificilmente desliga funcionários, e da oportunidade de crescimento profissional."
good,the co-workers is what makde me stay as long as i did. the company did not want to promote you but wanted you to do the work.
good,Engaing with customers and associates to complete all necessary task.
good,"Okay so it's retail, your never going to know how many hours you'll get because the previous weeks dictated that to a certain degree. I mainly stayed in the automotive department and found that many people that work there don't have a great deal of experience in the department they work in, despite that you can enjoy your work if your manager is a encouraging type of person like I had. My co workers were a mix of personalities and one had to learn what made each one tick so to speak in order to maintain a good atmosphere. I found that the job was enjoyable but not too challenging unless you sought out the challenges like advancement to management. I enjoyed my time there and hope that one day I can use my experience I gained there to help me in my future endeavor."
good,"Quando havia visitas de chefes maiores, era muito corrido, pois tudo que não era feito a semana toda, queriam fazer em minutos, então eu quase enlouquecia, pois gosto de ser bem organizada para não deixar tudo de ultima hora."
good,"I worked for Walmart pharmacy for 6 years. In that time, I handled the bulk of the responsibilites. I had excellent reviews every year. There were pharmacists that would not fill in at my store unless they knew I was working that day. Then, we got a new pharmacy manager. I don't know if she felt threatened by me or if she just wanted to be the only one in the pharmacy that was competent. She fired me, I have yet to find out why I was actually terminated. I fought with home office HR, because she said I was terminated due to a no call no show that didn't exist. Now that has been removed from my files, but I still don't know why I was terminated. Maybe I made too much money."
good,I enjoyed the Customer Service part of the job. Third Shift did NOT work for me.
good,just clock in do scheduled duties such as
good,"It's a nice place to work and stability. Meeting new people everyday is also a plus, but it has its down falls. Often i don't feel treated equally with other employees and the benefits aren't good. I've been working here for almost 4 years and only make $9.35 an hour. I have so much experience in different departments in the store and feel like i deserve more. With that being said this is my reasoning on searching for a new job and or career. It's normally busy and that's something that i love, makes the day go by faster. Ive learned so much from knowing how to present myself in front of a customer to counting and handling large quantities of money. Management is not fair on how they make decisions between employees and co-workers make it easier to deal with. We normally encourage each other and help one another. The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude customers, but even that's not hard for me. It sometimes gets a little uncomfortable but i always master the situation and the customer leaves happy or content. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers."
good,I'm not happy with the way management treats me. they pay isn't enough to live on as a part time employee.
good,No accountability. People that are higher ups can control and easilly steal and manipulated.
good,"you could not move up in the company, no full time jobs, management problems, customers were not happy. i liked my job, i just was not going anywhere"
good,"Good job, but doesn't pay well or recognize past experience in retail industry."
good,"O trabalho não foi de todo mal, porém eu saia certo de casa e chegava muito tarde em casa, vivia cansada."
good,- Expected too much without any solid perks to work towards
good,The days were usually unorganize because of managements indecisions. I really didn't learn anything that I already was familar with. As the old saying goes there were to many cheifs and not enough indians. Some of my co-workers were competent but others were there just to collect a pay check. The hardest part was the constant back stabbing that occur to try to advance or just to be noticed. The most enjoyable part was some of the people I met while working for the company.
good,"A política da empresa é boa,eles tentam passar pra nós algumas coisa s que na prática se torna um pouco dificil(a minha loja),aprendi a trabalhar em equipe a respeitar e ouvir a opinião dos outros aminha gerencia em particular é boa mas se torna muitas vezes dificil de colocar em pratica algumas reformas.A parte mais dificil do trabalho é trabalhar ao domingos o dia todo e a parte mais agradável são meus colegas que trabalhamos um ajudando o outro para poder trabalhar melhor."
good,Working there was great in the beginning. Things started to change as new managers got hired. They wouldn't except doctors notes and would write you up even if you had one. My coworkers in garden center were great! It mainly was a management issue.
good,The associate were ok to work. Everybody is so helpful & everybody works together as a team. Management doesnt communicate at all. They really need to work on the communicating.
good,buen ambiente laboral pero poco sueldo
good,"Typical day at work varied from day to day, learned how to be patient and multitask."
good,"Time consuming stocking inventory. I learned how to take advantage of each minute as if it were my last. There was always tons of inventory that needed all the time and energy we consumed. So it was very essential to not slack in between point a and b. Hardest part of this job was the constant heavy lifting, it was strenuous at times. Most enjoyable was the people I worked with."
good,Management and training of employees was always an issue at this store.
good,I liked working there working with the public and working in fashion.
good,I would come in to set my cake case up i was a cake decorator so it was a very fun job to do managers only a select few are great managers my co-workers only a select few are great but other then that the remaing are ok job was very easy. I loved dealing with customers that was probably my favorite other then decorating the cakes.
good,horrible staffing support structure... good coworker environment
good,I loved my job but when I got hurt I was treated unfairly. I tore ligaments in my elbow forcing me to not work.
good,"Working the overnight shift at Wal-mart was rough but had some good parts about it. The work was demanding but after a short period of time, I was able to perform my daily routine of stocking the dairy department with ease. The managers weren't as helpful or polite as some would think. They refused to give help where help was needed and only cared about those they favored. Overcoming the frustration of not getting the extra help when needed was the hardest part of my job, but I did enjoy conversating and helping the different customers that came in every night."
good,I loved my job except the fact management didn't care for my needs
good,A typical day I would ring on the cashier. Assist customers in a quick manner. Stock merchandise quickly and in orderly fashion. Also cake decorated in the bakery department.
good,"I'm gonna start out, that it was very unfortunate I had to leave the position so quickly after getting hired. I unknowingly had a hairline fracture in my foot that was received right after getting hired. I couldn't work through it, so I was forced to resign my position."
good,Going into work and having a line of pallets full of boxes that need to be put out by the end of your shift. looking through the boxes and moving them as fast as possible while also helping people who were needing anything. The best part of my job wa working with so many fun and exciting people. i could never find management when i actually needed them but they were there when i didnt need them telling me to hurry it needs to be moved.
good,"A typical day in the garden center was never the same, hard to explain since it jumped from task to task on the hour. I learned great sales experience and how to operate a handheld gemini computer. The management ranged from good, hard working people to others who didn't, in my opinion, actually deserve the title of manager. my co-workers were the best part of the job, everyone was awesome and no one had a poor work ethic. The hardest part of the job would have to be when management took advantage of those under the ""90"" day probation."
good,"Fast pace , stressfull, demanding, low- starting pay. Regrettable customer service job ."
good,"Can be a good position, but can also be very stressful. This could be a better place to work if they hired more daytime help for the department managers."
good,"I worked in the smallest walmart in new hampshire and loved every minute of it!! great pay/benefits and wonderful management. when i moved to nebraska I was harassed by the management, treated poorly, and eventually fired and accused of something i didnt do..different cities, very different job!!"
good,Worked hard to become managemant so quickly.Past co workers still welcome me and respect me when i shop there.
good,"A typical day at work is throwing fraught in timely manner, making sure the shelves are stocked with merchandise, and helping other associates get there job done. I learned How to use a telzon to been merchandise that is overstock. I also learned how to use a compactor/Baylor. Management follows the rules as they are told.The co-workers help others do what it takes to get the job done.The hardest part of the job is to meet our times. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping other associates and being there for customers."
good,"In the company very difficult to move up, however, I had good experiance as Sales Associate position."
good,"A lack of employees, and a refusal by management to undo a hiring freeze has led to employees of Walmart to pull more of their fair share. According to Walmart's own system, I successfully completed 13 hours of work. This is not a rare occurrence, however, according to management the program, MyGuide, is flawed; however, never in the favor of the employee."
good,"Walmart is wonderful place to work. I would recommend it to anyone. I enjoyed my job becaus of the people, that being fellow co workers to floor managers. I learned that with time and hard work there is opputunity in working for this company.The hardest part of my job was for the distance that i drove i didnt get enough hours. My favorite part of my job was all the great friends i made while working there."
good,was a good company to work for gave 12 years of service to them management was the bad part to many people telling you what to do before you can finish one thing they want you to do something else
good,My manager is great as well as my co-workers. I always have a fun time at my job joking around with everyone. I do not like the company. They do not treat their employees with enough respect.
good,I like working their but it was hard on me with the hours getting cut.
good,A typical day at work usual had you tired by the end of the day. I learned to work in a warehouse type environment & to use an electrical jack. The hardest part of the job was lifting extremely heavy freight. The most enjoyable part was going to break to rest.
good,my work day started late at night very quiet witch i liked we could listen to music of our choice witch was a plus.people i worked with where hard working and nice i cought on to the work very quickly.the hard part was the heavy lifting of cans and trying to get everything stocked on time.the enjoyable part of the job was being left alone to do your work.
good,I know I was an awesome cashier. Management made it hard to enjoy a days work. There is a huge lack of communication.
good,"I begin my shift tasking in to a task that i was assigned by management , next i work on the task which could either be Down Stacking , Stocking isle , stocking picks ect. in between the process of stocking the isle i must also attend to customers . helping guiding even giving my own opinion . once the isle is complete i Face / Zone every item on the shelves. at the end of the night i throw away the boxes into the compactor if the compactor is full i make a bail . drag the cardboard on a pallet with a pallet jack. double check to make sure my isle is up to store standards and task out of each task that i completed."
good,"Uma escola de como trabalhar em uma logística, a gerência muito exigente, como se deve ser dentro de uma logística. Os colegas de trabalhos formando uma grande família pelo fato de conviver muito juntos. A parte difícil era a sobrecarga, fazendo as vezes os funcionários trabalharem até 14 horas diárias sem folgas durante algum tempo e a parte boa era o convívio com os amigos que se ajudavam entre sí."
good,"Working at Walmart is not as easy as people think. Now, the job duties were not difficult at all, but dealing with the overpaid managers was mentally taxing. Many of them are complete morons, and would actually turn to ME, a lowly cashier, for help or questions regarding store policies and procedures. That is when they were even available, as they would walk around the store texting during the vast majority of their shifts, barely even looking up to clock out for the day. However, my main reason for leaving was that they would not work around my class schedule, which I gave them copies of on three separate occasions. How am I suppose to properly train for my chosen career path, when the job paying for my education is also causing me to miss out on my classes?"
good,empresa grande 08 horas de trabalho com horas extras diarias obrigatorias depois sento descontada em banco de horas final do mês.
good,working as their cake decorator it was an enjoyable at times as long as you had what you needed sometimes ordering would get in the way of production the hours were not bad management was ok not wonderful considering half of them didnt know what you need from a decorators point of view
good,"When I arrive I get keys, count the supervisor cash drawer, and assign tasks for the day."
good,"It's a good place to work with decent pay. Corporate management makes the job not worth it. They daily give out new ""improvement ideas"" that do nothing but make the job harder and drive customers away."
good,"Maintain up-to-date knowledge of store policies regarding payments,returns and exchanges. Prevented store losses using awareness, attention to detail and integrity. Trained new employees quartly. Cross-trained and provided back-up for other customer service representatives when needed. Worked as a team member performing cashier duties,product assistance and cleaning. Responsible for assisting customers and associates in a timely manner. and guaranteeing high level of customer service. Guaranteed positive customer experiences and resolved all customer complaints."
good,Stocked new groceries and general merchandise. Management was rude and disrespectful. Co workers were lazy and unhelpful.
good,"* customer service all day, answering telephones, door greeter"
good,"the company is a good one but the club i work at wasn't the best one, the members are wonderful people and a joy to work with."
good,"I didnt have a trainer to train me hands on. I had to learn it on my own or ask while I had a line of customers. if i wouldve had proper training that wouldntve happened. When it was time to let seasonal employees go, no one told us. We had to find out on our own from not being on the next wks schedule. Poor management"
good,"A typical day at work for me would be stocking the shelves, making sure eveything is in it's correct place, and most importantly customer service. I learned alot of employability skills there, my co workers were always happy to help out, some managers didn't mind helping out. The hardest part of the job was the managers that didn't understand the correct way to talk to their employees. The most enjoyable part was all the people that I meet on a daily basis."
good,"Each day brings differenent challenges as you encounter supervisors, associates, customers and the community. You must start each day organized and prepared with the ability to be flexible for any suddend surprises."
good,"El trabajo que se desarrolla en Walmart Chile tanto en la parte operativa como en el área de soporte es buena, los colaboradores en los locales son muy entusiastas, toman desayuno a las 07:30 para abrir a las 08:00 donde comienza la aventura del día a día por cumplir las metas de ventas, en la parte de soporte el día comienza a las 08:00 y cada uno toma desayuno en su escritorio para comenzar lo antes posible a laborar, mi aprendizaje consistió en aprender a marcar productos, junto con eso integrar el sistema de cajas en el local y tener mucho cuidado con el manejo de dinero, luego mi aprendizaje pasó a la atención con el público y el protocolo a seguir para la excelencia en atención, Resolución de problemas como: Cambios de productos, notas de crédito, accidentes laborales tanto de los colaboradores, como del cliente, Encargada de supervisar la mantención de la sala del local, como el abastecimiento de las góndolas, Recepción de reclamos , la parte más dificil se encuentra en los locales, ya que el colaborador se encuentra expuesto a la interacción cara a cara con el cliente, por último la parte que más gustó fue en la parte de soporte y ser partícipe de la creación del evento:"
good,"Problemas que solucionar con los clientes, trabajar reportes finalizar cambios de precio Revisión de reportes, ejecución de de guías de mercadeo, supervisión de personal, evaluación del personal, control de presupuesto, revisión de pedidos, juntas de comunicación, realizar inventarios de perecedero a fin de mes. Etc."
good,Learned.new ways to enjoy the hardest parts of a job by knowing that the work is what you make it.
good,"my typical day starts off with a meeting to discuss what tasks are assigned for each employee, then follow up on job duties and provide help as needed. I like this job due to the culture that is wide Varity"
good,"waiting on customers, exchanging cash, for product. did enjoy talking to the customers,"
good,"foi minha primeira experiencia profissional,fiz o curso de operador de empilhadeira pra uma promoção,a gerencia era boa o pessoal era muito agradavel,o esforço sem reconhecimento realmente é a parte mais dificil,bom er reunir o essoal pra descontrair"
good,"for me it can be stressful working there I come in and don't know if there will be enough people to unload the trucks. From working here at walmart I have learned to appreciate the work I can do and how motivated I am.Management at walmart don't communticate with one another and don't really communicate well with there associates. I love my job but other people in my job don't love it so I don't really enjoy working there like I used to.Hardest part of my job is unloading a truck and not having enough workers to get the job done, so then I have to work twice as hard. The best part of my job is being busy I don't get bored theres always something to do so the days go by quick."
good,"While it's a solid company for anyone starting to work, after a while you will see that it really isn't enough, especially if you're living on your own. Each store is different and to be completely honest, no position within retail is going to be a 'dream job' however there were just a lot of issues that never got addressed. If you're still in school this is a pretty decent job to start you off, everyone else will more than likely want more after only a few months, which is unfortunate seeing as your hours are anything but guaranteed."
good,"I arrived in the afternoons, to straighten out the garden area and re-stock the shelves. My manager was a stern person with little patient for non english personal. Luckily the supervisors was tolerant and understanding. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. Althought some customers were demanding, I can say that I did my job as affectively as possible. I never received a reprimand in all the years I worked there."
good,"exige bastante esforço, eu aprendi bastante coisa la, a gerencia esta la faz dois meses, é uma pessoa da qual muitos não se agradam, meus colegas de trabalho sao excelentes, a parte mais dificil do trabalho é quando voce tem que deixar o seu pra ter que atender o dos outros e ainda não é reconhecido, a parte mais satisfatória, é quando damos resultado diariamente em vendas e planos."
good,I think that its a good job for someone who doesn't have a whole lot of bills to pay. But for my i need more hours the 20 a week.
good,Don't really work for walmart unless you need a job desperately or if you need good retirement benefits.
good,"Always busy and always work to be done, lots of great people working there."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart included me watching over multiple departments (sometimes all of the departments in apparel) while also managing the jewelry counter and answering customer phone calls. I've learned about the tasks that needed to be completed by the department manager while at times being treated like one. Management wasn't the best at Wal-Mart. They sometimes treated the employees with disrespect. The co-workers were friendly and tried to help each other throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was that many times I had to watch over all nine departments in apparel and the jewelry counter and help all of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job included spending time with the employees.
good,Antiquated systems and equipment
good,"A typical day at work was hard but intertaining. I learned how to work under stress, pressure, and time frames. The management was not very helpful. The co-workers is what made the job so enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a cusomer that actually wanted to be helped."
good,The day is crazy.i learned a lot about retail over the 10 yrs. management is always too busy and never enough working..my co-workers were great..hardest part of my job was trying to make everyone happy. Everyday was something different..
good,Employment was short due to employer refusing transfer. Easy job.
good,can be a fun place to work if you like fast-pace and mutiple tasks.
good,the most enjoyable thing about work was the people i worked with
good,"I liked working at walmart stocking, I stocked the freight every night and I learned better stocking skills. I didnt like the management so much because they gave credit to the wrong employees. Most of the employees were hard working but some were distracted on the job. The hardest part of the job was bad team work."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers , also most every one worked as a TEAM"
good,"take care of all the customer need, make sure the front in stay clean take care of shop back and put back on the shelf and make sure the employees that I supervising don't get off tracks and when the front-end was tooking care of I would move to where ever the management need help the hard part on the job is when a customer is mad when they come the and take out on but am a good problem solver. so it really no big deal what i like most about the is the network part of the job you never know who you going to run into all of my co-workers we always had fun but still get are work done with good time left before and the day was over"
good,Management needs help in customer service and what it really means to be a manager.
good,"a typical day at work involves dealing with customers that are unappreciative and rude as well as management that expects you to do a job that it would take six people six hours to do in ten minutes. The pay is decent for what the job is, but you still never make enough to feel that it is worth putting up with the abuse. They are usually good about working with availability if you have a good assistant manager. Some managers make it very apparent that they do not like you and will do their best to not work with you. Co-workers are ready to point fingers at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong. Co-workers are generally lazy and will push off their work onto you or just flat out not do it so that it looks like you are the one who has not been working. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the co-worker's drama as well as the rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get that one customer that does actually appreciate you and that you went out of your way to help them in any way possible. That is the only reason I can bear going to work. Some days it makes it all worth it."
good,"Great place to work if your starting from the ground up, and I mean that in terms of life. So if your going to college it's a great place to work part-time, or if you never had a job great place to start; great environment to start building attributes. Such as time management, customer service, and work ethic."
good,"being busy,management don't back up there employs,having people call u names and tell u that u don't know what u're doing plus go and lie to management when they don't get there way. When someone tells u thank u and getting someone there money back from a bad mistake that they made."
good,"I work in multiple departments at walmart. Their scheduling is the worst when your an entry level hourly employee. During my college years, it was a ok place to work."
good,I truly enjoyed developing film and working with all of the different types of people. Customers with bad attitudes were the worst part of this job.
good,"It's WalMart, they're really all the same. Unfortunetly. Low pay, expensive benefits. Company does not value the hard work from all employees."
good,* large company
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart was ok. With that being said, the work was plentiful but the pay was lacking. I dont mind working as long as i'm compensated for my troubles. My co-workers were very nice andd pleasant to be around."
good,"Per MHRM and company protocol we were required to learn every assistant position within the store. This allowed me to acquire and attain much more than I originally anticipated and I became well versed in every area and regulations in each of these areas. I enjoyed the interaction with upper and lower level management as well as working daily with the associates in regards to HR needs, customer care needs, etc. The most enjoyable part of my tenure there would have to be the relationships and trust I was able to build with the customers, associates, and management. Knowing that the skills I acquired there will only be an asset to any company that I am hired into and continuing the volunteering that began as a requirement and became a lifestyle improvement!"
good,"Work is the same everyday, I stand in the same spot, and interact with customers. The job has not taught me anything I have not already learned. Management can be unbareable sometimes, but they will work with me if I work with them. I love the people I work with, but the hardest part of my job is handling certain customers, that blame me for certain things that I have no control over. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and networking."
good,"Manejo de inventarios, manejo de merma, la atención y servicio al cliente siempre son lo primero. Aprendí a trabajar con altos estándares y con una buena ejecución de las instrucciones de mercaderías y de los puestos superiores."
good,a empresa e uma grande escola na qual vc de tudo aprende um puoco e um pessoal dinamico e tem força de vontade porem vc passa por varios setores adquire esperiencias mais promoçao e muito dificil.
good,"My work shift always starts off great! After clocking in I would begin my tasks assigned to me and fulfill my duties for the day as scheduled. I learned how to do exchanges, refunds, also how to change out the registers. My managers were always there to help with any questions or problems I had. I believe there was no hard part of my job. I had over ten years in experience so I pretty much knew what to do. I believe the most enjoyable part was just being around friendly people, being co-workers and customers."
good,"I handle scheduling, evaluations, hiring,terminations, cash office, events, merchandising, coaching for improvement, talent development."
good,"Day a work can be very busy. Everyday there is a new way of learning how to create new versatile styles and techniques to improve customers looks. Immediate manager is fair and very pleasant to work for. I love my co-workers, they are a pleasure. The hardest part of my job is I am not compensated enough for the job I do. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see the expression of my customers face when they see the transformation and they are overwhelmed with happiness."
good,"allot of people that work there are nice, smart and professional but some of management have allot of ego problems and are rude to both customers and associates."
good,"I worked as an overnight stock person for this company. It was a decent job, doesn't pay well, a lot of physical labor naturally. Anything from hauling big heavy towers of merchandise,and stocking shelves,to consolidating and tracking it."
good,the company wal mart was a fun job but did not give room for promotion
good,"This has to be one of the worst jobs i have ever had. I was a 3rd shift dairy stocker. Management had no clue what they were doing, workers were not trained for their specific task, the scheduling system/task system was flawed. Working there you felt more owned than apart of a team. i walked in with high hopes, left as one of the few people who wont shop at walmart. disappointed."
good,"aprendi muito com a empresa,abriu minha visão para estudar e alcança objetivos na minha vida."
good,A typical day at work involves working with minimal resources and still expected to complete all tasks to satisfaction. It is challenging at times and support from other departments is limited but ultimately the work environment builds your skills at managing because you have to employ them at full tilt everyday just to get the job done.
good,"Very busy fast paced environment where you learn something new almost on a daily basis. Great co-workers and a wonderful team of cashiers. Hardest part of the job is communication, there are so many different shifts of people coming and going sometimes it is a challenge to make sure everyone is aware of all changes happening. It's great working with such a diverse group of people though."
good,"unloading the trucks , usually we get 2000 items to unload (the hardest part) and most enjoyable part was wrapping the items on the skids"
good,good place to work. I Worked as a cashier/ sales associate in lawn and garden department with flexible job task
good,"Walmart, was never a fun or unstressful, in management, for the normal employee they told me they enjoyed their job except for the pay. I was hired on as the Electronics/Wireless floor manager, I enjoyed the job. I did scheduling,tending to all paperwork, and cell phone contracts. After six months I was moved into Office/Sales manager, this was an extremely stressfull work enviroment due to Walmarts ever changing systems."
good,WalMart review Constant harassing work in varmint..When I wanted to go back to school it conflicted with my work schedule so they dismissed me
good,I started at 7.90 and was filling in for a job that was full time and getting paid $10/hr. I was listed as a normal cashier but the job I was doing was the Customer service managers role. This happened throughout the store in multiple other positions.
good,"Working here was certainly a challenge in a few different ways. The work itself was easy and simple, but being a big corporation, the company has strict guidelines and goals that seem to be unattainable unless you work at a store that never gets busy and work with people who have your same work ethic. I especially had issues with my immediate supervisor, who really did not help me learn the processes and duties of the position at all, even though I directly asked her if she could assist me. My co-workers had all worked there for 6 or more months, and seemed to be in a groove and had no time to train someone new. I basically learned the job on my own through trial-and-error because I had no other options. I even went to upper management with concerns and although they did listen to me with open ears, nothing ever came about it. Once I learned exactly what I needed to do to correctly perform this job, it was somewhat enjoyable, because it really is a simple and easy job. I loved helping customers, and they really seemed to appreciate my help, because not everyone who works at such a big store is willing to go above and beyond for a customer."
good,I unload trucks. Never really had the right amount of workers to do a good job.
good,would like to have a office job rather than working in the store
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company as far as an outside would know. At my store, not saying all stores are the same, management are nothing but snakes. If you mess with the wrong people you get bitten and suffer consequences in subtle form, such as cut hours.....etc. Hours fluctuate since they refuse to hir full time, except for Dept. Managers and higher, therefore living off of 30 hours is a requirement. I do say I enjoy my job for the people. I am a people person and serve my customers with the highest ability I can. The hardest part of the job is management, the easiest is helping those who have questions or are looking for something specific. My coworkers are GREAT, strong people and I wouldn't trade them foe anything. We all are in this together and we stick together like so."
good,"hard work, and no management support. working for walmart i've learned exactly what not to do when running a retail business. management was of no help and always trying to throw someone under the bus to cover up for their mistakes. no teamwork what so ever. the hardest part of the job was dealing with too much work with no prospect of it ever letting up. the only thing enjoyable about the job was leaving"
good,"I liked the work I did here. My manager was outstanding in leadership and team building, both are rare at Walmart. My most enjoyable part of my job was helping the patients."
good,a day there was i would get there about 8 am and would start by getting the carts that where in the parking lot. then sweep by the doors to keep it clean and then get more carts
good,"My typical day at work was usually the same everyday. If it was a Monday, I was in Claims helping and being trained. The other days were filled with freight, mods, binning, and customers. The management for the most part were always helpful and gave their point if needed. My co-workers were the best. There was never a day that went by that I didn't laugh thanks to them. They have been there for me through so much. Most days there really wasn't hard part, just frustrating when the customers got mad at us, the associates on the inside for something that the TLE Crew in the shop did or didn't do to there vehicles. My most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I was able to help a customer find exactly what they were looking for or being able to help my fellow co-workers."
good,"Scheduling is horrible, it's like they would like you to live your life in the store. My co-workers are wonderful we pretty much are all on the same page and get along very well. The hardest part of my job is actually not being rude to customers especially when they are disrespectful and rude to you."
good,"its a good place to work for its just like any other workplace where there is a lot of talk, but other than that its ok."
good,"he aprendido a controlar mis emociones, entendiendo que primero es la actitud de servicio, aunque aveces es difícil con la gerencia de la empresa son diferentes formas de pensar y cada cabeza quiere algo diferente, hay compañerismo entre los empleados aunque con diferentes formas de pensar, la parte mas difícil es cuando hay mucha gente, en general me gusta lo que hago, mas no me gusta el trato que aveces tiene la gerencia."
good,"I like working with the public. The drawbacks of working here are the weekends & holidays. My coworkers are great, but I need a more stable schedule."
good,The Company has gotten so big until its lost its original integrity that it was built on under the leadership of its founder Sam Walton!
good,I liked the my co-workers and the environment but the pay could be a little better.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is very consistent. My hours may vary but I know what to expect most of the time. I've learned various things such as dealing with customer service and I've gained a lot of experience. Management is very understanding and likeable, and my co-workers are very friendly in fact despite those expected few, but I am not bothered. The hardest part of the job is the late hours but it's nothing I cannot handle. I enjoy working in my area which is the electronics section because I know a lot about games and such therefore it comes very easy to me when a customer has a question."
good,"This compnay was nice to work for but you never had a set sceduale and the hours were long, it didn't feel as if you had any room for advancement and alot of your coworkers were grumpy majority of the time."
good,Sliced deli meat for customers and making platters for customers
good,"i like to get in do my job and get out. only problem is, its a job in itself just trying to find the resources i need to get my job done. it is retail. so mostly kids working there, or semi-retired adults. a lot of the supervisors are kids, and behave as so. if you can learn to ignore it, you can do well to move up in the company fast. I can ignore it, until it comes to my door and involves me personally. they are always hiring, so if youre looking to move up in a company, or just want something for the meanwhile."
good,I considered myself an asset to Walmart during the time I was there. I do not feel that it has the culture or values that I have and there are little advancement opportunities.
good,I worked for Wal-Mart Distribution Center for 8 yrs. The biggest thing that kept me there was the 3 12 hours weekend schedule. I went to college during the week and worked on the weekends. I was paid enough to be able to lead an above average lifestyle compared to other students. I did have to work very hard to manage and keep this job. 125% is expected of you while never getting paid above 100%.
good,This company has drastically changed over the past ten years. It used to be a company that cared and was involved in the associates lives. It worked with them to provide a suitable schedule and work enviroment. It is no longer this way and quite honestly it saddens me. The values that once made this company strong have all but disappered. It is now very micro managed and all about making money. It is still enjoyable to work there for the most part and becomes some what addicting. I started there thinking it was something temparary and ended up working there for almost twelve years. The biggest issue with this company is that almost everyone (including the management) is there just to collect a paycheck and do not put their heart into the job.
good,"This was a temp job that turned into the only job I had. The store I work in is overran by an all male management and obvious favoritism so no possible promotion for someone not on the good side. Despite hard work ethic and willingness to learn, I truly believe that I will never advance in this company. I am currently seeking other employment."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of many different things. I was constantly busy, which is always a plus. I learned how to follow structured, task-based assignments on time and how to work for a big corporation. I learned how to multi-task even more, along with all the basic work that goes along with being a sales associate/customer service. The hand-held computer had many options to learn and I was always learning when it came to that aspect of the job. Management was not the best because all the associates had different managers, who all worked in different ways. They would rotate. In the two years I was there, I had four assistant managers/supervisors for the apparel department. Then of course the store manager. Sometimes it could get confusing due to the constant changes and work ethic. For the most part I got along with all of my co-workers, but in all reality you will never get along with or be ""friends"" with who you work with. You need to know where to draw the line. If any of my co-workers ever needed help, I was there. We were supposed to be a team, but towards the end, it seemed like people started to care less and less about working together and appeared to care less about the job in general. The negativity and constant complaining was one of the hardest part of the job. Also the fact that Walmart was extremely strict could be both hard, but at times enjoyable. It was enjoyable to know I had consistent hours, legitimate breaks, including dinner, time and a half on Sundays, holiday pay, personal hours & vacation hours. That was the most enjoyable and professional aspect"
good,"The basic idea of the internship is great. Interns are given folders with what to do on a daily basis. What is lacking is supervision. You're basically left on your own for the duration of the internship, no support from management, zero! If you are not motivated to learn something it will be a waste of time. Interns can do as they please. Departmental manager, assistant managers dont know when interns are coming to their departments so they are unprepared and dont know how to train them...."
good,I believe walmart to be a good company. I feel a lot of the corporate policies are not enforced or used at the store level. At least not the store I work at. the benefits are good and compensation okay. The dilemma is the lack of caring by in store management. I feel my direct manager is great and wants to help me move up. Anything from assistant on up feels like they are just trying to bring everyone down.
good,i thought walmart is a good entry level into the auto industry but there wasnt much more to offer at the time i was there. there maybe now since they have progressed into more advanced services.
good,"a typical day is assembling anything that was needed or serving the customer,the team that i had was wonderful whatever our guest needed we got it for them i enjoyed my job very much."
good,management has no communication with associates while changing schedules. managment pawns off all wok to lower employees
good,"Em doze anos de trabalho, pude conhecer esta empresa e contribuir para o seu crescimento. Nesta minha caminhada, contei com grandes colegas, que hoje tornaram-se verdadeiros amigos."
good,"The pay is great,but they do not treat their employees well. It is also not a company to for if you want to be somewhere to advance."
good,this was my first job over night stocker at walmart i started this job to help pay my bills while i was in school i really didint kno anything about the work world but it gave me what i needed
good,It really was an ok job. It was just a job to help me pay for school
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., but due the economy hours are being cut and I have to let them go. I learned a lot from this company but it was more a starter job to help me acheive what I realy was interested in."
good,"An average day would consist of my team and I processing on average 600 prescriptions daily, while also processing delivered orders, taking customer calls and instore questions. The hardest part is the standing, but the best part is my team."
good,I feel like no matter how hard you work for these people they will never notice your efforts.
good,"Walmart is a fun fast paced place to work, but the management team could be a little more professional. They pick and choose which policies they are going to follow and when they are going to follow they. they also show favoritism to their friends."
good,Overnight stocking (10:00pm-7:00am shift)
good,Co-workers were unfriendly and not motivated to work as a team
good,"A typical day at work is the unknown. Although being scheduled in one department, you may be required to work anywhere within the store regardless of knowledge of those departments. I have learned to go with the flow and achieve as much as possible within the allotted time frame. The store management abides by all corporate policies. My co-workers are all friendly people who are easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is knowing the store policies because there is a communication gap between the day and evening shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with the customers."
good,"Was a very productive company but, management wasnt as responsible as need be"
good,"Working at Walmart was decent. I gave it my all when I got the job. The more and more days passed, I realized everyone was laid back, calm, and not as jittery as I was. I started work trying to be perfect. I learned that you shouldn't try to be something you're not. Even when you have months/years of experience, everyone makes mistakes. Everyone looks at management as if they're super humans. I've learned that management can be one of the most stressful jobs. I've also learned how to deal with management in a way that's suitable for them and myself also. Co-Workers, some are nice, some are mean, and some are just plain weird. You'll grow to love them no matter how they are. The hardest part about the job, is that when you're expected to do so many things by yourself, and its never good enough. This job also builds your character and makes you stronger. The most enjoyable thing about working at Walmart, was the special events held in the Associate Break Room (Pie Fights, BBQ, Associate Celebrations, etc.)."
good,"permite crescimento, e investe no funcionária, faz treinamentos e tem campanhas social legais."
good,"This was a great starting off working experience, I learned from this company not to let other employees get to me, and to report when supervisors are mistreating you."
good,good if you need a job an you wanna get on your feet feet but bad for your personal life an pays really low
good,-I was in charge of decorating customer special orders and filling the cake case
good,Geting what every had to be done on time an in a good maner.learning all the different jobs
good,I walked the store looking or theives in plain clothes. carried handcuffs just plain fun.
good,"Working for Wal-Mart is a great job to have. The associates are nice, the management team is good at what they do."
good,"My job was quite enjoyable. I really liked helped customers by helping them select their fine jewelry purchases and educating them on the different qualities of gems and diamonds. I, unfortunately, had to leave the position because of conflicts with management continually scheduling my hours to overlap with my college courses and my finals because of lack of dependability of other employees"
good,walmart is a very busy work i always enjoy sseeing new faces everyday at walmart we get people from everywhere around the world.
good,very busy and always moving managment doesnt really know whats goin on since it is so big and under staffed
good,miscommunication. learned everyone has different rules. management very unorganized. no team work. hardest part dealin with all the miscommunication. helping the customers was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"For a retail job, not too bad. Very busy and always room to grow with the company."
good,Meeting a lot of people.
good,Scanning merchandise and meeting new people. Making sure everything is clean and organized. Making every customer a happy one.
good,"they reduce working hr,,they dont care what ht employee nned."
good,I've advanced from a stocker to management.Through the years I have learned that you can learn and advance if your willing to put in the work.
good,It was ok but it just seemed like the workers were doing all the work and the managers did not reallly help us with much. All they really did was put a bunch of work in our face and said it had to be done by the end of the night.
good,managers unfriendly and not helpful. Hours horrible
good,It was like you expect. Most of the people you work with are rude and miserable to be at work. Customers were miserable to pay prices that they deemed to expensive and took out their anger on the walmart workers. It was a job when you need a job but it is not a job I would want to work at for a long time.
good,A typical day at work you would cheack out at else 100-250 customers a day. I meet alot o very nice co-wokers there as will as customers and we are friends until this day.The harderest part of the job i have to say there relly was not any and the most enjoyable part of the job was i always got the same customers everyday they enjoyed my work.
good,"My typical day at work is clocking in then looking at my team mat to see what my tasks are for the day. Normally the tasks that are written for me I do already on a regular basis. I help customers with products and answer any questions they have. I also run the cash register, stock freight, set mods, process contract phones and do general cleaning around the area. The management normally is busy doing their own tasks and they just want you to do yours. My co-workers are great for the most part, we all have to work together to take care of the area. The hardest part about my job is on slow days having practically nothing to do, but on those days I normally just do extra cleaning. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer, I have plenty of customers who come to my area just to see me again or help them with another product. I feel great about my job when I have customers telling me what a great help I was to them."
good,Constantly changing by the minute and you have to keep up. You will see what makes them the number 1 reatiling company. They will get the best from you.
good,"Reposicion ,control, cambios de precio. Tareas varias"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of double work meaning doing one thing then being told hours later to do something else with it or being told to work something a certain that would take a lot longer than it should. I learned a lot about Inventory Management and how to do basically anything in the store including cutting fabric, grabbing fish, cutting keys, mixing paint, make fishing licenses, and keep a department under control(What a Department Manager should be doing). Management is certainly the worst and most unprofessional I have ever dealt with. In my years at Wal-Mart I have had different Managers but the ones I have now are the worst. Too much miscommunication and they just basically don't seem like they know what they are doing. The hardest part of the job is when having to deal with the Managers and tell them how to do things. The most enjoyable is helping out customers."
good,Great place to work....coworkers are fun but i know that depends on the location.
good,was not a good fit for everyone who works there. Managment was pushy with hard workers of the company.
good,very fast paced and repetitious. you will learn by on the job traing and computer based learning skills. very high influx of co-workers and managers quitting and hiring. the only good part about Walmart and if you can hang in there are the benefits and the 10% discount on GM items.
good,"Well I worked hard every day since the beginning as i do in every job I work for. I was given the chance to move up in the company quite quickly, it only took me 6 months to become a Zone Merchandise Supervisor. After i got the position there was no training at all, even though they knew that I had no experience in retail. I learned quickly and over came the hardships of the position. It was hard to learn how to ""merchandise"" and learn all the company policy's with no experience in this field. After i taught myself how to do my new job, they expected me to do others jobs as well. I did not complain at all and just did it. I thought what I was doing would become noticed and I would be given the chance to move up in the company again after 2 1/2 years of doing this. Just so all of you know I was only making 1/2 of what others in the same position was making. Instead I was fired because with everything that they had wanted me to do i was not able to get all the deleted and non-replenish able items out of the stock room by the dead line that was given to me. This was the first time that I was not able to do what was asked of me. I was able to accomplish 75% of the task but I only have a 12' area to put all the merchandise that was required out. Wal-Mart is not the company they say that they are for a career. I wasted 3 years of my life on this company even though I have 8 years experience in the machining trade. I took a chance on Wal-Mart and it is not a company that you go to if you are looking for a career."
good,Have little requard for the people working for them.
good,A typical day of work would be clocking in and going straight to your register cleaning it before opening up and keeping up with the shelves surrounding you. I learned a lot of patience in being a cashier at a grocery store. Co workers were awesome! I made some great new friends. Management was horrible. They didn't manage very well at all. Never acknowledged anything positive and had their favorites. The hardest part of my job was not being able to move around. I like to be moving and more interactive. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet great people and making friends with all the regulars!
good,"Constant interaction with upper management and vendors. Keeping control of grocery claims as well as filing claims against certain vendors for damaged merchandise. Receiving millions of dollars of merchandise into the store by outside vendors; which I need to verify and account for. I learned that my receiving responsibilites,call on the concept of conflict resolution and maintaining my positive attitude, keeps a potential crisis from escalating. I get along very well with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is receiving and trying to do claims at the same time. I enjoy interacting with the vendors. They are very respectful and kind to me and I return that to them as well."
good,a typical day was working various days from 3pm - 11 pm in the mens department stocking and helping customers.
good,"i worked for walmart five years and was fired because i could not keep up with a foot injury a month after tha on fourth of july had a major heart attack but a stent was put in and i survived they tell you emploeey of the month and get dumped ,,most of my workers are gone terminated for no reason ,,god bless the unions see you in the next life .."
good,Overall walmart does it's job. Low prices and instock.
good,"Handled Customers both good and bad, Handled inventory and supervised 6-8 technicians. performed oil changes and tire work"
good,"enjoy what i do but need a change,i need to be doing more to help patients.i love helping people"
good,"As a department manager I was in charge of the inventory of my dept. and had control over price changes and proting certain items. I learned how to keep my stock low by decreasing prices on items that didnt sell as well as others and the items that did sell well I had to advertise them by either building a stack base, or a shelve full of the item with advertising. Managment were a great help when it came to sells and hot items. The Co-workers were friendly and helpful at times. The hardest part of the job was supply and demand. If we had it we had it, but if not we either had to order it or refer them to anothe store. The most enjoyable part of the job was again the people, Im a big people's person. I love to help people"
good,Managment was very to sided. Work associates were great people.
good,Working outside enjoying the day with my fellow co-workers was the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job was living up to managements expectations everyday of work. I have learned how to work your very hardest and push myself pass my limitations.
good,I worked with some very fun people and got to meet some very intersting customers. This is a very fast paced retail environment with long hours but if you can get past that this might work for you.
good,Good way to learn customer service skills and how to use cashier system. Co- Workers were fair and nice but management was not fair with employess.
good,I love working with the asociates they are my family away from home.
good,"At Walmart I began as a cashier and moved to the deli and then meat department as a sales associate. Every position involved customer service and working with other associates. The sales associate positions included inventory control, stocking and cleaning to keep a high quality shopping environment."
good,first meetings then go and scan dept. next connect with shift workers go over any thing left from previous shift. Management not the best especially store manger does not do what he preaches.Co workers great. I would say the hardest part was when we the employee would try to help the customer even though we was met with diversity from higher up. Helping the customers no matter what it was good or bad making a difference in their shopping experience.
good,"A typical day is either you or a cowoker getting cursed out at some point and time by a customer for something not your fault because you are a cashier and they see you last.you greet customers, help them,basically try and get em out fast as possibly bt still being friendly. i learned to control my temper alot. co- workers loved em we were we family especially up front. the hardest part is about the job is getting help up front when needed and putting up with the rude customers and even more feeling as if your management doesnt care bout your well being or ur familys. the enjoyable part is meeting people and the entertainment n working with some great people."
good,"The highlight of my work day at Walmart, is the interactions between me and friendly customers. The late lunches and poor scheduling played a huge role in why our lines were backed up. My co-workers were my family, we all had the same issues with the lack of workers on registers, my managers were amazing, up until the store got busy, they became rude and displayed poor judgement."
good,Assist customers with their shopping needs. Help look for products and make sure department is clean and organized so customers can find what they need. Management was always available for employee needs and customer needs. The most enjoyable part of being employeed with this company is that you encounter people from all over the world.
good,WalMart pay there management handsomely but the other employees are paid pennies on the dollar and given very little hours.
good,worked new and over stok frieght
good,The bigest thing with walmart was management and no comunication with management to employees. I would have to fill the cake case and do 15 orders a day by myself but when the other cake decorator would work she would get help. the most enjoyable part of the job was when customers would leave with a smile on their face after seeing the work i have done on a cake for them.
good,Looking For a career not a job. Here until I find a place to stay for rest of my career.
good,I enjoy the people that I work with but the Company as a whole does not show much appreciation for its employees.
good,"I really liked working here, they will work with you for anything. I needed more hours and pay that is why i left."
good,"This was a great start out job.There was always constant movement which was wonderful. However, there was little room for advancement and very little willingness to teach new management skills to younger people. There is also a very high employee turn over rate."
good,Over it was a good place to work. It used to care aabout its workers but that has changed the hardest part of the job was never having enough employees to get the job done right to benfiet the customers. I enjoyed all the associates and are still very good friends with alot of them. These employees took care of and helped out other employees when ever it is needed not he company.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would be the employees. I think management need better communication among themselves. Certain times of the month the freight is very heavy. The down side to the job is that you work every weekend and holiday .
good,"Walmart is walmart. It wasn't horrible to work there, but it wasn't great either. I was a cashier, so I stood at the cash register and run people up. There were no opportunities for advancement or change, so it's really a dead end position. If you need a quick..low buck.. work there. If not, don't waste your time."
good,learned ways to deal with rude customer and management that abused there authority.
good,I loved working overnight more then during the day. Job had its good days and bad days.......most of the managers were pretty good.
good,"When my department manager was on vacation I was over the Men's department for the week. Putting up stock, doing inventory, cleaning out the bins, and working at the fitting room. Makes sure the shelves and pegs had the items in stock and in the right spot for the customers. Meeting new people and helping customers when they need my help."
good,"Not the best of company's to work for considering the pay, but is worth while for people who don't plan on focusing on educational advancement in the future. The pay honestly isn't very great, as well as the stress you deal with versus the amount of authority you are given as an entry level employee."
good,"My day connsist of helping the general public.Assisting and helping them with items that were to heavy for them to load into the vehicle. I mostly just cleared the parking lot from all grocery carts the were in the parking lots rather it was sun, rain, sleet or snow, I had to push carts. My manager was somewhat cool but not understands and wasnt really helpful. My co-workers were the coolest. The hardest part of my job was pushing carts thru the snow and thru the hottest days of the summer. The most enjoyable part of my job was....................."
good,"Management will ask you to accomplish more than any one person can achieve in a days work time. Then will always add more things to do. Stocking the shelf then zoning the isles, then do all your price changes and also working your freight. Then there is setting displays correctly, and whatever other little task management gives which is normally a lot more things."
good,A wonderful place to work for a lot of people but for me not a right fit.
good,"your job is not the same every day, working with customers and adapting to ever changing situations my each day one of a kind, it will keep you on your toes and keep you quite busy."
good,i would come in build bikes and move the bikes out to sales floor
good,I learned a lot of different managment skills and advanced retail practices. Learned excellent customer service skills and learned a lot about people from a wide varitey of backgrounds. Was not satisfied with the advacement oppertunites even though I was very successful at my postion.
good,WalMart is a great place to work if you want to come under corporate submission and give up any of your freedom.
good,"The most rewarding part of my experience at Walmart has been the satisfaction from helping customers. When I started with the company, four years ago, I was very quiet and had trouble approaching a complete stranger to ask if they had questions or if they needed help finding something. I was very fortunate to be a part of a team full of very out going personalities and this in turn helped to develop my customer service abilities. However, I do not attribute my development to company initiatives, only to my coworkers. Walmart is a very task driven company, and the demands that are placed on the hard working associates are quite awful. The management must follow the direction given by Home Office, and this is not conducive to creative thinking on the store level. The company continues to ride on the reputation it established when Sam Walton was at the helm, but the goals of the company have changed and do not reflect Mr. Walton's vision."
good,"The work was good and your co-workers and really friendly. Some of the managers were really nice, while others made working there not worth it. The hardest part of the job was all the under staffing."
good,"my experience wasnt great, managers do or say whatever they want; co-workers were okay but there are cliques; hours and advancement opportunities are the best part of job"
good,"i liked working here just wasnt enough hours,great involvement with customers.."
good,Never a dull moment
good,Enjoying working there.Overall it was a good place to work. Could be very stressful at times but enjoyed the job.
good,I love working with people and deals and the bargains the store had to offer
good,Enjoyed the work. If we were short handed I would come in to cover the work load. I loved teaching and being creative with our cakes for special orders. I took pride in having the shelves full and the order taken care of. The bakery was a reflection of me and I tried to keep things in order and full for the customers.
good,"A very stressful enviroment, deadlines to meet. They want everything done yesterday. Learned excellent customer service skills. managed 11 people in my department. The co workers were like family. The hardest part of the job was making sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,"A typical day at work were help the customer, I learn how to talk with different types of people, my co-workers were great to work with, the hardest part of this job were not enough work hours, the most enjoyable part of the job were to be able to shop after work without leaving"
good,they promise advancement and purposely hire everyone except managers as p/t so you dont get your benefits for 3 years.
good,"As an ex employee & former assistant manager for WalMart, I found that the company is not for the employee what so ever, but for the all mighty dollar. They're customer service has really gone down hill due to all the cut backs including eliminating possitions, not hiring full time associates but rather part time instead to save on the pay out of insurance. To keep the bottom line as low as possible. Remember the store manager has to get his or her bonus at the end of the fiscal year. I loved my job, I gave it my all & not any time did I hear a good job or an at a girl. I made a mistake & I was terminated. What a shame for all that knowledge & training for them to throw it all away. The mistake I made was not anything to do with theft, bad language, disrespectful, falsifing records, or favortism, but what i did wrong was not to lock the door when the associates went outside during a snow storm for their 15 minute break @ 12:00 midnight. I left to change the security tapes & came back to lock the doors after they all came back in. I was terminated on my next shift. The store in Greenville, PA was the best store I ever had the opportunity to work at with the best team of managers. The store in Kittaning, PA was the worst store I ever had to work at in my life. Horrible store manager."
good,"Wal Mart is a great company; however, unfortuantely, the management make is a job that you must have because you need to work but unfair treatment."
good,"Its allot to explain Overnight Stocker, Electronic/Wireless Sales"
good,"A typical work day was very normal. I assisted customers with their purchases, as well as locating things around the store. I learned more about customer service,more about people, as well as more about myself. I liked the managers, except, they definitely had their favorites.Walmart policy states that any manager or supervisor isn't supposed to fraternize with people below them in their departments, however, only a couple of managers honored that policy. Anything personal discussed with a manager was quickly spread around Walmart. I liked all of my co-workers they are all wonderful people with a common goal, to make a living. Everyone is very caring and hard workers. The hardest part of the job was I couldn't make all of the customers happy. If we didn't carry what they were in search for, or the return policy's, I try my hardest to make everyone happy, and for them to enjoy their experience. The most enjoyable part of working with Walmart was meeting new people, and the people interaction."
good,A typical day at work was a 10pm to 7am shift. I would go home and have to baby sit my nephew until 6pm. then go back to work at 10pm. I never got much sleep. Management would not let me change shifts because of my situation so my work showed my lack of concentration. I had great co-workers but one of my managers really didnt like me since I was the youngest person on the team. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer out and seeing the genuine smile on their face as they walked away. It just made my day go by smoother.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has taught me a whole lot about people. There are so many different personalities out there and being where I was (Customer Sevice), you will come across them all. Satisfying every customer one-by-one can be a very difficult task. But I think the most challenging part of working at Wal-Mart is dealing with your co-workers. Some are nice to work with. And some tend to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. And overtime, you will learn how to handle all sorts of emotions, problems thrown at you, and overall how to get along with just about anyone. That is one talent I will always carry with me that I have gained while working at Wal-Mart."
good,There is a non-ending list of things to do and usualy not enough people to do what needs to be done
good,"i come in to work breqak down the wet wall so they can be cleaned then reassemble the wet wall, break down the truck when it comes, remove all bad product and replace it with the new."
good,Everyday taks included putting stock on shelves as well as setting up bulk display for high volume sales. Job included also unloading trucks as well as utilizing computerized inventory systems.
good,enjoyed working there but management and the way things ran was not smoothly.
good,The friends you will make will be the best experience of working here. The pay is laughable based on the work expected
good,I loved my job at Walmart. My co-workers and I got along good we had good working relationship. My typical day there was scanning the bins making sure they were correct. Then I would get the pallets collected and scanned into the correct bins and get the merchandise to the floor and stock the shelves. Then I would make sure my daily vendors were taking care of and their merchandise was on the sales floor. Unload the grocery and frozen/dairy trucks
good,Working at walmart was great experience for me. They taught me how to be a receptionist as well as how to use the equiptment in the Dr. Office. Overall it was a great job and would recomend it to anyone.
good,"There is no typical day at Walmart. My main job is cashier, but I have stocked shelves, scoveled snow, mantaince work, pushed carts, I also work in lawn and garden. My coworkers are all pleasing to work with I get along with everyone including Mangement. The hardest part of the job is not being able to get full time and stable hours of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the different kinds of people and to listen to them and hear their stories about their lives, family, trips, and their up and down moments."
good,9:00 am - 6:00 pm
good,"This is the type of job that a person makes it wonderful or impossible. I made it work for me. they do tend to have a fast turn over but can have advancement, For me i enjoyed the job."
good,lots to do
good,"Focus is on sales and profit, lacks customer service, care for employees, not a fun place to work, stressful, fear of being fired."
good,"Too many management layers and I have had 3 managers telling me what to do at the same time, so I did what the higher one said....lol. Not bad for part time work, but too micro managed for anyone's own good."
good,Very long days.i leaded how to stock shelves and deal with money.not very good management.Co-workers where ok.Dealing with people with additudes.Getting off work.
good,"No day was typical, each day presented new challenges. I learned that time management is critical, and you can't always make a plan and stick to it, you need to be very flexible. Politics are more abundant the closer you get to the top of management. Teamwork is the key to a business' success. Co-workers always had their own agenda. The hardest part of the job was not being able to follow the plan you put together for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping customers and knowing I made them happy with the service I provided."
good,"overall i enjoyed my eperience. It was short, because of the job being temporary. Wal-mart has taught me to have excellent customer service and to put the customer's first."
good,"I had to file a complaint with the Attorney General's Office of MI on the Howell, MI Wal-Mart, as well as with the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federals), for discrimination against religious convictions and two disabilities. I worked there for eight years and ten months, and finally after about seven and-a-half years of working daytime as a cashier, I was promoted to the overnights as Customer Service Manager, when I worked at that position for ten months, and then I was laid off. The Company is a perfect example of abuse of own authorities over another and disrespect toward their employees (associates). I was retaliated against for reporting illegal activities to government agencies, and their own Loss Prevention/Asset Protection Co-ordinator for their own Asset Protection Division was a police officer, who gave no help in saving my job. The pay is very high, but insurance is not good; the co-pays are too high. At the time when I was working there, the pay raises were excellent, and the advancement opportunities were excellent, but only if you wanted to forfeit having downtime and personal time in your own life for self-maintenance. Assistant Managers' shifts rotate and are not flexible. The ability to transfer to other departments within the stores are not easy, as I was a daytime cashier for seven and-a-half years. It is not recommended that 401(k) is obtained through the Company from Merrill Lynch, because twenty percent for taxes will automatically be deducted when you schedule your total distribution made out to you, over the phone, but the following"
good,I was responsible for contacting vendors to set up pickup times for company. Worked with any problems that vendor and/or driver may have.
good,"I stocked shelves. maintained inventory, Kept the stockroom organized. worked in different departments as the needed me to."
good,trying to help the new department manger learn things in that department. but think they know everything but don't
good,"Wal-Mart is a company that should be in terms of job, for high school kids and college kids. It is such an easy job that it lacks challenge and is monotonous after an extended period of time."
good,Ultimately anyone's experience in a retail setting is going to be factored on how efficient management is
good,"mix paint, help customers, go backs, straighten up the dept. My co-workers were fun, management, not so much"
good,I did enjoy working at Wal-Mart. My problem was there was no organizing of the whole work environment. I dealt with a lot of workers who wanted to be lazy and not do their job so i was always doing their job. Money was good but I didnt feel apprieciated by the managers.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work for. Depending on the managment your under the company can be very productive. Walmart has good health and dental benefits that can still be used after the have left Walmart. It is hard to go to other positions such as assistant manager and co manager positions in Walmart. You get yearly raises depending on your progress in your position. If ou work an 8hr shift you get two 15min breaks and a 1hr lunch. An 5hr shift you get just one 15min shift and their are shifts that you have a 15min break and a 30min break.
good,I enjoyed meeting the customers and interacting with them but the management philosophy that is talked about is not always followed through with when it comes to the employees.
good,It's a good job for someone who doesn't need a lot of money or benefits. No good way to advance up the latter of management.
good,Good entry level job to gain experience and learn more about retail.
good,"Liked the people i worked with. On the bad side the management did not do a very good job scheduling. The hours I worked were very hard to work with, and taking breaks was difficult due to lack of people working."
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for if you are just trying to work there until something better comes but I would not recommend working there for a long period of time.
good,"very busy,customer service orinated,fun but lack of hrs and work."
good,Being such a big corporation they have a hard time really watching out for their employees and make impossible to predict hours and are not very good about making life better for those that work there.
good,The Coach's (Supervisors) lied to the employees and was a very tough job but did pay good
good,"Management plays favorites with other employees,if your on the freind list then you can pretty much get away with anything but if they don't like you then goodluck..Walmart is not very family orientated like it use to be back in 2004 it's gone down hill since then..i thinkwalmart needs to go on the tv show undercover boss because then they would find out a lot of things."
good,It is a good atmosphere to meet new people. Keeps you moving in your area to make sure its shoppable.
good,Wal mart is everyday growing center. I have gained a great experience by working at this store. Lots of friendly people with very good management. Have gained alot of experince form wal mart.
good,The company was more interested in getting production out of the employees rather than their welfare. The pay wasn't great. The hours kept dwindling down.
good,"My personal experience is probably tainted, so I will let you discover the pitfalls of working for them. The pay is decent if you have previous retail or any relevant experience, the scheduling is relatively okay as long as you get a manager you can get along with."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place for a first job, side job, or working while in school."
good,"Good work enviorment, except they switch managers too much, & had to perform job duties that I was not informed about when given the job."
good,The company and values have changed over the years. Overall a pretty good company to work for.
good,"Schedule was very crazy, money wasn't worth the work and hours."
good,"Walmart doesn't have any social reponsibility for it's employee, low wage, no insurance, no holiday except for christmas, but sometime the hour are good."
good,"Its a learning, productive, and highly motivated workplace."
good,Wal Mart is a hard place to work for very little pay. You get no respect from anyone including your management. You can't live off of what you get paid.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work temporarily as there aren't that many perks to continue as a career there. Of course being a major store there are many customers and alot of the time you are helping them locate product, and many times they are not the most polite people."
good,Management were very unsupportive. Very rude assistant managers also.
good,Very low pay. Benefits are unaffordable for the average hourly employee. Management does not back employees on policy.
good,"Working at walmart was a huge step at that time of my life because I was a high school student, but the advancement happened fast due to hard work and being friendly to others. Walmart is a great company to work for; however, it needs a better management staff and some order."
good,Ok so maybe that title is a little harsh but I can say without a doubt that Wal-Mart is the worst place I have worked. So bad that I do not even like to go there now to grocery shop.
good,This job was an easy going job that was honestly always miss managed. Walmart switches management every six months or so so you always have to train the managers on what to do.
good,when the hire you the tell you there are a lot of opportunities that’s not true. The day’s are long you are supposed to work 5 days a week 10 hour shift most of the time it’s more 12 hour day’s the will call you on your days off and expect you to come in no compensation for all those extra hours. If family and friends are important I would absolutely not recommend working for this company as an manager
good,"Initially it was a good job, until I learned the department’s in general. Seems like one is taken advantage of while working overnight. Hard to actually describe the conditions really without going personal entirely."
good,"walmart broadened my customer service experience. I learned how much to bag groceries, manage the self service checkout and help the customers with any problem at hand."
good,"Experience is for one person personal experience, get hired and try it out. They are good when it comes to work, and working for them. But management is a big thing that I feel is too, risky in the business they are putting out."
good,"Inconsistent Management, begin moving to other stores. The floating created difficulties with procedures, which were inconsistent from store to store. Work load overwhelming at times."
good,"Not recommended unless you are desperate. You are not appreciated, burn out happens quickly and employee turnover rate is super high. Management will pick on you if they decide they don't like your face and will get you fired. Vice versa if they like you."
good,"It’s Not the worst place to work, but It’s not something long term. Management doesn’t play around, your there to do your job and be done. But decently nice staff"
good,Walmart stresses their employees and doesn’t appreciate them. IT SUCKS!! I would love to work for another company that values and empowers their associates instead of tearing them down
good,I would work there again if able to work a different shift. I enjoyed being busy constantly. However the management wasnt the most approachable and was more likely to tell you to deal with whatever it is or move on to another job.
good,"Working for Walmart was good for the 4 years I was an employee. I enjoyed my coworkers, the opportunities to change departments and learn new areas. I enjoyed staying busy so tine went quickly. Management at the time left A LOT to be desired. Overall a positive experience, but negative with management."
good,"Working there was probably like going to High School. The managers are somewhat lazy, the store manager is lazy, the department managers probably work harder than any other managers in the store. It may seem too chilled and laid back because it is too chilled and laid back. But managers don't listen to employees half the time when given certain suggestions or ideas to help the store, department, company etc."
good,"fast paced work , lots of drama and if your not there at every becking call they use it against you when it comes down to you missing for being sick no baby sitter anything. they called e in the same day I got out of the hospital and my dr note didn't mean anything to them and they just brushed it off I ended up working for two hours for them but had to leave because I still wasn't feeling good and they were pushing me past my limits"
good,Walmart is all about themselves. They want a bunch of stuff done but only have a couple of people doing the job and expect it to be done. Management is a joke and lazy. they will stab you in the back in a heart beat. Benefits are stupid expensive and not worth what you pay. I know much smaller companies that have excellent benefits compared to Walmart and multi million/billion company.
good,Most managers and staff are disrespectful. They don’t give you precise directions and they’re extremely rude. I an always talked to like I don’t matter. I get cursed at and not treated as fairly as other associates.
good,"With walmart you have a chance to move up in the company if you want to. You're able to transfer departments. Most of the other employees are nice when you get the chance to know them. The team in the department I worked in were awesome people, you eventually become like a family and help each other out."
good,Walmart is a great place to work however with a lot of the company changes it has left several employees not knowing what’s going to happen to their job later on.
good,"The work required wasn't especially difficult, I started out as an overnight stocker, lead night safety advisor, and eventually worked my way up to Jewelry Sales Associate. I was only part time, however, I worked full time hours as I lived 1.9 miles away. "
good,"Emploi très formatif. Beaucoup d'opportunités pour apprendre. Par contre au niveau de la gestion ne cadre pas avec vous si vous n'êtes pas un  "
good,"Overall its decent but a lot of days are frustrating."
good,"At my location, the hours rested between 32-37 a week, so roughly 64-72 hours a paycheck. Long days, but only three days a week, which is a plus for students or anyone working toward a greater goal in life. Co-workers on my shift were generally friendly, iffy on mid-shift but edible. Benefits plus incentives also a plus, which is another variable that intrigued me. The real, clear upside is the fact you will have four days off a week, which is golden for those I've mentioned above."
good,Walmart has change since I worked there but it was a terrible place to work with high turnover due to lack of respect towards individuals who are different or even are considered a lower income class. The upper Management talked down to everyone.
good,"The job itself is easy, the complications start when they stop scheduling properly, expecting three people to do a five man job. Closing is the hardest, they want people to be done on time but do not understand it takes more than two to finish properly."
good,You show up do your job and go home it's a paycheck. Yes they do some messed up stuff but can't speak on everything that goes on the garage is a little different it's doesn't feel like a part of the rest of the store for the most part
good,"This particular location had some questionable at best hires during my tenure, warehouse managers who could not manage younger employees, (16-22)  which was a majority of the staff. Many days had time with no direction or order from a superior and associates would take advantage of the relaxed environment. Setting timers for us to work to the maximum legal amount before allowing a break was the main concern of managers."
good,If you get the right store Wal-mart is amazing place to work for.  But if you are unlucky  some store's management team will make you hate the company.
good,"Pays well for the location, but you aren't appreciated. To much favoritism. Open door policy sucks. The hard worker are given a hard time. The lazy ones are praised."
good,This place is not a good place if you are trying to make a living. They choose favorites and they dont appreciate hard work. They are quick to tell you that you are replaceable.
good,"They tell you you can move up in the company but it doesn't seem to matter how knowledgeable you are or how hard you work. It's not what you know, it's who you know that gets you advancement. The pay sucks, they start you at minimum wage and that's where you stay unless corporate raises everybody's pay. If you get sick or have a sick child good luck. The company enacted a program called protected personal time off to try to help with this area but try using it when you need it... I've done several different positions and never a pay raise. It's a paycheck but that's about it."
good,They don’t appreciate you and they treat you poorly. I don’t like the fact that we can never get overtime. Management shows favoritism with their workers. Most of the people in charge don’t really care about you.
good,"Changes made lately are not associate friendly. Little training, subpar communication, constantly adding to workload while minimizing staff support. Ever changing work schedules and long hours are not family friendly anymore. Vacations and time off are constantly interrupted with phone calls, conference calls, and mandatory meetings. Benefits are good and very affordable. Advancement opportunities have shifted"
good,"Great company to work for, but unfortunately many of the stores themselves are not run the way Corporate intends for them to be ran, and in this case that's actually a bad thing. Long term managers are resistant to newer, and better, directions that the company wants to and has invested in going."
good,They really want you to work hard while cutting your hours just for 4 hours no one is going to work hard Manger are there rude have no respect For you unless you kiss there Color of your skin matter there 🤬
good,Working for Walmart was a good experience and I would recommend the company. It offers a diverse work environment with a lot of different job opportunities.
good,At first working for Walmart was ok but there where no real management there employee did whatever they wanted without structure. The hours where all over the place and it wasn’t organized
good,I was a casher and working with people on a one on one basis not as easy as alot of people think ..i have learn to respect people who helping me by doing this job.
good,my supervisor would sometimes let me supervise when he had to do other jobs. helping the customers was the best joy at the job. i did learn how to stock shelves and operate different loaders.
good,"There was a day I worked by myself and management  didnt help me. I was running the bakery, deli and hot case by myself on one our our busiest days. I got no help and management knows the departments."
good,A empresa é boa. Mas infelizmente no Morumbi onde trabalhei muito como Polivalente. Meu encarregado não me deu oportunidade. Pois eu era mulher. Mas eu não abaixei à cabeça. Continuei trabalhando normalmente.
good,great place to work but the ones i worked in particular had bad managers but i did enjoy working there and the co workers i made life long friends there
good,They do not  accept  Doctors excuse and only allowed to mi as 5 days if you are part time  it takes a very long time to accumulate PTO hours .They don't care about the employees.
good,"I feel that walmart has gotten too big for it's britches! The focus seems to be geared towards who benefits the most from walmart....Quite possibly, the people who benefit directly from the money walmart rakes in."
good,"Depending on what shift I got, my day could start with me as the opening cashier early morning, to starting shift on self checkout. Most of the customers at this location were rude beyond belief and have a high sense of entitlement. Even if I apologize to customers for having a bad experience with someone else, they want none of it and go out of their way of making me feel terrible. The management was lackluster, and the scheduling for the up front (cashiers) was a joke. They rotated schedules without warning, leaving some of us with more than 40 hours a week with no overtime pay. The store manager would change the schedule roster and also give no notification, leaving myself to coming in ""late"" and getting docked a point for something beyond my knowledge. I tried to resolve scheduling conflicts with several managers but all they told me is that they reserved the right to do so because I signed a magic paper. The paper I signed was a scheduling agreement yes, but I agreed to the set number of hours on specific days is what I signed and nobody knows where that paper is. Despite all this, I dealt with rude customers on a daily basis as a cashier, but not all of them were rude. I enjoyed helping disabled customers with loading their groceries or lifting heavy items for them."
good,they do not keep you in your department and will put you somewhere else without any training in that area. i did 6 different departments in 1 day. you didn't know if you were going to work in your department that day or somewhere els.
good,You are asked to work as fast and safe as possible safely you get a yearly share holder stake. and once a year you would get your vacation pay you'd very little hours Intel black Friday
good,Are awesome but management is something to be acquired depends on who is working most are nice and will help however some are very cut n dry and don’t care if there’s a family emergency or if you don’t understand the job task at hand they don’t want to exsplain as there supposed to overall though my experience with Walmart was positive
good,"They give raises once a year its very rushed so even tho i worked harder than most i got a 20ish cent raise. If you are young and get in theres a chance to advance but they aren't interested if you're not in your 20s it seems. Also they give bonuses every quarter, they say its based on sales and reviews but everyone thinks they just make it up because you can get a lower bonus in season than out"
good,"The work environment was decent, other associates were very nice, management not always too helpful. Advancement is claimed to be possible, but actually difficult to achieve due to favoritism and lack of positions. Benefits for part-time employees were practically non-existent, very little paid time off, low bonuses compared to full-time employees. Compensation for some positions, like second shift stockers, was low for the amount of work that went into the job."
good,Everyone thinks they are in charge and noone really likes each other. A lot of back stabbing. The managers only fake caring and turn around on their words.
good,"The responsibilities and management are not worth the frustration, however, changes are coming and it might get better.  Fellow associates are very friendly and helpful."
good,I guess it’s ok they don’t follow the 10 feet rule far as managers goes co manager and all it’s a lot of favoritism but I guess it with every job they expect the workers that they knw gonna get the job done to do so much
good,There are a lot of changes there everyday and in the future there are going to be some layoffs and cut in pay for anyone who is a class C and/or D. I was happy until they made some changes to my area and then I felt lost and didn't know what to do when I came into work.
good,It was nice and lovely I had allot to do. I was a cashier and door greeter. Nice job but needs to get paid weekly that biweekly mess ain't cutting it!
good,It's not a bad starter job at all I've met some good friends there and there is some good trainers there as well especially floors I would recommend it
good,"The work load was overwhelming as a department manager. I was offered little to no help from management. I would stay late to try to finish tasks, then was not allowed to keep the overtime. I wasn't allowed to leave early or come in late to cut it, I had to take 2 and 3 hour lunch breaks to cut my time."
good,"-corrupted "
good,"Everyday was super long"
good,Walmart is not an easy company to start working in. It is a good company to start working in when you are trying to get on your feet. It is very stable.
good,"Wal-Mart is customers driven and more so,driven by the mighty dollar. As far as their associates there isn't a lot of care,consideration or concern. People are put in positions and are not trained. Should an employee be verbally assaulted by a customer there's nothing done on the behalf of the employees"
good,It's a big company with a heavy non-exempt population who have certain guidelines on how to do the job and there is no room for deviation. Providing feedback on process improvements is dismissed because it falls outside of the job scope.
good,Rules change a lot and are very particular on how work should be performed and how fast it should be done you are often under valued as an employee some of the managers are awesome some are not
good,The job wasn’t too bad working outside in the element wasn’t that great but the management was the worst part they really didn’t care about us and just wanted us to get the job done at all costs and then they’re yell at us for breaking the rules to get the job done
good,"Although most of the associates i had worked with were great, the management had been horrible and i believe they were one sided. Some associates were treated much better than others although they had preformed the same."
good,The retail business is a tough one especially during the holidays.  To many nights and weekends.  work/life balance is bad   I took the job as a part time job and eventually took it on full time due to a lay offs at my full time job.  If you dont mind working nights and weekends and being micromanaged its a good place to work
good,"A typical day is entirely stressful and you feel unappreciated during and at the end of the day."
good,Walmart has overall rules  . respect for associates is suppose to be one of them.It does depend on the store manager however a team is only as good as the head coach
good,"I was there for 18 years.  The last few years where terrible.   The culture changed.  Production levels became the priority, safety was pushed to the side.  There were 15 managers each with over 15 years experience that where fired.  They where nearly all well preforming.  They were replaced with new people but at a lower pay because of their time in the company.  Over all it has good pay but they expect a great deal form you for that pay."
good,Just...don't.Wait to see what Walmart wants to be when it grows up. They've been rewriting everything about the associate structure for the last two years or so and it's only going to get worse.
good,"I appreciate shopping at walmart, but I did not particularity enjoy working there. The diversity angle is great, I come from a Latvian speaking family and meeting other interesting people working there was a benefit, but the demographic of employees was not my cup of tea. The only thing good about working for walmart was, sadly, the discount and the diversity. There was often nothing to do but stand at your post at a register and stare into space, but if you like that then this is a good fit for you."
good,Lets see i started with the promise of working 34 to 40 hours which is full time. Im lucky to get 30 hours a week while in all departmens are facing the same issue. They hire people and then cut hours of already established employees and give the hours to the new hires. They add on work from what you was hired to do all the time when your job is still yet to be completed. Theres no integrity shown from managment you bring up a problem its walked off untill you get written up.
good,"Just don't expect anyone to care about you in the slightest.  This job starts out remotely fun, but you will get burnt out rather quickly. Everything is always half-done."
good,"I learned a lot in customer service. The hard part of this job, when customers are always complains and we always have to accept that customers are always right.  But management has to consider consequences and situations that occurs."
good,I like working there but I would like more hours I've been there for 10 and 1/2 years I think they should consider that they are fairly good at with us I do like the people I work with in the most part
good,"I hated working here. Liked some of the people I worked with, but the management was awful. Along with the point system. I got pointed for being out of work due to a threatened miscarriage."
good,I try my hardest and I love my customers but every time I am at work I feel I am not not appreciated and my work performance is poor. So I go home  feeling horrible.
good,"make good money but have no life, work your tush off and hardly ever get the incentives and raises they dangle in front of you. everything you do is watched and timed."
good,Not worth the pay. Requires strong psychological and emotional fitness as well as an extroverted personality. You have to meet unrealistic expectations.
good,I like working here for the most part they work with your schedule. Managers are hard to work with. But you do gain a lot of money experience and more people skills
good,Management is very sketchy and they like to mess up the schedule to associates who work hard for the company. It is also a very stressful environment to work in
good,"The people are great and the job can be fun once you get past the politics. Every year they take more benefits but demand more work from associates. Upper management doesn't know what it takes to work on the floor, so they often have unrealistic expectations."
good,I was stressed and tired all the time. Physically and mentally demanding. I was cheated out of overtime where they forced me to cut some of my hours. Management lies and is manipulative.
good,You work for a large unorganized company that only cares about their benefits. You work to not be acknowledged for what you do. You’re allowed flexible schedules which is nice but it’s hard to feel as a part of a team.
good,"Great co workers, pays well. Closed only one day a year. It's a place where if your aren't in with someone then you get unfair treatment at the store level. They don't replace people when they quit or get fired and expect the rest of the 5 employees to do the work of 10-15 employees. So I would only recommend this place for something quick and you don't plan on staying."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart gets you what you put into it. If you work hard, follow ""one best way"", and make yourself noticeable, you will be a prime candidate for advancement."
good,You requested a day off months in advance they still recline it. No cover how are they can say there is no coverage  for weeks way before you asked. There are some employees at Walmart  can get ever day off they asked for.
good,In short I wouldn't be looking for a different job if I was happy there the coworkers are good but management sucks they want robots not people and if you don't play kiss up you will be treated like you're worthless
good,Walmart is a not the job if u have family . The people that u work with make your life hard. The work load is overwhelming and mangers just play the blame game ..
good,I was sick due to black mold under my bed. I loved working there. but 3 sick days for six months is dumb. It makes it so if your really sick you might lose your job
good,Absolutely the busiest pharmacy where i have worked and the most stressful by far.   I would not recommend Walmart as an employer to anyone in any capacity.   I have always worked 55-60 hours per week.  Walmart was very rewarding financially but the most stressful by far.  Ever increasing work loads and poor decision making by corporate created an atmosphere where it was difficult to settle in.  Once again i would not recommend Walmart as an employer.  Omnicare  is what i would recommend.
good,If you are desperate apply. If you are drug- free and not a felon you will get hired. Don’t have any expectations of your co-workers and you won’t get disappointed.
good,The job is easy to me because i am very familiar with the job duties i do complete all my tasks ahead of schedule. And i do have a get the job done attitude.
good,"Most people say negative things about there job because they hate working. My case is a little different. I believe Walmart did well for me. Helped me understand the customer's way of thinking. Helped me understand the human mind. Really helped me notice how passive-aggressive everyone really is. How hasty society has made us. With technology right there at our fingertips. We become addicted to having things the way we want it instantly, and when a customer doesn't get what they want they go off. Luckily Walmart hired me to dumb down those types of situations. But stepping back and really looking at how Walmart changed me. No matter what no regrets."
good,Its nice to work at Walmart because they follow the rules a lot however sometimes the environment can become exhausting because of customers. The management is understanding and professional.
good,"Used to be a good place, but now management are very unprofessional. If your good making supervisors happy pretending that you like them, you will be able to do whatever you want, but if you are not like that, forget it, don’t even try to work in this place. Is going to be your worse work experience ever."
good,Just another steering wheel driving position. Better than most mega carriers if this is your type of driving job. If you like the otr lifestyle and super easy driving job then this is your place.
good,Walmart is a okay company to work for it has it up and downs it really very from store to store. There really flexible which is the best thing but management is really a down side for me
good,Typical day at work is extremely busy without appropriate helps. Manager is lazy and not knowledgable and relied most on staffs. Techs got cut back hour no help
good,There is a lot of opportunity at Walmart.The company is going thru a lot of changes.. It a was good job at times but became to time consuming and I wanted more family time.
good,"Es una buena empresa, la cuestión es que Gerencia. Regional y Recursos Humanos no  llevan a cabo los lineamientos marcados por la empresa, todo lo hacen a como les caigas a ellos, aunque la política marcada diga otra cosa"
good,"Nearly, 4 years at Walmart. Every position, Ive held. Came with a Complete LACK of Proper Training. A couple of hours on a computer, is Nothing to prepare one for the ""monster"" known as Retail."
good,The best part of working at Walmart was the proximity to my home. I enjoyed working there although I never felt valued. Turnover was constant as others felt under appreciated and under compensated.
good,Please don’t ask me what is so good about working here. They are very greedy and always want more from you. More more more. If you can’t do the job you’ll be replaced quick.
good,"It's busy all the time, they like to give lots of work to do so theirs no free time. I've leaned to liked that its what I like to be busy all the time, management is't great it might seem like there doing stuff but in the long run they really are not doing a lot at all. the hardest part of my job is the drama of the other departments. The most enjoyable part is when knowing you can probably solve a issue better than some of the management that they have."
good,"The job is ok, it is a career opportunity if you didn’t choose to go to college. Everyone there is pretty young, and are good people for the most part; however do to everyone being young gives of a high school vibe"
good,It's a ok place to work if this is your first job. Not much respect giving to those who deserve it. Mostly it's a job that dont offer overtime but complains when tasks are not finished in the work day even tho you might have to finish the prior shifts tasks
good,"Walmart has done me justice, in the form of getting me through college; but after that I would not advise anyone to have a career here it compromises your soul."
good,Just needs to care about associates a little bit more and then the flexibility needs to be fixed cap 2 is one of the hardest jobs in there and one of the less paid people in there
good,"A day on the job at Walmart is like going into a fugue state where nothing matters and very little of value happens. The work is so emotionally draining that you wish you could just shut off your feelings while working. The management is there, but usually distant unless they need something from you. You can set your own hours and they're as flexible as you want, which is the only really good part, and occasionally someone will put some leftover food in the break room. Do not expect any kind of appreciation in the form of bonuses or compensation."
good,"Working at Walmart during the night shift, you should have enough to stay busy throughout your shift, but the state of the store at the shift's end suggests the associates don't put much effort into their jobs.The shift typically begins with finishing and cleaning up what the previous shift couldn't do, which is frequently a significant amount."
good,"Walmart is fast paced and can be exciting at times.Sometimes, we are understaffed and then other times we aren't. Just a very fast paced environment that changes every day."
good,love the environment and the associates are very friendly  lovely services and nice customers overall  just looking for something new to educate myself more
good,"Little to no schedule flexibility. Managers know your name but not more than that. The sales floor is pretty easy work, except during the holidays. Lots of rude customers every day. They are known to cut hours. Absolutely no overtime allowed. Can be very mentally and emotionally draining over time. You don't feel valued as an employee."
good,"Working the morning shift was nice until afternoon when unfriendly customers shopped. A set schedule was also very helpful. I Gained a lot of customer service experience working at a store that was labeled ""Complex"""
good,"Typical chain. No respect for pharmacist or staff. Bottom line conquer. "
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for a number of reasons. I didn't have a long commute to work. They offer great benefits. Some of my coworkers where friendly.
good,"They constantly want us to go faster, get more done, yet I get reprimanded for moving fast around the store. It makes no sense, and kills motivation. With this speed over quality attitude, comes issues that customers immediately notice."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to start, get some work experience. Then after a few years i would move on and look a better job, unless you enjoy working there."
good,"If you don't have a good manager you'll hate yourself. Also if your looking to move up in the company, your position is not promised. They delete job codes and make you reapply every year it seems like."
good,"Its an ok temp job, deal with a lot of stupid stuff. The scheduling is rediculous and if you don't have an open availability you get cut hours. Things have gone down hill"
good,Need more interaction with management where they actually listen. Could use less negativism. If working with more than one person there should be more cooperation between associates.
good,"It was cool, the people I worked over were great, I was able to build a strong team with employee morale and what not but the managers above me were rude and disrespectful and consistently treated  everyone else like the lower class. I was almost relieved that I was able to walk away from the job before getting fired because my supervisor wanted smoke with me"
good,"Despite not being talked about, you will definitely notice and feel that there is still racial discrimination in the branch where I used to work. Don't want to expound on this topic anymore. But you can still make inquiries from present workers at the branch where I used to work."
good,A typical day for me is selling guns an ammo pulling out items from the back and stocking them. the best part to the job is interacting with the customers.
good,"Walmart had there ups and downs, but over all they do their best as they can which is almost all people ask for. Is by trying your best and always keeping a positive attitude."
good,When i was working at walmart i learned fairly fast that unless you are working on day shift your work life will be bad you days will be long and your bosses will be mean and rude.
good,"This place is an excellent place to start your working life and stepping out into the adult world. Walmart stores as a whole accomplish this, I feel. Working as a front end associate is by far the hardest part of the store, at least outside of management (or even including management in my opinion)."
good,Not a bad short term  employer  the store is nice and compassionate but corporate is a blood sucking leach that dose not care about its employees at all
good,"Its a good job if you need something. Not bad if you need a goal in life either, Store Managers make good money. The work can be fast paced with either lots to do or nothing at all."
good,If you’re looking for lots of hours and live in a smaller area you can’t rely on them. Company has started to care more about themselves over any one else in last few years. they don’t pay Holiday pay for any holiday. And you’re only allowed to call out 5 times in 6 months and the more you call out the less quarterly bonus you get.
good,"I here talks often of the good ol days of when people used to love working at walmart, but as someone who is working there now I dont see it. We're always understaffed no matter how much we beg management for more help and expectations are unreasonable with the coverage we have. Overall not a great place to work, decent pay and benefits if you can make it to full time but I wouldn't stay here for more than a few years"
good,It’s was a great place to work for the most part but managers were bad and refused to help with personal problems or family problems I honestly wish I could go back but just as a regular worker
good,Always something to do. I've learned and developed more communication skills with customers. Only negative thing is over the summer your hours get cut depending on what department you work in.
good,"Starting out as a regular associate, there are plenty of opportunities to move up with the company. It depends whether you want to put forth the effort or not."
good,Organização seria e organizada com atividades de investimento e resultados envolvendo colaboradores e clientes.
good,"Good enough place to work when you have to work!  Like a lot of employers now, there's a heavy focus on saving pennies (sometimes at the expense of operational efficiency} -- razor thin margins in retail pretty much dictate that part.  However, I hear the company culture changed dramatically after Mr. Walton passed away -- he cultivated a 'family' atmosphere.  The bean counters and consultants have taken over now, hence the priority to maximize the bottom line.  it's a good fit for some, especially if they're either early in career and have time to learn the business and climb the ladder or very late in career and making the last go round before retirement."
good,"Rotina tranquila,não havia pressão por parte de encarregados,havia metas todos os dia para se cumprir."
good,Wal-Mart is a great job if you are planning to achieve management position and make a career out of it. Every day can be a different challenge and fun.
good,"My experience at walmart was hectic at best and agonizing at worse. While the work itself wasnt hard, the customers, who had come to expect a very specific thing from Walmart, treated employees like dirt. I was terminated from my position there due to my grandfather passing away. I tried to put in for bereavement with them but when I came back I had found that the computer had fired me and the Manager who would NOT work with me was fired a week after I was."
good,"This company had started out as a good environment to work , but over the years I have noticed the management does not care about their employees, they show too much favoritism to the minorities that at this point I fell like the minority any more, it never was like that, They don't appreciate family time with our families for the holidays you can't even request the day off they count it against you, you get no time and half for working a holiday or holiday time. I am ready to move on to receptionist or front desk job. I do love my current job of Money Center Associate if only they would let me stay there and do my job."
good,Great place to learn retail management would at times would just throw you in to the position but it builds you to understand how fast you could learn on the fly and when faced with big tasks you also learn the sense of urgency to get things done in a timely manner
good,Working to hard for change not happy at all managment can get a sensitivity class I don't have much to say about the company just wish I had another job
good,"At Walmart I enjoyed my job, I was able to help people at times. I learned a lot in the past 9 years. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to teach and train people and watch them move up in the company."
good,"If you just need a job,this works. They will hire anyone. But managers can be catty about anything you need help with. They don’t approve most requested days off."
good,"Tough to balance work life mix"
good,"All of the employees are not afraid of being themselves there, which is a blessing and a curse. While it is fun to work there at times, other times people would goof off too much. There are a lot of regulations to keep people from being over worked however the system does not protect the employees as much as it should."
good,"Inconsistent schedules, management will change your schedule and not ask or tell you and if you’re not a favorite, forget about your days off request. I did learn a lot and grateful for that. The store you work at may not follow policy. Don’t leave early or you get points if your Manager doesn’t follow up."
good,Working at walmart can be difficult if you want your hard work to always be noticed. On the other hand though it is a great way to learn your strengths in the workplace area.
good,"Busy, not to stressful, I learned a lot of new things. Management was ok. Hardest part was heavy lifting. Most enjoyable was my co workers. I enjoyed working here but could not get full time hours."
good,"It is like most retail jobs. It is a good place to work if you have no previous work experience, so good for a first time worker. It is fast-paced most of the time."
good,"I really liked the customers, I loved the CSMs, but the managers were unmoving when it came to my schedule. I tried to make sure that I could work here and be at university. I had classes four days a week, out of town all day. they wanted me to work the ""other"" four days a week. when I left, my last day, my manager avoided me and didn't tell me I had to do an exit interview. Another manager had to tell me"
good,Walmart was a gteat place to work initially but over time the morale of the place decline. Many changes. Communication needed improvement. No good mgr
good,Walmart has a bad reputation about not treating everyone the same. Favoritism is in every store. I worked for the company for 18 years and I've seen a lot of people come and go. They have a huge turnover rate. More than most retailers.
good,"The management teams and corporate doesnt care about you. No one is willing to help you or work with you. "
good,It was fast paced and never a dull moment. My favorite part about working there though has to be the people I met and the bonds that Ive made along the way. And the worst part had to be the managers that never seemed to be on the same page with each other
good,"Good job for someone starting out wanting to gain experience. There is opportunity to move up, the company seems to be going to more part time employees and eliminating benefits. Several layers of management that always find something that's not to their liking, and every correction is eventually passed down to the bottom rung. Corporate is always making changes without allowing them to play out, and testing them in larger fully staffed stores expecting them to transition flawlessly to understaffed lower payroll stores."
good,"poor management, easy work. Low standards and low effort required, not very fulfilling. I only worked there for a few months before needing to move out of necessity. I don't regret it, but I wouldn't work there by choice again."
good,I worked at an understaffed store with all new management that seemed very new and overwhelmed and overstressed and it affected employees and performance of employees
good,"Can be stressful at times. Handling customers needs or questions. To be able to move at a fast pace. Stock, bin and unload trucks. Load milk and eggs."
good,"Need better management at that job, it was slack of help for me and I didn’t get enough help that I needed for my department .i ran my job position by myself when I needed a lot of help but I managed to do the best that I could"
good,Good benefits and hours. My customers were very nice to me. They always came to my line because they knew I was the fastest. Get them in and out. It was not a long wait.
good,"The job tends to be very physically demanding. Doing the job is fairly simple, once you get the hang of the job becomes monotonous. The primary criticism would be management. There can be bad managers that heavily backseat drive your job and make it more miserable. It just depends on luck in the end. If that was not bad, there are the occasional customers that leave a bad taste in your mouth. All in all, this job requires a thick skin and a indifferent mindset to survive for long."
good,Available upon request since I currently work there I reserve the right to discuss at any interview    I am thankful for the opportunities and growth within Walmart and hold no animosity
good,If you need a check then I would recommend Walmart. They are not good with working with your specially school kids and they don’t to much care about days that you need off even if you request in advance. They make you learn multiple areas in the store so they can use you.
good,Walmart wasn't bad at all I miss it out there but it was a lot going on at one time. But I learn the good and bad things happens for a reason and there's always more blessings i worked my butt off at any job I get and that will never stop
good,The pay is better at Walmart now. But many changes are being made now at Walmart which changes many things and some are losing their management jobs and having to step down to lower grade jobs to keep position at Walmart. Management jobs have so many tasks now that it’s hard to talk to management regarding changes or important matters regarding your position.
good,its basically work and more work. The typical day started with assignments and briefings. lots of times changes are made in the middle of changes.coordication is extremely lacking
good,"Walmart is a good job, they just need to offer more rotated weekends to their associates and offer more vacation time. The job itself is a very hard working and not as stressful job. I feel that any one has the ability to succeed in Walmart’s work place if they put forth the necessary work."
good,"management didn't treat us right at all they never planed anything for us to do when we didn't have a truck they basically gave us last nights work that we worked on they only cared about themselves,on the truck we were under staffed so we wouldn't get done till near 6"
good,"Getting overnight daily planning by reviewing the absent list for the day so you can plan effectively if there is a call in or not."
good,"It is a good job for benefits.  Even part time can get health care after a year. Did not like the scheduling policy.You had to work when ever they wanted you to, no set schedules. I felt like  I was in prison always expected to be at two places at the same time."
good,"You don't know what's going to happen until you clock-in for work. There are very productive days and then there are other days that are slower. From what I've learned is how to manage my time better and my critical skills have sharpened. I'm very happy to help customers and make sure that they are able to get what they need."
good,"I was honestly surprised at the work effort some people give off , it’s like they want to watch the company fail , the people that actually work never get any motivation moving up , instead you’re taunted you’re going to get replaced. Their scheduling didn’t matter to the employees, basically oh you’re not on for a week? Figure it out buddy! Pretty upsetting considering I was kid out of high school looking forward to his first job , this is how you treat people."
good,"Often had only 9 hours between shifts. Advancement was available only after years of employment in positions that couldn't pay rent. Otherwise typical retail experience. Usual problems of slow times and rush times. Holiday madness for better or worse. Would recommend as a retail job, with the caveat that all retail jobs are fairly terrible."
good,"people are good but in order to get more hours, they seek managers to tell them about their work, more of politics and preference game than a fair work environment."
good,"Can be interesting at times and can change jobs to fulfill interests. To be management, you are required to have open availability and be available at a moments notice. Demands full loyalty from it's associates. Policies are only followed if it doesn't interfere with customer service. Always short staffed due to scheduling system that doesn't provide hours for proper staffing. Expected to do multiple jobs and take care of multiple areas during shift."
good,They don’t follow Walmart policies . They make you do other areas work. The managers don’t make all associates do their jobs. And don’t get the right equipment for the job to be performed well.
good,I worked with Walmart for almost 4 years. I tried multiple times to move up or become full time in the company but was always turned down. The management there were okay. I worked for 3 different stores & the last one was the worst of them all just because of poor management. Was terminated due to attendance (2 ER trips put me over the 4.5 points allowed) & did not have anymore protected PTO to cover it.
good,"experiencia en inventarios acomodo de mercancía, recibo de mercancía y cuidado de la mercancía y el uso del sistema."
good,"My first job was as a cashier here, where I moved to customer service. Anyone can become a CSM here (manager) which makes it harder to work at. Your coworkers now tell you what to do. Pay per hour goes up by $0.10 for every year you work there, with a 10% discount for employees. Closing shifts at most stores have you leaving at 11:30pm, making it harder for students."
good,"The management only care about their friends and who kisses their butts. They do not listen to the employees, have to fight to get a day off and there is absolutely no help."
good,I got so tired of earning my paycheck and everybody else's to because they were family or friends or they missed up to them they disappear when u need them therefore u have along line more than one person should always be in garden center at all times because garden has more than checking customers out going on you have to help customers load u have to go get propane u have to get products down
good,Customer always comes first and is always right. Fast work pace. Learned to work fast and efficient. You leave your job work at work at the end of your shift.
good,"Management needs more training, and needs more Asset Protection Associates.The hardest part of my job was getting ten apprehension a month. the most enjoyable time that i had at Walmart will have to be the customers."
good,"I really enjoyed my job and still do to a degree, but a lot of people play favorites. Some managers are great, some aren't."
good,I’ve been with Walmart along time.  I loved it here. Recently they made changes and now it’s horrible.   We as associates mattered at one time now we are just a number. It’s a shame. I truelly miss the old Walmart.   People are hired now and no one stays. A high turnover rate.  management don’t even get me started on that topic lol
good,Standing at cash register all day. Fast paced store. The management team was friendly but does not keep you informed ad to benefits and daily expectations.
good,"The job wasn’t too hard and the work was consistent, it also pays fairly well. However keeping the job was trouble. Just in the first week of me working there 3 people were fired and they tend to let people go randomly. I got injured on one of my days off and needed surgery. I tried going to work and even asked to just greet people at the door but I was rejected. Instead they gave me a 12 week leave and then 3 weeks into it they fired me."
good,Is pretty good but after a while people just start slacking and not much of a help. Management was alright some were good others didnt know how to manage.
good,"Good work place nice people to work with, safe and clean working environment, Recommend this employer to others looking for a career in retail setting."
good,"I would actually recommend walmart to anybody seeking a job that pays decently. Though I would make sure to inform anybody who goes to work for walmart that, it is in fact hard at times and the management sucks. It can be very draining both physically and mentally but can be worth it if you don't have any better options."
good,Some days are good when they schedule properly and have the help that is needed to clean a parking lot. Other days an employee could be all alone to clean up 200 carts.
good,"All in aall I did like my job there. like any other job it has its ups and downs. Really it is what you make it, I think it is a good first job but not a career"
good,"Easy work but, customers are flip of the coin whether they're good or bad and management is for the most part aside from two or three absolutely horrendous."
good,"It is a decent place to work, certainly when management doesnt have their heads up their a** which is most of the time. Many opportunites for advancement."
good,"The job was OK. I met some really cool people and enjoyed most of my time there. But I felt like when you work at Walmart, you have no life outside of it. It’s hard to be social on your days off because of how tired you would be. And I felt as if they didn’t care about their employees as much as I think you should."
good,A typical work day at Walmart consists of break box's and returns. In order to do your job right you need to be able to put everything in these boxes away. I learned how to work in a fast convenient manner. The hardest part was being pulled to other sections of the store to help put stock away and also get all of your work done.
good,Local bom e colaborativo ajuda bastante os colaboradores
good,"Very poor communication, they tell  something different every day. Lots of we are supposed to do it this way, but this is faster so, or I don't know, I don't remember."
good,"Working for Walmart is very stressful. Aside from good benefits and fairly good pay, the management is rude, abrasive, rude, and incredibly hard to work with."
good,"The over task you while understaff and they will get you I  trouble for not accomplishing most of the work, just because you prioritize your associates as management (quality)  rather than the quantity of work."
good,All hourly associates are treated the same....  Education and past experience are never taken into consideration.  Very bad communication with management and empoyees.
good,I have worked at multiple Walmart’s and the job culture was different in each store. I would recommend the company but not store 2291. The management at the store is poor. But the company has many benefits and when placed in the right store many opportunities.
good,"They act if they was going to hire me as full time....I was the only cashier getting off late...."
good,"As a first job, it isn't so bad. At first I felt quite nervous taking on such a job for the first time in my life, but it came to me at a relatively short time period. My coworkers, who are now several of my close friends, are what really truly made the job worthwhile, as well as some very good, understand, relatable and level headed management staff. Unfortunately, what eventually drew me away from this job was the inability to have a flexible schedule after their recent PTO (Paid Time Off) change and more than a few unfortunate encounters with rude, impatient and overall insufferable customers. Overall I had a decent time working here, but I would definitely think twice about working for this or most other big retail companies again."
good,Walmart doesn’t care anything about it’s employees it’s all about the money they don’t have enough coverage for each department making employees cover other departments most of the time there is only one person in a department at a time
good,"I understand, to a degree, Walmart looking to technology for dependable work. Too many people calling off or not doing their share of work. Think Walmart should reward the good workers with more hours and overtime."
good,My review about the place I liked it sometimes but didn’t like when people come in and steal and latter I didn’t like working there they don’t care about there employee
good,Poor job work place management could be much better have high expectations of us but have low understanding of our work as a team. Needs lots of work for our store to be at it's best potential.
good,"I enjoyed the time I was working at Walmart. Everyone was nice an friendly, when I needed help or something they would help. I liked the hours I worked."
good,If you enjoy people and serving their needs a cashier at Walmart would be a good place for you.   Meeting and greeting new folks and cashing them out in a friendly matter.
good,Good people work there but management really sucks..sometimes no training for workers they are just thrown in to fight for themselves..they don't allow overtime you have to take long lunches to get over time off
good,"This is a good place to work if you have a busy schedule because you can ask for you availability, however they are very stingy with hours and there isn't much job security. Hard work is not really recognized and there is a lot of unfair favoritism."
good,Management only cares about management. They see employees as replacements on a daily. When I worked there I wasn't appreciated for any of the work I did. No matter how hard I tried it wasn't good enough.
good,Good place to work and room for growth and to relocate opportunities. Worked there for years and had an enjoyable experience. Needed a new career opportunity to grow more
good,"I have seen other Walmart’s and they all seem pretty great but the one that I work at, can not hold staff and a lot of the higher up managers aren’t very nice or helpful and the place is just falling apart."
good,"After working with the company for over 5 years and returning after maternity leave, I am needing certain hours, having to change things up after having a baby. The company seems unwilling to assist me with such needs, therefore I am in search of a new field as well as something for flexible for me and my family."
good,"Walmart is an overall great place to work , they benefits and opportunities they offer their associates are phenomenal, although my experience with some staff at that particular location or even shopping there at times were unsatisfactory, the experience of working there is what you make it and can be a wonderful experience and opportunity to meet a lot of new people as well as provide for you’re family. It is a fun and social environment"
good,I have CP I was there for 10 months and they fired me for literally doing my job poor very poor management they don't like working with people that have disabilitys they look to fire those people asap
good,"Reviews of Walmart vary across the nation however the Walmart I worked at provided me with a flexible schedule along with some basic training for my position as a front end cashier. The management however seemed to take little notice of my introduction into the field of work as turnover rate is high in retail and simply assigned me to jobs which I was unaware of how to complete such as handling a cash register. Most of what I learned was on the job which required me to ""figure it out"". After two or so weeks, I'd figure out the basic routine but after that I figured out that it was all the job had to offer. Unless you plan on climbing the Walmart corporate ladder, I recommend searching for a career of higher value such as learning sales or perusing a college degree."
good,I woul recommend working for wal mart through the company because the temp agencies want to slave you and take all your hard earned money. Plus wal mart treats you very differently when you are not working through their company.
good,"A typical work day at Walmart is steady moving from the time you come in to the time you leave. Things i learned with Walmart is people management, sales trends, merchandising, and store planning. The culture of Walmart is saving money and living better. The hardest part of my job is finding talent. finding people that want totwork and take pride in their work. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my associates and customers."
good,"Walmart is a decent first job, but don't expect to make a career out of it. Management is OK, and the hardest part of being a cart pusher is... pushing the carts."
good,They is no structure. Each day is different in the most unorganized way. They lack the necessary skills to train associates to align them with company guidelines. There is absolutely no training for hourly associates unless you are an hourly supervisor.
good,"They fired me because they said I was tardy, when I was always on time for work. So I went to file for unemployment, and Walmart declined it and I had a hearing with them and they did not show up."
good,"Over the course of five years with the company, I saw many changes. The company as a whole is adaptable to change, however, my last assignment was riddled with a continuous sense of panic. Daily anxiety in my specific location was not commiserate with outcomes. I spent more time away from my family which placed undo stress on my family relationships. I would rather make less money than deal with the stressors of continual panic."
good,"I've worked at walmart for over 2 years now and I've seen a lot of positive managers, but 65% of the time the assistant managers are abusing their power. Few of them actually work and know due process the supervisors do the majority of the grunt work and they get the credit. Their is a lot of false information and promises given to dedicated people who are overworked. and"
good,"I have met many long term friends at walmart. Walmart was agreat company to work for back when I first started in 2001, now not so much. the company constantly changes things and without a union the associates have no one to protect their best interests"
good,"Staff and Floater Pharmacist, worked at various stores in and around phoenix , Scottsdale area, Maricopa and Yuma.  worked in high volume stores which does 300-400 prescriptions per day"
good,"Worked there for a bit, management was good with employee needs. Fast paced work and hard work. Is a good job if you’re looking to continue an education."
good,"They prefer you to be faster on the register, as the track your average check out times. I was cross trained on the service desk, so when ever they got too backed up I would be pulled off the register to help get the line down. When I worked there they never accepted doctors notes so everyone would always come in sick so they wouldn't be written up for calling out."
good,Loves to find ways to not pay you what your worth. Weird pay structure makes it easy to lose money when changing positions.  Constant restructuring makes it hard to know what your job will entail from month to month.
good,My typical day at work is that I’m the girl that works the night shift working all the freight for morning crew not having anything to do. I’m a night manager that wants our management team to have team work but not the case when you have management to throw shade about your job performance.
good,"Was a pharmacy technician. They didn’t really care about their employees, if the customer blamed us or was mad at us my boss sided with them all the time. Never stood up for us techs. I like what I did but there’s too much drama in the company to stay anymore."
good,"Wal-Mart is a company that shows young workers what it is like to have to deal with all types of customers and to always be positive no matter the situation. I believe I learned a lot about how I would never treat people at Wal-Mart and at the same time how to have a good working relationship with upper management. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who were rude and the easiest part was ensuring all isles were clean. the workplace culture was okay there were negatives and positives from person to person but that is expected in every work place. A typical day for me was arriving and opening the garden centre, checking customers out, watering plants, cleaning up isles, loading bags of dirt, and unpacking new items for the store."
good,it is OK to work here. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Not much i learned that i didn't already know. get 1 hr lunch is really the only plus to the job. smoke shack is too far away from building takes your whole 15 min break to get out there and by the time u have any time for yourself you have to go back.
good,"- Hard working days with little pay"
good,"Relaxed environment, great coworkers, good starting pay. Poor management. Do not plan on staying there for 2+ years. I recommend going to a trade school or getting a degree for better pay. This job is great for first jobs, students or a part time/second job."
good,"Worked part-time as a Pharmacy Assistant, hours are kept to a minimum and pay is not that great. Great coworkers, but terrible customers and pay system."
good,"I worked there for three months and it was mediocre, to say the least. the people in my area could get a little and I did my best to provide exceptional customer service."
good,"It's a job, it pays the bills. For the most part there's good days and bad days.When you have managers with egos and heartless. Is when the lack of communication, respect, and many stressful days hit hard. If you have a team of supportive and encouraging managers,you been blessed.The company constantly make changes within the company. Which hardly benefit the associates. It use to be a great job to work for, with flexible hours. Not so much anymore. I'm grateful for my job, it could be worse. I have work with some wonderful people. Had some great bosses. That have taken time to share their knowledge and support."
good,"Working at walmart was not great, there is a lot of attitude and not much leadership. They play favorites and don't provide safe environments. Pay was okay."
good,"Really complex environment, management is mediocre. Benefits are worth it though; provides plenty of insight on learning new skills and equipment management"
good,"When I first started working for Walmart I loved it, but after a couple years they began making a lot of changes. The management was not good. We were majorly short staffed and they wouldn’t hire anyone ."
good,Walmart could've been a great place for a career but the field I worked in was not paying enough for the work. I enjoyed my fellow employees and loved all the customers. They just didn't want to pay for the work that was being done and the hours and no life at home.
good,"Management is lacking, staff feels they aren't heard, there's favoritism, staff isn't all reprimanded equally for the same infraction, too many managers with different goals and opinions make working on the floor very stressful. Good employees don't get recognition for their work."
good,"Overall good place to work"
good,"Overall my experience at walmart was a positive one. I would like to see them be more active in understanding the everyday worker. Now i know some will always work harder than others, but managment is suppose to get the most put of all employees."
good,"There are no chances to advance at this time due to the restructuring going on in the company. Too much favoritism and not following policy. Overall, working at Wal-Mart is ok if you just want something to pay bills, but not as a career."
good,"It's not the worst, however you will be expected to do more with less and you might be an escape goat for upper management. This job has no real loyalties but the pay is so-so and the hours are consistent."
good,"Fast pace environment with an organized list of tasks to preform daily ."
good,"Wal-Mart was a great place to work with great benefits, back in 2007 but after policies changes a few years ago everything started going down hill for employees, especially associates with seniority, cut back benefits and cut back pay raises, so that left me on the same pay for over 3 years while new associates where already making almost as much as employees with seniority with no pay compensation at alfor the changes"
good,"this was an ok place to work overnight, management often displayed appreciation for hard work of overnight associates. Communication between shifts was often a big issue."
good,Walmart has me constantly stress out and add tasks on top of your task just so they won’t have to do it. Scheduling is bad and they’re slow about doing everything.
good,"I transferred to another Walmart,  it wasn't the same after a few months. The people were good people,  but the stores structure was changing.  I knew how to do my job, but was limited at how to complete tasks."
good,They are ok not the best company to work for. Depending on your manager they work with your schedule. It’s veey busy so it keeps you occupied for your shift.
good,"A lot of my co-workers were fun to work with but the work itself was extremely labor-intensive. Well, my first two months there were pretty fun. My coworkers are friendly and my supervisors were nice. The manager though was often very rude to me and didn't acknowledge that I existed. Overall I had a very nice experience there but the manager made it the worst job ever"
good,"Find out exactly what the position you applied for does and do it exactly. Do what your told,ask questions. Help your associates and customers always come first."
good,Didn’t care about employees. Didn’t take family emergencies seriously and demanding to put the company first before family. Hours were decent job security wasn’t certain
good,"The walmart I worked for was in Wyoming, some places are not as easy to work in as other areas of the store You have to choose your areas carefully and learn as much as you can"
good,Well Walmart was my first job and I appreciate the experience and time I spent there but I feel like things could’ve went better. It seemed as if I was miss treated because I was leaving for the Army.
good,"Good place to work, wish a lot of things were different but it’s an ever changing company. I feel it would be better if management was more hands on with associates and were available to help and teach on hand."
good,"I started as a Department Manager just as Walmart was changing their processes and they have tried to streamline things by expecting managers to do much more in the same amount of time.  One example is that we used to be able to work on our process (section work and price changes) all day, then we had to be done by 2 pm, now we have to be done by 1 pm, but the amount of work we are required to get done has not changed.  Not only has our timetable been shortened, but I frequently have to help in other departments to run freight while still being expected to get my processes done by 1 pm."
good,They treat you like a kid and expect you to fall in their loopholes so that you are totally depending on them as your job and not career focused on people as individuals... Very nice idea but extremely difficult for hard working people... That have responsibilities and/or bills
good,Eh the job wasn’t bad but management really was bad and had tons of favorites. If you don’t get cool with the managers expect to be screwed over. They promise every 30 days to have a one on one with you to discuss any problems but they never do therefore you’ll feel left unheard. The job itself was easy money though. It’s fun at first but give it a few months you’ll be looking for a new job
good,Poor people relations with employees. management tends to treat everyone the same. That's okay if people WERE all the same. The majority of the workforce is 18 to 35. I'm above that age bracket and don't appreciate being treated that way. Management is unwilling to work with employees for transfer requests.
good,Working here was very boring. The assistant managers were horrible. They were never around which caused customers to get mad at you. They don’t care about employees which is why their turnover is extremely high.
good,When I was with the company it was near impossible to get full status/benefits managers weren’t awful they worked with me on a lot of out of work situations I had going on in my life I.E UTO and taking me off schedule
good,The manager that I was working under did not handle an incident that happened at work during my shift when it was brought to his attention.  Mostly for this reason I am not upset that the job/position ended as it did.
good,It's a good place to work at least it was two years ago. We had amazing CSMs and Managers that actually cared and tried to work with you. Now we have CSMs that avoid doing their jobs and worse than that they talk bad about you behind your back. If you want to transfer to another store or if you want another position? Good luck chances are you'll never get anywhere with that.
good,"I started working in the back unloading trucks, after a little over 1 year I was promoted to overnight support manager.  After 1 year i transfered to the unloading supervisor second shift. Then stepped down to the dairy department for 6 months then transfered to customer host assets protection"
good,Great place to work but management can make it difficult. I still love my job I just need to find something better that I also enjoy. Plus more money would be an added bonus.
good,The best part of woring at Walmart is the the people you work with & get to know. Even getting to know the customer's. It's a great place to work and grow.
good,"It was a challenge trying to get extra hours, they most likely will not hire you for the job that you are wanting. The management is rude unless they favor you. They hate working around school schedules"
good,Ive learned how to cash handle...gave wonderful training in Customer Service.....Learned price changes.shelf labels...changes in modular.....the best part of this job was meeting hundreds of customers and helping every single one....and the rewards were all the great comment cards I received.The hardest part...is you have to listen and do what 10 different managers say...and of course there are the rude customers and shop lifters
good,It's not a bad job just never had a chance to advance and hour cuts made it hard to make a living the managers were good people who I got along with great the job was pretty easy basically stocking and making sure the areas were clean
good,"It was a good place to make money to pay the bills, but Walmart does not treat their people very well. "
good,When I first started working at Walmart I looked forward to going in. The atmosphere was always good and you could have fun while working. Over the few short years I've worked there its slowly gone down hill and I've noticed a drastic change. Looking for something/somewhere different.
good,"Decent people to work with, Work On Management, Job Security wad good and hours were good, But I couldn't handle the shift, the work was pretty difficult to learn, but once you got it down, it was easy."
good,"Very Productive with unreasonable expectations. Great Pay Though! Process driven workday, lifting, carrying pulling merchandise to destinations. Lots of training for specialized tasks, most jobs are simple enough to master in 2-4 weeks"
good,"Competitive retailer with strong drive to accomplish goals and push KPIs.  Will achieve at all costs, including at the expense of their personnel. Highly competitive and stressful.  Rewards the bold, determined, and driven.  Will work yourself to the bone in the pursuit of success."
good,unloading trucks and setting up pallets. i learned how to operate electric pallet jacks. Management was very interactive but did not not give enough time for breaks. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck.
good,"Absolutely loved the other staff members on the first day, felt welcomed and like I had a lot of opportunity to get better at the job before they would get fed up with it, Management was firm yet fair and I respect the actions they took."
good,"The actual job itself isn't bad at all, you get the occasional rude customer but the majority of the time it's just people who want to get in and get out. Your experience will depend mostly on your managers and your relationship with them, at my old store I had good managers and enjoyed my work for the most part, but after transferring to a new store I can't wait to leave, mainly because of my manager. If you become friends with the managers you get a better shot at ""moving up the ladder"" but I honestly wouldn't consider Walmart for a career, just decent money until you can start a real career."
good,Walmart has a strict absent policy you could only miss 3 days a year so addentice was hard for me the whole time i was there. Management were always hard on me i became a supervisor pretty quick but they never hired help so were alway understaff so i was doing 3 people job everyday
good,They had a system for stocking that was very advanced and easy to understand. It automated your hours of work based on the amount of stock you had to put on shelves. Most days I would have about 11+ hours of work to do in an 8 hour shift for only $10 an hour.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart the people were great the management could be better and the insurance but overall good place to work need to improve management team
good,"Very hard work, standing on your feet for an entire shift and scanning the products huts your back and shoulder.  There are some supervisors that are nice"
good,Walmart management system sucks it is absolutely horrible. The employees are lazy and rude. It was a handful of people who actually did their job. They pay good but it will stress you out
good,Working for Walmart has it good and bad day but overall it’s well paying job a lot respect from manger very friendly. Everybody is very efficient at there jobs
good,"I really didn't like working there the managers treated me horrible. I didn't feel welcomed when I worked their, they Favorited the people that worked there. The pay was okay, but I feel like for the amount of effort I put in, I deserve better."
good,The work aspect is straightforward while the management needs alot of work. Management will not act on issues brought to them pertaining other staff and will outright ignore you if you persist.
good,The goal should always be put customers first and it's not the same as that when I started in the beginning just because they don't have enough help that's why they should hire more people
good,I did not want to write a review. i am only filling this out as a requirement to skip forward to the next step in the process because it will not let me move forward unless i fill this page out
good,"Don't believe all of the horror stories you've heard... but don't disbelieve them either. "
good,"It depends on the State and the stores that you work at to really decide if Walmart is ideal for you. I had the pleasure of working 2 different ones in Arizona and loved it. I went from an Associate to being promoted to General Merchandise Support Manager. The management teams and staff at both locations were great and fun to work with.Of course like any place, there were some managers and staff that were not ideal to work with. The Walmart I came to in Texas was not the ideal place for me to be employed. Most of the management staff were not helpful, knowledgeable and sometimes just refused to help anyone but themselves. As I stated, it really depends on the state and the store you apply with."
good,"Doesn't matter how hard you work or prove yourself, one bad day and it feels like your job is in the line. Constant threats, demanded to stay over, unreasonable workload for all associates."
good,Customers are very rude and some and my management is very rude. Management always take customers side and make you feel dumb sometimes. Management always tired to make it look like your stealing.
good,"Overall, it wasn't a bad place to work if you enjoy working with minimal staff. Most days, you do the job of four people while getting snipped at by customers as to why there aren't more people around to help out. I did learn a lot, my patience and tolerance has definitely grown. I most enjoyed the people I worked with. They were a great bunch of people and if you can't have fun at work, then it makes for a really rough time."
good,Very high turn over with employees and Management. You have to do your job and everyone else’s. Lack of management support or help when needed. Fire and rehire the same people that don’t do work.
good,pueslesfaltamejorar elsueldo y escuchar mas alpersonal
good,"must be punctual, hard working and have flexible hours. Working holidays is mandatory. People are nice and benefits are good. Customers can be terrible, must be patient"
good,Managers were really dramatic. Workers didn’t do there job. Walmart was a good paying job just for the fact that I am a highschool student but it seems to me like our work as employees was never appreciated.
good,I hated working at Walmart the hours where all over the place as was the scheduling the pay wasn't that great and neither where the hours I would not recommend
good,"over 10 years in retail field and look for a better opportunity to move on"
good,Most management was unreasonable. Could not get all the work done in the amount of time given. Work expectations Unreasonable. Most enjoyable part was working with the other people. Also enjoyed learning how to help decorate cakes and cupcakes. Hardest part of the job was spending a lot of time in the freezer and getting ready for inspections.
good,"fast busy"
good,"When I worked there in 2017, it was an ok place to work.  However, I do not feel comfortable reviewing them now since I've been gone from the company for 2 years.   I will say that will I worked there I was treated fairly.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the manager of the store was a very up front and nice person to work with as a store manager,"
good,"I have been at Walmart for almost 21 years, have excellent attendance and have worked several areas of the store. I am willing to learn any new opportunity that is given to me."
good,"It wasn't always stressful there but my position as a deli associate influenced that a bit more than other positions. I learned a few things, such as management sucks and department bosses/directors don't really know what they're doing. The only enjoyable thing was my coworkers and the occasional customer that was feeling nice and would say thank you."
good,"Walmart is always busy, you have to be on it or else your lines will get long and the customers would complain. It’s good for a first job you learn a lot of things and they help you if you need it."
good,Walmart is a easy job just ton of work for you to stay busy if that's the type of job your interested in. There's nothing difficult about it. I've work for walmart for 5 years sometimes there's days where I want to jump off a cliff and there's other days that just goes as plan but if your thinking about working for walmart try it you just might like it
good,It was a very helpful job to help you get the experience in cashier cash handling and customer service. But the management was horrible. They never followed policy but expected us too
good,"Every store is a little different. Hopefully you get into one without favoritism and maybe you'll get hours and chances to promote. Be hungry and put your best foot forward if choosing to stick with the company. Don't rely on favors and such to succeed, make sure they know your name and what you do."
good,The best part of this job is working with my hourly associates on a daily basis. Each one brings their own personality that I enjoy and that is what makes me happy of being their manager. They make me work harder at my duties so they can work just as hard along side me.
good,You are required to work at a fast pace to get things done. Working as a stocker plus the cash register in the pharmacy made it almost impossible to get things done. The managers knew this and still frowned on you.
good,"distribution center, fast paced production.  Decent benefits, medium pay scale.  set schedule on which days you work, but based on production on what time you get done."
good,"The company is changing know doubt, it's not the Walmart it was 15 years ago. Management has their hands tied because everything is done by home office, stores don't have any control anymore. You have a area that you are over but you will do more than just that. The pay is really good, benefits good."
good,watched every minute. not much fun. not allowed to talk to other walmart workers during  hours on clock. Management very pushy. attendance is a big issue. 5 occurances out the door not a happyplace but money not bad.
good,"Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work. It just takes alot of patience of the employees' part. You will be asked to do alot with little or no support, whether it be equipment or guidance. You will be required to work most weekends, holidays and days leading up to holidays."
good,When both managers are there assisting the associates the job gets done efficiently with time for cleaning and other related goals. Whenever one or both of the managers aren't at work the productivity of the entire department is strongly affected because the store is already understaffed. Equipment use was also a problem because we did not have enough handhelds and printers to keep our productivity at its peak.
good,"Worked here when I was 16 as a cashier, pretty boring job. Interview was easy and I got hired on the spot. Working the self checkout was especially boring but if you are lazy then you'd probably like it."
good,working at Walmart was okay but the section that I was working at was the toy section and the shift I was working  was not ideal in the way that I when I started I had one manager and that the tail end of my shift another manager would come and not knowing the work I did will keep me overtime until the Isles were clear which was difficult being it the toy section and having children from 12 to 3 a.m. go down each of the Isles and wreck everything
good,"worked there for 19 years and worked my way up in the company. But, as all things, when they feel they don't need you, you are gone. associates are great."
good,"Overall, its stressful, busy, fast-paced, under-staffed, and under-appreciated . My tuition is getting paid for, I have health insurance, and I get paid semi decently. Is it worth it? For now, I suppose."
good,Management put a lot of pressure on stocking your isle within the time frame that the computer produced. So much sot hat you would end up getting coached if you went over even by 30 minutes. It became super stressful o work in. The times they gave you were just unrealistic even for me and I was one of the fastest stockers. Walmart employees a lot of older individuals who found it especially hard to keep up with the times. The workplace culture was nothing short of unbearable. Everyone wanted to get the other person in trouble and no one cared to help each other out.
good,While working there I was getting paid very well for the work I was doing but I could not stand being around the managers. They think because they have keys they own the store and treat you like nothing. Good work conditions and good pay if you’re able to keep your temper and keep going on by yourself.
good,"What i’ve learned working at walmart is that, no matter how much customers get under your skin always remember to smile and continue to check them out and ask them how there day is going! "
good,Walmart is a very busy place that is extremely fast paced. From serving customers to performing services for customers can be difficult if there are not a lot of employees in the area to assist. I self taught myself about the products in the department and also learned quite a bit about cars and what makes them stay in good condition
good,"overall fun workplace, duty managers could use some work and take more responsibility in helping out when needed. they gave back to the community. working part-time didn't get benefits and as far as advancement its more who you know in the company"
good,"I go in at 5 am and start picking. I stay a alot and work anywhere from 8-14 hrs a day. I learned ho to pick up my speed,customer service skills, stock shelves, zone aisles."
good,"Honestly, it really comes down to if you can stomach a ""corporate first"" environment and it depends on what managers you get. I had a somewhat positive but mostly negative experience."
good,Depends on who your manager is and what position you are working. Some positions are a little more fast paced than others and have more work load on some days than others
good,Cutting meat and cheeses for customers. Sometimes making sandwiches or wraps. Clean up takes two hrs on your own. Work days are from 6-8 hours with an hour lunch
good,"It was fast pace but I liked it , pay was good, I got along with everyone, the management was great , only problem I had was that I had severely hurt my self outside of work and they didn’t let me take time off  nor let me secure my job , do they just let me go."
good,The management team at Walmart had a variety of managers in their stores and with so many managers comes a lot of different tasks from different managers it gets tiring and annoying when you get pulled from your area to help another area because management cannot make the proper staffing schedule to fill their needs
good,"Walmart is crazy and busy. The customers can be rude, some are nice, most are crazy. The workers are nice, the management could give employees more help and attention"
good,they need more pay and more working hours o days . more benefits . too many bosses . some have bad attitudes. part time employees don’t get much and very hard to get full time position
good,"Worked the overnight shift 10-7 as a stocker. Co-workers made the job fun aside from all the work the managers shove on you. Some of the managers were cool but there’s always one with a horrible attitude. Work was interesting but unless you’re a night owl you will get tired fast. Absolutely no work life balance at all, you spend your days sleeping and nights working. You’re even tired on your off days"
good,Es buena empresa pero el salario y las prestaciones son muy bajas.
good,"Walmart is a nice place to start out because it really shows you what it's like to work in the real world. At the same time though, it's quite stressful and they shove way too much of a workload on you. They also do not treat associates with the proper respect. I had a huge issue with management."
good,I wouldn’t recommend this job at this location because it’s stressful and the managers don’t care about what goes on in that store. I’ve never had this type of experience before with a job.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work at, but it has its cons. You'll always work every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday unless you request off. They mostly only want night time employees."
good,Walmart offers many benefits that include vision and dental. You may invest in stock. There's many different shifts that you may work to accommodate your lifestyle and family life .
good,not good for anyone who has any kind of issue lifting. I had a mild medical condition with my back and it was worsened by working a year there. the management can be lacking and the policies can seem rediculous from corporate. not good if you are slow-moving as this job has a quota on freight that needs to be moved. customer service is required when stocking.
good,Setting up and opening the new store with the set up crew was a wonderful experience.  I really enjoyed getting to meet the team that moves from different stores to set up and manage the opening of a new Walmart store.
good,I liked working at Walmart but my work hours were reduced repeatedly. The other employees were kind and hard working. The managers were sincerely concerned with our well being.
good,Some of the manger needed more training. the benefit is not good because only manager are full time and other employee have to be employed at Walmart work for 2 plus year to get benefit.
good,They always make it seem as if you can always be replaced and don’t offer enough hours. Would rather hire 3 extra people then give the good workers hours so they don’t have to pay for benefits for full time associates.
good,"Working for Walmart is a cakewalk if you're lucky enough to not desperately NEED your job there. If you're one of those who has no other employment options, they'll do all they can to screw you over and hold your job over your head."
good,"Llegar checar y realizar tus actividades cotidianas "
good,"I was started at part time but I asked to work an additional day every week. Those weeks you would be forced to stay later after your shift, then later in the week to avoid getting overtime they would make you take an extra hour on your break."
good,"It's Walmart, you get what you get. My coworkers, all closing associates at the time, were incredibly awesome and we all functioned as one big unit, but there were a few less-than-thrilling managers to work for. It all depends on management if your time here will be pleasant or not."
good,.just horrible. management sucks. the work sucks. the hours suck. it sucks......................... they won't let me continue unless I have 150 words
good,"The pay is adequate . A lot of co-workers are not hard workers , standing around and scanning the items from the shelves . I’ve noticed they’ve taken longer breaks , 30 minutes for break times and an hour for lunch time . My experience at Wal-Mart was boring . The men’s restroom always stink so bad , no ventilation there . Overall if you wanted to be lazy , this place is ideal for you to work ."
good,"The job is corrupt and the managers don’t care about their associates, they only care about their paycheck and if the customers are happy. The work environment is terrible and your associates are always upset about something because of the managers and their lack of caring about their associates."
good,Good place to earn extra income . Too much work for the pay. Not enough time to be eligible for raises. Too many chiefs and not enough employees staffed.
good,My experience was in two stores and had terrible managers with poor experience. Sadly they treated me terrible despite working quite hard. There's no real advancement unless your best friends with a assistant manager.
good,"I liked the job but the management was horrible , they complain about having to help others , they hide in the back most of the scheduled shifts , there’s actually comments on google and on the site of customers complaining about the managers, the store in Chelmsford, MA is the worst, the managers have the worst attitude, they make the employees feel belittled constantly, they make other employees work jobs that are not in their description but won’t help others doing jobs that are not in their description."
good,"I worked for the pharmacy.  We worked hard long hours, but got to know our patients and enjoyed my co workers and talking with the patients each day. Filled prescriptions, inputted prescriptions, stocked"
good,"Being a cashier, you had no freedom on the floor. You only left your register for break and lunch or to go home. I felt too confined compared to the employees working in a dept."
good,"Working at Walmart can sometimes be fun. You meet many different people with different personalities. The only downfall is how they cut hours, and constantly hire."
good,"Maybe not for every store but it's a mile of simple tasks and when you start walking it, they build up and suddenly you find yourself dragging your feet because there's so much to work to pull and no one else to shoulder the burden but you."
good,It’s pretty active and fast paced when it was busy which was a lot of times but the hours varied and sometimes catch you by surprise with a week for just 15 hours and some times they will throw 35-40 hours. I just don’t think it’s stable enough to support a family and pay bills and if your part time you don’t receive benefits until you have been there for a year or longer. Full time only applies to management or over night stockers. It’s okay to work there but you will probably need a second job because many people there have two or three jobs. They cut hours a lot and yet still keep hiring more people.
good,"It was a great job for part time and I enjoyed speaking with customers. My CSMs were the nicest managers I've ever met and they would hand out candy and stuff as an appreciation gift!"
good,"If the store had better management, it wouldn't be a bad place to work.  A few of the managers need better people skills and better handling of certain situations."
good,"Honestly all depends on the store you are at some are some are bad management can play huge favoritism, they give decent benefits and starting at 11 an hour is not horrible"
good,Most of the associates and assistant managers are very supportive of each other. There are unrealistic goals for the amount of people staffed. Work life balance can be challenging.
good,I watched as hard working people were brushed aside as family and friends were given preferential treatment by management along with special quarterly bonuses that workers were laid off to pay for. No accountability is given and almost nothing could this corporate juggernaut from destroying the less competitive Mom & Pop shops that dotted my home town.
good,Just like with every job you have to work the system (that they seem to change up everyday). They will spin you until the wheels fall off. Overtime is a rarity. No paid vacations. Constant call outs so you will consistently have to do ten times more than your fair share.
good,"It’s decent pay and has some decent benefits but the higher management is poor between schedules and needing help upfront. Especially on days you need extra help, you receive none and on days where there’s a lot of call outs, it greatly effects our CCF."
good,"I loved working there for the longest time but I needed to change jobs for different hours, pay, and my health. If you love working overtime or like a fast pace work environment this is the job for you."
good,Working at Walmart  is not wat they say it .they talk good to get u in the door. There is no communication between Management and staff .one half of the time staff don't know what going on. As a    Customer Host it's very stressful .
good,"Several managers have told my crew that we are the backbone of Walmart. We are the crew that stocks the store and prepares it to open the next morning. As a stocker the pace of work was fast. Christmastime can be crazy. For the last year and a half I have been on the modular crew. If managers do not try to micromanage the team we can get our work done. Unfortunately we are the back up stockers on some nights. Consequently we are often behind in our work. "
good,Company doesnt value associates much and the front end is a non stop conveyor belt. Cashiers always are in demand but at the same time the there is a high overturn rate
good,"I'm not sure about the other Walmarts, but this specific Walmart needs help everywhere. Management did not have a clear goal for the week, everyday something changes, and there is some obvious favoritism. CAP 2 team is unappreciated, overworked, and underpaid for what they do for the store. Thankfully, the co-workers there will help you through your day if you want to put up the chaos."
good,I enjoy working for Walmart. Each day I come in I learn something new. Some time the workload can be to much but I can get it done it timely manner. I wish sometime that we could be more friendly to us when it come to things people may have going outside of work. The hardest part about working for Walmart is that not being uplifted when you at work. The most enjoyable part is the longtime friendships that I have build working for the company.
good,Management is the best part. Some are friendly and treat you human. The hardest part of working at Walmart are the employees. Horrible attitudes from grown people.
good,"Management is a problem on most jobs, that's my opinion. But when management is not organized it makes everyone's job difficult.  I think its awful when you can't get things in order such as your schedule, or the times, etc. Don't know who to talk to when you have concerns, nothing's being done about anything."
good,"working at Walmart is  very fast paced. you get two 10 min, break and 1 hour lunch.I worked in the Deli so I was always worked hard. I would not work for Walmart again."
good,This place and experience really all depends on who the employee is personally and professionally. It starts off great and stays great if you’re willing to put the work and extra time into your shift and job
good,"Automotive technicians spend the day either replacing or repairing tires or performing oil changes among other simple maintenence activities.  Fellow employees are good to work with and management does their best.  One drawback is Walmart's computerized scheduling system, so your schedule will vary from week to week."
good,"- Typical Day at work:"
good,"Walmart is everything that you've heard about it in the negative.  It does have some good factors and I loved the people with whom i worked."
good,"After 4 years of working here I need a change in job and pay looking for another college as Well. I'm stuck on a waiting list at MATC which is ridiculous especially when you need a better paying job!"
good,Walmart managers need to step up and stop treating Associates very poorly just because they are manager that does not mean that they should fired Associates for wrong reason I know because I was a victim to them they need to be fair to Associate  they fired me  very unfairly I had protected PTO but they still fired arent they ashamed to fired a disabled I think they should know better .managerare very curel
good,Started out good then just went down hillwhen they transferred the manager then all employees would speak there other languages.  In the Wal-Mart handbook states you only speak English umless a customer doesn't understand and you speak there's.
good,Walmart is a good first job. It’s tough to stay because of how competitive it is and how people treat others. Some people can make a career out of it. Some can’t and that’s ok.
good,"I’m a great worker, have good communication skills, work well as a team, I’m dedicated to my work, and I go above and beyond to get it done.. I’m skilled oriented, I have a steady work history. I like to learn new things."
good,"A typical day at work consists of picking up groceries and staging them for their pick ups. I haven't learned much there, there really isn't much to learn. The management could be better, if a manager is in a bad mood then the day for the whole department is ruined, sometimes the managers will stand around in the back and talk for hours and hours about anything and everything and pick us associates to go and do their jobs. The hardest part of the job is pushing around and picking up the heavy carts and totes, then in the afternoon it gets even harder trying to work around the customers that are shopping. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you look at your hand held device and it says "" You're all done :)"", and just being around some of the associates that make the job more bearable."
good,This company need to be more considered of you life outside the job. Give you more hours than the give. They also needs to work on the attitudes that some manager have. Avoid alot of the favoritism with employees.
good,Management was horrendous and working there was awful but it was a job. If you could find somewhere else I’d recommend it but if you’ve got nowhere else it’ll do.
good,I have been working for years at this company doing asset protection and overall it has been fun. Unfortunately I have seen many come and go due to how easy it is to get fired.
good,I have been employed with walmart for almost 13 years now. I have been a salaried member of management for almost 4. My current store has made me rethink my employment with Walmart due to lack of leadership and the core values that is not demonstrated by upper management. Just recently I received news that I have to reapply for my position in August due to a restructure in the position without any other options available to me. Because of the changes and work ethics of my superiors I am currently seeking other employment so I can bring my talent elsewhere.
good,"I been with the company going on 10yrs "
good,"Not too great on management. Overall the store that I worked at with walmart could of had a better management team, but the benefits were pretty good."
good,This isn’t a bad place to work and move up in a company. Only requirement is that your single and have no family or life outside Walmart. Upper management do not care that you have family or things to do outside the Walmart building. I am a salaried member of management. I am required to work 6 10-12 hrs days including weekends and have been doing so for the last 9 months. This is not a family oriented workplace.
good,Would be a better place to work if the managers actually enforced rules and have everyone take accountability.. You’ll find out really soon that people at Walmart don’t like to work and it makes your job and everyone else’s harder.. Could be ran smoothly under better management and more workers to help.
good,To many mangers to answer to. Some were nice. But they were never on the same page of what was supposed to be happening. Besides that it was super easy job. Just do as your asked and be a helping hand.
good,Worked outside in all weather conditions. Management was very demanding even if tasks could not be performed. Hours were constantly changing. Not recommended for high school student.
good,"Great opportunity to learn if you are a quick study, as you are given cursory knowledge on whatever the need is at the moment, enabling you to learn to view accounting anomalies from the front end as the ""Vendor"" as well as from the back end as the ""Customer"". Great learning experience in being ""flexible"" and fulfilling an ever changing need to fulfill corporate expectations."
good,"The company itself is good but depending on who the management is, it might not be a good experience. Some feel entitled and will take advantage of their position showing no respect for associates that work for the company. They can lack respect for an individual and be cocky. But depending who is there, it can be a fun place to work filled with team work."
good,"It’s a good place to work, for a summer job, or for when you’re in school. They pay is great, the friends and situations you encounter are good they help build your skills as an associate."
good,While the people I worked with were extremely nice my store was always understaffed which led to extremely angry customers and having  to work extremely hard to make up for any callouts that's occurred. Also not very prompt with receiving a reply about a transfer when my father died which forced me to relocate which led to me losing my job and having to apply financial strain on my sister
good,The training for my position wasn't clear. 3 years later everyone is doing their own thing. In return nothing is done correctly. But don't stress it. The culture is laid back. There I a flex schedule is the absolute best part of the job. You can work 4 hours and literally go home and make up the rest of the hours later in the week. The managers approve PTO doesn't matter.
good,"As a second job, it wasn't too terrible but it definitely had some faults. If I had to recommend the job to someone else I would say that it's not the best place to work."
good,I really did like my job at Wal-Mart but i guess every thing happened for reason.when frist started at Wal-Mart i would come in 2hour early and the store manager would get excited to see me and tell to clock in because he needed me to do a job for him. So i did that for about a 1yr then every body had to move from matteson to are brand knew sostore.newsto
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and that is about it. The company itself does not seem to care for its employees. The point system is ridiculous and basically punishes the employees for being sick. Life happens and the company does not care. As long as they keep making money.
good,"I would clock in stock shelves, made sure label were straight. Help the check-out lines keep moving, and customer service with a smile, I really enjoyed helping people. But no room for advancement. Hardest part was always picking up clothes and folding but that was easy. I'm just looking for a career with a salary and benefits now. To me that was more like a job for high schoolers."
good,Management was bad and they didn't seems to care about their associates concerns.  Also there was never enough associates scheduled. The pay is good if you would like to do five people jobs including your owns.
good,"If you aren't willing to work in a hot, fast paced and highly demanding position with heavy lifting then this job isn't for you. We've had many individuals walk out on their first day."
good,"They lied to us about the hours given and told us if we struggled that they would help but that wasn't true."
good,Tienes 10 minutos de desayuno pero no valoran tu trabajo y no te dejan crecer
good,It was a decent place to work. Management was lacking of the skills they should have had. And they also weren't fair on employees some got treated more fair then others.
good,"It's not a family friendly company, no sick days are allowed with penalty. I enjoyed my time at Walmart, I just feel that better communication with workers and understanding about family especially for single parents."
good,"good managers and employees, fit in good and had fun"
good,Walmart is ok there are days when it's fun and exciting to work for walmart others are not so great but i guess that's with any job you work. Walmart is a very understanding company
good,Not a bad place to work. Hard to move up the chain. Hours are decent. Managment could be better and the possibility of promotion is almost out the window
good,It got very caotic. A bunch of the employees didn’t get along and talked bad behind each others back. It was a ton of drama. It was the most stressful job on the weekends especially because of how many orders were to go out at one time and the little amount of staff. The pay was good and the managers worked with you! I pretty much made my own schedule and could change it whenever I wanted to
good,"In multiple stores: messy management, terrible ethics, short staffing, lack of care for workers, lack of acknowledgement for good workers. Overall a sad company. Many people there who deserve promotions after 10 years and aren't given them. Store managers are also over worked, and rundown. They do not revive enough pay. Most associates at Walmart in southern California also require government assistance bevause the wage is too small."
good,It was a good place to work. But some of the managers there weren't management material. They were good at accomadating you as far as taking days off.
good,On a day to day basis from my experience is upper management's goals vs reality are sometimes unachievable.  SOP only apply to certain situations or when its convenates works out in favor of the management team.
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work necessarily.  The benefits and hours were great.  What was not so good was the management team.  Promotions from within the facility were a joke.  Instead of moving up the most qualified applicant the Walmart warehouse employs the ""good old boy"" system where if you are a favorite you are in whether you are qualified or not.  Tenured associates with degrees, relevant skills and the most knowledge were often picked over for those who ingratiated themselves to the management team.  If you want a great job and have no desire to promote this is the place for you.  If you are looking to grow with a company go elsewhere."
good,"As a cashier my day was spent at the register assisting customers at point of sale. I enjoyed assisting the customer and making the customer feel valued.  As a customer service manager, I enjoyed running the front end and assisting the front end associates.  I also enjoyed helping the customers with their questions/concerns. I trained in different areas so I was able to learn a little about each dept.  I believe that no matter where you work you should look and  behave professionally...on the floor, break room or break area, you should act and speak with the thought that customers are always around and can over hear conversations which at times can become inappropriate... because the associate feels that if they are on break they are free to behave differently than when in the building and some time management conducts themselves in the same manner or  not stop the associates behavior ….because it's WALMART.  I can't really say that I found my days working for Walmart hard or that there was a hardest part of  the day....I think work is what you make it...I wish management would have been more responsive to the associates needs when dealing with an upset customer or dealing with a shortage of supplies...bags, register tape …..also wished that associates were able to afford benefits offered.   however, I enjoyed my job, I liked interacting with my fellow associates and I enjoyed assisting the customer, from a carry out to a defective product, helping the customer understand and being able to give good customer service was always an enjoyable part of my day."
good,Walmart is a descent company. I'm looking to get out of retail. They have cut back alot in their stocking and staffing also changed the way you even receive vacation and very strict on their attendance.
good,"A typical day at work including running multiple places and not having time to do so. I learned better communication skills, and customer service. Management was good at first but before I quite, it seemed to have gotten worse. The workplace culture presented itself with many different backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was the customers, certain ones. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I was consistently around."
good,"I enjoy the people. However, there is no guarantee of a permanent position with the company. The job is very labor intensive and fast paced. Not a bad place to work."
good,"Managment does a poor job of scheduling during availability. They do a poor job of communicating with employees in general, pay was good but not worth it in my opinion"
good,This store is a nightmare. Store manager belittles people every chance he gets and is sure to let you know he is the boss and no one else matters. As long as you can obey like a dog and have no conscious on how you treat people than maybe you can make it here. People cry on a daily basis here. Can’t blame a whole company for 1 bad person so I’d stay clear of Defiance Ohio location.  There are other store managers that are great to work for.
good,I was a part of the Cap 2 team at my local Walmart. The compensation was not adequate for the labor required in this position. Management had little understanding of how to delegate work properly. Overtime is discouraged but often required to complete the necessary work load. High turnover is a huge issue. Employees were often made to start work before fully trained. Employee hygiene was a huge issue at my local store.
good,Working at WalMart was ok. I got to promoted to custmer service manager in about 3 months i was there. When they fone away with holiday pay anf changed the vacation time is what made alot of ekployees upset. The upper people need to recognize their employees better and give them alot more on the hour.
good,I was a cashier at Walmart for nearly three years; multiple times I was passed over for customer service manager positions in favor of new employees. This was particularly frustrating as many other managers recommended me (or lied to me about doing so) for the position.
good,Long term employees are no long safe in there position.  Constantly changing roles.  There is no work life balance with this company anymore.  Hiring younger employees
good,Good work enviorment  but less pay .. flexible schedules... competative jobs.. needs skilss and good pace and speed .. busy during weekends .. good managers
good,people knew their jobs but management made it a high stress work environment and caused everyone to end up in a bad mood. interacting with the customers for the most part was very enjoyable.
good,Its a good store. Just looking for something that has alittle bit of difference in each day. Walmart is the exact same thing every single day. But overall its a good job
good,I enjoyed working with the people that also worked there. I enjoyed working with customers and was able to get to know them for repeat customers that came through my line.
good,"you can pick up shifts, they don't hire anyone in full-time, management is ok, I loved personal they were very nice an helpful all the time, their floor messed my feet up bad"
good,Need new job. Hate the manager. They didn't really get how to work things. They just put u on the spot with our traing. Always hire teens made things hard
good,"Buen ambiente laboral pero la paga es mala, además promueven gente no muy capaz"
good,Wouldn't recommend working at walmart as a family supporting job but its ok for people starting out there work experience. Id recommend the job for college students or kids fresh out of high school
good,"At Walmart I Always Had A Chance To Put Smiles On People's Face, Even When They're Upset. I Also Enjoy Meeting Different People From All Over The State To Learn Different Ways To Cook."
good,Im not happy with walmart because tjey dont work with you on the days you need off but expect you to practically live there. It like you dont jave a life outside of walmart
good,Mamagement at store 1900 needs some work. Favoritism is a big problem here. You only advance if management likes you. And I dont just a mean likes how you work.its a constant battle for hours. Some times part time associates get more hours then full time associates
good,Great company to start with for high school students and people looking for supplemental income. The benefits are awesome and the starting pay should be more.
good,Working at Walmart was a good customer service experience. Every day I'd have to talk to people which in turn helped me develop my personality even further.
good,"Like any business, it really depends on the managers you work under. The issues I ran into happened because of not one, but multiple managers."
good,It was a good job untill you start to knowtis that the people really dont help you and the manegers just dont like you. the work they give is sometimes from another department.
good,Retail business     It is not a family friendly place to work.   The company really does not care for their associates    Walmart does have good health insurance plans also 401k
good,"It was fine until they would schedule me a night shift, then an opening shift patternly . They also didnt do much when customers would disrespect you."
good,"One of the things I will take away from my time there, is all of the connections I’ve made over the years. Along with lifelong friends, proper skills to manage most situations."
good,"It's very typical for anyone working on dry shipping to be sent to perishable, so if you don't like being cold, you might not want this job. You can learn how to do other jobs if you show interest in it. The hardest part about the job is giving up as much as 60-70% of your day, including being mandated to work on days off."
good,"I have been asked to work a 6-month rotation overnight. Now, its been 6 months and now management is saying that I have to work a year overnight. Many broken promises."
good,There’s times when I was there when going on breaks were hard due to  customers but when you did the  relief  Feels nice to sit and to relax on till you had to go back to work but they say a jobs sometimes never easy
good,"I've enjoyed working at Walmart but some of the management members need some work, either but more training or by improving their additude. Some managers refused to work with each other and would constantly make calls that would result in a tough work environment or unsatisfied customer's. Also, for all my time working there, I never received my insurance card for the insurance I was paying for. Reguardless, it can be a good entry job."
good,Most positions are easy to accomplish. I have found; however that sometimes assignments are not communicated effectively and when you ask for clarification the response is sometimes less than desirable. Things/agreements  that are said also have a way of changing to suit the company.
good,At first it was ok to work at Walmart but the company started so many changes that even the managers couldn’t keep up with it. Its an ok place to work for those who are looking for experience in the retail industry but not for establishing a long term career.
good,"At Walmart in the pharmacy you had no opportunities to advance after achieving lead tech. Once I held that title, the job got repetitive with no reward of pay increase. The staff out in the store all got pay increases on the bottom line and the health and wellness was never boosted to compensate for the raises. This made the job much less desirable."
good,"The huge downside is the wages. Lots of hard work doesn’t equate to how poorly you’re paid for doing more work than other departments. For example, you’re working so hard lifting really heavy stuff under time restraints as an unloader and only get paid a paltry sum. And if you don’t finish within the time frame your whole team runs the risk of being wrote up. However, if you work in a fresh area doing way less work, having all the freedom you could ask for and no time constraints on the work you do, you get paid more and have more opportunity to advance. It’s backwards as anything bad and very very poor on upper management."
good,"A typical day at work starts with you waking up in the morning and wondering if you should even go in and deal with the bull or not. Then you get there, you clock in and second guess that as well. You then proceed to get your ears chewed out my your salaried management team all day as they make you do everything but never lift a finger up themselves. I learned that being a salaried manager at a retail store means you tell people to do everything as you sit back and watch and if they don't complete the task in the time allotted you reprimand them even if insinuating circumstances prohibited them from completing their assigned tasks. The non-salaried associates are all cool and are definitely the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is getting out of bed in order to get to the job."
good,If you have a family. Walmart is not a family oriented place to work. They are about business. They are not apricitive of there associates. You are replacable.
good,"Low down, managers are backstabbing and tells everyone your business.  Use you until they cant use you any longer. Tell you one thing and does another."
good,fast paced and busy environment. little effort is made to make it fun or entertaining. little to no explanation of walmart store policies/ general rules.
good,Walmart is a productive work place .. it help pay the bills.Only sometime it will be the perfect work environment.Managers often lack the leadership qualities. As well as the store manager!
good,"Typically as a cashier my day included greeting customers, scanning and bagging items, and dealing with customer situations. These could include pricing errors, coupons not working, or needing to wait on a CSM to be able to sell alcohol or to override some actions. The CSMs are very supportive and willing to work with you with break times and anything else in their control. However, the higher up management gives almost no support to their employees. While working there I had issues with being scheduled outside of my availability, not being given time off that had been requested months in advance, and not being able to get in contact with the managers to fix these issues."
good,"My time at Wal-Mart was quite a long time ago, when I was still a high school student, but both my mother and I saw lots of issues with it. Despite company policies made for students to prevent things like this, I was often denied time off for extra curricular or legal obligations I had due to divorce orders with visitation rights. I have heard that things have gotten better along those lines but I did not stay with the company for long because of it, and do not have plans to ever return."
good,I loved my job the first year I was there then we got a new manager and she decided to get rid of me. She created a hostile environment that stressed me out so bad I couldn't work.
good,A typical day at work could go any way. Management gives several different instructions to complete throughout and expect you to get everything done while your number one priority is the customer. It's always understaffed . You never get credit for what you do. Even if you have a true availability sheet you can and will be scheduled outside of your availability especially during the holidays.
good,"At Walmart, the scheduling is easily messed up, there are constant issues with employee and customer harassment, and it’s not a very challenging job. I would not recommend working here, at least not at the Woodsville Walmart."
good,good platform for some opportunities and experience in multiple departments . but most opportunities are picked from favorites. part timers don't have steady hours even during holidays. management won't always be flexible with your schedule
good,"While working at walmart, I enjoyed working with other associates at my pay grade or just above me. With a few Exceptions the management (assistant and up) treated everyone like they were nothing more then robots and machines with unrealistic goals. Everyone above the supervisor level treated the lower associates like stepping stones to get ahead in the company.  I had be singled out once or twice because one or two managers didn't like me, and they decided to humiliate me in front of the rest of the team."
good,management but limited capabilities but walmart likes robots that will listen to what they say. made auto techs do work that were not in the job description.
good,Walmart was not that bad of a place to work just not to understanding when it came to being sick with or with out 2 weeks of knowing with or with out a doctors note.
good,"In my experience working for Walmart was very enjoyable in the beginning. I had a great manager, who would schedule me in accordance to my school schedule. However, in recent times I was having a hard time with my manager respecting my school schedule."
good,Everyday was different most stressful depends on who was there for management I worked on different areas of the store but the front end was the worst we’ve been through 5 different managers and are currently on number 6 he does a good job but they let a computer do the scheduling which seems to understaff the front end everyday since it started
good,Not organized enough. One hand doesn’t know what the other is doing. Not enough communication. Loseing benefits from when I first started. Management doesn’t care enough about it’s employees.
good,Its not a bad company to work for but its not something i could or would want to make a career out of. Some of the staff were friendly and some people were just there to get a paycheck and be done.
good,The work was not hard at all it is a very easy job it's just repetitive so make sure you stay working as much as you can and always serve your customers with a smile
good,"They will:"
good,"Walmart isn’t the worst place in the world to work as some would have you believe. Depending on the coworker energy, or the energy of the customers I’ve helped in my time with this company, Walmart Can be a fun, exciting fast paced and energetic place to work at. However, my complaint would be with management. Whenever I had a problem or needed to speak to someone about something I didn’t understand it was like a game trying to find them any entire shift. And as a cashier I would soon be placed somewhere as soon as I came to n and request to speak to a manger but not get to the entire day. I would even see a manger pass me buy and say “hi I need to speak to you later) and make no headway even that way."
good,"11/hr minimum is nice, but overall it's just not a great environment. Upper management is terrible. They pretend not to know about any issues and then turn it around on you when you bring it up to them. And the people who make the decisions seem to have absolutely no idea what the jobs are actually like."
good,I didn’t care working for Walmart. We were understaffed all the time and my managers didn’t care they just wanted js to work with what we had which again was never enough. We always had managers coming and going because it was such a stressful job no one wanted it.
good,this particular job was very hectic and kept me on my feet and my typical day included me being able to show my great customer service skills towards each customer I came across. I pride myself in helping others and making them feel important and beautiful with just a simple smile and a compliment. I learned to keep my posture and stay humble while being faced with many challenges at this job. the key to success is not giving up and always believing in yourself. this workplace culture was very diverse and unique. the employees respected one another. the hardest part of this job was dealing with the management staff who was very disrespectful and belittling employees and biting my tongue. the most enjoyable part of this job was working there.
good,"Enjoyed my bosses and they were very lenient with me, however, I got next to no hours and they refused to work around my school schedule, despite garunteeing they would during between semesters."
good,"Overall it’s okay, but really it’s get bad when management starts to rush you when you have a lot hours in your isle or departments and they give you no help, but expect you to finish in a timely manner that is almost impossible."
good,it was a good place to work but the hours were varied . Some of the management was not very friendly. Coworkers were great people.I enjoyed meeting a variety of customers
good,"As an OGP, you have to walk fast because you are being timed. Doesn't follow your ""true availability"" even though they agreed on it. My co-workers are friendly and easy to work with. You will be able to meet different kind of customers (from a kind, well-mannered customer to a very rude customer). My manager knows how to appreciate if you do something good."
good,"let me tell once you work at Wal-Mart you'll never want to work in retail again. they work you like dogs, well where I worked at least they did. its a good starter job but I wouldn't recommend working there for more then a year."
good,The job started out great but as time went one the job went downhill and fast and management chose not to do anything about it making it not a place you wanna be
good,"Walmart could be a great place to work if the senior executive management, who obviously have great intention for their staffing, get down into the work zones (warehouses) to see how their managers deal with staff. My experience wasn't a pleasant one and my conclusion at the end of it all is this: Walmart is exposed to a huge influx of job seekers and as a result, machine and goods handlers have been taken for granted because they can easily be replaced. Only a crop of Managers or Team Leads are responsible enough to deliver their roles."
good,I worked for the Walmart company for over two years. Once you qualify for benefits with the company I believe the benefits are fair but the management and hassle in between that time period and on-going makes the environment unenjoyable and not worth it. The pay is decent but the environment and management is not something i'd want to go back to.
good,A lot of pressure to get everything out on the sales floor with 12+ carts and only 3 people working. Work hard and other shifts get credit and not appreciated. Only good thing were coworkers. Work is fine but my supervisor quit and didn't have one for over a month and different managers telling us different things to focus on so it was confusing.
good,"My time at Walmart was alright, there was lack of understanding between management and employees. But it was a good place to work if you talked to higher members of the staff you’re good. That is how you advance in Walmart. Just make sure you put open availability on your availability handout because that’s how you get the most hours."
good,"Outside of the managment teams i loved my job as an associate and would love to go back to work for the company as an associate, CSM, or even as Department manager"
good,"A usual day at the Deli contained a mental disabled lady yell at us. We was always required to met an exact perfect level which stressed up constantly. Overall, we worked hard as a team and did our best to get the job done."
good,Wal-mart is a nice establishment to work for as longs as you look over management. The employees were nice and helpful when I started. I enjoyed my time there until my child had gotten sick.
good,It's dont pay enough for what they have you doing but other than that its a great job with good benefits and a whole lot of lazy workers and certain supervisor pay favorite
good,Despite the breaks you feel like you never rest. Must always be moving and going at or over the desired speed even if it means connecting less with customers.
good,"The pay is pretty good for the little amount of work you do but walmart as a company doesn’t care one bit about its employees. Management sucks, they don’t care."
good,don't work there ever don't pay fires people for no reason only good is the pto program the only day closed is xmas so expect to work all holidays for regular pay
good,a typical day is busy stressful dealing with customers and keeping the front lanes clean and well stocked and making sure all returns are put back on sales floor.
good,Walmart has a very high turnover rate because it is so stressful to work there! They don't pay the workers enough to go through all the difficult things they have to do!@
good,The biggest complaint I can say is that you're not going to do a 9 to 5. Every day you could be coming in at different hours and customers can be very demanding. Management is a mixed bag with some being very good while others are useless
good,"Long hours, Rude customers, understaffed at all times, management nonexistent, lack of compensation or benefits, barely any paid time off... dreaded going to work"
good,El trabajo es bueno por qué te contratan sin tener experiencia
good,Working at walmart some associates said that it wasn't a good job for some one starting a job for the first time. And people that people were quiting every week because they didn't like working there. And most some associates were wanting to move to a different section to work at but they were still waiting to be moved. Most associates said that they didn't like the manager at walmart because they siad he was mean.and. for doing cab 2 we didn't have a supervisor yet we only had a temporally one until they found some one. But what i did learn from working at walmart i learned at walmart was  how to look for numbers on the price tag and look at the last 3 and look at the one on the shelf and thats how you know that its the correct one and that working fast gets things done quicker and that some people just put things where ever so you have to reorganize everything to put them back in the right place and that if the shelfs are over load then you have to take it back to the back until there are more room. And that cosmetics are the ones that get stolen or disorganized.
good,I really loved working at Walmart because I got a long with Co works and the manager yes but the bad part is that they didn't give me my 40 hours and I can't be taken a Lyft for 3 hours a day all so they don't give you benefits until it's official that you are being scheduled 40 a week others then that no you don't get them
good,"Job is a decent stepping stone, but don't think it would work as well for taking care of a family (or similar situation) without aggressive advancement through the company."
good,"This was my starting job. I gained experience in the work environment as well as communication, teamwork and practical adult life exposure. I view this as a great temporary job, but I moved on to pursue a more suitable job for my living expenses and location change."
good,What more do I have to say other then I was a cashier. They tell you to be friendly but the moment you do they get mad that your talking to customers management doesn't care about there employees and you cant really move up unless you are close with someone.
good,And if you're in need of a part-time job to have some pocket money that I suppose that what this is all right if you're fine with having no set schedule and always having to do the work of two or three people.
good,I worked there for 5 and half years it killed my back i cant work a job where i have to stand alot or lift alot it was constantly busy so my time went by fast but i couldnt plan anything cause i would habe 4 hour shifts
good,fast paced environment working with customers keeping a sales floor up to standards and  Stocked clean so that customers can find their merchandise without having to constantly ask for assistance locating items in located spots that's applied to an app so that they could has their own direction of course for items in the store
good,"If you were very sick that took more than 2 days to recover you were fired"
good,Management was a huge problem they never did their jobs right and had they're favorites in store other people got forced to do other people's work when it wasn't even their department
good,"-great for entry level job"
good,Honestly loved my job in the beginning. Once i moved up the ladder the less i loved it. There is alot of favoritism. There is lack of respect from management to those below them.
good,"You have a 2 minute window to clock in, and you must clock in at your work area, a 5-10 minute walk from the parking lot depending on your daily assigned area. Nearest bathroom/break room is usually a 5-7 minute walk from work area with only two 20 minute breaks per 10 hour shift (translates to two roughly 10 minute breaks after walking). Production and safety are the focus."
good,Lack of management and communication. Fun people to work with. Not fond of the CSM's. Changed there bonus program. If you missed even 1 day of work you would only get 50 percent of bonus. Didn't get a discount at all untill you had worked for 6 months. Not a good discount.
good,"They try hard to show that they follow a work culture of US Walmart but fail to do so... Too much work load with unnecessary back and forth communication."
good,It’s difficult to get a shift that fit my needs. Getting a promotion or a job title reclassification is almost impossible. Pay rates are better now but it was hard to get a raise when I was there
good,"It has change in the past years. No one knows what is coming next. never know is you will have a job tomorrow or not. It does not matter how long you have been with the company, they may get rid of you the net day.I was the older there."
good,"A typical day would include cleaning bathrooms, taking out the trash, sweeping the floor, etc. During the day there is at least 6 assistant managers and the two head managers roaming around the store, conducting their business, after 8 PM there is usually about 3-4 managers if that. The head managers at my store were constantly nagging about something small, but other than that they were fair. Walmart requires you to call into the store, and into the associate hotline to call off, which I personally believe is dumb. They schedule you on the hours you are available. You will work any day during the week, and on holidays. It is an okay place to start but I would not recommend it for a long term placement unless you desire to work in retail."
good,"It's an OK place to work. However, it's not something I want to do for more than a few years. Management can be hit or miss depending on who is on duty."
good,I worked as an evening and night cashier. I went to school and was a single mom working full time. Hard time balanceing life with the demands of working.
good,"When I started working there it was okay, the work wasn’t too hard but the managers would treat us like garbage and blame us for everything and makes us do things they were supposed to be doing and they weren’t at all flexible we weren’t allowed to call in or ask for days off without a minimum of 3 weeks notice which was always inconvenient if it was an emergency"
good,I’m an hourly mgt what can I say Walmart pays wells but the need changes they have role out pretty much cancels the higher pay now. They are using a schedule right program in which a computer generates associates schedules for the next 2 weeks or so in other words if  the system says you are need only 16 hours that week that’s what you get for that week . You can pick up other shifts in other hours of the store but you have to already been trained for those areas and they have to be approved by management. Your really only guaranteed hours if your and hourly supervisor to be honest. This system short hands the entire store in order to count payroll cost one of the meetings I went to stated that Walmart wastes nearly a million or 2 per store on payroll. Mgt is awful at least in my market they all have their own agenda and the do not communicate with each other at all the fresh operations manager will come in my store to walk it and say one thing than the market manager will come in weeks later and say something completely different. They also do not follow one best way which is Walmart’s bible like I said that all come in with their on agenda. Store salaried management only care when company big wigs come in town. There is never enough equipment or people but the expect for you to have things done by a certain time and there isn’t any consistency as far as quality of work in the fresh department second shift is horrible and my store has be ready a month or 2 without a fresh cap supervisor also Walmart has and is cutting a lot of jobs out we went from 4 department manager to 3
good,"When hired, the HR representative literally stated ""this location is 2nd lowest in the nation for employee morale and 2nd highest in the nation for theft, next to Compton, California. Worked for over a year and had 6 different managers in my department alone. New store manager every year or two. The jobs aren't bad but it's being run by people that don't care about their employees"
good,"Great place to work and meet new people, but some of the rules and regulations there are difficult to get used to. Risk losing a higher pay when moving to another department or job in company."
good,The people there are nice but the management is less then ideal. A typical day includes me ringing up a lot of customers with an occasional break and lunch.
good,"good place to start off but not recommended for supporting a family unless in a manage position. work place can be very stressful and management is a joke, plus there is usually no coverage in most areas so your on your own most times."
good,"had too much responsibility as a self checkout host. 1 person was required to oversee 10 self check outs two of which were not in the same area and there was an increase of theft due to not enough "
good,"Good place to start, bosses were great at the time,  however they change very often. Great benefits and employee gets a small discount. I'm grateful for my opportunity to work here"
good,"When I started, It was pretty great. Now Walmart is consistently understaffed, most management doesnt seem to care, and employee morale is pretty low."
good,I would start my day off with my hand held device that showed me all the orders the customers ordered that morning. I would then run around the entire store collecting all the items. It was a very fast paced job because we were always on a time limit. We were very short staffed at all times for the amount of orders being ordered. the managers and my team mates did not do well under pressure but we always got the job done no matter how messy it got. the customers always got their groceries.
good,It's a good place to work and their are many departments where you can find what you like but retail is retail no matter what you try to call it and as good as any job can get management can and will always find a way to begin to ruin things for you
good,I have worked with walmart for 6 years and counting. I am a salaried member of management and would not wish the stress and work/life lack of balance on anyone. Its not worth it. I have missed milestones with my children. Family is of most important. Find another industry.
good,"I was placed in a job where I was asked to complete tasks that I was not physically suited for, thus creating a bad work environment for myself. I was also refused the opportunity to move departments"
good,"They will not switch your hours to part time, even if you have college classes. The management never listens to simple adjustments until its too late."
good,I enjoyed working with a lot of the people . A lot of changes have happened within the company that slowly chased all the long term and hard workers away
good,Nobody worked as a team. Management was not the kind of people I would work with . Work was hard as is but was always Able to pull thru and finish. Was frustrating but it got me by. Needed to move on.
good,"Walmart is a place of constant moving. New things are always happening there. You're told to do one thing and then you are told to do another. This can become quite stressful, but if you need the money go for it and you might move up in the business."
good,a typical day at walmart was very fast paced. I learned how to communicate very well with coworkers and customers. management was unorganized and manage my time well.
good,"Management is constantly pushing high expectations on their workers, but there is almost never any consideration to whether or not those expectations are reasonable or even physically possible. They're constantly understaffed, yet expect performance to be consistant as if every position is being worked. They have high demands on how much work is done regardless of how much these few employees have to do at once. And they expect everything to always look neat and clean even if the department had such a large delivery that there isn't even enough room to WALK much less work."
good,"working for walmart was meh. management is the worst. they picked their personal ""pets"" and you would be stuck doing your work and theirs. if they saw you could do it? they dumped more on you. you would be written up if you didnt live the wqmart way"
good,"At first I really loved it byt theres a huge lack of communication and the managers are in their own kittle world. Its very similar to high school, everyone starts rumours and is in everybodies buisness"
good,Management picks their favorite employees and excuses absences and approves more vacation days. They baby their favorites and put all the work onto other associates and let them take the fall. Horrible place.
good,Managers were the worst at making schedules and responding to associates whenever there were angry customers.they always made last minute changes in the schedules which damaged a lot of associates attendance.
good,"Self starting job and pulled most of the other employees weight on a day to day basis."
good,"A typical day...it starts off busy, I work 5 a.m. - 2 p.m. So sometimes we don't have the equipment necessary to begin the process.  I have learned a lot more in terms of retail, I've always pretty much had a Customer Service background, but this is a daily face to face interaction and that's all good with me.  I love to feel as though I am helpful.  The hardest part about the job I would say is the heavy lifting, but the most enjoyable part of the job IS assisting new comers, my fellow associates and of course the Customer."
good,"I’ve worked for Walmart for 5 years now, my associates turned into the reason I came in everyday. I’ve worked combined 4 stores in 2 different markets. "
good,Honestly sucks. You have to fight for your hours and you still don’t get any because it’s computer generated. Even though you do get an employee discount it still isnt enough to cover the fact that it’s a poor job. I’ve been there going on 7 months and i see a person leave every month. No lie. It’s a good job for a high school graduate but if you have bills find something else.
good,"The Management team need to recognize the ones that are working hard and doing there job ."
good,when i began with company the customers and associates were priority now they just numbers.  Olders associates have no more benefits than those just hired.
good,"As long as you do your work and can advance pretty quick in thus type of environment but continue give it your all, because if you let down a little bit they down grade on you."
good,"Even though the environment was fast-paced, it was unstable in terms of scheduling. I never knew when I was to work and how many hours I was to work as well."
good,"A typical day would consist of poor staffing/coverage, unrealistic goals from upper management and a very stressful working environment. Workplace Culture is preached by management But not followed."
good,Great when run by the right management team. Some are more educated and correctly chosen for the position that the hold versus others. Good benefits and paid time off accumulation.
good,"If you are looking for a part-time or seasonal job Walmart is perfect, but due to the constant competition between old associates and new hires, it is almost impossible to stay employed with reasonable hours each week for very long."
good,"Walmart's pay has been historically low. They recently increased pay for new hires, but failed to increase pay for existing employees. Some employees said they are making the same as new hires and have worked for walmart over 10 years. Walmarts turnover rate is high because management treats most employees poorly. Employees do enjoy a discount card for 10% off non food items. The job itself isnt hard most of the time, but the pay isn't worth it unless you get into management."
good,I liked my job at first but thibgs changed i started noticing that it was alot of bad things going on like stealing mt coworkers were talking about me behind my back including the management but i did learn alot like how to read upc how to make orders for my area
good,"the new scheduling system is unfair to all associates, it was a great place to work until new changes were made now they are not associate friendly, the profit share checks are a postive note, but doing  someones schedule 3 months out is not working well for the associates"
good,I wasn't employed long enough for me to give a fair review on the employer. However the management team there were very patient and excellent trainers.
good,"Hard work little pay mean customers.  Management just wants sales.  Lots of favortism.  No benifits or holidays off.  If you dont have an open schedule they wont work you that much.  "
good,I began Walmart as a 17 year old Junior in High School.  I am blessed to received the opportunity to work here and have a better job. With all due respect I do believe my personality and work ethic is a bit above Walmart’s norm.
good,If there was a better communication with management and no favoritism. The sales floor was a challenge and learn something new everyday. Hve good and bad days.
good,"Es buena empresa, lamentablemente no hay mucha oportunidad de crecimiento y eso hace que tenga mucha rotación de personal y que la gente que se queda es por necesidad no por gusto"
good,"Poor management! Poor upper management, If you use the open door policy, they will use retaliate against you. Started off great, ended very sadly. I would still be there if, I hadn't used the open door policy."
good,Worked hard and got rewards and compliments. Always showed up on time and took my breaks like I was suppose to. Working at Walmart was actually kinda fun.
good,Quick and fast paced.  High stress. Will work with college student schedule.  Multitasking and customer service skills are very important. Be open for change constantly.
good,"I worked at the Gloucester location. I wouldn't recommend this location especially in any kind of manager position. The current store manager does not get along with men in particular. Wal-Mart rules are not followed at this location, only the ways of the store manager. "
good,"A hectic job, your work day is not ensured, with days where trucks would not appear management getting shifted around to deal with other departments, where some managers will demand menial jobs that our department doesn't cover, but you do them, because they say so. "
good,"Wal-Mart is a wonderful place to start a career. You get promoted in as little as six months, if you're patient skilled, and hard working enough. But in order to get promoted, someone has to like you, and people can promote others based on solely that. A store can have as many managers as it needs (decided by the market) and having too many cooks in the kitchen usually creates more problems than it solves. Every day, a member of management would come up to me and absolutely contradict what the previous member of management said yesterday. While some managers prove immediately that they know what they're talking about, others will prove the opposite. One of my assistant managers worked in the same area for years and didn't know how to operate/complete daily tasks within that area. Assistant managers get paid about 60k a year, plus raises, and it's not an entry level job. Communication is part of their job and Wal-Mart really fails with it. Don't stay in Wal-Mart."
good,"No one ever seems to know what is going on. Management is ridiculous, very often will good managers come, but they leave quicker than they arrive. Everyone feels like they are in charge of the employees."
good,I have worked for this company for 16 years. Job promotions are not based on what you know..... It’s who you know!!! Management tell you to apply for a position already knowing who they are goin to choose. It doesn’t matter how many years or experience  you have with Walmart.. It’s simply being in the click with management!!!  Walmart use to be a family based place to work and associates use to care.. Now it’s just a place to earn a check.. Sad to say that but its true!!
good,"Siempre tienes que apoyar donde faltan de otros departamentos, te respetan el precio de oferta más el descuento de empleado"
good,The First two and a half weeks of the month are the busiest for me in Customer Service. We currently don’t have a store manager so things are a bit hectic at the moment. There are a lot of different cultures that I work with witch is interesting to learn about others cultures
good,"For my first job, I wanted something that'd help me build my interpersonal skills, sense of responsibility as well as other things and I got all of that from my time at Walmart. Some customers were terrible while others were great. Management wasn't perfect but they weren't terrible either. Overall, a pretty decent experience."
good,"My time at walmart although was good at first i realized management wasnt doing near enough to help us out at all, like lets say they would give us a certain time limit to get something done and it sometimes wouldnt be done on time, so then we get griped at but i always say where are the managers? Why arent they lending a hand instead of on thier phones or just walking around. I couldnt stand the site. Also No benefits hardly at all for such a successful company, they should be able to afford to take care of its employees. I think the funniest part of the job was my lunch break or the last hour of my day."
good,"It's a ok place to work, the Walmart at store 2040 has a saying work more with less. Which is OK but it can be stressful when you have alot of pallets to do"
good,"Management was very rude and all for themselves. I loved to work there, it was just they always brought problems from there home to work and have attitudes"
good,It was a great place to work at in the beginning. Then after awhile it seemed to go down hill. I got tried of hearing my coworkers complaining about other coworkers not doing there job the way they feel they should.
good,"The business was always looking for a way to cut cost. We were given a raise every other year but intern our hours were cut each time, so nobody really seen a difference in pay."
good,"En lo personal es un negocio que te deja una experiencia enorme, ya que aprendes a trabajar con poco, me prefiero a que no tienes inmobiliario, tampoco tienes herramientas, y mucho  menos un lugar fijo para realizar tu trabajo, por lo tanto aprendes a trabajar con lo poco que te proporcionan y a utilizar tu imaginación, haciendo de un espacio tan reducido, algo agradable para los posibles nuevos ingresos."
good,A good place to work in general but the rules they have always change and they rarely tell you directly. Management is also very poor at times and nothing is usually done if you say anything.
good,My main reason for not liking Walmart was because none of the employers were very helpful always rude and in a rush. Management was also the same way didn’t really care in my eyes. I would have to beg for teamwork and didn’t like that very much.
good,"Not as great as it seems, depending on management youll have fun. Dress code is not a rule for everyone they pick out people and coach them for no reason. yearly pay dosent go up by much"
good,"Needs better communication through management. Management bad about down grading associates. With sale volume, more associates are needed in departments."
good,"management was way off with my hours, had medical issues and they did not care one bit, very on your own no direction with anything, other employees were EXTREMELY RUDE, manager took 2 weeks off when i started working there and my schedule wasn't even planned out yet so i didn't know what days i was working. i had to ask my other manager every morning when i left."
good,"I worked for walmart for 2 years and 6 months and was still receiving the same pay as my girlfriend who only worked there 6 months despite being told i would receive an annual raise. I left after being confronted about calling out on what was considered an event day under one of the the stores new policies. i wasn't aware of the date and they continued to give me a hard time about it, this is when i decided i had enough. i had also ran into problems trying to get the day of my graduation off. Even after receiving a degree i receive no form of compensation for it. There is also no real incentive to work in the environment."
good,Not a bad part time job. I am certain there is room to move up with in the company but i did not see a career in the company.  Being a cashier was a multitasking position due to lack of employment in other departments.
good,They aren't a bad company to work for but trying to improve urself and get raises is like trying to pull teeth unless u bust ur butt and it still doesn't work out for the most bbn part
good,The main issue with Walmart is conflict between persons and the employee's best never being good enough.  I pushed myself to the physical limit constantly and more was always expected. Because of always being told to work harder I have acquired injuries that aren't going away soon. The workplace conflict adds too much emotion into a place that wants you to be a robot.
good,Every manager is all on egg shells when higher up comes in i feel they should be there self...always busy witch is great because other wise day goes slow.
good,It was a stressful place with bad management . Over all the customers and the co workers made life at Walmart manageable. But this Walmart suck butt..
good,"When I first began, I absolutely loved my job. But now I felt like I was getting targeted. My supervisor was the worst I ever worked for, and I worked for over 20 years."
good,They expect a lot now that they pay $11. To much work that you are never done and if you do get your work done than they will start expecting you to do more.
good,"They have made alot of changes in the past two years, and most are not good. Raises are no longer based on work preformance, or how long you have worked there, and it's not right. The starting pay went up but did nothing for those of us who have worked there 10 or more years, so now new hires are making almost as much as us. One change that was good was dress code, it's pretty open."
good,Too many manager positions. It feels like you’re the only one looking out for yourself. Managers don’t care about you. Toxic social environment. They aren’t worried about their employees.
good,Lack of communication with management leading to mistakes and missed opportunities. Also a lack of employee consideration for life style.  All employees under a department manager position were expendable.
good,Working at Walmart as a Deli Associate can be a very stressful and daunting task if not set up with the proper equipment and proper staffing needed to complete the job.
good,"Fresh production covering bakery and deli. Baking bread, cookies, pastries, and stocking sales floor, Deli work consists of cooking fried foods, making subs and salads, slicing meat for customers on the front line. Rotisserie chickens, Hot dogs and more. The department is so big that it's overwhelming on the amount of work that is expected to be done one person. The stress levels are so high that behind the scene, nobody is smiling."
good,It's a stressful work place and fired people everyday & management talks to you like you are nothing and no body. And if we get 5 points you get fired..
good,When I was working for Walmart it was great at first in my hours of full-time great insurance working there 3 years it seems work has been going downhill favoritism after favoritism
good,"Not enough hours the hours changed to much its ok if looking for part time worked there 6 months had to leave for this reason"
good,"Very busy.How to stock  cashier and layaway"
good,typical day at work included coming in and finding the manager to know what tasks were assigned to you the work place culture is diversed everybody does different things
good,"This job was no respect for other things you had to do. I was in high school when i worked here, they would constantly call me while I was in class - knowing i was in  class- to get me to come in. When i would say no because i had a test the next day they would complain and get mad. They would cut hours very bad, poor management. Customers treat you bad cause its walmart. But very easy to advance to management positions."
good,Not family oriented anymore.  Work hard but doesn't pay off. Too many lazy people not held accountable for their actions. Management great but communication is rare. Expect a lot from their employees for the amount of hours they give them. Which is less and less every week.
good,Walmart is a good place if you are new to working.. they teach you what you need to do and its a lot of team work. If you have a good team it makes everything easier.
good,All I did was unload trucks and stock shelves. I learned all about retail from them. Management was the reason I left. the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and stocking the shelves. I stock quick but at certain times it seems like it doesn't matter how fast you move they aren't happy with the results.
good,"I was only part of the remodel crew at Walmart, but some glaring issues hit me. Like employees who ride of others work all over that get away with it. And expectations for certain people, I had a very energetic, and frankly lucky day and did an amazing amount of work in one day, and then was expected to maintain that. Forever."
good,Not a lot of room to advance. They do not like to make you full time. Will make you work a 11-13 day stretch before a day off. It's bi-weekly you either get a long stretch of work or 32 hours.
good,Tiene mala organicacion pero es bueno el ambiente laboral
good,Walmart management is horrible because from what i can see is that you get promoted or advance based off of the buddy system. The people that actually care about their work are only made to do that work. There is no respect for the individual at walmart.
good,The point  system keeps changing and they don't they don't take into account for people with medical conditions and the side effects of medications that there employees have
good,"My day usually lasted ten hours there. I would stock and fold clothes through out the day. Sometimes get asked to go to another department like, grocery or be a cashier. Overall, Walmart was an okay place to work, I would only return if I had to."
good,"Not bad as far as bosses go, relaxed atmosphere where I worked and the only thing you've really had to worry about was the occasional crazy / irate customer and the occasional scammer / thief."
good,"They want as much work they can get out of you for as little pay as possible so they expect a 14hr job to be done in 7.5 Hrs."
good,"your a number, your expected to do what they tell you to do and anything else they want, what I learned was to take garbage. the management team well there in it for there paycheck and sit in the office most days sipping there coffee or out in mcdonalds, the culture well dont get me started, most enjoyable part of the job was my paycheck and going home, BUT IT WAS A JOB!!"
good,"It's not the worst, or the best place to work. It's pretty much what you would expect out of retail. Biggest downside is the expectation to work pretty much every holiday, except Christmas."
good,It was fine from what I can remember. Your typical retail job experience. I wasn’t there too long so my review may not be that beneficial but it was an okay job if you are strapped for cash. It only paid minimum wage but I was young with no responsibilities then so that was fine for me.
good,"I work for wal-mart for 7 yrs, it is a nice place to work, but they do not care about their workers. when I worked for them I got sick and I had to stay in the hospital for a few days, I called them to let them know and they asked me when was I coming back to work at that time I did not know, the next day my husband went up there to take them the doctor's note and they asked him when I was going back It was on the paper when I was coming back. when I got out the hospital and I went back to work I was fired and they did not tell me I found out through the machine when I was trying to clock in."
good,"I worked here temporarily just to get back on my feet. The job is not a career it’s just a job to get by you should never work here unless it’s temporary, you are a teen or a senior or you want to move up in management. This job is not reliable and all the money you make will be funneled right back into Walmart. It is a stepping stone and you should use it as such."
good,It was a very fast paced work experience with a lot of friendly co-workers. I loved the fast paced work environment and getting to be able to work with the customers face to face.
good,"I worked in the back work, doing inventory control, I would do daily audits, bin unstocked items and do daily inventory on entire backroom, alot of walking the floors"
good,I left walmart for Walgreens for higher pay and better opportunities. Walmart is lowering hours and you would never get overtime. Or not even 40 hours per week.
good,"My co-workers varied from kind and hard working to rude and offensive, luckily only the kind ones got promoted. They go through people quickly, so only expect to stay if you're actually willing to do your job."
good,They didn’t work with my schedule. Poor management but the supervisor was really good he cared about his associates. It was a good work place I was left alone
good,"Managers were willing to help, however some other associates act like children and force others to have to cover themselves unnecessarily, when talked about with management, nothing is done. Makes working there dreadful and not worth the pay."
good,I worked for Walmart right after graduating from high school then continued to work there for several years. After sometime working in different areas I ended up in the vision center. I ended up loving it. They provided good training and incentives to get licenses. I now have a career as a licensed dispensing optician making a livable wage. (No longer at walmart) And Walmart is the reason I got here. I didnt always agree with the policies or agree with decision made by management but overall I dont regret working there. I've heard the benefits and pay have gotten worse since I've left and they are constantly eliminating positions so it feels like there is no job security but if you can get into the vision center or pharmacy you are better off. The store manager plays a huge role in overall store moral and I was lucky to have a caring manager while I was there.
good,"The management was lazy on tracking when you actually had an excused absence from work, would never be there, wouldn't concern themselves with serious situations, instead would send someone else to solve said problem"
good,The money and benefits are great . Some of the managers are great to work for. Just do your best at the job that you are assigned and everything will be fine.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work with the exception of no fixed hours."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits if you can make it pass six month. Always busy and you would get two fifteen minute breaks (depends on what area our in) and an hour lunch"
good,"Working for the Wal-mart team feels like an unappreciated one. Micro manage, you get pulled from task to do another without request and no time to finish current task before end of shift. Overall job is fine for PT well in school."
good,Improvement to how employees are treated are needed. Very company focused but forgets about the needs of the employees. Customer satisfaction required for the jobs
good,"As an assistant manager, expectations were demanding. Never had a set schedule but, as a manger, there was opportunity for advancement. Every assistant manger wanted to manage his/her own store. Competition very strong. Benefits could have be  better. Good experience."
good,Doing a lot of the work while most everyone else goofs off. Doing the work is unappreciated and you will get in some sort of little trouble from what everyone else does. Managers act like children and never take anything seriously or help a lot.
good,Great place to work to learn how to deal with different people and different situations.. they also provided free food for special occasions and was flexible if an employee had an family emergency
good,I loved my passion but didn’t like management  pay was okay but the workers were to rude and disrespectful I was always happy to be at work tell managers was no help
good,I was a department manager for the pharmacy. I had to answer to 4 different levels of management who were never on the same page with each other. So it often felt like I was always in the wrong. They work you to the bone. And then expect more from you. There is no room for error.
good,"My experience at walmart was stressful. Everyone at walmart is stressed, especially the older long time associates they just complain all day. Walmart tries the best to squeeze the most work they can out of every associate.The leadership is under pressure to beat times and quotas and that pressure falls on employees."
good,"Due to the large amount of responsibilities you are required to accomplish within your shift, work here can be difficult. There is constant adjustments to the way the business is ran and can be frustrating when trying to keep up. However you do meet lots of nice people who have your back like family."
good,"Its a great place to work . You get paid $11/hour but its not worth it all the time employees get treated poorly, management overall is selfish and not any help its unfortunate"
good,"They train really well however if your scheduled you better show up! They make you find someone to fill your spot. A list of names is given in your department and you don't know anybody on it so it makes it tough."
good,The management team over worked their employees. We were taking for granted and fired people for medical reasons doctor notes didnt help they stillgot rid of you for nor reason
good,Not enough time in the day to complete what needs to be done without impacting work/life balance.  Unfair assessment of talent and what people can offer to the company
good,"The supervisors were micro micro-managing, as well as belittling the employees. Very unprofessional as well unethical environment. Supervisors would have a problem with employees using the restroom because they didn't anyone to stop working the floors due to them wanting to look good to upper management, during the morning shift."
good,"The job was nice and pay was good.  It’s the way the building was ran , and the way they just send new people home after 3-5 hours of work. A company can’t keep hiring in people if they can’t afford to  give the employees they just brought in"
good,"Only certain people are promoted for higher positions"
good,"The company afforded anyone the opportunity to be ""all they can be"". Everything depends on the individual's determination to succeed. I was given oppurtunities to learn and grow because of my desire to do my job well."
good,Not bad place to work if you don't want full-time or you're retired but you don't make enough if you're wanting to make a career out of it unless you somehow get into management status then you get benefits like health insurance and other stuff that all the other employees don't get
good,"Assisting customer's through out the store daily, stocked shelf's, cleaned and keep inventory in my area up to date.  Co-workers were wonderful I enjoyed my time with customers and making sure they were satisfied."
good,This is a job that would be great and easy if everyone was reliable and pulled their weight. Schedule consistency and easy to follow work is the good deal portion of this job.
good,"I can not say much on my time with Wal-Mart. Like many retail positions it will change on an hourly basis. The management at the location I worked were very understanding and supportive of personal life struggles. Most customers were pleasant and a joy to assist, others would try your patience."
good,"You can get overworked working here. The pay was okay, but hours were not flexible. The management sucks as well. I was never getting my breaks on time."
good,There are no easy jobs at Walmart. Everything is very fast pace and there are no slow times. The culture is not a friendly one and no one speaks to each other unless it is about work.
good,The hours are very inconsistent. The staff is over worked. The appliances need replaced. It’s a bad environment to be in. The associates are very nice though.
good,"The job in and of itself is not are particularly difficult one, although physically demanding and definitely not for the weak and frail, at least not the position I worked.  Although you are typically tasked with a lot during the work day, the 8 hour shifts they make you work provide more than enough time to complete all duties in a satisfactory manor. My problems arose at this job specifically after about 9 months when the store manager left along with over 90 other associates and managers.  The team of management that came after that regime was completely new (from the Assistant Managers to the Market Manager) and each person had conflicting ideas on how to achieve the same results we had been achieving before.  The newer managers seemed to care more about the process than the end result, which in turn slowed everything down and created internal problems a divide between associates and managers that hadn't been resolved by the time I left about a year later."
good,"As you would expect it's not the best place to work, you have no idea who your manager is and unless you have a set role you are being pulled and tugged in different directions to different departments. This was m first job and had no idea what the difference was between full and part time so when I needed to switch to part time for school in the fall it was practically impossible to do. I spoke to someone in personnel and she told me to speak to my manager, I thought I had but you never really know who is in charge of you until you meet them by the grace of God or if you get in trouble I guess. Needless to say I put in an end of the week notice and looked for something different to the worker bee lifestyle."
good,"It was great for the time being. Now that I am getting married and relocating, i believe it is now time for a change. So I'm ready to take in any and every challenge, I just hope in return to be able to get that chance."
good,"I actually enjoyed my job, but then the company started enforcing unreasonable policy changes that I was unable to keep up with. I tried, and obviously failed, since they fired me. I liked my direct supervisor and my coworkers. the hardest part of the job was trying to perform a task that took 4 &a half hours, normally, in the new less than 2 hour time span. if anyone in the previous shift fell behind in their duties, mine would be affected detrimentally. the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, especially our regulars."
good,"Walmart was a decent first job, with a steady pace and something that offered experience. It prepared me well for the customer service industry, though it is not a place which I would continue to work."
good,Wal-Mart only wants part time employees and they don't want long term employees. The current attitude at Wal-Mart is that employees can easily replaced so loyalty is not rewarded.
good,it was an ok place to work it could be very stressful at times their new policies were getting a little hard to deal with i enjoyed the people i worked with
good,A typical day at work with go either way and depending who is your supervisor. I have learned a few new things everyday rather it was taught to me or not.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you don't mind skirting around management, getting reprimanded for things that are out of your control or staying in the same department for 6 months. Otherwise its a pretty great place where there's plenty of interaction with many different types of people."
good,"Very cliquey, very partial to some and treat some with no respect. "
good,"A typical day is walking into total chaos and trying to make it better. Our breaks were never on time we always hit our 5 hour mark before lunch. We usually never had things we needed for our work stations, we constantly ran out of bags, receipt tape, and the machines were constantly breaking down. We constantly had customer yelling because of these issues. We are cussed at, get told I'm never coming back here, and over all nasty attitudes of customers. It was actually very hostile in the department I worked in. Management would tell us to just brush it or wouldn't even answer our calls for help. Most of the so called management didn't even care what was going on in the store."
good,"The job was really nice and I loved having a little bit of diversity throughout the shift rather than just sticking to one thing for hours, and the hours were good."
good,"Overall acceptable job. Decent pay, typically understanding management, and relatively calm workplace. Hours based around availability. Reasonable point system."
good,I am a mother of 2 small children. Walmart usually will not hire you or give you many hours if you are only available during certain times. The walmart i worked at some of the managers were good then there was others that just wouldn't even listen to anything you tried to talk to them about
good,"Excellent pay and benefits for salaried managers, but the trade off is too high.  There is no work/life balance.  The upper management expects assistant managers to stay well above their 45 hour work week to ensure ""the store"", not just their own departments, is inspection ready all  the time.  They manage through fear and intimidation, NOTHING like Sam Walton intended."
good,Even with a doctors note you still collect points. You can only have 5 in a rolling 6 month period. Which wouldn’t be bad if you didn’t collect points for everything now. And a manager has to approve them so stay on their good side.
good,Good for part time work. Not beneficial to long time employees anymore. Overall pay for older associates compared to new associates are unfair. Management is not consistent and shows favoritism.
good,"The registers are pretty straight-forward. However, you need a CSM's approval to do anything other than a basic transaction. This makes transactions time-consuming and wastes a customer's time when the CSMs take a while to respond. Sometimes the CSMs never show up no matter how many times you call them. This is especially annoying when you call for change that you desperately need and you have to start turning customers away unless they aren't paying with cash. There aren't enough CSMs to properly assist the cashiers. Some of them are nice, some of them are extremely rude. You could have a college degree and some of them would still treat you like you're an idiot. There is a lot of favoritism as well. The schedule is inconsistent. Also, the rate of pay means nothing when you aren't scheduled enough. Walmart majorly shorts you on hours from New Years to summer, so if you're paying bills alone, try to find a better paying job that actually offers you healthcare right away. If you have help paying the bills, actually want a lot of time off, and can keep your mouth shut when customers and managers treat you like garbage, this may be the job for you."
good,"Checking my area to see what needs to be done first.Making sure that you have the proper equipment to work with. Checking out items needed to go out using the FIFO system first in first out. Do as I say, Not treating employees like real people and No RESPECT for employees. It is a melting pot, It is nice. The way upper management look at and treat  there employees.See and working with co-worker and seeing returning customers."
good,Its a relaxed job and you stay busy but get enough breaks. You don't just work in one area which i like. You can learn different positions. And its great for future job opportunities.
good,"Lack of tools and equipment, HR lack of information, yo need to cover close by departments wend the associate call in and sometimes you take care 2 or more departments alone and under pressure of the client and management and my other stuff. Its a good job if your are a full timer, If you are part timer its not good."
good,"A typical day at work would be busy because something is going on such as football games etc, Management try to control everything as best as possible."
good,"Management is my biggest gripe about the job. Management in addition to how physical the job is. I worked the job for about 9 months and while on the surface the job appears to be great by offering halfway decent pay and accumulated time off, when the job gets going and you realize you'll be unloading trucks by hand a lot of times (if not all the time depending on position. Unloaders use their own hands as forklifts) it becomes tiring, redundant, and tedious. i made management my biggest complaint not really because of the actual managers themselves, but i mean management in regards to the way the warehouse was managed, as a lot of the ridiculous expectations did not come from the managers individually. everything in the warehouse came down to production, and if you were in a position that did not quiet rely on production, then you were considered lucky. most times the production were just too high of an expectation to trully be considered realistic. and when you've got walmart trying to compete with amazon and seemingly losing the race, the management expects to make up for it by relying on the employees to work faster and more efficient. this is where the main concerns unfolded. the main issue with management was that they had very unrealistic expectations regarding the warehouse staff both in what can be accomplished as a team, as well as what was possible for the individual to accomplish in a timely manner.  Production is the one thing at this job i feel that really turns everything sour. the warehouse has a very high turnover rate as the demands that the production sheet"
good,"Long hours, 6 or 7 work days. Lack of teamwork and no culture at all. Store standard is low and lack of product. Low pay for management and no room for advancement."
good,Wal-Mart was a decent place to work for as a high-school student. As a adult this job does not compensate my cost of living and there was no room for job advancement
good,"Retail was fast sales driven. I take great pride in assisting customers and teaching and training my subordinates.  "
good,"a typical day at work would consist of people having to do their job and someone else's"
good,la empresa exige mucho y compensa poco en cuanto a la remuneración salarial
good,"management doesn't care for their employees, they need to remember they started at the bottom and worked their way up and know what it felt like to be treated like a rug under foot. Be nice treat people with respect like you do."
good,"The typical day included being forced to rush through calls to reduce wait times and instead give them a ticket to fix later. If the call was over 2 minutes or wasnt able to be fixed while taking another call you were expected to get to it later regardless of urgency. In theory thats fine until you realize that the calls and issues never stop for a team of less than 20 managing over 180,000 devices that all can have issues and there is never downtime to work on the tickets themselves."
good,"Most coworkers were great, many became good friends but management was not always that great. it was hard to find one you could go to with real problems"
good,liked working with the public could have better management but overall it is nice to get 10 per cent off while shopping there if you work there  the departments you work in have stock daily to put away along with customer service
good,"HEAVY LIFTING! Many orders of huge bags of dog food, large cases of water and heavy cans of soda. You are constantly ""staging"" them which means getting them ready for pick up. I'm 5'5"" but Wal-Mart has a cart you stack so high that I had to constantly lift these items over my head ALL day. Then you deliver them to the customer who usually sits in thier car like royalty texting while you are unloading thier heavy items in thier car sometimes in the rain. About 1/3 will help you load,  a third will sit in the car and 1/3 t(the worst) will stand beside you and monitor how you load and tell you where they want things. Pay decent. 11/hour. Most likely you'll work ALL weekend and a lot of afternoon shifts that eat up your day. Managemient is decent but needs to control some of the many cussing/bullying workers that are back there. That seems to be the norm back there  One employee was constantly yelling at the others and it was constantly overlooked like she was a pet."
good,New store manager drove a lot of assistant manager away Which took months to replace and still had no support with the new position that I was in. Poor management skills
good,Working at walmart can be great. Lots of changes are being made and its very hard to understand the reason for it. Things run smoother if you listen to your employees.
good,"In my opinion Walmart would be a decent place to work if not for the incompatent management team that you are forced to be working under."
good,"Got hired at 16, the management never communicated with each other. I would be asked to fold clothes by a manager and 5 minutes later a different manager would tell me to do returns. They had walkie talkies they could have communicated. I got in trouble for ththe silliest things. The work itself made me feel brain dead."
good,I did however enjoy working for Walmart. The only downfall was the management because they really didn't work with you or care about helping people advance.
good,fast paced environment. a typical day at work lasts 11-12 hours. management is very inconsistent and communication sometimes suffers because of it. the most enjoyable part of the job is the employees.
good,No tienen la administración indicada para su factor humano al parecer es lo que menos les interesa.
good,Management could be way better. Taking out time for associates in a positive way..Not always being negative and trying to find something to criticize people for.
good,I worked overnight unloading trucks down stacking pallets and stocking 4 isles. Other employees had 1 isle maybe 2. I had 4. I had a great work ethic and worked hard so they took advantage of that instead of making others work harder. It was a negative atmosphere with to much gossip and not enough work. I always enjoyed the customers.
good,"I was there 2 years and just when my benefits were about to restart I was fired. They messed with the schedule on my two days off (changed my days off). So when I went in on my scheduled work day, I was immediately fired. Luckily I had printed the first schedule and won unemployment after they lied to the unemployment rep and then wouldn't return his calls."
good,There is a lack of help with the amount of things that need to be done. Department manager can't get things done that a manager should be doing. If you don't like people don't work there.
good,"I worked as an overnight stocker and for the unloading team at Walmart."
good,The work environment has changed immensely since I was employed here. The benefits have decreased and the ability to advance has receded. This company has declined in employee relations since the original owner passed away.
good,"Supervisors and assistant managers are always trying to pass the buck to someone else. No one wants to answer calls for help. Open door policy is a joke. Either the manager defends his unprofessional assistant mgrs or tells them what you said and lets them turn up the heat on you. Your schedule depends on how good you are at brown nosing the assistant manager who is rotating through your department.  If you party with your superiors, your job and schedule are safe. Otherwise, look out."
good,I like working here but it has very poor management. I don't have to have a radio to her management yell at customer service managers to basically do everything. They barely page maintenance to sweep the store I see cashier's sweep the store and some get sent outside to push in carts when they don't have a cart pusher. I see cashier's having to do others jobs when others can't do it. It seems very unfair for cashier's and customer service managers! Co-workers are very friendly the only thing driving me away from this job is management!
good,I loved my job. Sadly with the constant changes In management and policies I could no longer feel comfortable In my job role. It was time for a change of my own as my job was consuming my life.
good,walmart is a very great company if only under a great management team. you can grow at walmart with experience and skills but the management there dont see your potential unless favored
good,Some incompetent managers fairly quickly ruined the workplace for myself and others. other than that the job itself wasnt too bad and the pay was better than expected.
good,"Got bored after a couple years of working as a stocker. Doing overnights took a lot out of me, but the people there were for the most part nice and had a lot of laughs there."
good,Stressful at the door! Rude and ignorant people come in! Too much stealing going on! Dangerous job. Meet all kinds of people nice people and ignorant people!
good,Management is a joke 90% of the time. Will harass you and will ALWAYS give you the lowest pay advance no matter how good of a worker you are. Will never work there again
good,"I can tell you as someone who has been a retail worker, then a retail manager, the “typical” retail day is going to be spent inventorying, setting up end caps, cleaning up displays, ringing up sales on a typical cash register, and cleaning. Responsibilities will vary depending upon type of retail outlet, but by and large you won’t be engaging your higher intellect unless someone in management lets you express your views on something like scheduling or advertising (which is highly unlikely)"
good,"Okay temporary job. "
good,Walmart is a discount store designed to save customers moneu. They are known for giving their employees pretty good benefits. The retailer giant treats their employees fairly but manahement is not always the best in my experience
good,"The job isn’t that bad, it’s more the management that I have a problem with. They don’t care when their staff is falling behind. Any time you bring up a problem to then or ask them a question they will either get angry with you, or they just won’t do anything about it. What is management supposed to be for anyway?"
good,"They run the store on a skinny skeleton crew, the main mangers in charge don't seem to care about their job, and since they don't do drug tests, the staff is full of stoner teenagers, which slows down production."
good,"It's like any retail job. Work horrible hours that are inconsistent, end up doing other peoples work, and favoritism.  If you like rude people and standing on your feet all day long, then this is the place to go."
good,"I worked at 2 Walmarts in Pinellas County.  The first was one of the busiest in the entire county.  The hardest part of that job was it was non stop cashing out customers with barely time to breathe in between and replenish bags, keeping the area clean.  Transferred with my manager to open the Walmart down here in Clearwater.  That was much less stressful because it was new and did not do the volume of business as the first one I worked at on Tampa Rd. in Oldsmar.  he most important thing I learned is it is impossible to please every customer."
good,"long and inconsistent hours were stressful.  Work life balance was not conducive to my personal life with a wife and kids.  "
good,Walmart is about pushing product out...when I worked there they usually was under staff and if someone called in that just made the job that much harder
good,"HR and management do not care about you as a person in most cases. Especially stockers. So if you don’t mind over working with your manager forgetting to give you a break for decent pay, go for it. I loved the job!!! But if you need a schedule adjustment.. forget about it."
good,I learned a lot at the lab. How to get along with other with the many different personalities and nationalities. The managers did sometime show favoritism but was respectful to everyone. The work environment was safe and productive not a bad place to work. But they don’t care for loyalty at all their.
good,Fast work place. Lacking in communication. Pressure on getting job done even when work load is to large for one person(want it all done no matter what).
good,Depends on the department and where you work. The more stress the more drama. What can I say about retail they are out to make money fast and that's the way most retail companies are going...
good,"Cuenta con un gran ambiente laboral, pero con salarios mal pagados"
good,"the company is ok to work for. The management really is what makes or breaks the establishment. pay is better compared to most places, but still is not enough. especially with hours being hard to come by during off seasons if youre a part time associate"
good,Se aprende mucho en cambaceo de mercancia pero se le limita mucho el ambiente de trabajo
good,My experience working here has not bee the greatest the last 6 months.  The people that they get to work do not want to put in the work and when I do the work I get reprimanded for doing my job.
good,"Working at walmart wasn't always bad. The main problem was always upper management. No one ever get praise for doing their job every night while busting the butts to try to get everything done. We were constantly understaffed for the amount of work that was put on us to get done. Direct shift management was always fantastic but my direct managers never got any words of encouragement either and more often than not they would get yelled at because we didn't get to things that ""should have been done""."
good,Aprendi al manejo de una handhell y procedimientos varios
good,I would clock in for my night shift and would wait for the night shift meeting and the assignments. after given the job duties i would go straight to my area and start stocking. I learned how to match the barcodes from the products and the the codes on the shelf
good,"As an employee for this company of about 6.5 years, I certainly saw corporate policies and general value of employees increase over the years. New rules regarding relaxation of the dress policy was a major boost in morale for most associates. "
good,"It shouldn't, but it depends on the location you work at. I started from the bottom and worked my way up. I loved it until I transferred to a new location. That store manager was horrible. A lot of favoritism."
good,"Typically stressfull depending where you worked at. Coworkers are generally nice and helpful, however it is hard to find good management. Sometimes felt like a dead end job."
good,"It was easy and fun to be able to meet new people. I did not really like the management very much. Most co workers were fine to be around and did their jobs, others did not."
good,"very stressful , overworked and unappreciated. Looking to find a polsition, within a company where my hard work is acknowledged. I want to work within a team team that  is  goal oriented"
good,A high paced work environment with tasks to fulfill. Stressful because I was in charge of putting out freight correctly in several department alone or with an additional employee.
good,"So far working at this company is fairly good, the staff is very nice and kind. Management is fairly good, the whole company plant works in a collaborative manner which gets the job done. They also celebrate employees birthdays which is awesome."
good,"just life draining, very boring, people are rude, never excited to work there. days go so slow. Customers are even ruder, and giving good customer service is difficult at times."
good,Wal-Mart is a great store and has good potential. But the Wal-Mart I came from was very inconsistent with rules and policies. The management wasn’t up to par either. I had to take charge on my own to get someone to check management.
good,"Not a bad company to work for overall. Flexibility with hours has decreased in the past year. If you want to advance and be promoted, you must be willing to work. The busier stores are very fast paced and demanding, and help is often short. Salaried positions (management) have terrible work/life balance."
good,Change--it can be good and usually is.  But... sometimes you need to listen to your associates that do the job.  After all they are the professionals and they know what their job entails and what they need to excel to be the best they can be.
good,"I work as a dispensing optician. The hours suck. The only reason I gave management a good rating was because vision center has their own manager and my manager cares for us like her own. Walmart has too many changes not benefiting the associate, only benefiting their pockets. Standard across the board 2% raises. No advancement."
good,"A empresa é boa,pena quem faz a gestão deixa a desejar."
good,"Employees where very professional with co-workers - worked as a team players and every one was supportive. Front end managers where responsible for counting in and counting out money drawers, Intensive training is provided to employees on various laws company policy and more."
good,Walmart is a good place to work depending on how the store is ran. I feel they don’t value longtime employees and they should really learn to get to know the people who are actually putting in work all over
good,"Walmart was an ok job I had fun decorating cakes."
good,I stood too much in one department and made me have complications in my pregnancy. I had to quite a few months after due to the standing position and not able to move.
good,"Stocked shelves and loaded merchandise and food to be stocked. Some of the co workers were pleasant, as well as a few managers. Doubtful I would recommend."
good,"The Walmart I was hat unpleasant managers. Upon my arrival, they made it seem as if it was so fun to work there. Turns out they all hate to work there lol. "
good,Well working at Walmart was fun and challenging. The people were nice and friendly. They do have to many management that all tell you to do different things all at once. I really should have thought your daily task should come from your department manager. I feel like management didn't communicate well with each other. They all had different ways to do things. which makes it hard to know who to follow. It is hard to get people to help. But when you do get someone to help you they really do a wonderful job. And most of the supervisors are polite.
good,"Work on a typical day is ok. In the 16 overall years I have been with them, they have changed things some for the better, some for the worse. Even with the addition of the Wal-Mart Academy a couple of years ago, salary management still has a long way to go to improve on an Associate/Manager relationship level. Culture of the workplace does reflect on the morale,which can change a lot depending on management. Hardest part of the job is communication and expectations from salary management, and the lack of help in the stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and associates."
good,"Everyone under the pay grade of assistant manager is expendable. Dedicated almost 2 years of my life to be terminated for something I was not even warned about. You can be actually brain dead and make manager position. Most of the higher management people at Walmart are severely emotional, and in dire need to take out their personal grievances on you."
good,"I believe My performence at work intiminated some  for there positions, but feel they could do more Im heghly Qaulified to work in Human resource area or adminstration as a leader and or public relations specialist dealing with  marketing."
good,If you like being around a lot of people this is the place. It's a fast pace work environment and fun at the same time. The co-workers are a big help.
good,"E uma empresa boa de trabalhar, mas precisa de gerenciamento mais adequado."
good,"A typical day at work, arriving 30-45 early walking the floor to see how well the areas are. I would then check to see if all my workers that were scheduled to be on duty for that day wherein for productivity. I would then check my list for my duties for that day so that they could be well met. then proceed on with my day."
good,Great pay. overtime became unavailable during the last year. some supervisores were great but most treated the average employee second rate.if your willing to work extremely hard your a good fit. They have strayed away  from there core family values.
good,It’s ok to work there but it’s fast pace you got to have great customer service every single day no matter the situation an they base your insurance on the hours you work
good,"‘MWalmart is like  no other,  job it’s a good and bad mix but that’s also life. over all Walmart isn’t  far down on the list of ok jobs in my book . ‘’"
good,This company is not as employee friendly as they would like the public to think they are. Schedules are geared to BYU-I students and the LDS church. If you are not a member you do not count.
good,"Need better pay scale for the amount of work you have to do. Dealing with rude customers can be a challenge, but it's always a pleasure to ensure their satisfication."
good,I would say Walmart is a great workspace once you get to your own register. You work on your own pace but sometime it can get a little busy and you would have to move a lot faster than usual.
good,it was a decent job but management made it next to impossible to get any jobs done always pulling you away but yet complain the job never was finished
good,I liked what I was doing but the management left a lot to be desired. I felt that they were very biased and were harder on me than deserved. My department manager wouldn't teach me what I needed to know for my job but I'm the one who got in trouble. One thing I did like was that they schedule you for 9 hours instead of 8 and a half and you get an hour lunch which felt more like a break
good,Walmart as a company is a nice place to work. Management lacks training and dedicates to much time to work process and does not care about customer service like they preach. Customers are not number one. It’s sad to see.
good,"When ever thier was a increase in base pay you would start at the base rate all over again and you will never make more than a new hire."
good,"Stressful environment bred not only by customers but management. It's not healthy for anyone. The only enjoyable part are those brief instances of kindness from customers otherwise the day drags on. Management claims an 'open door' policy but regularly shuns and gives a unapproachable attitude towards associates. Complaints about hours or scheduling conflicts are only taken seriously after constant badgering of several different managers. However, it is a great place to learn about patience and how difficult retail can be. If anyone does decide to work there or has an opportunity to, I would recommend taking it for a temporary job only to get a new perspective on working retail."
good,It was good for a while of working there then started to become really toxic for coworkers and management so caused me so much stress to the point where I dreaded going to work.
good,The benefits are good but the amount of work you do especially in graveyard shift it's not justify the pay you receive. You only get .50 cents more for working overnight. A social life is basically non-existent since you sleep most of the time just to be functional for the job. The clientele can range from pleasant to down right disciple scum. If they don't get there way they insist they see the manager over the smallest things. e.g A vacuum cleaner for the display model price since its the only one we have. Fun fact the display models are a penny because they don't work.
good,"If you are working for Walmart, be sure to work as a cashier! They have it the easiest by far. Stocking shelves is a lot of work and they try to get twenty people's worth of work done with five people."
good,Working for this company was a pleasure with its up and downs.Can be a fun and productive place to work at times. It has change in the past few years.
good,Muy mal ambiente laboral en general. Los gerentes son muy groseros y despotas.
good,The most enjoyable part of being a manager at Wal-mart was merchandising and buliding displays developing ideas for sales and effective sales. taking a product with poor sales and finding ways to improve on that.
good,"Friendly coworkers."
good,The only thing good about the job was the associates. The store manager is very unfair unless you are one of the favorites. If you are not a favorite then they will look for ways to wright you up. Even for stupid reasons
good,"Management at the Walmart I work for is unresponsive and uncaring. They say customer service comes first but the reality if quite different, they are more concerned with making sure all the daily things to do list is completed. A prime example is trying to get assistance for a customer when a problem occurs, very slow and uncaring for the very customers they contend are so important. "
good,At this job you need to be in shape and need to stay hydrated. In all this is a great place to work if you are in shape and like and enjoy having a physical job day to day.
good,"The pharmacist has a power trip having to have a victim every day she works, not a nice person and is always hateful regardless of who or what position they hold. must be nice to be perfect."
good,"Walmart is not a place for everyone. If you can handle working top speed 100% of your shift, you might make it here. However, if you feel you are constantly being harassed about your work speed, you may find yourself in a situation where you have to consider if the wages are worth the disrespect."
good,Like the company overall. Just looking for other opportunities. Worked with great associates and the company truly has some amazing assests in place that care about the people theu serve
good,buen ambiente de trabajo pero sueldos  bajos eso hace que el personal no dure
good,"When I originally applied I told them that I couldn’t stalk shelves but that was the position I was given, and I couldn’t change it or appeal the position for 6 months, my back is bad and they wanted you to finish 2-3 aiels by 2am"
good,"Walmart is always changing. If you aren't under good management, you will dread your employment here. There is room for advancement and growth in this company. Best thing to do is just fly under the radar."
good,"I would collect the shopping carts continuously all day."
good,"Full Time College Student; Part Time Walmart Sales Associate. I currently work about 12 hours a week. Co Workers are nice enough, longer breaks are very nice but while only working 12 hours a week is wonderful to focus on school; it just is not enough to make ends meet with such a low salary. Managers are not always great about thinking of their employees lives outside of Walmart and seem to schedule you whenever is convenient for them and not for you- which can make trying to stay on top of school difficult."
good,"i have scan the thing sometime i have to help-other people where the things is. i have learn so many thing from there be kind, alway smile, talk to them. some time is do hard."
good,"some days were bad and some were good "
good,"E uma empresa boa de trabalhar, mas precisa de gerenciamento mais adequado."
good,"Every day is very routine, of course customer service is and always is a must. Walmart is lacking of excellent managers, some are good. Hardest part is just as any other retail company/store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability and opportunity to successfully assist and complete any customer's request for help."
good,"Overnights are constantly being threatened with being shut down. The management stretch a few people to do multiple people's jobs, then complain when you can't get it all done."
good,I didn’t like that I only worked two weeks a month for only 3 days. Work is good but tiring specially nights. Employees are very helpful and friendly customers are very impatient
good,As a stockmen most o your day is rounding up shopping carts and returning them to the car holding area inside of the store.  There are some time that you are expected to always provide outstanding customer service.
good,Liked working here.  The day went by quick.  There is always something to do or something to stock....................................................
good,I worked for WALMART for almost 5 years the mangers are the toughest thing to deal with I loves serving the customers and working there but the mangers do not work with you at all
good,"Very fast paced,lack of support.very unorganized when scheduling is done. No one there reflects being a team player and what it means to be one in the work force."
good,"Not the best place for someone that likes to think of new ways to work better/faster. The One Best Way changes every week and no one can keep up. Great place to work and get experience, but don't recommend staying very long."
good,It was times lines got backed up but u just have to keep pushing forward the co workers were ok n my department manager was cool also I would work here again
good,"Managers have unrealistic task times."
good,I left for health reasons .Breaks and lunches were very regimented. Each Manager seemed to be running their own store. Every Manager had their own agenda. It seems to me that they mostly communicated by e-mail
good,The Wal-Mart staff had very thorough and in-depth training sessions and are willing to hire you with little to none experience with cash handling and customer service.
good,"my most enjoyment part of this job is dealing with customers learned alot about retail and how it works, working with different culture of people is hard at times but the smiles and thank you for helping them are the best,no benifits but good managers and job security"
good,"The days earliest shift begins at 4 am, late shift ends at 8 pm or later depending on what needs to be cleaned up. There are various shifts throughout the day that average as an 8 hour workday with a 1hr lunch off the clock and two 15min breaks on the clock. You are exposed to extreme temperatures depending on where you are assigned as a personal shopper. The time you come in affects the area you will be in for most of your shift. It is daunting on extremely busy days dealing with thousands of products and many customers. It is an okay job, and they say its better than many jobs in the store. I will be honest, I personally don't enjoy it and it is not what I expected, even though its temporary. My shifts change all the time. It gets exhausting and many associates don't care as much about their job as you would like. It beats being jobless."
good,"very easy job, took me two days to catch on. everything's pretty slow in the morning. things pick up around 12-2, slow back down around 7-8....you meet nice people on the daily. I enjoy being cashier."
good,"At first I was elated I got a job at Walmart - then the company as a whole started changing policies and procedures, they care more about customers..."
good,"Mon experience Walmart n'a pas etait la meilleure. J,avais beaucoup dattente et jai ete grandement insatisfait. Je suis un personne qui travaille dure et pour les taaches qu'on me donner je trouver que je netit pas assez paye, paarfois on me donner des ordres"
good,ok to work for. I would not make a career out of this. skin need to be thick. can be stressful. the most enjoyable part of my job was to see the smalls on the customers faces. I learned how to be more caring and understanding
good,"Mangers treated you like a kid, always had an attitude when you came to them with a problem. stressful work environment, worked with cool people though."
good,"WalMart only raised the employee wages to comply with the recent minimum wage employment requirements.  Overall, it is a place where one can gain a lot of experience, but not advancement or monetary remuneration."
good,fast pace work from the start of the day to the end. constantly having to pick up the slack for those that are slower paced. rushed to get all acomplished by the end of shift. Too many want to be bosses.
good,Walmart is not the worst place in the world but it’s also not the best. I suppose it would be okay for someone who enjoys working in retail but I’m fed up with retail work.
good,"The store I worked at was bad. Upper management was nasty & condescending, some co-workers were unfriendly & rude. The co-workers I did get along with weren't even in my department and I didn't get to see them often. I felt like I was the minority since I was white and everyone else was a different race. I did have some favorite customers and they always went out of their way to say hello to me which was nice."
good,"very fast paced talking with customers on a friendly basis is a very cool part of the job "
good,I have worked for the company for 11 years and management is very unreliable and not very supportive what a company needs to be when it comes to customer service they tends to not communicate with the customers which upsets them and they takes it out on the employees
good,I did just fine in Colorado came to Kansas and the manager I had was very unprofessional I was the only employee on nights who could do every role and department and did a supervisers role with resets I got treated so poorly my manager annie was so unprofessional went off on me for no reason because something I was told to do by my superviser I got blamed. she showed favoritism I had to resign not to mention exploited all my personal business to the whole meeting.
good,The communication both in the stores and company is very poor.  Management really has no rights and there is no work/life balance.  Management on several occasions is forced to stay to make up for areas that are short.
good,Good job for those without a degree to move up. Hard on people with family or church responsibilities. Environment is mediocre at best. Still it was nice to work so close to home and family for so many years.
good,"I already work a full-time job. Walmart is only part-time. I work in apparel, so they require you to work until 11pm. This is not ideal when you have to be up the next morning by 4:30am. I am going to have to let it go soon. I don't get enough sleep."
good,"I really enjoy working for Walmart. With all these changes that are being made now, I'm ready for another occupation. I am ready for something different and ready for a better paying job."
good,"I knew I was only going to be working at Walmart for only 1 year, but I had a great time there with my immediate coworkers. My direct supervisor and manager were Phenomenal, but upper management and home office is just a mess. With such big company as Walmart is, their value of associates is just horrible. it did not matter how hard I worked or not, everyone gets paid the same and that is a huge blow in anyones work ethic."
good,"After the holidays, everyone’s hours got cut. I can’t afford to stay there. Downside is, now I have to look for another job. I’m a people person and so I loved interacting with the shoppers but my paycheck was nearly nothing."
good,"My day was very up and down, I would clock in and say good morning to everyone. I would rush a bit to see if there was any equipment available. Then we would rush to get picks for customers done by 2pm or 3pm. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I would typically fulfill substitutions and refunds for items not found in the store. I would also flip to help dispense orders to customers when needed. The hardest part of my job is pleasing management when the team is falling behind or when we are unusually busy."
good,As an employee everyone should get treated equally all my customers liked me cause i took that time and effort to help them. Sometimes customers they come to shop but they be looking for an listening ear to tell their problems to. Never ignore them cause customers are always first.
good,Job has good pay and decent benefits but it is poorly ran and keeps losing associates. Most nights my department is understaffed and we are forced to take on an even larger work load than normal
good,My team was under staffed for a bit of my time there but as we got more people it started to pick up an be able to complete the work on time and to the company’s standards
good,Enjoyed my job and responsibilities.  Always an aspect in retail that can be improved.  Varied daily routine. Created lasting personal relationships to this day.
good,"the team who download the truck is underated and not supported, the floor is empty of workers however you need to still doing 3 people jobs"
good,"This job is not to stressful, but can be a handful with customers at times. co-workers are usually fun or interesting to work with. The Job can have decent pay"
good,"decent place to work if you cant find something higher paying, there are clear sign or favoritism and management only deals with morning people and if your not apart of the morning crew you will be left with your own devices and if you complain thats a lvl 1 coaching"
good,The job itself is easy but the associates and management don't communicate so that start a big confusion and the non management associates get blame and coach(wrote up) and three of them your out and people will play the blame game til it not on them anymore
good,"The job was okay, no real benefits as far as I was concerned. The management were all rude and didn't care about you or your personal life/problems. They pushed me out after hurting my back at home and taking 2 days to recover."
good,"They don't treat staff equally, everything is one sided. Meaning they never think there Mangers are wrong in there judgement. They are quick to have a staff person to step into doing department manager duties, but not give them the salary or title. They prefer to promote someone that don't have that experience, and have you train them to keep you in that department as back up for management."
good,"Floor managers aren't on the same page. Do not deal with work injuries well."
good,"Check out customers for two hours, break for 15 minutes. Two hour work period with one hour lunch. Two hour work period, 15 minute break. Two hour work period and shift ends. I learned stamina, courtesy, how to smile dealing with difficult customers. The staff were the most enjoyable,  hard working and courteous."
good,The hours are great a bonus 4 times a year and good health benefits are a great draw to the company but management can be difficult sometimes specially during the high seasons (Halloween to new years)
good,Working for Walmart I have seen how they treat their people and it is with no compassion and no values we are basically slaves to their money making empire
good,"I did love working for Walmart. I liked my co-workers and my immediate bosses.  "
good,It was calm and easy to do both departments. I always had enough time to get every thing done and still be able toclean up at the end of the day. but I could always do my work fast and good.
good,I've had doctor appointment's denied. I've also had to cover twelve departments by myself for multiple hours. It's fine when there's little traffic but that never last long. At night you're lucky to see two people in one department. You're constantly being pulled to do other tasks and required to finish the others as well. Even if you try to explain that you're on a task by someone equal or higher up than the one asking they won't listen.
good,A typical work day for Wal-Mart can be done with relative ease so long as things already going smoothly in the location you work which was not the case where I worked management at the upper levels was abysmal and mid-tier management struggled to pick up the slack
good,"Management at my store is absolutely horrible. They have their favorites and there is a lot of drama from other coworkers. Management doesn’t want to help out at all. It’s very stressful at times but the pay is decent and it’s hard to find another job that pays the same rate. You get discounts and PTO, which is nice as well. Good place to start getting retail experience, easy to advance in the company if you catch the eye of upper management. Hours are rough most of the time and very inconsistent, 38 hours one week then 30 the next. I have had to take a half hour lunch every day instead of the usual 1 hour, just so I can get more hours. I have worked until 11pm then had to work at 6 or 7am the next day. Overall not bad, it is a job, but definitely not a career in my opinion unless you are favored by upper management."
good,"When unloading trucks you more more then just that you also sort small items into different departments, you also have to know what items that break are hazardous and how to dispose of them properly."
good,I was a cashier who worked on the busiest cash registers as I was fast and accurate (have a lot of experience dealing with customers and cash).  The management were nice.  The hardest part of this job was the various hours one had to work with the minimum wage (this was a survival job for me until I got into a clerical job which I have been trained for and worked in most of my career life).  I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers.
good,"One of the best years of my work career were there, I got to help lots of people. I was a very commended worker, had a few great compliments from customers. I always went out my way to make sure the customer was satisfied."
good,"Walmart management is horrible, they do not have good communication skills and always harassing the employees. The only good thing about Walmart is the pay and the benefits. Most of the people are disrespectful and full themselves."
good,I enjoy My WalMart on a daily bases. Management needs work. My Walmart doesn't have many advancement opportunities. I Love the customers at My Walmart they make my work easier. Great employer for college students.
good,work at this place is cool if you don't have a family to take care of they don't pay you fair they don't give hours if your a high school student its a great place to work
good,"I enjoy what i am doing as a customer service associate, very fast paced, you have to be very patient when working in retail and dealing with customers, some people can really test your patients, but you have to stay patient and still be very polite even tho some customers scream and yell at you,you have to listen and remain com and try to defuse the issue, if you cant  defuse the issue you have to call for management, you have to be very cautious and make sure when you are dealing with money to make sure your cashing the checks correct and take customers right information to do so"
good,"Typical cashier job, you get there, clock in, go to your assigned register and work until your break, take your break, go back to work. Sometimes i was allowed to go outside and organize the baskets, i always looked froward to being able to move around."
good,"Drove a fork lift and moved merchandise around and to the loading dock. When I moved then items I recorded what I moved and where."
good,Team work is important some days there was no team work and I had to do things myself. Half the time couldn't find my team leader for a problem or cancern.
good,"I was taught a lot about how the retail world works. I learned how to manage merchandise flow and making features for end caps. I learned how to price change merchandise, and work freight from truck to shelf."
good,"Job was stressful and often under-staffed. Training did not adequately prepare you for the floor; most of everything you learned was from someone else. Management was terrible. The only managers that do anything are the support managers, who are basically whipping dogs to the higher-ups. Upper management was inept, and heavily played favorites, especially to people they slept with. Management in general did not care about the typical employee, especially part-timers."
good,"I can only review the store I worked at and not walmart a whole.  I worked really hard, was professional, exceeded expectations, but it didn't matter."
good,"Management sucks, not willing to work with your hours, letting a lot of people go that's worked for the company for a long time, don't care about their employees"
good,"I liked the people I worked with well enough but the constant pressuring for MC apps, and the monotony of doing the same thing every single day really gets yo you, and in the end I find it hard to recommend anyone work here."
good,customer service was a major part of my duties. I was  willing to learn more about the pharmacy tech position in which I was not being trained in since they hired someone from another Walmart work site in the south to fill that position.  I went to a training program specifically for Pharmacy Tech but It appeared that they did not want to take the time to train me because of the high volume of customers associated with the pharmacy on a day to day basis. I was always willing to learn more about the day to day operations of the Pharmacy.
good,"Terrible management . Rude and arrogant people walking around. Management is one of the reasons quit after being with the company for 6 months. Get new managers, store wide, and i would go back."
good,Management that is in place at my store has been there entirely to long. and with that being said they have lost their command for respect. so employees  honestly have no fear of losing their jobs so they work half as well as they should.
good,"Working here is OK, you meet people from other towns working on a lot of projects, you also learn basically warehouse functions and learn the basics of inventory management."
good,Typical day of work would be trying to keep up with the volume of customers wanting services performed on vehicles. hardest part of job is dealing with irate customers. Most enjoyable part of job would be leaving for the day
good,I think that overall Walmart is not a bad place to work as long as your a people person and as long as you don't mind hard physical labor too. The people there are really nice and are very helpful when you first start to make sure your doing everything right.
good,"My wish is that I can find a closer location. The job itself is good but my location isn't. I've been really hesitant about leaving because I like my coworkers and the energy I have when I'm there. I feel like management can be a lot better than they are. What I've learned is that I cant give up because it gets hard or things don't go as planned, I just have to roll with what is dealt to me. After all I am doing it all for my family and I'm trying to create a better life for my family."
good,"no need for a review, but if I have to say something about the life at Walmart. I would have to say it starts with management if management can do a better job of teaching and training there associates better and stop bringing there feelings from home to the work place then that will be a start...."
good,"Being a department manager was alot of work but paid off in many ways, teaching you skills to manage products, delegate employess and responsitbilities and a gave me a feeling of accomplishment.  There was a lot of stress on management and the hardest part was feeling the pressure of understaffing and the sheer mass of production. The results of hard work was returned with customers satisfaction so it was rewarding."
good,"My day start at 10 pm with a hectic and unsafe backroom receiving area , other managers work with a no care attitude , the only thing on their mind is when the 8 hours will be finish , while some of us worked 8 to 12 hours sometimes without any recognition from upper manages ."
good,"Your experience working in a Walmart will widely vary depending on both where you live and who you work with. Everyone no doubt has probably heard their horror stories, and those do happen. But still It depends on previously mention things."
good,"Whenever I have work to do, I was forced to take on roles for other people such as greeter to give them lunches or breaks and front-end cashier when they ""need"" someone. When this happens, I can never get my work done when it needs to be or help customers appropriately. Most of the managers are sometimes to almost never coordinate around the store. They are not giving people the set hours they are supposed to get because they either cut them, shorten them or give them no time for a week."
good,"I worked at walmart for months and really loved all the people i got to talk to. They are what made the job good and fun, But when there were problems with my schedule managment never tried to fix it and always got irritated with me when i tried to bring it to there attention. That lead to complications with my home life and my kids with there babysitter."
good,i think Walmart is a good start job but its not a place to be for more than 3 to 4 years i know different Walmart's treat their employees different but Randallstown is 1 of the worse Walmart's Maryland
good,"Stressful loading and unloading trucks, stocking shelves, separating merchandise, putting merchandise on pallets. I learned that I needed a better job with benefits and somewhere I go move up to something better. The workplace was fair as long as I had people around that wanted to work and be productive. The hardest part of the job stocking shelves while customers are in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off."
good,Ready for a change. Very demanding of an associate. Need to have patients and alot of motivation. Not for timid or weak in strenght characteristic person to work. Sometimes lack of respect.
good,i liked working there. i had alot of medical problems. i paid the price of that and was fired .they expect you to work when you are sick i understand they need you there but sometimes its impossible
good,Hard to move up within store I was employed unless you were friends with a manager. Several associates that were promoted within were promoted by managers who they knew from outside of work place on a social level and would spend time with outside of work and discuss plans with each other in the work zone in front of other associates.
good,"Walmart is a good company to get some job experience and to have a current work history.  You can move up to a Customer Service Manager position, Department Manager,......and Assistant Manager positions.  There are very few office jobs if that is what you are seeking for future advancement."
good,Going into this job I knew it would be temporary. It wasn’t a bad job while I was there. Management was not the best but the people i worked with were really nice and helpful.
good,"Lack of knowledge of PTO using with sick time "
good,Lots of joking around. certain people were not doing their job. often pawning their workload onto other associates. Associates problems are often unheard. Inappropriate behavior was not dealt with even when brought up to higher management.
good,Walmart does not have paid sick leave for part time employees. Your work hours can be very different every week. Now they have a core scheduling packet that you work 3 months.
good,"The hours for Walmart are not enough, and are not flexible with my life style. It is difficult to advance inside of Walmart. I've been there for almost two years and have not seen any room for advancement. The management are almost always too busy to help out when they are needed. My customers will be waiting up to 45 minutes before a manger even comes by to assist in whatever is needed.  There are not enough employees to complete all the tasks management wants done everyday. Too much is expected from one person on a shift. The most enjoyable part of working for Walmart is my department manager and a few of my co workers."
good,I would go back now that there is new management. The pay was good considering what you were doing. One week you would have 40 hours then the next you would be cut to 25 so they wouldnt have to place you as permanent full time and offer life insurance.
good,"Management is horrible. They treat us like kids and expect you to bow down to them. They over work us but when were short, they dont want to help when in time of need."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was an experience I will not forget. The ultimate in corporate America.  Just keep your nose clean and you will be fine.  They can fire you for any reason and tell you that every day
good,I only considered it a temporary job. the work environment was okay but it felt unorganized sometimes. Alot of work had to be done in so little time and most of the time that did not happen
good,Liked to work with others got to meet other people and help others answer questions that they might have got to help with carry out help in other departments.
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience, Greeting and meeting new people. One thing i loved was to see the look on the kids face when they came and got the foods they liked and it was fresh. I've faced a couple of challenges working there as well, for example i dealt with a Racist customer and was called out my name plenty of times. What i did was call a manager and let them deal with the situation instead of arguing or handling it in a different matter. I was really close with a couple of my co-workers and they made it feel like home to me, At times i didn't wanna leave work cause my day was so awesome."
good,"I worked the night shift, I had three tasks: stock the shelves for the morning sales associates, product facing which is making sure all front labels are facing outward where customer could read the product name, assist other cashiers when the lines were too long."
good,"I loved it at first but I had the worst CSM Angelia she would just pick on people , had a very smart mouth and just made You hate your job the customers were no problem it was just a few workers mainly old workers"
good,"Wal-Mart a few years ago used to be a positive place to work. Now there's new management and seems as if nobody cares about the workers. I've dedicated 5 years of my life to this company and was very passionate about it, now I don't feel valued. I know more than both my supervisor and assistant manager combined but they're always leading us in the wrong direction. The hardest part of my job is trying to do things the correct way but we have to listen to management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits but the stress I've been under lately I'm slowly starting to not care anymore about all of the wrong things being performed at this job."
good,Always seemed to be busy wile on the clock here so the time kinda flys by. Often new products to be added to the floor so you get quick knowledge of the shelves. Veteran employees seemed to try to help newer associates up to pair so that also was helpful in the beginning
good,They need better management that is nice to their associate and pay them better and work with their hours better than what they do.i learned alot working at walmart but the managers show favortism towards who they like and whobthey would like to work with
good,"Every Walmart is different.  I couldnt advance within the company due to the barriers the store manager kept placing on me because i was humble and loved my job,  i was more useful as a regular associate doing the job of a department manager without officially getting the promotion, the store manager kept promising the position but i didnt get the pay that is suppose to come with the position"
good,Really really stressful.Management Didn't really care just get it done. Co workers where excellent. Benefit  were good. Overall was a Good job but not good enough
good,Work atmosphere has changed. More responsibility and less help. Mixed messages on compliance and SOP from different districts  Management says one thing and then focuses on priorities.
good,Its a good place to work at if there is enough people. The location i worked in was very understaffed and it was very stressfull trying to meet the the goal at the end of the day.
good,Walmart is a company who’s leadership is at the forefront of what it takes to keep associates happy and engaged. However as it trickles through the ranks there’s a dilution of the strong ethics and guidelines the company prides itself on.
good,"At one time Walmart was a wonderful company to work for. They seem to be moving toward the computer age and doing away with many actual employees. Many positions have been eliminated in the past year, with more coming in January. There has been talk of handheld scanners that customer's carry are going to be replacing cashiers. They scan what they want while shopping and before they leave the store they use the walmart pay option on the walmart app to pay without going through a register. There would be a door greeter at the door to check receipts. If they choose to pay cash, they print out a ticket and scan that ticket at the self checkouts. Then proceed to show receipt to door greeter."
good,"Working at Walmart you have to be quick, the place is always busy with customers. The management is kind and fair, and working there can also be rewarding, meeting new friends and learning new skills can make it all worth it."
good,I managed the toy department at walmart and it was ever changing which made it exciting. I enjoyed the fast pace and the constant hustle. I had great employees working with me to keep the department in great condition.
good,"Empresa com bom ambiente de trabalho, colegas unidos, porém um pouco desorganizado, e com uma gestão bem comprometedora."
good,"I wouldn’t mind going back to Walmart,but truthfully the management there is terrible,they are not on the same page.but it’s a great environment to in."
good,"Although Walmart is a great company, the one I worked for had a couple of problems. I could ever get time off even if i requested weeks I’m advance and they consistently cut hours."
good,It’s an alright job for beginners and offers decent pay. However where I worked no manager wants to actually do anything by the book. Instead orders are conflicting and just strange.
good,Great co-workers can be found working there. However management there were all me first. Would take associates from other areas not their own. Then leave associates out to dry and lie to save them from embarrassment or save them from getting in hot water when other things were not do from pulling the associate.
good,"it was okay but the management was pretty bad with the staff and all , it was not a very good work environment also there was some tension between a few employees"
good,"Same thing every day, stocking, cleaning, not much managerial contact at all. They leave you on your own. Expect you to keep busy, but do not come out to help."
good,"Management played favorites often and would reserve promotion opportunities for their favorites."
good,Walmart can be a good place to work if management take responsibility for the many problems policies bring when it comes to their associates dealing with the demands of Customers. Many associates felt as though they were not being heard and had a tendency to not fully do their jobs or even show for work. This in turn caused extra stress on other associates.
good,"I worked at Walmart for 7 years, and I think it was ok, but I wasn’t very happy towards the end.  I’m much happier now that I don’t work there.  There’s a lot of favoritism at the store where I worked, and a lot of the managers let their “pets” tell them what to do."
good,It wasn't the worst job I've ever had but it wasn't the best either. Management is decent but it's not the first place I would recommend someone to. There are lots of pros and cons about Walmart but for me I think the cons overruled.
good,"I once asked a co-worker that worked there for years why she would stay there so long and she said ""It would be too much work to find another."" That basically sums up every Associate's answer. Its hard to find a job that will pay you the same. It is not an easy place to work."
good,It's not terrible but it's a job and that's it. I would like to move up and if really difficult to do so. All of the management is great to work for .
good,"Walmart is a very fast paced company, they offer good benefits, annual raises, paid vacations. Walmart is always crowded no matter what day or time, they don’t pay enough for all the work you have to do."
good,"While overall I loved my time on the front end as well as my coworkers, I am glad it is over. I worked an average of 8-10 hours a day and usually worked 6-7 days a week, only to get one day off before my next shift. The overtime was great, but I would work until 11pm, only to be scheduled at 6am the next day, and then get called in on my day off. Lines were long as I would only have 2-3 cashiers scheduled at peak times, and management only cared enough to yell but not solve the problem. Management was lacking in skills most of the time, the store was chronically and severely understaffed, and pay was not as good as competitors paying for the same position. Plenty of advancement opportunities, but be prepared for 50+ hours a week once you’re a salaried manager. They have also eliminated a lot of hours and positions throughout the company in the last year, so be cautious."
good,"Didn’t like it very much, made a couple of friends, but overall it seemed Walmart wasn’t on top of things when it came to customer needs, but I can only speak for the Walmart I worked at. I can’t say that every Walmart is like that. The routine was soul killing"
good,Little room for advancement and poor accountability. Walmart culture plays to the lowest common denominator and in so doing gets the lowest common denominator.
good,"its a stressful job, you are on production so a typical day is picking cases for 10 hours the workplace isn''t very enjoyable not a happy place to work but the job pay well and you can just go in do your job and leave."
good,"A typical day at work at the Wal-Mart that I worked at revolved around the Electronics department. You would come in and have to clean up any of the mess the previous shift left before you because they didn't care or were swamped with work. While maintaining (or attempting to maintain) a relatively clean work area/department, you also had to maintain the register back there, help people with questions as well put the returns on the shelf and stocking the shelf with freight that didn't get put away in the morning."
good,"Work on a typical day would either be an okay day or a hard day. I started working at Walmart I never worked as a cashier or in the deli. I learned how to use a register when I was a cashier. When I started working in the deli, I learned how to use the fryer, rotisserie oven, and the slicer, I also learned how to close down the deli. When it comes to management there are some members of management that are willing to fully work with you and listen, then there are some that are not willing to listen to you and work with you. The hardest part of the job is when you are trying to get a hold of management to talk to them about problems going on in the department. I always enjoyed making the customers smile or laugh."
good,"Management and company policies are the biggest down fall in this company. Advancement comes and goes but they consider seniority for these positions. When they need you to work, they will try to make it a more mandatory thing instead of option. During peak season they will most likely have 12+ hour shifts. Management is always stressed out and then effect the workers by putting stress on them."
good,"It's a decent place to work. Benefits aren't bad (that's if they schedule you enough hours so that you qualify). If you don't have open availability, don't expect to get a lot of hours."
good,As a cashier it could  be a little stressful working with the customers. Got sent to other departments to work quite often. Limited advancement opportunities to advance forward.
good,I really enjoyed working for Walmart when I was in college the management would work with my school hours they made sure my schedule was flexible I enjoy having personal days and sick days
good,"Walmart takes care of there employees, but management and the day to day work process is always questionable. Being trained in many areas is a great opportunity, but I believe employees are not used to there potential."
good,Constantly pulling associates around. spreading people thin. Learned a lot about phones and electronics. worked with power equipment. Most enjoyable part is going home.
good,There is computer training at the offices in Walmart. Management was just fine. The culture was very diverse. I believe that the hardest part of the job was being able to keep up and the most enjoyable would be the breaks and lunchtime.
good,I decorate customer orders and make all sorts of cakes and desserts for the pastry case.  I write special cake orders for my customers. responsibility of dated products and fill the shelfs.  I also have experience as a front end cashier.
good,"Walmart could be a great place to work if the culture changed. Management there do not listen very well and are not very good at coming up with solutions to problems. We have been severely understaffed over time of months with very little solution to the problem. On top of that, the freight or other parts of the job are not slowing down, they are only getting worse. But our management team does not seem to get that, and will just yell at you if things don't get done the right way, even though we are not even at capacity to handle all that it takes to keep a store running. This job is very stressful and takes a toll on me too much so that I am looking for a new outlet. I cannot take it just working live freight all day with nothing else getting done when we have no associates and then have all the problems build up and then explode and get questions from my supervisor about these problems aren't getting resolved. My answer is with an obvious question: you wonder why...?! I can't work for a store when we don't have the management team who can run the store and proactively find ways to accommodate the situation without them threatening to coach us or other disciplinary action even thought the situation was created because they are not ensuring a good workplace where people actually want to work."
good,It is a good place to start getting work experience and to pay for education. They have some really good people working for them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the good people.
good,"Since so many people come to Walmart, it was nice to speak to different people every day & deal with different situations with each customer as they came through my line."
good,Walmart was a competitive and overwhelming job i was over worked at times the pay was not enough for what they would ask you to do they do not take doctors note if your sick
good,"Some things are good, others are not. Cons slightly outweigh the pros. Culture is a little better for people in management. Starting pay could be better"
good,"job was challenging at times,  learned controls ,management was ok, culture was ok, hardest part was keeping up with repairs. enjoyed the challenges. sometimes had issues with management."
good,the people that you work with here is what you come in for other than a paycheck. they are friendly and realize what the job is and when and how to be serious
good,"Every manager and assistant manager recommended me as their first choice to be hired on as a full time permanent employee. So when the time came for selection, and they addressed the group of the 7 people ( including myself) who were not able to come in that weekend to help with inventory, I was THE ONLY ONE FIRED. THE ONLY ONE! I honestly felt as though the store manager had something against me, i have never disrespected her or anyone for that matter. So I would recommend if you apply be extremely careful around her."
good,"I was employed here for 6 years with no advancement opportunities, There really wasn't much to look forward to as far as the future with walmart. I enjoyed my time working there but now its time for more."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart at the time I did. The managers were very flexible and were willing to help me find a job at another walmart when I had to move.
good,"It's fine, I guess. Your co-workers are probably nice enough, up until recently management couldn't figure out what it wanted the dress code to be, so use that to guess how competent they are as a collective."
good,"I suppose each store is different so a review is not beneficial. Pay is ok. High for around here for unskilled labor. Management has their moments, but in general is not fun to work for. Concrete flooring takes it's toll on the body."
good,"face pace. many different customers throughout the day. i learned many different ways how to slice meats, stock store. how to handle customers on spot."
good,The only way you will move up is based on who you know and how well you schmooze.Not for how hard you work or prove your abilities as an associate. I have been working solo in layaway. i was promised a team when asked to work it. yet i am alone. i have to beg for my breaks that are usually an hour later. The more you learn the more they will use you to their advantage. There is not much professionalism in many areas. There are several associates who really try to do there best and are great people over all. But they too are frustrated.
good,"You always seem to walk into someone else's work which has to be finished before you can do your own. That shift is walking out the door as you are working on their many unsupervised mistakes. Bringing up the problem with management gets you little more than an ""Oh well, what can you do about it?"" Management members fail to communicate with each other so, more often than not, you are asked by different members of management what you are doing or why are you doing what you are doing. Co-workers are in the same boat so you generally get along with everyone. "
good,"Need to treat all the same and show no favors towards friends, management should not mingle with hourly do to showing favoritism. Need to do more training"
good,It was bad. Managers don't care about helping and only care on phone calls. Paychecks are under $600 every two weeks and hours are only 24 every week.
good,"It can be a decent place to work, IF, there were enough crew members. I do believe the work isn't worth the pay. I believe they should pay us at least $3 more an hour based on the amount of work that they ask us to do."
good,"nice place to work, customers were mostly great. Management was less than desirable. Fun working environment. Hours were okay. Was not able to move up to full time like i wanted"
good,"While I think Wal-Mart certainly is a respectable company, I personally did not enjoy my time there. My hours were too rigid and the culture of the workplace is rather toxic. However, my reason for leaving was the working conditions. The facility is nasty. Someone even pooped in our work area once. To me, things like that are unacceptable."
good,"buena empresa, el problema que tiene es que los sueldos son muy bajos."
good,not very organized but they do treat you pretty fairly. they give you the hours you want but once there set its hard to change them. you can meets lots of new friends and get lots of experience with people
good,Love my co-workers. Management sometimes does not listen to concerns. Customers are awful. Be prepared for tons of grossness. Worked here all through college and it's been my second job in the evenings and on some weekends for over 3 years now.
good,We were a high freight store so we always had big trucks to unload. Ill say working on the floor is way better than being in the back room. Would be a better job though if we had better management.
good,"Good first job, but no growth in the company. Management plays a big role in a company. I believe rules should be fallowed but in my personal experience management never followed them."
good,never enough workers. management was poor. harassment and bullying of employees by higher ups. they never could keep a supervisor for cap 2((went through 4 in 2 years)along with months of time where there was no supervisor)
good,"Use as a second job because they dont pay enough , But it is a fun place to work at but if your are looking for a longterm job that makes good moneyo this is not the job for you"
good,In my experience the work culture needs to change because there are too many managers that manage very little and boss employees around. The right people need to be in management in order for this to change.
good,Working at the Walmart deli was definitely an interesting place to work. The management sucks and the work is kinda bad but you meet a lot of different people and gives you a lot of fun stories.
good,was job titled as customer service manager and was actually doing the job duties of an inventory control associate and a stocking associate and was continually asked to complete all duties under those roles as well as run the front end cashiers from a location not conducive to meet all deadlines and responsibilities was continually being summoned from the stock/inventory locations which varied from grocery and general merchandise receiving located in the back of the store to respond to customer service related questions and such that i was constantly running from front to back of the store more than getting anything done
good,"Lots of work, little recognition. I worked in the freezer. I actually enjoyed the work itself but the store I was at was hectic. Very large workload. Worked hard and didn't get appreciated any more than the people who didn't work."
good,"When I first began to work at that Walmart it was great. The managers were very helpful and would resolve errors on their part and would work with scheduling. When I was trying to relocate it was a nightmare. At that time a lot of the good managers, in my opinion, had left and those remaining didn't care. I was supposed to have a job waiting for me on the other side of the country but due to mis-communications I was and am left unemployed."
good,"You never know when you are going to be scheduled, so you have to check your schedule daily to see if it has changed. There is never a set time for you to work, one day you might be scheduled until 11pm then have to be back at 8am the next day. Managers all have different procedures as how they think things should go so you never know what is correct or how to handle situations."
good,Awesome place to work. Only get paid every two weeks and the supervisors are always up in your face expecting more from others than most. Other than that the hours where good. And very nice people
good,"This is one of the stressful and frustrating jobs. I need less stress. Therefore it's time to move on."
good,The management is completely unorganized and scattered. For the most part they will have you doing others job duties when it’s not in your job description.
good,I Worked For Walmart For Nine Years If You Start Out Your Ok Once You Start Making Money Plus Benefits the Pressure You With A Work Load that There Is No way Of Completing in a 8hr period which Results In You Quiting Or Getting Fired For Productivity.Plus No Respect For The Older Employees.
good,direct people to different work zones workon cashier when it was break time .people very friendly.my manager was great.but very low pay.good learning exsperience
good,Belle équipe de travail. Par contre salaire peu satisfaisant et peu d'avancement de carrière.
good,"I worked at Walmart for about three months, and they were the worst months ever. Scheduling was very unorganized to the point people were sent home early. Which was due to too many people being scheduled for one time."
good,"started as auto tech, then went to low bay tech and then to order writer. it was a job that was meant for a single person. I was good at my job but i was not compensated properly."
good,"I had worked here prior and wanting to come back because it was a fun place to be. I had some issues after they wanted to hire me for customer service for less hours and no pay increase, but called it a promotion."
good,This was the only job I have actually liked I liked my boss an coworker we had a good thing in the pharmacy. It’s. Experience to have worked with the people I did.
good,It really depends on who you work with and what shift you work. Some days are good days and some are bad. A typical day at work is sometimes very stressful because some customers think you have the power to do anything they want and if you don't then they get mad.
good,The only real problem i had at walmart was hours. I couldn't get full time hours there. I may get good hours one week and the next week i wont have get good hours.
good,"pros- helping the customers"
good,"Busy fast paced environment, unfortunately staffing doesn’t meet the needs of the customer. Management doesn’t seem to care about their employees as long as sales are still booming."
good,Loved the job and coworkers. A lot of headstrong managers that killed the morales of associates. A lot of favoritism and lack of being leaders. Takes one horrible manager to bring down a team and  that’s this store 2500 Tiffin Ave Findlay Ohio. Very self centered ego driven store manger that does not even acknowledge his associates. He is only there for the pay check and to rid the store of long time hard working associates and bring it part time people to fill their spots.
good,Enjoyed my overall experience with this company. I have gained many skills throughout my years. I have developed organization and growth thru many years of customers service.
good,Poor management. Failure to communicate with others and advance further in your career they lack professionalism. Failure to take care of associates in making sure they are safe.
good,As long as you stay on task you would be fine. Management would always watch you and i would feel like it was uncomfortable place to work. I honestly wished they would have been more understanding of people’s life styles and help with making schedules.
good,"Not family orientated and is very stressful place to work, not a place to work around the workers injuries of illnesses. Workers are great and you get to meet many different people."
good,"Like the military, this is a great place to start to develop work ethic and team work.  The issue for experienced personnel is the lack of respect for having a long work history and work ethic because it does not necessarily suit the standards of Bentonville, Ar."
good,Good job/company just everyone not on same page. Company needs to be more understanding. Wish they would of kept the over night shift for frozen dairy
good,I actually enjoyed working in the electronics department.  Working with rude customers was the hardest part.  Most of the management was helpful.  Seeing all of the new technology coming out was fun.
good,Managment is poor. Customers are mean. Pay is nice for those just starting out. It's best to keep your head down. Get in get out get paid. Do not expect to make freinds
good,"Just like every job, there is a list of ups and downs to working at Walmart. Overall it was a pretty good job, but the lack of decent management was a big downside. Another big problem I have is the point system. After your six month probation period, you can get up to nine points before they will fire you. My problem with that is, I was eight months pregnant with my son and was rear-ended at a red light on my way to work. I was then taken to the hospital for monitoring, resulting in me missing my shift and I was still given a point. I talked to management about it and his response was, ""Well just don't get anymore."" and refused to take it off."
good,Walmart is fast paced and busy every minute of a shift. Job is secure and is considered for long term employment.  The downside is that you are asked to do 2-3 other peoples jobs. More downside:Managers  don't seem to care about you as a worker or that you work so hard.
good,Poor leadership skills  no one want to see your advance unless they favored you. No care on problems you come across with customers or associates. Not a bad place to work if you are under the right management with good leadership skills and who actually cares for their customers and associates
good,"A lot of changes, I know changes are necessary but its extreme and many of the changes fail."
good,Most of the Management don't know what they are doing. working at that the front end we don't get are breaks on time and we don't get the help we need.
good,I have worked for Walmart at different locations. I was disappointed to see that they are all the same. It would be a much better work place if they acknowledged the employees that work hard. If they focused more on their customers and employees instead of their own pockets. Its a Typical corporation.
good,Working for the Walmart company has help me to improve on my people and communication skills. It has helped me build my customer service skills. I recommend working here. It is great.
good,"Very stressful environment for its managers"
good,Needs to listen to what your associates have to say. Nothing should go unnoticed. Check on your associates. Should be able to take doctor excuses- people do get sick!
good,The worst thing about this store is they don't promote people based on their job performance it's who you know and who THEY want. I was told by management to apply for promotion's numerous times only to find out they had to have a certain amount of people apply before placing who they wanted.
good,"Walmart is trying new things in the bakery and giving everyone but cake decorator. In five years working here I have lost more then gained while those after me have gotten more and advance faster due to a grade level discrepancy."
good,"Buena empresa con muchas cosas positivas, hace falta mucha capacitación y cursos sobre liderazgo a las personas con cargos importantes ya que no se sabe cuidar al personal, la mayoría de los crecimientos se logran a travez de palancas y no por méritos propios, teniendo un tabular de sueldos la mayor parte de las veces te asignan el mas vago para no incrementar gastos y eso impacta mucho en el desempeño del personal; me encanta que proporcionen cursos de primeros auxilios, contra incendios, etc. Que haga apoyo a la comunidad, puedes reportar situaciones de acoso y de falta de ética aun que no me toco ver esos procesos aplicados."
good,"Point system. Don't accept notes from drs Change schedule on you randomly, Easiest job youll have for 11 dollars an hour, Great store manager always works with you, other management doesn't coordinate with each other"
good,I enjoyed working there for a while but it's too busy at times and not all employees are helpful to each other. Too much slacking with some employees and depend on others to pick up the slack.
good,"I worked at Walmart for a year and 2 months. I just graduated high school and attended college after work. I applied to work in electronics because that is an area I know I could excel in but instead they called and offered me a position in CAP 1 (grocery stocker) which is a 4AM - 1PM shift. I took the position because I needed the cash and because I was also told that they would get me where I want when it was available. I was the youngest to work during the shift and they treated me as if I had a low work ethic when I did just as much, if not more as the next person. Time went on and positions for where I wanted opened up but I was always denied without reason. The biggest kick in the face was when they hired my brother (who also applied for a different position) and gave him the spot I wanted. I was stuck working in a position I didn't want to be in an unhappy. My depression went up and satisfaction went down. I kept working hard even when I didn't want to because I hoped they would notice it. I told management countless times about how i felt and it always seems like it went in one ear and out the other. My fellow colleagues wanted me to work with them in certain positions because they knew I was good at it. They would even request that I move over and management still did nothing. Anywho, if you're desperate for money, work here. Also, they had me working two positions, which is okay however, the other position got paid $0.50 more and they refused to give me the raise because it was not my job title. They do not care about the little guy. As long as you are helping the"
good,"Pay was low, but the environment was great and management attentive.  The starting pay is now considerably more than I made back then. I would suggest it as they have great programs for advancement."
good,It is not a gob for everyone. depending on management it is not a bad place to work. the co-worker that I worked with are all helping kind people but the upper management in my particular store is not.
good,The overall atmosphere was okay depending on who you worked with. You already knew what you were doing so pretty much coming in and getting to work. Management wasn't the best. Left for better opportunity
good,In this position and in this company things get shoved on you for no reason other then they don't hire the correct amount of people. This made the job difficult along with a poor management system.
good,When I worked for walmart it was horrible. When I worked overtime I did not get paid. The managers where not understanding  about anything I only got paid maybe 200 to 300 every two weeks. If a job is needed badly enough it may be good but for a single mom with 4 kids it is not good enough.
good,"The company is going in a horrible direction that no longer cares for the associates , it is about the shareholders! I have learned alot with the company and I have been paid very well so I cannot say anything about the pay, Walmart has been good to me however greed is taking over."
good,Walmart can be both a frustrating place to work and an easy one. Management tends to be hands off in most cases. Worst part of the job is the customers. They tend to be rather insane. Holiday shifts are the worst. You will get bombarded with customers to the point where you'll not be able to keep up.
good,Working for Walmart Central Fill has been a very positive experience as well as a very negative experience. I enjoyed learning about how to run the parata machines which fills customer's medication. I was very excited to learn how the conveyor belt and the automation machines work to get the medication out in a timely matter. The negative thing I can say is that Central Fill don't keep the technician notified on the new meds or the new laws yhay have been put in place. I was on the inventory team and they don't have the necessary tools to get the job done in a timely matter.
good,"Most salary managers do not put any effort into connecting with their hourly associates and instead expect them to do anything and everything they ask of them no matter what the cost with no overtime of course. I learned that this work environment is deceptive, gossip ridden, cut throat, and toxic. Discrimination/Harassment/Racism are rampant and if you report these issues it will be you who is singled out and even with proof it is overlooked."
good,"It was a typical day at work where you work hard, supported one another, and got closer to your fellow associates. The hardest part was adjusting to new polices that were initiated because when the ones that don't work are introduced it slows down productivity and makes things harder for associates, but the experience of seeing new and various customers was a good one. It allowed me to display a variety of social interactions that I normally would have avoided."
good,"A typical day at the Walmart on N. Cockrell Hill as a cashier is dealing with all different types of people. "
good,"A typical day as a Walmart Manager involves preparing yourself with a plan for you day. Assign out all task, plan a meeting. Assign any training plans for individuals. Prepare the front end for the night, complete cash pulls and change out register tills. Complete all cash drops in the allotted time. Follow up on all associates every 45 minutes to ensure they are getting assigned tasks done. "
good,It was more like high school managers worried more about who said what or is doing what then training or worrying about their own job. Not being able to leave the regesiter for your lunch when your suppose to and going 10-15 minute later.
good,The manage was very poor when we got. Ew management team work was bad if one person slacked then that would usually mean everyone would be behind but the pay was good
good,a typical day at work at Walmart would be clocking in checking in with a csm to see what register they need me on. then I typically straighten up my area turn on my register light if it isn't already on. then if I don't have a customer in my line I tidy up the shelves then wait in the happy to help spot for a customer. I learned that not everyone is as nice as you because ive always been kind and cuurtious to my customers  but don't always receive the same in return and that was also the hardest part of the job. my experience with management was not always god because there was a lot of favoritism. the most enjoyable part of my job was all the people I got to meet and interact with.
good,"stressful place to work, theres no team work, the company expects you to bend over backwards for them but they cant do the same for you. i believe companies should look out for there employees because after all without your employees you cant run your business. Just help one another out. The more you feel appreciated, the more better you will work."
good,I have been with Wal mart for almost 5 years and even though the company is willing to work with me and my availability to work the pay is lacking.  I do get a discount on certain products which helps.
good,"sometimes its boring but sometimes its really busy and too much work for 1 person, and they promote the wrong people that don't need the raise like single young without children and the ones that need it don't get promoted, management is rude and just care about themselves, workplace is diverse and they will hire just about anyone off the street from anywhere around the world, the hardest part about the job is when you have to wait on a manager to get something done when you could get it done yourself if they would just give you the key or train you better and its bad when they move stuff around all the time and you can't find it when you go back, the most enjoyable thing is the friends you make at work, you become a family sort of if you stay long enough"
good,"Would show up at 4 a.m. was  the only one in my department for 3 hours, got bored and tiresome after some time. My co-workers were  friendly and the department manage was nice to and extent."
good,It was a relaxed job met lot's of new people. You just waited at the register till someone needed to check out. Need to be on time and fast when there was a rush. Also needed to be on alert for shoplifters.
good,A typical day at work is usually stressful but if you are doing as you were told to do then you usually won't have a problem. The pay is not great for the amount of work you are expected to do but at least most of us get 40 hours a week. There is opportunity for advancement. The hardest part is almost always being understaffed and still expected to push yourself and others to complete the work. It is entry level and it pays the bills. Good health coverage and other benefits when compared to other retail stores.
good,Poor management but some good people there. Management just needs to be re-trained. Treatment of new associates needs to be monitored and training should be longer.
good,"The CSMs and most management are incredibly nice. I feel like I could be making more, I'm only part time and I can barely afford a place to live as well as food. The new manager was incredibly unfair and ruled with a little too much control. Their attendance policy is incredibly strict and unfair."
good,"I liked working there, but the management definitely plays favorites. They were nice enough people, it was never malicious; e.g. advancement opportunities were only allowed to ""favorites"". Instead of advertising for applications a select few were given a code to apply with. Other than that I enjoyed working there."
good,"Overall the benefits are pretty good with Walmart. They start you out at $11 an hour, there are quarterly bonuses (with the potential to go up to $550), you are allowed to work what time you want to, and the callout system is very lenient."
good,"every walmart will be different to work at its all about the management. If the store is doing well the managers are more relaxed,but if they are under pressure from above ,its the associates that get the brunt of the pressure."
good,Management team lacks caring about their associates more than anything else. Kind of puts a negative energy into the workplace. A great starter job but definitely not worth the long term. Very hard to get days off if you aren't favored. Good money but not worth the stress of it.
good,A typical day would be starting processess( working FIFO frigate) Taking direction from management. There is so much work to be done so just trying to get your work done in 8 hours can be a streesful job.
good,"the hours are great,  the people I work with are friendly.  There are some issues with communication, but over all this company takes care of their employees"
good,It is an alright place to work ...its best for students..they rarely offer full time positions..it also very hard to get any vacation time..the management  was allright.
good,"Job providers, offer some benefits, best/ great technicians in the industry, but too much politics involved in the corporate/operations and still use very primitive tools that categorically reduces job satisfaction/ happiness index"
good,"Poor management makes working there difficult, the salary, and being able to move up in the company isn’t great, it’s pretty fast paced, but a horribly physical demanding job"
good,"Walmart overall is a good company to work for. Where I am currently the management is not ideal, which is why I am looking for something different. Normally short staffed which results in unreachable goals set due to doing multiple jobs in your description as well as not. It does work with your schedule for the most part and you are able to build and use PTO the more you work. The point system is very tight, sick days are not excused, even if you provide proof."
good,My personal experience is it’s been going down hill 8yrs ago when I started it was a pretty good place to work but over the years it’s been going down hill it’s no longer about helping the employee but about the dollar
good,"good place to start with when you want to start working for the first time , good esperience, not really perfect but you get to know new people and interact with them"
good,I loved my store and my management team. But the overall company after 3 years went from good benefits to hardly no benefits. Two company rules are hard to deal with one watching someone steal and can do nothing about it but yet comes out of my bounds. And if you are past five hours of your shift before you take lunch your fired. Yet you can be nine minutes late for your shift and no trouble. Hard time understanding these rules they say laws but just their rules.
good,"I like working there because of the fast pace and time went faster ."
good,"Foi uma ótima experiência de trabalho e aprendizado,apoia foram quase cinco anos na empresa,fiz e deixei muitas amizades"
good,"In the past few years, this company has gone though a few changes. The most obvious is the higher pay rate a few years back bumping new hires to 9 dollars then 10 the next year (roughly). If you had been there before hand you too were just bumped up to new hire rate. Then, last year, the base rate went to 11. The process was the same. Walmart also nixed a true holiday pay and instead moved to PTO (paid time off). You accrued hour of PTO by how long you were there and how much time you worked. PTO could then be applied to your vacation, sick, or holiday pay. When I worked there, I earned 1 hr of PTO for every 11 hours worked (I worked there 6 years, for 40hrs a week). This process worked for me and those that worked longer. But if you're new, good luck with getting paid time off."
good,Good place great prices for me and my position lot of hours just needed to change change through three different departments then left Walmart to better myself
good,Lots of fun to work always on your feet. Greetings costumers never a dull moment. Manager were fair. Lots of employees to communicate with friendly environment.
good,I loved the job I did at Walmart I think it had to many managers an one department all with different agendas not enough  communication or cooperation with each other.
good,"Work environment was nice, stressful but enjoyable. They teach you many different departments. Walmart could focus on customer service more aswell as communication with overall focus"
good,"I was an employee of Walmart for nearly 4 years. Each store varies in terms of management, but the last store I worked at was a complete joke. Poor sales, poor management effectiveness, inconsistent policies and corrupt store manager. One year I went from Overnight Stocker to Inventory Management, and after 3--6 months, was bumped back down to stocker. Two people in Inventory were fired, and I was forced to carry the brunt of the workload. In short, not much preparation for some stores."
good,I just needed better opportunities.Over  all the work  environment was very stressful. Working second shift you was the main source of the store and got paid less.
good,Just come here to work love what you do but also stay under the radar. No one helps you unless you are friends and just love what you do because you can’t just come to work and think of it as a pay check
good,Working for Wal-Mart is differnt from place to place. I have worked at 5 differnt stores and helped out at 4 more. The best part if you want a career in retail they are large enough to let someone be successful.
good,"walmart can be a nice place to work, but the management seems as if they are not capable of managing sometimes, the pay can be better , however the co-workers was not bad to work with,"
good,"Walmart is a good place to get introduced to the work force. The pay is nice, however, they tend to barely work you. Mandatory breaks rarely happen. However, you are getting some retail experience."
good,"Shift starts at 10 p.m. Management started off the night with a 15 minutes meeting, providing everyone with their designated department. I have learned to locate and stock merchandise to it's home, in above standards speed. The culture of this workplace can be bias, due to the different levels"
good,It has been a while since i worked here and some things have changed but overall overnight cashier and cake decorating was kinda fun. They were really nice in the office.
good,i actually didn’t mind working for walmart itself the customers were fine and it’s easy hours and day usually goes by quick however the one that i worked for was subpar at the time because all the management was lackluster and unhelpful which made working there harder than it should’ve been.
good,working at walmart is  good experience for high school students to learn about work ethic. for full time workers not a good place unless management which is hard to get to. sub par benefits. toxic work atmosphere.
good,"I had good and bad experiences with Walmart. First manager was great, the next one had zero clue who any of his people were and was never thankful for the work they did. The expectations are a little too high for such a large company. One individual is expected to complete ten hours of work in less than three. The major problem is the type of people hired are young lazy individuals that don't want to work as a team.  I saw a ton of favortism in all stores as well as racism from all types of backgrounds. Everything just comes down to management and how much you are willing to take sitting down. I knew people that worked at Walmart for 12 years and were only making $10.20 (that was only after their new and improved pay rates) and others that worked there less than two and were making $14. Their pay is again in the favoritism field and completely unfair for people who work hard. I was liked my managers and had good pay but they way they treated others was sickening and the reason I would not recommend working for this company."
good,"I worked for Walmart for 10 years, most of it going Asset protection. Promotions are based on who the management team likes. I was salary asset protection manager for 6 years and know they would already have a person chosen to get the position before the interviews. Walmart comes up with ridiculous processes. For example the have a grid that has tanks you have to check of on weekly. The directions for each task is 3 pages long. It is only checked when  they want to coach somebody. They have different thinks the focus on, never the same thing. Right when you prefect one thing they hit you on another. Very stressful 10 years of my life. I do not intend on going back, although I did leave on good terms."
good,"Loved the work and job but due to family illnesses was needed at home, now that they're gone I need to find something to do with my time. Prefer to be caregiver"
good,"They don’t care about you as a person. No one wants to take blame for their mess ups and they are very punishing; if they believe you don’t kiss their rear ends,"
good,"Doing my job is rather stressful. You are out there in the direct sun, beating down on you at 106-112 degrees during the summer here, having to push carts by hand or with the mule, bringing them to the bay area while clearing up any carts in front of the entrance. Managers step out to see your work and if they spot corrals with carts in them, they badger you about it. Sometimes they think you are lazy and yell at you about your job. The major issue I have with this job is help. Not many people want to do this job, so they hide or don't show up, leaving the rest of us to pick up their mess. There will be days where I will be the only one to clean up the lot for hours. My store is a superstore, so the lot is huge. My advice to you if you want this job, prepare yourself with things that will keep you cool during the day and during cold weather. Also be prepared to be short handed with help. Sometimes managers don't have anyone to help you so they wish you the best to clean up the lot. FML"
good,"I was a stocker, my day started usually at 5am if I was mornings or 4pm if I was evenings. Mornings I had to usually zone the general merchandise around 6 aisles by myself in 3 hours. When I would complete an aisle to how I was trained I get told I didn't it wrong even though I did it how I was trained."
good,"Empresa que oportuniza o crescimento profissional"
good,Wal-Mart is a good starting place for someone that needs a job after high school while attending college. They worked around my schedule a lot. The lack of opportunity for advancement at my location was an issue.
good,Walmart as a company is making improvements but still need to remove managers that are set in their ways. Times will always change and managers need to understand that and embrace it.
good,"Although I did love my position because I got to move around, the management was just not fair at all!! No matter how much you think you earned your promotion, is your not sucking up to the boss, you just wont get it."
good,"I believe I'm underpaid and the management at the store can be improved, by offering more benefits and higher wages to the employees that the store claims keeps them afloat it could and should lead to more productivity, a better working environment and pay equal to what has been tasked to us."
good,"It depends on what store and market you are in. This is not a good market to work. "
good,"Very fast paced working environment, lots of on the job training as well as computer training, fixed schedules, lunches and breaks (lunch if working 6 hours)."
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work at first but soon the managers wanted you to do jobs your not quaffed to do and write you up for it, they will threaten you over breaks or other reasons just so you will do whatever they wanted."
good,I was greatful I started when when jobs were scarce in 2009. But at the time Walmart only paid 7.25 the minumum. It was hard to support a family with that kind of salary.
good,it was the constant remarks about your work that was not cool. but nevertheless cool people to work with.....hardest part was handling the goods..most where breakable
good,Management at my Walmart was shady. They did not want you to promote and they would terminate workers if they would go against them. They would also coach you for such childish reasons. The store manager would also choose their favorite person to take over a position than to choose someone who was already training for it.
good,Got put out on the floor with no training. No benifits that were worth my time unless you going to college. No control of worker's and others getting blamed for it.
good,It was a place where you went to work and went home. It was a seasonal job. I was told there was room for a permanent position but that was not true. They let all the seasonal workers go.
good,"Each department varies, as does their pace and expectations. You can change departments if you want, you'll just have to contact your manager. You'll be joining a team and a family when working here. You end up looking out for each other and when one of us is down, we step up to do what we can to try to make it a pleasant experience for the customers. It can be challenging at times, just remember to give it your all and smile as well."
good,"Walmart is over all a great place to work at, due to the timing and change of house location I wasn't able to continue working there. for a first job Walmart is great but it is definitely not a job to stick and stay with due to poor management and the amount of disrespect you receive from other workers and customers."
good,Wal-Mart in other areas may be a great career in which employees can climb the corporate ladder but the store i was associated with promoted from outside. All management positions were filled from day one and remained that way until my resignation.
good,"felt pressured to do thing and was very scared to call off on emergency's cause of the new system they use to keep records, which is on a tally point record"
good,Empresa com cultura de vendas e grande potência... porém sem muito incentivo ao trabalhador.
good,"Decent job. Management gave loose directions on how to do things. Some managers help out when it gets busy but majority leave you to the wolves. Overall great atmosphere, good co-workers. Needs better pay and better oppurtunities for college students. Better scheduling. Worked as a part-time employee but working well over 40 hours a week with no full time benefits."
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work but when it came to all their rules about attendance and management, it was too much for me. They have a very strict attendance policy that if you need a flexible schedule your not going to get that there. They have a point system and in a 6 month period your only allowed 4pts. Exp: 1pt for missing your shift and a 1/2pt for being late. Well, I recently got in a care accident and ended up not being able to come to work and I got up to 5 1/2pts and they did nothing to help me. They said fill this form out for leave of absence and good luck. Well it got rejected and I got fired. The main thing they stressed at orientation when I first got hired was that they would help their employees if anything like this happened, and they didn't."
good,"When I started people were not so friendly"
good,Walmart is okay but the management is bad and they are very disrespectful they do int respect your privacy that well and if you go to the bathroom they get kind of mad because they need the freight to be worked
good,Working there is fun as long as you follow the procedures laid down by the company. what I have learned is a lot. The management is good and gives assistance when needed.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work but has its problems mainly with training. there is no time to train. but the people you work with is the best and try to help and make friends. the managers are stuck in the fact that they have alot to do and no time to do it.
good,OK company to work for paid time off vacations but the ts pretty faced paced and always busy but overall its OK mangers are OK  its a lot of employees that work there so u definitely have yo be a people person
good,By far the most stressful job ever. customers have chased me with a belt other customers were rasict and said that they would shoot myself and my manager.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my associates training an motivating them on the job,learning an advancing in the warehouse operation an store operations customer service interacting with the general public assisting them in there daily shopping needs."
good,"Walmart is great for a career, however, they do not appreciate long term associates.  They seem to try to force them out to be able to train newer people and pay them less."
good,"Unload trucks stack boxes by departments ,take some out on the sale floor ,stock shelves ,rotate stock and replenish the shelve work on displays .Help with inventory"
good,Pues solo es trabó de un rato por qué hay muchas trabas y poco apoyo en todo y no hay metas grandes ahí
good,Iwhen I started it was awesome but as years passed management got awful . I was in management for 15 months they were always changing the way they wanted things to get done
good,"Actually was good experience to work at Walmart but the schedule was not flexible at all ."
good,I started at Walmart. It was my first job and I’ve been there two years. There have been a lot of changes since then. Some of the changes are beneficial and others aren’t so much. But there is nothing you can do about it except do your job. I wouldn’t say it’s a bad place but I just don’t see myself staying there long.
good,"It's hard to describe a typical day for Walmart as all positions are different from hourly to salary. I've been lucky enough to hold both types of positions. With the ever changing environment that Walmart holds, you have to be adaptable and go with the change. One of the hardest things to do is accepting the constant change and the stress that comes along with it. I've enjoyed my time with Walmart; however, I've reached a point in my career in which I've become stagnate and there are not enough opportunities for me to continue my career in the field in which I am passionate and knowledgeable about. Thus, I am now having to resort to looking outside of the company for continue career growth and opportunities."
good,Great place to work in order to get your foot in the door via the working force. They hire at 16yrs old and are more than happy to help you work around school and/or college.
good,Management was kind of all over the place with the exception of certain managers. There were always a lot of opening due to the fact that we could not keep people.
good,"Until you are seriously injured...the job is ok. Some of my managers were great to work with, however, others were horrible. Most, 90%, got along with me fine, the other 10% always though I was wrong, and that they were GODS. Eventually they hated me more because I forced them to follow company policy by using open door and home office HR. I got my area OPS manager in hot water over a weight lifting max issue. I was right, they were wrong. I took it above and beyond to home office and eventually they were informed that I was correct and they needed to follow policy."
good,Overall my time spent there was worth it. It taught me a lot I learned how to control myself and to work in a big environment. I'm grateful I was able to work in a company that helped me learn and mature. It was a great experience being there.
good,"Go in and think your going to cover one area and end up working every single area and location in the store. You get so busy and can't take breaks so they get mad about you not taking them, then when you do take breaks they get mad if you do. You don't answer to one manager but 3, so when you want to take lunch you have to ask every single one of them if you can."
good,"the management is rough, im sure they try their best but value of the individual is not a priority there. they live for quarterly results and expect you to bend over backwards for them at the drop of the hat. the company itself is not awful, they provide part time benefits, one which is half of off a goodlife member ship and 75% coverage for medical and dental. they only hire part time an expect your availability to be open. getting time off is difficult due to ""black out"" periods when no vacation requests are approved. not a good place to work for students as they require you to be available friday evening to sunday evening plus one day in the week."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work when I started 12 years ago. Over time managers came and went which gave no consistency to teamwork, and respect between employees and management.  By the time I left I felt they had been trying to force me out for 3 years. They found a loophole which gave them leverage in asking me to leave after 11 years and 8 months. The hardest part was being told to get on my aisle, stock shelves, don’t talk to anyone and don’t go anywhere except the bathroom. By that point no one was being recognized for hard work completed for months. No sense of unity."
good,Always a mess left by the last shift that you have to clean before you start. Old equipment made it hard to effectively do your job. Some of the managers were more organized then others which made it difficult for use to provide answers to the customers. The random schedule made it very difficult to balance work and home life. Some days you would be days then you would be nights. Working the customers and some of my fellow employees was the best part of the job.
good,"Overall the company  is good.  It s going through a  major marketing over haul. They are promoting,online shopping to make  it easier for busy consumer, on how to save  and shop stress free."
good,Foi praticamente meu primeiro emprego mais longo. Aprendi muito e passei a valorizar muitas coisas que antes não dava atenção.
good,Working as a cart associate was stressful and understaffed. Management did not schedule more than one associate at a time on most shifts. Working at Walmart was a learning experience.
good,"The job was a good summer job, but is not enough for an adult with bills. The cashier position was very fast paced and sometimes stressful as customers were not always happy."
good,Extremely stressful with more emphasis on cutting hours and saving money than actually letting you do your job. They are more focused on the bottom line than anything else but fail to realize that it would go up if they were properly staffed.
good,"Not much to say. Produce was my hired department. I did cover Deli quite often for other co-worker breaks, but wasn't paid their salary for doing so. The hardest part of my job was the turn over rate for the produce department. The most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to interact with customers."
good,"Like any other grocery store, you help and solve customer issues that they bring towards you. Workspace is iffy when working with certain coworkers; hardest or most annoying part of the job is the scheduling and shifts you are given last minute or have been scheduled that you aren't aware of until they call you and write you up for not knowing you worked, explaining that it's your responsibility to check it daily which is difficult due to transportation or your daily schedule."
good,The managers were rude. They have codes that cashiers must type in if they need a lunch or break or to use the bathroom but they would go unanswered for 20-30 minutes. I didn’t like that.
good,They give A raise thrn drop hours and change the schedule do much u can't plan anything constant write ups and no organization at all in any department
good,"Love it it's just I gave years to Walmart and I feels though I shouldve been paid more at least 25 cent more but overall I liked working at Walmart, I'm willing to work at any warehouse"
good,alot of nice employees fun environnement but hard work bad equipement very nice managers i learned alot how to work with others nice long lunches good work
good,"As a former Assistant Store Manager, I know that Walmart---as a company--has great policies for employees and customers, a great focus on progress, and goes through great lengths to test and implement improvements. That's all awesome;  but it means almost nothing when in-store management is plagued by incompetency and flat-out idiocy. I started off in a great store with a good store manager. He followed policies and was fair. He set the tone for the other managers, who were pretty good to customers and employees. He helped me move up into management by giving me opportunities to learn new skills. Unfortunately, most management is garbage. Most have their own interpretations of policies, botch things up, blame the subordinate  employees, and wonder why they have call-outs and high turnover. Regional management and higher needs to do some sort of ""undercover boss"" type of thing nationwide, keeping hourly employees anonymous. Heads would roll from salaried store management teams."
good,its  a good part time job dont make it a full time job. To advance you need the same skills as a salesperson Its not how productive you are its more about developing a relashionship with salary managment.
good,"While I do enjoy my job there just is no room for advancement,I like learning new things and improving my job.  I sign up for every type of training that is possible but it does not get me any farther in my job."
good,One of the hardest thing to deal with is that management is not on the same page. One says something someone else says something totally different. And in the end the employees gets in trouble for the miss communication.
good,Im looking for growth and Development I felt I put my hard work and effort in and being humble and going above and beyond and it was no advancement for the length of time being with walmart right now
good,The hardest part of the job was management continuously changing where things needed to be because they were unorganized. Like super unorganized. Things moved and customers took it out on us.
good,"I loved working for Walmart at first and told my zone manager I wanted to be a CSM, but nobody would train me and no matter how hi I went nothing happened. I heard Walmart was about the opportunity but I didn't experience that at all. Pushing credit cards and programs customers don't want to be heckled about isn't right either. So many customers told me they were glad that I didn't ask them about credit cards, because they don't want them or have other ones that do way more for them. Plus it's rude to heckle people about the same stuff day in and day out. I think Corporate needs to visit on the store level as well because some of the new programs that came out weren't helpful and more ridiculous and made our jobs harder, and the customers more aggravated. Hourly associates don't think corporate understands them and honestly, it felt like all they cared about was profit, with no regard for the associates. I think saving money makes it possible to live better like Sam Walton wanted and I love shopping at Walmart because its cheaper for the most part but working there wasn't that great."
good,"I enjoyed the fact I was able to learn something from almost every department. The only reason this was possible however is because we were understaffed and the didn't want to hire anyone. In turn, I was always getting pulled to do someone else's job and couldn't finish my own, but they would get upset if you worked overtime.  Management was terrible with an extremely rude and poor attitude.  Upon leaving, they also lied about things to prospective employers and refused to give a copy of my leave report."
good,"my immediate supervisor, a married woman was sleeping w/ the mgr of the pet dept. while I was the ...the work culture was terrible and the bosses got away with everything while employees were fired for taking a sandwich"
good,The culture at Walmart is fractured by silos. With the different business units within the company operating as their own fiefdom. With all the teams rowing in their own direction it makes it difficult to make meaningful accomplishments.
good,Good job but take seriously. This company and job is no joke. It will eat you alive if you don't handle pressure correctly. Stay on your toes and don't trust anybody.
good,"The associates were easy and fun to work with, made the job more enjoyable ... store manager was easy to deal with, whn problems arose. Always go in with an open mind."
good,"I worked in two stores, the first one was excellent honestly. The first store was very good environment to work in, friendly staff, and overall good experience (80M+ volume). Second store was absolutely horrible (120M+ volume). The second stores staff was not very friendly, no one wanted to help each other, non stop drama, no one took responsibility for anything and just blamed each other for all of the various issues. Constant call outs, extremely high stress store due to it's volume - store consistently makes 500k+ a day even in off season. If you can get into a lower end high volume store, it's going to be fast paced and enjoyable overall. I would avoid extremely high volume stores at all costs, it is not worth the stress, and just all of the toxicity that kind of environment entails. Otherwise the pay is good compared to other entry level retail jobs, if you work hard and are friendly you can advance pretty easily to be quite honest."
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. Although the management isn't friendly and the coworkers tell on you. They have good benefits and you get extra discounts
good,"This place was a good place to work in the beginning, Wal-mart had a lot of full-time hourly positions with benefits. That diminished along with vacation hours, sick time, and personal time. It's mostly PTO now. Hours for work can be up and down. Management is unpredictable. Best thing to do is to work consistently, not miss days and finish the task you have been giving. Money was pretty good, I worked full-time for years, and I thank God I've had the job and also thankful to move forward"
good,"Fresh areas are stressful, and constant changes are being made. Be prepared to open up your availability or your hours will be greatly cut. Management all depends on your location. This company is always trying to cut costs, so more often than not your location will be understaffed."
good,"Project Managers have little to no say in regards to acquiring appropriate resources, expectations for delivery of projects were very high with little to sometimes no resources to complete tasks."
good,"This can be a hard place to work as a cashier. Not enough coverage on busy days. A ""full time"" employee generally gets 28 hours a week. sometimes less."
good,"In my job I clean my area, check vendors in using a handheld, check gm merchandise in and then deliver it, unload the grocery trucks, shoot pallets up and down using a walker stacker, research and sort paperwork. The management team is always on a different page which is hard because you tell a vendor no you can't do this and that then they wine to management and they say yes so we look like the bad guys. It's hard when you're not backed by your management team. It's all political. How much can you stroke a manager's ego to get into a higher position. It DOES NOT MATTER how hard you work. Only if you stroke a manager's ego. I can not stress that enough. It use to be a great place to work but those days are gone. They keep eliminating positions. They don't give you a heads up either it's like they just call you in and say screw you. The raise each year is between .20-.30 cents no matter what kind of worker you are. You could be amazing or super sucky and its the same. You still get an evaluation which means nothing since we are all on the same level with same raise. It use to matter if you worked hard you were rewarded, but not anymore. My position is not too bad but apparently it's eventually going away. I can not think of any other position worth doing than DSD. I been with this company for 11 years. People starting here are making close to what I do. Even management seems like they deal with a lot of sucky stuff."
good,"Very stressful."
good,"Grateful for the knowledge, experience, friendships and opportunities to promote within departments and the company. Work, Life balance was a struggle."
good,interacted with customers daily. fast paced due to trying to ring up customers in friendly but time sufficient manner. Customers were also stressed and stressful at times. Customer service managers had cashiers backs and were supportive in customers that were less than patient with the cashier.
good,Enjoyed the fast pace but workloads are hard and to see elderly workers in this environment is difficult. They recognize hard work with appreciation from others and people who know you genuinely care.
good,"It is very frustrating environment to work when the equipment does not work correctly due to the servers are to small for the size of the store. It should be a team store, but it is not that at all."
good,The management doesn’t try to work with their employees. They don’t pay workers comp. they barely give pto. I got 6hrs for two months. They don’t work with your personal life. They don’t promote fairly. They don’t pay for sick days. No benefits unless you’re full time but you can’t hire in as full time.
good,Its an ok job if you dont have on.  Its not a place that many can or should consider building a career in. I have worked at a store in SC and one in FL.  The SC store was better to work for by leaps and bounds.
good,"Walmart is actually a really good beneficial company to work for, Everyone has a smiling face and greets you whenever your checking out and they are always being a helping hand."
good,"Walmart needs to cut back on management, they have too many levels of management.  Management contradicts each other.   I loved working with associates."
good,"Typical day, you go to work, do your markdowns, get the case ready for business. Do special orders, fill the case with fresh & thaw and do backups or whatever is needed to be filled. Workplace is fine. The hardest part of the job is wanting to go elsewhere in the company but being told that ""you are where we NEED you"" regardless of where you WANT to go. The most enjoyable is knowing you just saved someones butt because they forgot or didn't order a cake and they actually appreciate you. Upper management is constantly making new rules company wide that make no sense & tell everyone to follow them. And when those new policies don't work, they make it not work for at least 3 months before they come up with something else that doesn't work. They don't listen to the people that do the job everyday, they don't listen to your ideas for change for the better."
good,"I would unload merchandise from the semi , stack onto pallets and then I would stock the merchandise on the floor. Help customers with any question they had while I was stocking and with the leftover merchandise I would then bin the products in the stocking area."
good,"Walmart is an OK place to work but that is about as much as I can say for the good of it. They offer benefits would should be standard in all workplaces so I cannot really compliment them on that. They say they offer a flexible schedule but that really isn't the case considering if you have anything less that what they want of you, then you are not ""guaranteed hours"". The customers are rarely ever a problem. The problem with this job is the management team with their constant lack of doing nothing but sitting in the office and complaining how things are up to their standards. The management team is the problem. They are inconsiderate and do not offer help when you ask, but are always willing to move you from your area of work to help someone else in their agenda. The so called promoting from within is a joke. The managers show an extreme amount of favoritism and will 9/10 hire from outside the store instead of giving the employee the chance to move or succeed. Walmart will pay the bills but it isn't definitely not a place you want to be."
good,"Its walmart, there is one in every town so if you need a job they will hire you. don't expect to be praised for a job well done don't look for overtime, they ask you to stay late one day but will cut your hours on another shift. management o d often clueless and you will get written p if you don't take your lunch on time or even fired often times you cant control when you take your lunch if you are a cashier"
good,At first it was great but then it became stressful. Lack of security and the constant cutting of hours. It was ok at first but long term it's not for me.
good,"This job is for college students who don't really have bills. When I worked there it was only enough to pay my car insurance, rent, and food for the week."
good,You never work in your department that you're supposed to be in there's no straight shift to work you're there working every weekend and they cut your hours for no reason the nice thing about the job is the customers
good,a typical work day would be covering not only my department but up to three other departments as well. Set the displays for either my department or the next department up to company standards.
good,"I worked there 12 years, learning & continue to learn different job duties.  Always giving 100% & more each day. Helping my co workers when needed or asked"
good,It was a okay experience managers were okay the employees were good and hard working the customers were awesome and the general staff was a great group to work around positive environment
good,"Start out with all department managers to see what they are doing for the day, look at backroom to make sure they are putting the freight on the floor.  Morning meeting with all management, then meeting with associates, then we finally get to start working on our projects for the day.  The day did go by fast, always working on something or helping customers throughout the store.  End of the day, one more meeting to see what we accomplished, our department managers accomplished and plan for tomorrow."
good,Walmart is your basic retail franchise fast-paced work that gets very competitive around the holidays and also like most retail the job is very stressful.
good,Absolutely no overtime.....no weekends or holidays off.....holiday pay was eliminated years ago....wages are ok if u have a partner helping you otherwise the pay will provide for a very low standard of living......at any given day your job can change or be eliminated.....annual salary is less than 25ooo.00 for most.
good,"*Crowded work areas"
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart was stressful I learned how to work with others management was ok the hardest part of my job was dealing with people with bad attitudes the most enjoyable part was working with others
good,"i loved working at Walmart, but they had a lack in their management systems Also, they have a lack in work advancement.If it wasn't for that reason to would be a great job."
good,"If you don't enjoy working alone or as a team. Walmart is not for you"
good,Management hires who that want and never base it off of what the person knows or their experience. It all about who you know and not what you know. Your hard work rarely pays off.
good,"Working with Walmart taught me how to work as quickly and accurately as possible in order to provide a clean, fast and friendly experience for all customers. I was trained in many different areas of the store which enable me to become the jack of all trades. It can definitely be a stressful environment, but its important to remember the customer is always right."
good,"Would not recommend, unless you are in dire need of a job. Co-workers were nice and helpful, same with my supervisors and managers. Everything was chaotic and there was no set routine."
good,"Wal-Mart has the potential to be great, but they unfortunately fall short of their promises."
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at the Wal-Mart, especially as a Cap 2 Team associate. Not only is there unnecessary stress from management giving you almost impossible tasks to complete daily, but the environment there is completely miserable.  There are days where you honestly would rather stay home and watch a movie than to go there and make money..and WHO DOESN'T LIKE MONEY?! that's just how miserable it is."
good,"MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE "
good,"It is not a terrible place to work if you are very flexible and don't mind limited hours.  Training consists is all done on computers.  Once you hit the floor, your training may be limited depending on the people you work with. Schedules are made 3 weeks out. When it gets close to profit sharing time, expect your hours to drop.  You do get a 10% discount on most stuff.  There are no sick/vacation days, just points. You can collect PTO hours. It's a job run by a corporation, their job is to make money for stockholders, the Walton family and themselves, and employees are replaceable."
good,"For the most part, Wal-mart is a good place to work. It is a good beginner's job on the way to bigger and better things. There are some lifer's there."
good,"Walmart has the potential to be the best job in the industry; however, nepotism has construed the basics of sam walton's beliefs. Great first job to have .Stay positive, keep a great attitude and lead with integrity."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for the first couple moneyhs then things went downhill. It was stressful. Some days were fun. I got along with my coworkers but my managers were never really there when I had to report things.
good,Walmart is a chaotic company that will harass their employees at the drop of a hat. The pay and fellow employees are the only things that kept me on.  My immediate managers that oversaw the department I worked in were awesome but I realized that having higher ups like that we're very rare in that store.
good,gostei muito de trabalhar no wallmart foi minha primeira experiência no mercado de trabalho
good,I would come to work and clock in and start stocking the items that needed to be stocked. And at 2am I would have a hour lunch break. My most enjoyable part about my job was my coworkers we got a long really good.
good,I liked working there as a cashier had lots of fun meeting people and lots of crappie people but all in all it was great fun but the position was only temporary
good,some areas of the work departments in walmart are a bit over worked then others. i worked in the cooler an its freezing cold an we had to stay in the for hours to gt work done didnt have time to take breaks from the cold but the employees at walmart are really nice the management is the opposite  .
good,"Um lugar desagradável, cheio de intriguinhas e onde as pessoas não valorizam o seu trabalho."
good,I started out collecting carts and transferred to Tire Lube Express. I enjoying my job in Tire Lube Express but was not allowed to work over 32 hours a week.
good,Getting the job done is all that matters and the managers can work with your schedule if you have things going on which is important or if they cannot just expect to call off
good,"Walmart, sell your soul for a roof over your head."
good,"good for teens or driven individuals looking to become management, but also kinda soul crushing and makes you lose hope for humanity. need alot of willpower to get up every day and come in."
good,An employee must be willing to work in a hot warehouse in the summer and cold in the winter. This job is fast paced. Must be flexible to work in different areas of a warehouse.
good,"Ive worked here for 5 years and the first week I started working I wanted to get another job but since i didnt have a graduates degree I decided to stay and see which area i can transfer to instead of clothing. Couple months went by and I fransfered to the pharmacy which i love so much and kept me there for about 4 years. It gets crazy at times if thats the kind of lifestyle you like. I dislike how the pay is, starred off minimum wage and they changed minimum wage to a couple dollars extra and ive been here for years to work up to the pay i have now and the new hires are making almost as much as me. They are cutting hrs at the moment So not really a good time to apply js"
good,"Buena oportunidad, pero podria ser mejor en cuestion de su cordinacion y seria casi el empleo perfecto."
good,"It can be good some day but bad on others. Managment at my store can be spotty, if your not on them they will fogrt that they are there to help you and the customers."
good,Overall a great company to move up in. However lack the family oriented feeling when it comes to associates personal life. Life happens & should take better care of their associates.
good,The most unenjoyable managers while I worked who never seemed to answer your help requests for them to respond to.  Very inconsiderate to employees during their work hours.  Once you are off work they all smile atcha!!
good,"It's not bad work, but the management isn't too good, unrealistic expectations at times and communication amongst workers-management isn't exactly the best."
good,fun to work at but hard to get a good team mate.  also to move on to better things. the hardest part of the job is being ask to do different job at the same time .
good,"the managers did not work with my family life, the reason i had to leave is my dad was sick i asked for certain days for and could not get them. but I did get enough hours."
good,Needs better management as there are managers that don’t allow PTO in their own standards even as the employee works the hours needed yet still can’t get approval for time off. Overall management needs more to keep the employee satisfied to want to branch higher and keep them more available to work as they never called me to work even when no one was there to fill in my position.
good,"After 12 years with the company, feel they need to focus on mid management, training on leadership, engagement and ensuring compensation plan is fair for those who have multiple units and markets to manage."
good,"Never enough employees to complete daily tasks required, full-time is only offered if they can save money from hiring another person, if you want specific days off, they will tell you to open your availability; and as a consequence, cut your hours. With not as many employees as the workload requires, management is stressed as well and no one stays a manager for long. Not worth the pay."
good,falta de desarrollo para la mejora del ambiente laboral
good,"Easy 8 hours shifts, as long as you make sure you do your job. I cleaned everything from under the shelves nightly, swept and mopped the walkways. I got to drive the zamboni everynight (helps get big areas that need mopping) good workplace and environment. Had to leave because I need something better."
good,"If you need basic work its a great place to  start.  If your lookin to make a  career with this company  I can tell you,you will not have a life, the expectation is super high ,and your stress level will be through the roof."
good,"Steady hard work but starting pay is good with higher wages as time passes.  Hard honest work that gets rewarded,  if you are willing to put in the effort."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work at for a definitive time period. Hard to work your way up the ladder but scheduling is flexible. Pay is low but fair for the labor.
good,"Good Summer Job, would go back if i had too. Stocker and truck loaders should get paid more thyen what they are being paid due to the most labor. Other than that, good job '"
good,Experience was good at this point in my life. Would not recommend a career and trying to support a family solely with this company as salaries and advancement is limited.
good,I worked with many different people and interacted with many different people working for this company. I learned how to keep organized in my work station and how to maintain a friendly work environment. Customer service was my main goal.
good,I enjoyed working there in the beginning. things changed. new managers were brought in instead of hiring from within. I was fired after injuring my back for not completing tasks from another manager. Injury occurred while assisting a different manager that was present in the store at the time.
good,"If you never worked at Walmart before, its difficult to come into a dept manager position. The training is very poor and the managers are too busy to help. For such a fast paced work environment, I certainly expected more."
good,"Learn as much as you can from experienced associates. Don't get attached to any department, store, or manager. Keep learning, keep moving, and always keep looking for another job. Walmart won't hesitate to cut your hours, especially, if you work overnight."
good,"A lot of the time we are short staffed so one person is expected to complete other coworkers jobs, if one person in a department calls off and he or she is the only person scheduled in that area we are expected to cover and maintain that area for our shift along side our own job responsibilities."
good,"Near impossible production goals. Matrix system that monitored just about everything, production, quality, following to the letter directions. Pay was very competetive."
good,It is a huge store so there will be all types of people coming in and out so you'll meet plenty of good people. A typical day would be unloading trucks and stocking all the items where they go.
good,Currently they are cutting positions to save money. They also are constantly cutting hours and if you work over any hours are asked to cut it. If you do not cut it you will be coached for not doing so. I do not appreciate how Walmart treats their employees. They continue to make stupid changes that lose them customers.
good,"I would stock shelve's for the first half of the day then unload trucks."
good,"Pretty laid back, no customers to worry about as the store wasn't even open at the time. Management was pretty easygoing as long as we got our quotas for the night."
good,gave over to much to do for how much frate we got gor yelled at cursed at a lot of drama from coeworkers and supervisors plus to much change was always in pain and never gor recation for doing a good job got lied about getting full time for 2 years
good,Must be able to keep up with a fast work environment and be able to manager many changes. Management is often willing to accept different availabilities and vacation requests
good,the most stressful thing was there was no way to personally speak to or call  a CSM to your register. they had you push a button n your register if you needed some change or had a question or had a problem. not to mention if you happened to have an emergency!
good,Les pauses ne sont jamais à l'heure. Il y a toujours des problèmes avec les horaires. Nos nombres d'heures par semaine donner ne sont jamais pareil.
good,"The experience was beneficial in a good and bad way. The management could have done been better with their delivery on certain objectives, but overall it was bittersweet."
good,"Liked working with serving food. Was showed more about deep fryers. Times and temperatures. Worked next to the bakery, so I could cross train in another department."
good,"You do one thing wrong, and you get yelled at by every manager in the store. You have very little hands on training, and your coworkers (depending on how long they've been there) won't always help you. Your customers can range from extremely appreciative to extremely rude and not understanding. I was the highest paid person in my department, and had no experience, while people who had worked there 10 years made less than I did."
good,"I learned how to be a Pharmacy Technician from my Pharmacy Manager. A typical work day includes processing prescriptions, answering the phone, filling prescriptions, processing insurance claims and assisting customers with products. The Pharmacy Manager is very knowledgeable and helpful while teaching you new skills of the job. The hardest part of the job is the schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new skills every day. I've learned how to be a Pharmacy Technician and all of the ins and outs of working in a pharmacy setting."
good,Pay was not good. The job wasnt too hard. Supervisors werent very nice. No vacation. No sick time . no benefits. Most positions are only part time so they dont have to give benefits. Its an ok starter job for a teenager i guess.
good,"Fast-paced, physical, but simple job. You do not receive decent benefits unless you are full time. They purposely keep you under 40 hrs for a schedule to avoid having to provide full time benefits."
good,By making everyone uncomfortable with constant layoffs that have no basis on which people and why it causes people to leave on their own with no need for a severance package.
good,Walmart took and worked me till I could no longer keep up with the pace. Most of my managers were fair but expected more and more every day. I understand the need to have productive associates is in high demand in the retail world some of the ways Walmart goes about it is tough to handle and even tougher to maintian
good,Great people to work with! management was a little bad but the employees are amazing. We all helped one another and made it easy to get the jobs done!
good,"A good place to work for in between jobs. A very difficult place to advance unless you are interested in a management position which can be be very stressful. Some management is kind and positive toward the associates beneath them and some are just impossible to deal with. I was very greatful for employing me after  2 years of unemployment, but I don,t think I will ever go back there"
good,"The Walmart I work at have very nice people to work with but, I felt I was being passed over for other jobs in the store to much."
good,Very fast paced store. The Assistant Managers would constantly be riding the Customer Service Managers if there was any customers waiting in line to be checked out.
good,"If you are looking for a job, Walmart is the place to go for they will hire you and give you a fair pay rate. Management all ways depends. Very fast paced environment."
good,"Always busy, at times demanding.  They are always willing to cross train so employees know different areas  They work around 2nd job and school which is important."
good,"Normally id clock in and get working, I love to assist anyone that needs help, the only problem is no one their wanted to work, I would sometimes get upset because i stay extra doing others work."
good,"The managers are constantly rushing you to complete a task and then bark at you for not doing it right. They give promotions and keep on the most low life employees. I never missed a day while I worked there. Always put in my 40 hours. If not more because they made me stay to complete a project. Then they lay me off. I'll still shop there, but employment there is pathetic. That's why they never have any registers  open. They don't have the proper employees."
good,"usually busy, you have to do a lot of bending and lifting. i would refer high school students to work there as there first job. it can be a bit stressful at times"
good,Don't work here just don't work here unless you have to  Absolutely have too last resort Walmart doesn't care about their employees  Safety I was the so
good,I loved my job until they kept piling more and more on us. The manager is not associate friendly. He never speaks to associates or customers. They got rid of all the good Co managers and brought in new ones after I left.
good,Wal Mart distributions centers is a good place to work if your are young. You can not advance here because everyone else doesn't want to move up so you are stock in the same position for 8-9 years.
good,Overall decent company to work for. Great benefits. Room for growth and development. Training programs available. Really enjoy the travel to the Home Office occasionally.
good,Poor working environment needs to improve. They need to be nicer to the workers all the time not just when they want to be to get more work out of them.
good,"Stressful, not knowing if you have a job everyday, not being able to use vacation causing friction on personal life. They don’t believe in balance between work and home. Not being consistent with associates, even when I try to be."
good,"A typical day at work at Walmart was usually pretty stressful especially in the Connection Center, setting up Straight Talk phones. I learned patience from Walmart. Management was ok depending who you had to deal with. The work place culture depended on which department you worked in. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers.The most enjoyable part of the job was creating the friendships."
good,"I love having a 401k and healthy insurance only being 22, I feel like I accomplished something, I like working for Walmart but management is very rude 99% of the time"
good,I like working at walmart because i get to meet new people but i dont like how they do our hours like next week they only have me scheldued for 12 hours how do they think we can live like that
good,"Walmart isn't the best company to work for. People aren't happy to be there, corporate is obstructive and the general feel of most places is downright depressing. Walmart does okay with monetary benefits and they do provide two 15 minute breaks and a pay hourly lunch for shifts that are over 7 or 8 hours. That's far better then most places in the retail sphere."
good,"It felt like management didn't care about their employees at all. Got discriminated against and when it was brought up to upper management, the offender barely got a slap on the wrist. Was always hard to find a manager when you needed them to help with a customer."
good,"Working with coworkers was fun and enjoyable. Some management wanted to ride you and give you grief just to cause you trouble. Customers in most cases were fine and great to help out but others caused trouble for you on purpose (college kids), others were giving you attitude because you may not know something or werent giving them what they wanted fast enough, and a select few like to treat you and the entire staff like dirt due to they knew there was nothing you could really do about it."
