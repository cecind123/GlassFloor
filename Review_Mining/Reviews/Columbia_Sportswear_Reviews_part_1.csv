bad,"Not a good company to work for, they do not treat people with respect , the yearly raise is very low and they only care about the shareholders. They tell you at the last minute about overtime work and it’s mandatory, if you don’t come in for overtime without being approved, you get an unexcused absence."
bad,"If you are looking for a fast pace, fun environment, this is not a great choice.  It lacks leadership and this is not a company that truly cares about its workers.  They do not consider that you have a life outside of work and they will not help you if you have a conflict. Lots of gossip and backstabbing... exhausting and unprofessional."
bad,not and ideal job....touch and go.....favoritisium...very friendly people but if ur not up ur superiviors  butt u will get no where....they want u to kiss butt...
bad,Management is horrible and they do not know how to handle workers always overworked and always had favoritism to certain employees management is a joke never room to move up unless manager had you as a favorite
bad,"This was the worst job ever. The management is pathetic! Never worked at a place where the store manager calls out every week. The whole management team has no respect for their employees and its shows when they talk to them! Luckily I found a job and left can’t imagine working here anymore, worst job ever! To anyone who is considering working here do not, i repeat DO NOT!!! It is a complete waste of time!"
bad,this place wasn't what I expected at all to the description as I was applying online the back of the warehouse is unorganized and there are some possible safety hazards
bad,They treat you very disrespectful.Bad management.Blame you for things that are not true.No advancement.Terrible.Will never recommend this place to anyone.Worst job I ever had.
bad,The management is horrible and unfair.They treat you badly.I do not recommend working here.They blame things on you thats not true.Very sloppy and disorganized.
bad,Management wasn’t very good. Didn’t care if you had a family emergency. I had a very bad allergic reaction to some food I ate at work and my tongue and mouth swelled up to the point of unable to breathe. Wouldn’t call AMR or let me go home. Took an attendance point for leaving to go to the doctor. Talked down to me and made me feel worthless at my job.
bad,Extremely busy company with no regard to their associates.Very demanding job but no appreciation for the employees. Bonus incentives were taken away and company does not employ full-time employees.
bad,"Worst experience of my life I busted my butt and showed up early everyday to get two girls who were jealous of where I was at to say I wasn’t doing  appropriate things while I went to get my ecig. Seriously, they waited two hours into my day and didn’t give me a warning for something I wouldn’t ever do and just fired me. They state they are family but there not. I wasn’t even allowed to go get my stuff and they escorted me out of the building. Shame on you columbia family doesn’t treat family this way."
bad,"This place was a joke no job security at all, if your not running 100% they will fire you. No benefits at all or days off till your hire full time which they never will plus the pay is awful."
bad,Not enough hours low pay. Management was poor. They give you maybe 2 days a week then change schedules not letting you know they changed it. To much drama and no respect for employees.
bad,Columbia sportswear of ellenton  was horriable managers treat u horriably . you have no life working there . They cant seem to find reliable people. Managers are so unapperciative and u have no benefits.
bad,"Customers treat you like you are not a human being. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the manager when he's in or in one of his moods. I learned that managers play favorites with associates. Enjoyable part was working with assistant manager. Very inappropriate workplace as too many associates bring their problems into work and relationships. Offer no benefits much less full time even though there are promises of full time, which only apply to management. Hours get cut constantly and inconsistent schedule. Manager is NOT flexible with your schedule. Manager wants you to practically harass customers on a constant basis and encourage them to buy more. Uniforms are not provided and must buy your own Company Brand clothing in the store including shoes."
bad,hardest part is standing for long hours on cement floors. .associates had a hard time working with management
bad,"Very stressful, everything is timed and monitored. If you are young,strong,and fast, you may do well. Anyone middle age or older should give this company a pass. You could literally kill yourself trying to keep up. A company that values profits, at the expense of people"
bad,"My experience at Columbia Sportswear has been very stressful and demanding. This company and the temp agency doesn't care about it's employees! You're giving very minimal sick days during your contract of work as a temp (4 days) and if you call in sick during any of those four days you are lectured and the people in the temp office are constantly telling you that you're being written up and so on to stress you out more if being sick isn't enough. It's very confusing because the managers tell you to stay home if you're sick but when you call in sick to do them and everyone else a favor you get lectured and complained at about attendance and etc so it's very confusing. They say one thing and mean the other! When you start there the people in the temp office (kelly services) tell you that there is so much opportunity in the company and how it's highly rewarding and so on. Once you get working and talk to people around the company and figure out how things really are you realize that what the people in the temp office tell you couldn't be further from the truth. I've talked to all the coordinators and management and from what they've told me is that it takes forever (2-5) years to get hired on by the company from the temp agency where your expected to make a maximum of 9.80 in those couple of years which is hardly enough to cover gas and vehicle expenses if you have a decent drive ahead of you."
bad,"Not one thing is made in the U.S.A. When you enter the warehouse you see a gigantic american flag,it made me sick.Shipping and Recieving work their Temps like Dogs.The news treats Girt Boyle as a great employer,I call her Dirty Girty.This place is a revolving door to Warehouse Workers, BEWARE"
bad,Not a good place to work...management is always changing their minds...supervisors yell and blame everyone else. Making employees wipe mould off the boots that have come across seas on a boat and don't give them masks for the spores. They have a high turn over in employees and the ones that do work there for lots of years are just too lazy to look for a better job. Alot have been there since coming out of school. Husband and Wife teams DO NOT BELONG THERE.
bad,"No help from specific managers. These specific managers want everyone else to do their job. Major cuts in hours and than they get mad when you don't want to stay over your scheduled shift. No kind of direction to improve things that can get easily fixed. Attitude, eye rolling and gossip are being applied by specific managers. NO SENSE OF URGENCY TO FIX PROBLEMS IN THE STORE. MY OPINION THE STORE IS GOING DOWNHILL DUE TO FAVORITISM, LACK OF URGENCY FROM HIGHER MANAGERS, NO COMMUNICATION, EVERYDAY RULES CHANGE"
bad,This company does not work with my school schedule. I told them I cant work past 9 and they work me until 10. They also dont give me the one day I need off. Flexible scheduling is a joke.
bad,"The hours were good, but the environment of the job was horrible, the mangers like to gossip. It was super hard trying to get time off for school, and family events. The boss wasn't very nice. A lot of workers would come and go since they environment was so toxic. Would not recommend working there at all."
bad,Columbia sportswear was a very fun job! This was my first warehouse job and this is where i learned a majority of my skills from. A work day would be ten hours on swing shift an relaxing until the last hour came and everyone is ready to go home because it was slow. What made the job hard/difficult was those on the induction floor not following given directions which made the pack floors job harder because we would have to audit every shoot where the clothes came down and we had to pack them into boxes and label them with a sku barcode.
bad,"A woefully inept pool of managers, who haven't the skill to work at better companies, routinely dump all over good employees- that is my summation of the horror show I experienced at Columbia."
bad,"Horrible management, no advancement, no overtime and very underpaid for the responsibilities they actually have you perform. I worked at the Potomac mills mall location."
bad,This is a horrible place to work. Buddy culture. No room for advancement unless you are friends with management. I feel sorry for most of the staff there.
bad,"Columbia Sportswear expects a lot from their employees and pays them poorly. You are expected to work long hours or you will be given a point. (avg 60 hrs week) I worked above and beyond most of my coworkers and moved into a coordinator role but yet still made the same wage as everyone else. Most of the other bad reviews on here have some truth to them. If you can fit into one of the cliques you will be treated better. But even then none of it pays that well. It's too bad because I really enjoy warehouse work, but would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"The managers could not care less about the employees. They straight up lie to us about getting raises after reviews then we get nothing. Everyone is part-time so I get minimal hours each week & they keep hiring useless people & never bother to properly train them so the few competent workers spend most of their time fixing their mistakes & over-compensating for the overall laziness of the manager. "
bad,This company is not accommodating when it came to family emergency nor doctors note. Being hurt on the job results in termination. Would not recommend if you are looking for guaranteed employment for the full contract.
bad,The work days are long and hard. The hourly rate of pay is low within the industry. There is a high turn over rate of employees. The workplace culture does not foster work life balance.
bad,It’s just a place to find employment.  Managers have favorites which in some cases it’s good but not so fun for other.  Some employees do whatever they please and management just sweeps everything under the rug. This causes a hustle environment.  The sales associates get minimum wage in the city.  The commission it’s trash! Don’t let anyone fool you. Current employees I’m still close to said they had to work with no heat during these past weeks we had the artic blast in the east cost. Apparently the company did nothing to help the situation. So that right there can summarize how the companies feels about its employees.  I have worked for much major companies and I thought since it was a much smaller company the culture would be more of a family run company where the employers show and care more for the employees but I was terribly mistaken.  I left for a better job and I’m very happy I was able to find something better.  Many employees at the store I use to work are trying to get out even managers.  Anyone that wants to be employed by this company I just urge you to do your research before making a decision.
bad,they we rude to me and when I had an accident happen there and I was on leave they had me doing stuff that was not my job description and the pay wasn't equal to how many hours I work I work 3pm to 3am everyday
bad,"The Management at this location is terrible. I've never worked for a store that the management treated its employees so demeaning. Mainly the store manager & assistant store manager. The hours are ok, no opportunity for advancement. And be prepared to be treated not so well, even if you are college educated & a professional just trying to make a little extra money. These two think they are superior in everything they do & say."
bad,"Let me preface this by stating one obvious fact about Columbia starting from the CEO all the way down to anyone who is a manager above you. "
bad,"In response to the ""retail apocalypse"" the company has started endorsing unprofessional and abusive management tactics in an effort to increase it's profitability margin.  Management sets unreasonable standards, and then fails to recognize any success that approaches this.  I would never work there again."
bad,"I do not suggest working here. There is only one good manager and the rest are narcissistic, petty, and lazy. The work environment between employees is very group oriented and if you aren't in the group then you are hated."
bad,I did a recorded 22.98 hours of work in an 8 hour shift. They rewarded me with an XS unisex neck warmer. I am a large dude with a thick beard. Just a #
bad,"Pretty much you get hired on through a temp agency. Your recruiter from your temp agency will tell you that every week you will have meetings with your supervisor to go over how well you are doing. The point of this, I was told, was so that you can know where you stand in terms of getting actually hired on with the company. Long story short, I only met with my supervisor one time, and that is when he told me that I was being let go. And, of course, I worked through a temp agency, so what else was I supposed to expect? The thing that really didn't make any sense was that they had another training class being trained immediately after me and 14 other people were told that we were being let go because it was ""too slow."" That literally makes no sense. So, the company gets rid of well trained people because it's going to be slow, but then hires another training class?! I am pretty sure they let us go because they didn't want to offer us benefits. I am actually 100% positive that is the reason because someone in management told me that while they were giving me a ride home one day. They also do not give their temps access to all of the programs that regular employees get. Not only does it make the temps job more difficult, you have other employees getting upset at you when you ask them to look something up for you because you don't have access to a certain program! The company will definitely give you 2 days off in a row, but time off being accepted is rare. The managers are very cliquey when it comes to who they actually want to talk that works there. In my three months there, I"
bad,I love to work in this place.i Have learnt lot in this company and the result i able to manage big factory's. I have got chance to manage quality of factory's in India  and Bangladesh.
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with but most of the staff had no idea what they were doing.  Most days upon arriving at your designated zone u would stand around until supervisors came up with a zone for u to work in.  Very rarely did I ever work in the zone I was assigned!  The jobs were very easy but u could b sent to multiple zones in a day! Favoritism is very noticable & in your face.  I found this place to b a joke
bad,It's an enjoyable place to work at first but things change quickly.  My particular manager is very young and inexperienced and is unable to seperate her home/personal life from work. She is very passive aggressive and at times berates employees including the management team for trival things.  The pay is outstanding  but the stress level is almost unbearable. There are cliques within the store particularly between the manager and floor supervisor.  They both spend the majority of their day in the office gossiping and when tasks are not completed all heck breaks loose.  If you get on the managers bad side you are written up and treated very poorly.
bad,America has given Columbia the benefit of wealth opportunity. In turn they provide unsustainable entry level jobs leaving the American worker struggling to survive in what is supposed to be the wealthiest nation in the world. Columbia projects a false positive American image but once you work for them reality quickly sets in.
bad,"Great flex working hours. Great discounts. Great coworkers and mentors. Apparel design technical Product development team departments Advancement is slim. New roles are created for people in upper levels but for people who just want a promotion NOPE.  Designers have been in the same role for 8 plus yrs. Salaries are low and misaligned. Inflation has not mattered. Materials Research Associate makes 120K, but a Product dev manager makes 90K and a Technical designer makes 70K but a Apparel Fashion Designer makes 60K and a Product Developer makes 60K. All department Managers should be making 115-130k across the board, designers should be at 75-130k, Developers should be at 75K/3-5yr exp, mid 80-110 SR developers 115k-130k 6plus years of exp. 55k-70k, SR Tech design 65-80k, Fit 80-130k Technical designers Merch Coordinators 60k-90k. Advise to management: Don't pay people on the low range. relook at entire roles/people salaries/departments. es People talk about $. Reevaluate directors/leaders. We want to see women and people of color to director roles.  Showcase the products that your workers create. The garments showcased inside the offices are from 2010."
bad,This is my former job that they are posting about. I wouldn't reccomend working for the store manager. It was the worst experience of my 20 years in retail.
bad,"The minute your not talking to a customer, management lose their marbles and think that your work ethic is bad.  Not true.  Plus, most of the managers could care less by you and all they want is to make corporate happy.  Um...... like as a retail associate you get abused, and you think. ""Wow, I get paid barely anything to work in a toxic environment.""  Lots of gossip and scandals broke out and of course corporate sweeps it under the rug while they make their millions.  Some times sales reach 40 thousand in one day and all you get is 50 dollars!  I'm worth more than pocket change! I can make more money in 30 minutes pretending to be homeless in the parking lot, but instead I choose to work in a hostile environment with management watching your every step.  LIFE IS TO SHORT!  Something better is out there, so go and find it."
bad,"While the people culture is great, this is not a good place to work as they provide unsustainable wages. If you sustain an injury they will cut your hours so as to force you to quit your job."
bad,They had critical standards for new employees to meet that were set by more experienced employees using methods unapproved by the management personnel.
bad,"The IT department is hopelessly confused and rudderless. IT Project management is an exercise in trial-and-error. Lack of individual direction is a common problem. Cliques and cronyism are preferred over org charts. If you can hack it, it's a great place to work. Just document everything. And watch your you-know-what. Nobody else will."
bad,"I made the mistake of taking this as a seasonal contract position. Everything seemed great in the beginning, with my background I thought for sure I’d kill it at this place. What a joke that turned out to be. Our training was experimental and they were trying a new technique supposedly. Joke number one. We spent more time in 2 weeks going over the one program that was the most self explanatory and about 2 hours going over the one program that was the most complex that we needed to use the most. This turned out to set most of us up for failure. Out of like 22 of us, there are maybe 5 or 6 left a month out of training. They don’t tell you that you are being set up to take billions of calls at the expense of company and warehouse mistakes. They don’t tell you that they purposefully send out the wrong items to people over and over because they’re actually out of stock of the things people are trying to get. It’s like they just pull random things off the shelf in the warehouse and go “meh looks about right.” Half of the calls are literally cleaning up after the company’s owns mistakes. Another quarter of the calls are people who never even get any items to begin with despite shipping and tracking saying the items have been delivered. Oh and those package investigations take weeks to complete. Half of your time between calls is answering emails to the same degree. They do have some cool perks but I’m convinced they do stuff like that because they have to find a way to boost morale in an otherwise mundane and very stressful environment. I would never recommend this job to anyone. I’ve"
bad,"columbia sports wear is perfect for someone who can keep up to fast paced line work, i got moved around alot, not really given a chance to get a hang of where ever i was placed"
bad,"Favourtism, micro management, conflicts of interest, toxic environment/atmosphere. Don't waste your time and mental health. If you don't like the way a manager speaks to you it is YOUR problem not something that can be fixed on both sides."
bad,"The company is great and our store was great until the former store manager got promoted to another store about a year ago. She was replaced with a manager from a smaller store and it's been downhill from then on. Her inability to handle the bigger store puts unneeded stress on her management team. The assistant store manager and other supervisors are fair and respectful. Due to her inexperience all the other managers basically run the store for her while she sits in the office.When bringing concerns to her attention we often feel intimidated that she will punish us by cutting our hours or finding ways to fire us. She contradicts the company rules by arriving late 90% of the time and gets on to us for arriving 1 minute after. I have worked in fast food and for other retailers, but I find it hard to believe that someone would ever have thought she had the skills to lead. I told her I needed a few days off to attend my fathers funeral and she quickly told me only if I get my shifts covered. I then knew that I was working for a emotionless and uncaring individual. I highly recommend working for the company, but not this store until the store manager is replaced. We used to retain staff at this store, but after she got here I've see 40 plus non seasonal people quit due to her cruelty. If you want to work for a store manager that will provide you with a hostile environment then apply at this store."
bad,"I had considered long term employment with Columbia, but after I witnessing the horrible culture they encouraged. I could not in good conscience continue to work for the company. There were many cases of harassment that were ignored even after being brought to the attention of management. Many of the female employees had to endure constant advances by their male coworkers, even if these advances were rebuffed they wouldn't stop. Most of the employees did not listen to management when policy changes were made, they did whatever inconvenienced them the least, even if that meant not being truthful to the customer."
bad,"when I say ""no hours"" I really mean it. I was working at this store for 4 and a half months and the most hours I've had in one week was 10. My weekly average was between 0-5 hours a week. The store manager is terrible, she kept on telling me that I'd get hours as time went on I never received and extra shift, and she blamed a new ""system"" for the issue. She also pulls favorites and allows her favorites to do virtually anything but actual work. Assistant store manager is great, she actually cares and helps out with the store (unlike the store manager). The other lower managers are okay, stock manager is very good. All sales associates are really awesome, just stuck in a bad situation. I highly recommend finding a different place to work, especially if you need more than 5 hours a week."
bad,"Typical day: We have a 5 min meeting, we are always told ""We have plenty of work"" but the truth is that they have no more clue then you do. More then 50% of the time they're right. "
bad,When working for Columbia it was a temporary position for me.  I excelled in all areas of the work obligations and enjoyed my time with Columbia.  The company treated employees with respect and appreciated everyone's efforts.
bad,"When I was recruited by CSC it was a great place to work, totally collaborative and open communication between the ranks - everyone seemed to matter and that made everyone contribute. that is no longer the case. Shifts in the executive leadership led to insecurities, which led to a ""cast system"". Also there is severe lack of career growth and job clarity.  It's too bad, really."
bad,It's a prefect job for a college kid just trying to figure what he/she wants to do with life but personally I couldn't handle the management that worked there. Too much favoritism. Too many delusional ideas like most retail managers have (if not all of them). There was some really weird company rules. The hardest part was dealing with bad management. Most enjoyable part was going home. I didn't quit this job I quit the management team.
bad,"I worked a week and before I got the job they told me they are trimet friendly I would take the bus 2-1/2 hours to make it to work. And I always got on the 1st one out and worked 2x as needed. But because trimet doesn't care if your on time and the people who work there don't care you have no place to fit in.. and everyday night shift would always some how mess up for morning shift then point fingers at morning shift   "
bad,"The best thing about working for Columbia Sportswear are the other co-workers. The management is very unfriendly and only cares about results. My store manager only uses employees are stepping stones to further their career. The store has trouble keeping new employees and all the good ones never stay long. Management doesn't know how to talk to associates and only criticizes. Doesn't care about anything other than results no matter how miserable the atmosphere may be. Typical Control freak like behavior. Only 1/3 of our workforce has been working there for over 6 months. The benefits are great if you use them, but not worth dealing with everything."
bad,The management is horrible.They sit in the back while everyone else struggles up front.They get angry when you don’t know the policies of the store even if you don’t know what they are.They will put you in places you don’t know.This was a horrible store
bad,The job was relatively easy but the management was horrible. They were terrible at scheduling and caused multiple employees to resign from their employment.
bad,"The co-workers are very friendly, management was okay. I answered the phone and placed orders for the customers. The hardest part about this job was understanding the managements expectations because each person said something different"
bad,I had fun working there it was for the social aspect. Bad general manager. Terrible pay. No promotion or raise opportunity. No Incentives. Terrible work attire
bad,"Team members are friendly/some management. Work is super fast-paced and always understaffed, management puts all the stress on sale associates. Underpaid for what we do, hard to grow within the company, management rarely willing to work with employee scheduling (like students and parents), time off usually gets denied. Overall the only perks I see for this job is the fact that one can shop in the store, otherwise I do not recommend this job."
bad,some people stand in 1 spot all shift with others are constantly being moved around to different departments because that department is backed up and behind or jammed from somebody's screw up in another department.
bad,It was a job that kept you on your toes. Did not like the long walk to the lunch room. I rather be sitting than standing on the production line.
bad,"Took the job and was assured I would receive no less than 20 hours a week with an average of 25 hours a week, part time. First two weeks were good and the discount was nice until you realize the clothing is low quality garbage and you get tired of looking at it much less want to wear it. After the first two weeks my hours were cut to 10-12 a week and stayed that way with no explanation. The customers are loathsome, depressed housewives with nothing better to do than argue about a discount that is literally cents on the dollar, that and old cranky seniors. The co workers are all cool as it usually is in retail, with the exception of that one guy who everyone hates. The management was incompetent in many different aspects. Favoritism meant the difference between sitting in the back on your phone and handling lines of customers by yourself, all while everyone's getting paid equally. There were employees who simply walk out on their shift due to the terrible management. Also signed up for direct deposit and was told it would take a few pay periods. After waiting 4 months I decided to call HR in Portland, OR only to find out my information was never actually sent. $9.50 an hour was slightly above wages around here anyway so that's the only plus side. The store manager would sit in office all day and not do anything. Communication with employees was done through a piece of computer paper with instructions written on it. The manager literally didn't speak to the associates.Training was self taught after a few vague instructions on the cash register. Do yourself a favor and just go"
bad,Columbia offers no paid vacation for store front part time employees. There are no benefits and one earns 16-20 hours per week (unsustainable). Twice I was offered management jobs at 8.50 per hour (obviously an insult to 10 years in retail). For dedicated work I got a 27 cent raise.
bad,"Seldom have I seen so many incredibly talented people under one roof. Unfortunately, the management has absolutely not one clue how to successfully utilize the level of raw ability present under Columbia's roof."
bad,"Work a bunch of different hours. It could be a 4-hour shift, an 8-hour shift, you never really know what you are getting. Only Managers and supervisors will get 8-hour shifts even if you ask for them."
bad,I was one of the 10 employees yet i barely got any hours. I worked during the school year far out in chesterfield county so we didn't really get that busy unless there was a break like winter or spring break coming up.
bad,"Nice clothing, but horrible internal work structure.  Run by a good-ol-boy system that likes to keep people in check."
bad,"Start off the work day by sweeping, mopping and dusting the entire store and fixtures. Open store and wait for customers. When customers arrive i had to greet them, ask what they were looking for and told them to ask if they needed anything. if a customer needed another size or style i would look it up on the computer to see if we had it in stock. if we did i went outback and got the item, if it wasnt in stock then we offered to the customer to call our other store and see if they had it. had to get customers to sign up for columbia greater rewards. finally i ran cash register, it was normally very busy and fast paced. Management was horrible! 4-5 managers working at once and not communicating with eachother. most of the time i was told to do something by one manager then told to do something completly different by another one. i ended up leaving the job because my hours were cut drastically (36-45 hrs/wk) to about (8-12)."
bad,They state when you sign on at Columbia Sportswear that you work Monday through Friday but we work almost every Saturday so you get a lot of overtime in your time there
bad,"Lots of pressure from from management to always sell better. There used to be great incentives and the company was family oriented, but that seems to have changed when I was leaving.  I started off really proud to work for Columbia, but after a year I was pretty done with the co-workers and management."
bad,"I worked for this company for several years. It felt as if I was in high school all over again. Management would always gossip and blame others for actions rather than themselves. There were obvious favorites who were granted more hours (even if they did less work). Although I did enjoy what we sold and how the overall company was ran, the store manager was an issue. They were very immature."
bad,"This is an entry level retail job, most workers are college students, co does a good job being flexible around classes but at a cost of making minimum wage with no career advancement and no benefits other then a 10% employee discount which covers sales tax and paid sick time off only because state of CA requires it."
bad,"Typical day at work is walking around in circles all day. Management is extremely unprofessional and jejune, The store manager does nothing but sit in the office all day long and shows no support to others and is scared of conflict. The assistant store manager is petulant and cant handle stress to save his life and is extremely disrespectful and the Freight manager Does absolutely nothing at all wasting company time. "
bad,"This company is great for those that make a good earning, for the rest of us it isn't such a wonderful story. Entry level workers are paid unsustainable wages to the point we cannot afford to buy lunch nor a pair of shoes. Currently some employees earn less than 10 hours in a week while corporate employees pocket thick pay checks. I would like to for once work for a fair employer...that would be a refreshing change."
bad,Women are frequently passed over for promotions and men are quickly under a microscope when working with younger women. Favoritism and  religious bias is open and apparent.
bad,It was a perfect job for me to learn and step to a new position. I learned how to manage business.
good,I couldnt get a raise or move up in this company my ideas were unheard and all they cared about was numbers amd sales. We only made a dollar for every 100 we sold. Over Christmas time i sold about 3000 dollars of stuff and got maybe 50 dollars
good,"Typical day ( if you ever get scheduled) fold and size clothes in the store, typical shift is 4hrs. Very little traffic so we sell little therefore we don't receive hours, but they don't advertise at all and don't do much to bring in more traffic but they harass us in to bothering customers and really going above and beyond to get the sale even though you don't get hours even for selling well."
good,Basic warehouse job..... Not much advancement. Ok benefits. Unsafe
good,"Columbia is a wonderful company, and offers amazing pay but does not care about their employees. They are quick to push you out and replace you if they feel the slightest need."
good,"If you're a sales associate you will look forward to little to no hours a week, the managers will tell you one thing one day and then the next day there's different rules. If you have a problem with a manager they absolutely don't care they have a ""you're replaceable attitude"". Not a fun place to work unless you are a manager."
good,"It was a good store, I enjoyed the work assigned to me. But there was too much personal I did not like the he say, she say behind others backs. The pretentiousness was overbearing."
good,"From my experience, as well as experience of many friends, we all worked very, very hard and appreciation did not come from management.  Many have left Columbia and are glad they did."
good,We always just stood around and talked it was never busy at all. The managers wouldn't listen to our requests on days we couldn't work or we were going on vacation.  He did what made him look the best for other people
good,"unorganised place to work and too many temps, no one cared about the work it was all about speed not quality, didn't care if a mark or rip on garment, just send it out anyway"
good,"I worked very hard."
good,Columbia propone un'etica aziendale lodevole ma è proprio l'ambiente lavorativo presso l'outlet che non è positivo e costruttivo.
good,Wouldn’t recommend working here. But also wouldn’t completely tell someone not to. The one benefit is time off is easy to come by if you have a full staff.
good,"The hours started off great. I worked very often but, soon the hours began getting cut. Now I am barely getting any hours. The most hours I get now is 16 a week. when I used to be getting 22-24 hours a week."
good,"Not very organized when comes to daily tasks."
good,Productive learning about technologies was fascinating.  Management was like normal co-workers because we worked as a team.  Communication from head office was the hardest yet challenging which i enjoy...
good,Nice history. Typical retail environment. Apply if you like extreme sports
good,"CSC is a very good company as far as compensation and benefits. But, it has a major endemic culture of nepotism, making it nearly impossible to advance one’s carrier. This also brings the added challenge of unqualified short term executives only interested in quick results that save money in the short run, but are dreadful for the future of the company and the morale of employees. That said, and in CSC's defense, this is not an uncommon practice amongst large companies, so take my review with a grain of salt, as the same can be said about many others."
good,"Good compensation, terrible office culture"
good,"Every department is different.  In my department, I was not respected for the knowledge I brought or the dedication and creative solutions I brought to the table.  In the end, my position was eliminated rather than allowed to grow."
good,"Management was lacking, low pay after you taxes, the commute from Vancouver wasn't bad, high turnover rate. Hardest part of the job was staying busy when the work was slow or dead."
good,"staff was divided and worked off of he say she say"
good,"I've worked in Ellenton Columbia. This one was pretty good with a good work environment. The managers were good at what they did and treated me like an employee. Moving to the LA Columbia, the management is a little iffy. I feel they make there own rules here as opposed to what's really suppose to be, compared to the one in FL."
good,"Typical warehouse stocking and picking. Not much to it, same thing every day. The work was pretty independent, I don't think i really even knew the names of the other people i worked with. We just showed up, did our jobs and went home. Very inclusive though, I feel like they hired people from all walks of life. So if you're in a pinch and looking for work, this is a good place for steady employment."
good,"cool place for a little bit to work for a little bit. And although there were too many people to meet, I did enjoy making strong connections with my team members that I worked with at the time."
good,"It is a fast paced job and relatively easy. You definitely get plenty of mandatory overtime hours. Big checks great benefits, though not much recognition or appreciation."
good,"Very sales driven.  Managers often would not listen to employee issues.  Management took no interest in community building ideas, volunteer opportunities, or other lifestyle related activities.  Held parties in store for brands that they carried, but never had employee parties. Did not feel valued as a worker."
good,Flexible with their hours. Good place to work for if your trying to juggle work and school. Very little opportunity to become full time and get benefits.
good,"Day to day work was very organized and professional. Management was a hit or miss. I loved my manager, but some of the other managers did not care about what you needed to be the best you could be in the work place."
good,The employees were fun and everyone got along. Some manages had favorites. Over all it was pretty nice job not to slow not to fast. Typical retail store.
good,The store was not prepared for the amount of traffic it received. Not enough employees scheduled each day for it. Employees were unhappy and openly looking for other jobs.
good,Great for anyone who loves the outdoors and learning all of the new technology for clothing/outerwear. The employee discount is great too! The store is full of so many cool gadgets - you'll never get bored at work!
good,"A typical day of work for me might include basic cleaning and opening of the store. I also am responsible for sales, returns, and overall customer service."
good,Working for columbia sportswear was long and great to work under big company because i gained experience a lot of cause customers who like this brand are very cool hey cause you get to listen to felt in the garments i recommend them because the customers love this brand are people who do a lot of outdoor sports so i enjoy presenting the features and benefits of the products other than that i enjoyed my working there more specially at pretoria.
good,The management team and the employees are very enjoyable to work with.  Then environment is friendly and bbqs were provided regularly for employee appreciation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and people.  The hardest part is the high risk of layoffs.
good,"It was an okay place to work for discount was nice, made over minimum wage but there were no raises allowed apparently."
good,"Some of the managers were very clique, there was a pay freeze so there was no chance for raises. But it was a good place to work overall nice people and alright environment."
good,Management staff tends to contradict themselves and not conduct in a way that is typical.
good,The management team is lackly a recognition program for good managers. The mid level managers have little control over the decisions required to acquire and manage a strong team
good,"ambiance au siège Européen plutôt sympathique, notamment lié au fait d'avoir des équipes multi-culturelles"
good,"It's an okay place to work at, as sales associate you ring, work the fitting room and sales. "
good,Fastpaced but fun once you get the hang of the program. Not strict but your usual valued work rules. No drugs/alcohol is a good thing cuz helps keep the working environment in a clean level headed thinking spot.b
good,"A great Oregon company with a hard working, loyal workforce. However, there are limited job advancement opportunities. They are continually working to improve on this as it is crucial to keep and attract qualified employees."
good,"Days filled with meetings and/or projects"
good,"Columbia Sportswear has a lot of great points, good pay, benefits, onsite gym, team activities. There were a lot of projects going on, but insufficient human capital (they did not utilize outside consultants). It seemed the company lacked direction on what they were focusing on and it allowed people to go in many different ways. Management in my department was not interested in developing their employees and looked down on them when they showed interest in growth. People seem complacent in their jobs and happy to spend time in the fun activities."
good,The company has management problems and high turnover. Culture has changed dramatically over the years.
good,a typical day at work
good,Easy part-time work. Management has always been good and they are very friendly and willing to work with you on everything. Very positive place. I've worked with them on and off since the mall opened and they have always been more than willing to work with me and encourage.
good,"Extremely busy store,must be able to shift tasks/ multitask quickly. Management/staff communication poor..because there are many employees not all info gets to everyone leads to confusion."
good,"At the start of the day, you are given a task by your shift lead or manager to work on, until you are given other instructions to change roles. Roles can range, such as, cashier, inventory, sales floor associate, fitting room associate. Hardest part of the job was having customers that did not speak English, mainly Hispanic tourist shop at my location, and this made it difficult for me to communicate with the customer."
good,You have to be on your feet all day. Your back and hands start to ache. Literally felt like working in a factory like a slave. I had no life. Very depressing. You werent allowed to be late.
good,Great company very easy work but fast paced many good workers and a few good management personnel. Some management needs to listen to workers but most do
good,it's retail work but more responsibilities than normal such as signing up everyone for the rewards program and daily goals for everyone that are somewhat unrealistic.
good,"When I first started it was a fun and productive workplace but the higher you move up, the more you are under a microscope by everyone. The company changes DMs like crazy and each DM is completely different. Your store basically runs how your DM wants it, not even by the store manager. The company kept adding on task after task for management to complete and it got way too much for everyone. You are constantly under stress and nothing is ever good enough that you do."
good,Columbia sportswear as a whole tries it's hardest to make a difference with a number of charitable efforts world wide but i feel on the retail lower levels we get the short end of the stick sometimes
good,"Good fast pace environment, lots of forklift training and good break / lunch room , very high turn over rate can’t keep people because of pay and benefits"
good,"If you really like a warehouse environment I would recommend working there, it's not bad pay and the managers aren't the worse but overall its a good starting job!"
good,"I was a contract worker for a holiday season, working in their call center, which might skew my opinions slightly. "
good,"Opening the store, engaging customers throughout the day"
good,The perks at Columbia Sportswear are nice.  The company does allow the employees to enjoy the outdoors and test it the gear at the activities they enjoy!
good,"Beaux locaux, ambiance seine et agréable au quotidien de part de très bonnes relations avec les collègues et les supérieurs."
good,"Working at Colombia sportswear company was something different , the team was great, we got along and worked well together . Always willing to help most."
good,"Standard retail job. Management is alright, they have your back when needed. Lots of customers as its the only location in BC. Work can be very dull and tedious"
good,"The company Is a great company to work for. They offer quarterly sales bonuses for management. Its like any other retail job, the hours are never consistent and there is no such thing as a routine week schedule. The management needs work on its communication skills but other than that they are great as well. The store manager is very flexible with students and other associates looking to just pick up a couple extra dollars a week. The hardest part about this job is the inconsistency with the schedule. Its hard to start or have a family when your schedule is never the same."
good,Not a lot of room for advancement low paying but good discounts on clothing. Retail in general does not pay well.  In the retail stores the company dose not allow for full time employment so that they don't have to pay for medical benefits.
good,This was a fun company to work for. Great discounts and great products. Direct manager was very hard to work for as he did not like women in management positions.
good,Merchandise geared toward a younger demographic which necessitated staying current with product knowledge. Worked with an amazing and diverse crew to achieve sales goals.
good,A fast paced work environment. Switch jobs every few days so things stay interesting. There is so much to learn but once you do it puts everything in to prospective for a distribution center.
good,"learned a lot working in this outlet, the staff and managers are great. like how everyone worked together and helped out. even though the outlet is always busy as a previous staff I once was I like being busy."
good,"Focus on the job at hand, meet your goals, and contribute where ever needed."
good,they cut your hours when its slow. its very busy during the Christmas season but in summer extremely slow. stressful when we have a secret shop. strict rules
good,"It was the most enjoyable and satisfying job I've ever had, for the first two years. The new manager made it miserably stressful. Nothing that existing staff ever did was right in her eyes. Mind you, we were an excelling store, beating sales targets 90% of the time. We had awards for our work within the company."
good,"It was great company to work for, most of the people were easy to get along with. The hrs were good. The down fall that of the job I had was it was hard on the back."
good,"A lot of people  interaction, standing for long hours. Have to understand the product to work smoothly. Very understanding"
good,"Sell good quality products."
good,"Had a stable job there for a couple years, lots of hours and regular customers were great to see. A family unit- with lots of product knowledge training and associate reviews. This workplace taught me great work ethic for the future. However, not a lot of time off."
good,Love working with the smart people at distribution but too much fun and games at corporate rather than doing the work.  Too many rah rah meetings for people to hold hands cheer.  Like a big pep rally high school when work is to be done.
good,Fast paced. Have to be good at multitasking. Learned a lot about footwear and merchandising. Co-workers are great. Stressful at times.
good,"Shipping and receiving"
good,"It isn't my idea job.  But I can't complain, it pays a check, decent hours and everything.  Lacks a lot of management in places and really couldn't progress though I thought I was ready for a promotion.  They have good job security but advancement is just tough."
good,Fun place to work loved the employees I worked with. A member of management was hard to get along with. The product sold great in cold weather.
good,Cool company to work for. Good people and room to grow when I was there. I learned a great deal from my managers. The only downside is you have to work most holidays.
good,"The staff was really funny, we used headsets to communicate because our location was so large but we would always just crack each other up the entire day. It can get really really slow during warmer seasons."
good,This is a very good place to work. I have enjoyed my time here.
good,Depending on the time of the year would determine if or if not the company would be busy. Co-workers were very fun and nice to work with.
good,A tipcal work day at Columbia would be maintaing high visual standards as well as training sales and stock assoicates.
good,Fast day always on the move. Inventory checks as well as quality checks. I learned to manage people and quality checks on the products.
good,great place for people who love customer service. management pass awkward comments towards each other. co-workers are rude about management. nothing hard about the job. flexible hours. but don't ask for a day off they get on you about being sick.
good,Regular fast paced job located in a tourist area so 98% of the customers were from out of town who did not speak English. It was always busy but due to the co workers and management it was always a fun place to work.
good,"Unique organization, good benefits, very stuffy for an ""outdoorsy"" company."
good,"nice people to work with, good culture. company appears to be in transition from smaller company to bigger company. pay could be better for IT where I work."
good,"All co-workers are willing to cooperate and work to complete tasks and objectives.Typically, work in the morning starts slow until noon/afternoon. Usually slow during the weekdays and slightly busier during the weekends."
good,"I was really excited to work here after being a stay at home mom for a little over a year. When I started everything was great, the staff was amazing and friendly and I enjoyed working in every area. Once I got done with all my training and was ready to be on my own, I noticed a lot of favoritism. If a staff didn't like a certain area and they were working with a certain manager they would switch and place a different staff in that spot. They were supposed to rotate on a schedule so no one was in the same place always and everyone was getting a chance every were. That didn't happen. So you would get burned out doing the loading dock or the stocking non stop while other staff mainly worked the floor"
good,"Alright work place for short term, they pay low. My supervisors are cool but others not so much. The lunch and break system needs to be fixed, a lot of things are kinda broken which makes doing a job a lot harder."
good,"During the week it was pretty slow. Weekends and holidays were the busiest. So many tourists, mainly non-English speakers, so it was very important to be patient and find a form of communication between the customer and employee. Average co-worker environment, some were easy to work with while others made the job difficult. Lunches and breaks were always off schedule, employees had to ask the supervisors for their lunches and breaks sometimes because they would not get called to take them. Most enjoyable part about the job was seeing a customer that you recognize, they tend to be the friendliest and easiest to assist."
good,"I just didn't feel like I belonged there. I mostly kept to myself when it came to connecting with co-workers. I did get to come in contact with many different customers. Overall it was a good workplace, just not for me."
good,"I loved helping customers get what they came in for. Many customers are easy to satisfy. Flexible breaks and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Don't bother working here if you're with a temp agency. Columbia WILL NOT keep you, even if they say they will."
good,"It's okay to work there just keep to yourself and remember its a job. Managers are human like everyone else but the culture of having ""sides"" is too much sometimes."
good,"still a local owned place which is great, but it is becoming very corperate and having more of a big box feel then a locally owned feel. They do have great product, and an awesome discount."
good,"The work is not difficult. Mainly consists of assisting customers, recovering the store, visual merchandising and restocking sold product. The biggest drawback to the company is that the vast majority of retail managers are unwilling/unable to develop their subordinates."
good,"They provided opportunities to grow with the company. There was also a clear explanation of what is expected. I felt like harassed in that work place. It seamed like the management tried to talk to coworkers. It was not enough. The harassment got worse, so I quit."
good,The Columbia Sportwear Employee store was a good high school and college job for me.  The managers were easy to get along with and expected the right amount of work from us.  The atmosphere was good.  Co-workers worked together to make sure customers were satisfied.
good,"A typical day at work was normally fast paced, and had to be accurate.  Like any job things could go wrong, or staffing could end up being short.  In these cases it was important to pick up the slack, keep calm, and get the job done without causing tempers to rise.  It was also very important to listen to instructions, to make sure others understood your instructions, and to be patient.  A good attitude, good communication skills, and respect for all workers was very important.  The best part of the job was on the busy days when the day would fly by and you felt like you had contributed to the companies success.  The hardest part was the constant layoffs."
good,"It depends if you work at the warehouse or the corporate office. If you work at the warehouse they treat you as a grunt, no special perks. The pay is okay if you don't need a raise every year. Glass ceiling affect for job advancement. The Corporate office gives out several special perks, treats you high class. Pay, advancement, and management is 100%."
good,Focused on providing services to the customer and getting their merchandise needs met. The job can be fast paced and requires a lot of standing for the sales associate.
good,"You never know what you'll be doing on a particular day, you're just sent where you're needed. Management is pretty good for the most part. The people are pretty friendly too and usually willing to help. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day on a concrete floor, and all the overtime. Most enjoyable part was interactions with co-workers, though they were few"
good,My job had its ups and downs just as any other job. Management could have improved their attitudes towards their employees. The stress of corporate did take a toll on the store for their sale quotas. The best part was meeting people from around the world.
good,Great company to work with. management is very approachable and encouraging. good performance is always recognized and rewarded.
good,Subsidiary office of USA based company. Hard to transplant office culture and feel in suburban Geneve.
good,"I learned a lot at this job. There was always something new to handle, from customer complaints to employee isuues. The most difficult part of my job was when I thought I was doing my job correctly, my manager would tell me I was doing it wrong and never fully explain how to do it correctly. For the most part, I truly loved my job, my associates and my regular customers. I just had too many personal issues with the manager."
good,"Overall a pretty great job from work/life balance to compensation and job culture. Obviously management varies by the store, but our management was good, business casual and friendly."
good,"Wasn't fun to work here , the manager was to uptight and always in your ear, But  he did help with alot of things and he was willing to help out with aanything you needed help with."
good,"Working for Columbia was great!  The culture, initiatives, and vibe of the company was infectious.  Only 1 complaint.  There's only 4 outlet districts within the entire company, which means each DM has  15-17 stores.  Which in other words means: you never get a response from an email, visits are verrrrrry few and far between, and ultimately there's not a lot of support coming from that area."
good,This job is great for people that don't like to sit in one place. Constant movement and carrying boxes filled with cloths. The main focus of the company is to make efficiency with strict rules.
good,"its a complicated service to work for there are hidden flags that come across as unfair. The people are just about doing their jobs they aren't so welcoming. and if they don't like you and complain about you, you're as good as fired there's no structured process to go through its just if the right people like you you'll enjoy working and making friends and be able to work with them and if the ""right People"" don't like you you're fired. And their supervisors weren't even doing their jobs. it was crazy but I learned from that experience."
good,Rapid training followed by fairly simple calls. Co-workers are a big help and management mostly stays out of your way. If you give it a minimum of effort you'll do fine. Do not expect to be hired on permanently. Super slow off season.
good,"Learned gladiator technology to due with placing orders in boxes for other companies. Constant fast paced work area at all times, not for someone that is slow or low energized. Hardest part would be maintaining the same job for more than 2 months as there are multiple lay offs within the 3 month contract period. The people are very kind and supervisors are very straight forward people, very easy to work with."
good,"I appreciated the work culture and leadership, however could not return to day shift after having another child (swing was the only option). As a single mom this unfortunately did not work."
good,Throughout my experience working at Columbia Sportswear I have to say it is a fair job however I will say the pay is great but I do not think it is close to enough to earning enough money to live in the area. Most enjoyable part of the job is the staff since they are all kind and willing to teach anyone new to the retail industry.
good,"It's a good company for beginners in the work industry. The current managers are very friendly and they have made some changes in corporate, so the company feels safer to climb the ladder, if you wanted."
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for to gain experience. The management is fair and the benefits are very good. It’s a good job if you are stressful out of high school, new to the country or looking for something very hands on. There is a lot of manual labor. They typically work five days a week for eight hours, sometimes it’s required to work Saturdays. There is a lot of holiday overtime opportunities. The hardest part of the job is they ask you to keep an Employee Performance percentage that is outrageous and is very demanding on your body, it personally wasn’t worth the pay. Advancement wasn’t an option because the people who move up have been there for 10+ years. They don’t pay you for taking on more responsibility."
good,"Have fun while you're there, work is supposed to be fun! Long hours kill but its always worth it in the long run. Always think of the costumers and help out as much as you can"
good,i love this company they made me who i am today. great colleagues even thou we dont always get along but at the end of day we all work as the team. we have a supporting manager.
good,"I love working for Columbia Sportswear. It's a great company that is always coming up with new innovations and designs to improve clothing. A typical day at work consists of registers and floor time. Unless you're a freight associate, meaning you work and process freight in the backroom/warehouse. There are typically 4- assistant managers, and then the store manager. The store I work fro has kept most of their managers, but seems to have a problem keeping freight supervisors/managers. My coworkers are amazing and very friendly, we all like to keep each other in a good mood and make each other laugh. The hardest part of the job depends on the day honestly. When we are busy, two of the four managers don't handle the stress as well as they could, and therefore become anxious , sometimes affecting the associates for that shift. The most enjoyable part of being a sales associate at Columbia Sportswear has to be the feeling of accomplishment when you've helped a customer, or taught them something new about one of the technologies the clothing offers. You start to build a sense of loyalty. Also, for every month that we make our expected or above expected goal of profit, the company gives you a percent of that in your check the following month. It's called ballistics. Very very nice incentive and motivator."
good,This company uses mostly temps. Great for a first job or if English is your second language.
good,I enjoy my job at columbia sportswear. My co workers and I do our best at keeping a smile on our face and providing the best customer service possible.
good,I mostly work in the stock room processing freight and getting it out to the sales floor or back stocking and organizing it. I also work on the sales floor filling in for breaks and when they are short of employees.
good,"Good company to work for"
good,Working at Columbia is great because they are flexible on my hours and they are very friendly to employees and customers. Managment understands and tries its best for all employees to be successful and succeed in the company.
good,Columbia is a good place to work with good people and good benefits located in the Portland Oregon area. They have a good IT department with good technology.
good,"They have a great deal of wonderful people on staff, a few not so much. That's what happens when you get a lot of women together. "
good,"very friendly people , had to stay on your feet and keep busy. always something to do. discounts were okay . management was very understanding when something personal was going on."
good,It is very fast pace... I liked that most the time you are moving ..packing orders ... People are friendly liked the work environment. Would like to go back
good,Working in customer service at Columbia Sportswear was fun because of the opportunity to meet different people. I love interacting and learning new things.
good,"Columbia sportsware is a nice place to work if you have no ambition and arent looking for a job with a likely chance of advancement within the company. most of the work is performed by Temps with a HIGH turnover rate, which is odd because the work, hours, and pay are all great. you just wont go anywhere but where you start for five years or more. All of the leads @ RVK said it took them Seven+ years to advance into their positions."
good,"It was a fun place to work at, especially if you like retail. Management is great. The general environment can be a bit stressful at times, but that's when the associates/managers come in and make it worth while."
good,"	Provide exceptional customer service and problem solving by responding to all inbound/outbound calls "
good,"J'ai effectué une mission intérim qui s'est bien passé, cadre et poste de travail agréable. Bon relationnel avec les collaborateurs et managers."
good,Worked here during the summer while paying for school. They were flexible with schedules and the pay was very good hourly. Would recommend working here.
good,"I like working for Columbia, love working with customers, The hardest part of my job is moving up the ladder, It seems like the management has favorite people and the other hard workers get over looked."
good,I enjoy this job. Seems difficult to transition from temporary employment to permanent full time status. Fun work environment and positive managers. If converted to full time I would probably like continuing to work for this company.
good,"i really liked working there, and i really enjoyed the people i worked with and the work wasn't to hard. and i did really well there."
good,"Management is great.  People are fantastic.  No competition is sales, rather everyone works well together."
good,Good products. Felt like I sold something that had value and would be used for many years.  Enjoyed working with the public.
good,Very enjoyable work experience. Excellent hours and managers work to accomadate employees schedule reuirements
good,Company has growth. It is a fast pace environment. Friendly co-workers.
good,"My overall job was to make sure the business was running and profitable daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.  I hired, trained and work with customers daily.  I got to work with over 1000 customers a day and loved it.  The product was great and that made it easy to sell.  My store was number one in my district and the smallest in the district."
good,commission based sales with heavy knowledge of price points as well as specifications of different product.
good,Good place to work. Good people. Had fun working here. Retail is retail is retail.
good,* Travail en collaboration avec les clients et les fournisseurs afin d'assurer un approvisionnement en temps et en heure ainsi qu'une livraison au maximum en adéquation avec la commande initiale.
good,Good place to work and gain experience. Financially sound company with good management
good,"My job is great, but I need to see change. Management is amazing: super flexible and in tune with the employees. A typical day for me is clocking in and going around the store and always finding something to do whether that be standards, helping customers, working the register or even helping in the stock room occasionally."
good,"My boss tended to be crude and condescending talking down to his subordinates, often times making demeaning statements questioning education and poking at ethnicity, and yet I was let go for an oversight sounds a bit ironic."
good,"Fun workplace with great coworkers! But I do not highly recommend being a contractor here long term as the corporate culture, that is awesome, does not transfer to projects or contractors fully. Try to get a full time position so that you are compensated fully for the work you do, get benefits, and get to fully participate in the culture!"
good,"PT work with little advancement. Had my hours fixed to the same day and times each week. Worked most of my hours Fri, Sat, and Sun. A bit rough as it was a lot of 11am-7pm or 2-10pm, the busiest time of the day."
good,"Some negativity by the full time staff make it tough to remain upbeat. Wage has increased to $14.per hour.  Training in all departments. Physically demanding, lots of heavy lifting, repetitive tasks, stand for full shift. You get moved around the warehouse so that you are not doing the same thing for 8 hours. Overall a good place to work, most of the staff is very friendly and helpful."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Columbia. The only drawback was the lack of training for management. In addition, Columbia recently changed it's compensation package, which was not well received by the reps."
good,There are a lot of parties and outdoor trips. The pay is very low but the benefits are good.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job I'd say is that you learn something new each day and meet new people everyday.
good,"Working at Columbia has shown me a lot  the work was great, but it was that some of the management would stir up unnecessary drama and would cause a lot of stress on the whole team. I would recommend working here, and if you’re given the opportunity to move up in the company, I suggest you take it."
good,"Great place to work.  Lots of benefits and perks.  Recently able to work from home.  Along with a huge responsibility, it was a fun time at work, Donuts 1st of each month!"
good,"I started as a Customer Service Representative, went on a stretch in Merchandising but it didn't land a job.  More help from managers would help to move up."
good,This job is part-time for me and most that work there. The job requires excellent focus on customer service and making sure to add sales.All but one associate are part-time and the hours are different week to week. I enjoy the interactions with our customers. That is the most pleasant part of the job for. me.
good,"Columbia is a great company to work for. I am a former freight supervisor at store 476 Edinburgh IN. The store manager was a trainwreck. The SM had no compassion, sat in the office 99% of the time, was clueless. Very high turnover due to her."
good,DC is a good place to work in almost in all senses. During the time you have opportunities for promotions through acquiring new skills. The only thing that is not ideal about the place is seasonal work. But this can be overcome if you prove that you are hard-worker.
good,"A good company to work for. You definitely work for your money but they could offer more for the employees that take on more responsibilities. A very repetitive job. Work load depends on how much the employees get done on both shifts so if your coworkers are competent, your weekends are yours."
good,"Great work culture, however slow moving and lack of responsibility that can lead to issues. Would recommend working here, there are some good changes happening and the company has a bright future."
good,"Fun and exciting place to work. Great perks with all the various brands. Low hourly rate, must be willing to work flexible schedule. Enjoyed the training platform and orientation. They set you up for success."
good,Average day was spent working on floor standards and replenishment. Received shipment nearly everyday. What I learned from this short experience was how to make use of all your free time. Outlet culture is very different than merchandising a smaller boutique and even the sheer volume of merchandise.
good,"I learned and loved working with different types of people every single day the pressure of performance and working full time was the only thing that I didn't agree with, however the supervisors and store managers were very grateful and understanding with all of their employees and their lives outside and inside of work."
good,"Retail is not for someone easily angered. Think the 80/20 rule: There are a lot of nice customers (80%), but the 20% that are not can really make your blood boil. You just need to find your mental niche so you can deal with it."
good,"It was really fun working at Columbia. The staff was upbeat, the store had a great energy and the store manager was awesome! Some days were really busy and some days were dead slow."
good,"Company was a mom and pop shop and remnants still remain, having brought in resources from outside the company progress is being made to make it comparable to other companies."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at Columbia.  Like most companies it has its ups and downs, but overall they are pretty good to the staff.  There are many company sponsored events and activities to bring the staff together."
good,The days are always easy. Just like any other job you will get the down times coupled with some hard days. At times the place gets dull and you get tired of seeing the same faces over and over again. You need to have a high tolerance for people.
good,"I liked working there, but the way I was laid off wasn't good.  They gave everyone in my department 15 minute warning to clean up our area and that they are shutting down our department and sign out to go home, that we were all being laid off."
good,"Come in check the playbook."
good,I tried my hand in retail selling items and processing shipment. I would spend a few hours processing shipment and organizing the stock room and then the rest of the day I would assist guests with any help I could provide them with. We ran a few company contests which were fun and produced some good results.
good,Great customer base and enjoyed all my accounts
good,Our wages should be much higher for the quality of work we achieve! Management had lots of favortisim! Coworkers we're ok! They would have pizza lunches and BBQ'S once a month to show they care about the staff!
good,"Although I worked as contract, this place is pretty good to work. Fast placed work but easygoing. There are coordinates everywhere to help you when things are not going your way. Good staff"
good,"A fair workplace. Not too difficult once you get used to the workload. Hardest part was dealing with rude customers. But, all in all, not a bad place."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Lots of company perks and discount and decent pay for a sales/stock associate for the area. Very relaxed atmosphere and genuinely good people and leadership within the company. Only complaint was a terrible sexist manager who has sense retired.
good,"Excessive hours, often worked 7 days a week during peak seasons. And pay scale was well below average for the work requirements. Very focused on efficiency numbers, and very fast paced. If your numbers are good your likely to get hired on permanent but everyone starts as temp to hire. But work culture is good as far as people go. Overall gave me the work experience that landed me where I am today so would recommend to someone just starting warehouse, but your selling yourself short if you stay because there are many companies offering much better pay for same requirements."
good,"The work environment is amazing and the people are mostly friendly and would go out of their way to interact with you. Columbia also offers facilities like a on campus cafe, gym and free fitness classes that also helps with networking while encouraging a healthy work to life balance. "
good,"Columbia, is a large company. But, the departments I worked in had a small family feel. There were other departments less friendly. I would recommend it a a good place to work."
good,"I worked at Columbia for just over three years and really enjoyed it. I was fortunate enough to work full time and received the benefits associated with full time. I wish I would have been paid more but the benefits I got were really great so it made up for it. I really enjoyed the culture of the company, it was laid back but very focused, if that makes any sense. I stayed really focused on my customer service skills but I also did a lot of work re arranging the clothes in the store. It was nice to be able to stay busy all the time. The hardest part of the job for me was doing the same thing all the time, I would have really liked to grow further in the company."
good,"Loved my coworkers and the environment. I was the stock associate and would take in shipment orders. We had lots of product to work on, and PODS located outside of our stock room for extra product that did not fit in the backroom. The employees were super nice, and very easy to get along with. There's always hours that are given out, but sometimes shifts are cut due to low traffic. Overall good vibes, and would highly recommend for college students or anyone looking for an in between job!"
good,Everything was simple and sweet. Work was a simple straight shot. Excitement filled the air sometimes with sales and pace. Beyond that very steady and predictable.
good,"Working for Columbia Sportswear at the outlets in Lehi was a high volume job, and requires high productivity, and leaves you always on your feet.  The products feature various technologies that are very specific depending on what usage it is for. It requires strong knowledge about the product, while also being able to maintain customer focus to ensure needs and wants are met.  Management was great, they expect employees to always be on their best behavior, and maintaining a strong customer focus.  Sometimes it is hard dealing with so many people at one time while trying to keep the store in good condition, but with hard work we are always successful, and remain one of the top Columbia stores in the country."
good,a competitive work environment to grow in sales and to better yourself in marketing. learned to gain relationships with customers to better ensure their shopping needs. customer service skills improved
good,"Good place to work day went by pretty fast, you also work 10 hours but get 3 days off. You get over time here and there no overwhelming overtime."
good,All you have to do is have great customer service and a good work ethic and this job will work out for you. Pay was decent and was a relatively easy job
good,"Columbia Sportswear was my first retail job. Everyone was really nice there, and they were willing to train and teach me things about retail. The managers were patient and always made things a learning experience rather than reprimanding you for a mistake. The associates and managers all got along, which made going to work a lot of fun."
good,"très bonne entente entre collègues, bon salaire, on nous donne la chance de connaître un nouveau métier, on nous forme"
good,Most work days are laid back and allow you to work freely and talk to customers making it easier to connect. Often times customers and upper managements changes would make tasks difficult.
good,"Though the environment could sometimes be fast-paced, more often than not, it was relaxed and carefree. My managers were also very flexible with my class schedule, which allowed me to focus more on my school assignments and commitments."
good,"The culture of the company is open, honest and collaborative. There are many people in management that really believe in the company and want the best for the employees and the company."
good,"Job is very strongly reliant on good numbers for efficient operation with ever improving conditions for employees, as well as improving the team work atmosphere."
good,"Great company!  Love working here, hard to take the new message of ""more with less"" at a higher efficiency and productivity rate.  Numerous times I had the opportunity to assume more responsibility but was difficult to excel, as the company didn't have a protocol in place for my situation, as growth was fast."
good,This is a good place to work just need more hours good people not really to many problems just not management can be annoying at times but not all the time.  .
good,The manager was one the nicest and knowledgeable person that I have ever worked for in my retail career.  I really liked the clothing and shoes/boots that we sold.  I have nothing bad to say about the company. I enjoyed the customers by talking to them and helping them find what they needed.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at Columbia Sportswear. My coworkers were very genuine as well as management, so that made it easy to work with them. I learned how to assist customers efficiently when they are trying to purchase merchandise. I hadn't worked retail before, so it was a great learning experience. The hardest part of the job was whenever customers were rude. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people as well as becoming familiar with Columbia Sportswear's products."
good,"Columbia Sportswear is where you go to if you were in desperate need of a job, other than that you are better off searching else where. I worked at their woodbridge va location for about a year it started off great but thing quickly went south. Management was clueless on how the store should of been operated, there was a lot of bickering between Store management, and obvious favoritism by management as well. Like i said in the beginning if this is your last resort then by all means take it, but if this is just an option then skip it and look else where."
good,"Work  some what slow and uneventful."
good,I love working here. The people are great and easy to get along with. I love meeting all the people that come through the store and the stories they tell.
good,"The slow days were the hardest times at this store. Also, making room for suggestions from the management team and crew were not available or taken into consideration. As far as that the benefits were above average. The discounts on products and selection was very pleasing. The most enjoyable part was the customers that came into the store with very unique stories about travel."
good,it was fun there i didnt experience much i worked seasonal but i also wasnt into outdoor stuff that much so i didnt enjoy the work itself if was just a job to me but the make and sale great products and always there to work with a customer!
good,"Job is layed back with lots of friendly staff, the company takes care of their employees really well. flexible work schedule. great atmosphere. amazing discounts."
good,"Pick up after customers because they can be very messy. Clean out fitting rooms to ensure cleanliness. During the holidays the store will be very messy so shifts will go fast because you will be constantly busy."
good,The work load is generally easy. The work is extremely repetitive and requires little knowledge of computers to be able to do all the job functions. Done
good,"I work on a remote based team, I have the flexibility to work from home often.  My manager trust me and knows that I am capable of doing my job successfully.  I'm given the freedom to do my job and have a great team to fall back on when I need support."
good,"Store Manager is hard to work with and doesn't know what shes doing half the time. "
good,I enjoyed working for Columbia very much.  The company itself is organized in a great way and provides many incentives for its employees.  The warehouse is constantly striving to meet new goals so hours are usually guaranteed.
good,The IS  side is going through some fairly exciting changes and challenges as an organization. A lot of off-shoring is happening which may / may not prove to be beneficial. Too much reliance on a single off=shore company
good,I really enjoyed my time here. I started off liking everyone I worked with then the store manager hired other management that weren’t qualified to be management but they were her friends and family friends. However I did enjoy everything but that.
good,"In a typical day I would conduct a pre-shift meeting with the team.  I would cover the tasks for the day, safety and anything relevant that needed to be communicated.  The team would ensure that the correct parcel would be placed in the correct location to be shipped.  I would take care of any safety, quality issues that would arise.  At the end of the shift I would close all loads of trucks that have picked up their orders.  The workplace culture is a team environment with many team building activities such as ping pong tournaments, pizza lunch, corporate challenge etc.  It was a really great place to have the pleasure of working for."
good,"Its a team effort for the most part, but I am sure there are managers that focus on themselves and not the team."
good,"Columbia is a great retail job to have. It's the longest job I've had. Everyone likes to work together as a team and usually gets along. A typical day at work is processing, helping customers, and straightening the store."
good,Good Company to work at. We worked many hours. They cared about the workers. Very respectful when it came to my religious beliefs. Very understanding.
good,Fast paced environment with a multi-cultural clientele. Language barrier is the most difficult part of the job. Daily tasks vary allowing for constant engagement in workplace. Enjoy learning new aspects of the job including new selling techniques and meeting a diverse group of people every day.
good,Great place to work!  Great work life balance and great people! Company cares about employees and values them! Hard to leave but was relocating.
good,"Typical days at work were fast paced, 11-hour swing shifts. I learned how to handle clothes through a various assortment of activities. Management pushed people to strive for their best effort, but people are laid off more than the usual workplace. Co-workers are enlightening to the day's workflow. The hardest part of the job was working in the Summer heat, especially since there was no AC or fans in the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was attaining newly acquired skills when it comes to handling clothing in bulk."
good,"It is a mall store so the customers can be a little frustrating.  The management makes it fun on most days. It is retail so the hours are not great and we have to be open on all holidays, including Christmas."
good,"Great place to work. Daily work included troubleshooting technical issues. Customer Service and system and other hardware management. I learned a great deal about SAP, Warehouse management systems."
good,"It's a warehouse, so of course it's going to be productive. I'm a pretty skinny girl, with very little muscle mass, but the work is easy enough to where I can do what the guys do. Carrying 30+ lb boxes, pushing carts full of product, running from one side of the warehouse to the other, it's a workout. While I don't appreciate waking up at 4:30 in the morning, every morning, my co-workers make it worth it. Everyone is friendly enough and they'll help you get through the day."
good,"Columbia is a very enjoyable company to work for. The company itself hold very strong values and is always getting employees involved in what can we do matters. Management is a strong leader for the stores themselves, with team work and constant learning. "
good,a typical day at work
good,Overall this is a typical retail job. you typically get about 30 hours a week . the managers are great but the supervisors and leads take their jobs more seriously than the managers
good,"On a daily basis my job duties range from working in the back stock area to performing on the sales floor. While in the back, processing product from shipments, maintaining a very organized stock room, keeping inventory and prices up to date. Duties on the sales floor differ in that I act as a cashier, also return cashier and overrides for other associates. Among other responsibilities, I provide great customer service which has been recognized as both employee of the month as well as for the west coast district of Columbia sportswear stores; and Very high ratings on customer secret shops. I am lucky to have a great environment with support from the management team, with open lines of communication that keep the store running smoothly. One of the most challenging parts of my job is balancing myself between objectives in the stock room and those on the sales floor."
good,"I enjoy working at Columbia more than I’ve ever enjoyed anywhere else! For the most part, everyone is caring and kind, though sometimes some members management can be unprofessional when emotions run high."
good,"I appreciated working in a new contact center during a growth period and through organizational change. However, once the objectives shifted to production it became a daily grind. Much as the company emphasized work-life balance, the customer contact environment was no more than KPIs and metrics."
good,overall a great work eviorment and people will help you to succeed and its good pay very diverse and full of different people its a nice place to work
good,"j'ai aimée travailler pour columbia"
good,"Management good to work with very supportive, would like to work there again when they have an opening for a part-time cashier. Busy schedule. The company is willing to work with you on scheduling."
good,Overall it was a great work environment. There were two store manager changes while I worked there. My reason for leaving was due to another job opportunity.
good,I love this job it was really good I had to work from 7/330 durning the week I would ship clothing to the store I work in the wearhouse send sweaters t-shirt socks and had to label them price them it was a good place
good,The job consists of your regular retail hours and demands. It is a fun product to sell being out doors equipment. It is a big store and the environment is friendly. The store usually has steady traffic so you will not get bored.
good,I loved working with Columbia Sportswear once I got the hang of there system. I helped lots of Customers with there needs and made lots of friends well working with the company and have good discounts at the stores.
good,This company gave me a great start to my career.  With a well known name it opened many doors that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise get in.  Very grateful for the training and support the company provided.
good,"Really did, was fun company, loved it, every work day was fun, even though its tedious to deal with customers, just wish they paid more on average for regular employee's."
good,"Excellent place to work part-time, especially for college students, or those needing a second job. Company culture is very relaxed, yet emphasizes professionalism & learning. Advancement opportunities are open to everyone. I like that everyone gets briefed at the beginning of their shift, so they know what's going on as far as daily goals, get company news, and is encouraged to ask questions, so there are no surprises. While it's an overall relaxed culture, it can be very fast-paced, and is very customer-oriented. I personally don't find this job difficult to do, but you will work. There is no standing around doing nothing - there will always be something to do. What I like about my particular location is that management is ALWAYS willing to help, and is positively engaged in the training and performance of their employees."
good,"It was the most enjoyable and satisfying job I have ever had, for the time worked there. Very understanding about family life and promotes tat culture."
good,"Every where I worked I always put my self in a situation to learn and grow every day, I might even from a customer or a simply kid g walk in to the store. Management at a work place is every one responsibility for example if you a task to do and you complete it that mean you manage task very well. Being in an environment with multi culture is very fun and other things that might beneficial later on in life.  For me I don't think doing something every day has a part in it that is just my opinion. the most enjoyable part of my previous job was the smile, helping others, the laugh with my coworkers."
good,"A typical day of work was ,e calling in sick. The most enjoyable part of working there was the rush 5 minutes before the shift was over. Management was coool"
good,"There is no typical day at work,"
good,Great benefits to working at Columbia along with a great product! Sells itself and relaxed atmosphere...management training was none existent for me and had to work off past experiences
good,"My time at Columbia was one i didnt expect to have, at first it was diffrerent environment. i had never worked in retail before but im glad this was my first place. There are good days and bad days but there were way more good days. There were times when you would have nothing to do. and then you would be so busy the next it made the day go by fast. The people i worked with were amazing and friendly and i miss working there today. Columbia is a good place to work."
good,"The job is fun, but the customers are difficult from time to time just like any other retail store. The managment is great and they dont overwork you."
good,"As far as retail goes, it has been the best so far. It definitely promotes a more positive, less competitive  environment than past ones. However, corporations are corporations and it stills harbors some of the same negative qualities as the worst of them."
good,"cashier job is very easy and very fun to work there, good manager and best co-workers. its a customer service job so get to talk to all kind of people all over the world."
good,"-Great Culture and day to day job is good if you enjoy what you do.."
good,"just stand by box line, grab a box, put it on your table, take the clothes out, put hangers inside clothes, tape the box, and put it back on the line. and do the same thing over and over again all day"
good,Working at Columbia is fun. Co workers are great and so is management. The hard part of working is when there isn't a high volume of customers and we have to make our goal.
good,"Columbia Sportswear is an excellent company to work for.  They obviously are leaders in the outdoor industry, but more importantly they take care of their people.  As long as you are getting your job done at the highest level possible, they allow you to do it your way and don't put too many restrictions on you.  They really let you grow professionally and individually in your own way."
good,"review the prvious days KPI's"
good,"I was able to do a bunch of different jobs within the company. My daily work was different daily depending on the demands of the overall warehouse. I have been able to learn lots with Columbia and will continue to learn lots. The co-workers are nice to work with. The hardest part of the job is sometimes it gets physically tiring especially during the hot summer months when we work long hours. The best part about my job is that it's straight days, so that means I can spend time with my family and take my kids to there activities during the evening."
good,The company strives to create a work/life balance that is unparalleled. Generous paid time off and the workday is enjoyable.
good,this was my first employer and the environment was fun happy paced and the staff would work with me on anything i needed to know
good,A productive job to work. Vey busy in the fall time. No time for family etc. Work comes first. Freindly atmosphere with great management. Many willing workers to go above and beyond to make production deadlines. Sometimes it is unclear which areas need the most attention to meet production goals. The employees make the best of the job. very friendly and are willing to lend a helping hand.
good,"Awesome benefits! PTO, plus holidays. Great health insurance for the price. It's a lot of work, but makes you feel accomplished at the end of the day."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, management, and upper management overall. I learned a great deal management wise. I wish my district manager was more in touch with the store than every couple to few months. The hardest part of the job was furnishing competitor products for the customers that enter Columbia Sportswear expecting a department store. The most enjoyable was meeting local families, athletes, foreign clientele, beginner to experienced fisherman, and outfitting people for adventures. I would work for the company again if certain things were to change, but for right now I've made the correct career-move."
good,"L'avantage est la diversité des nationalité qui nous permet d'apprendre tous les jours et d'apprécier chaque personne. Les collaborateurs sont très social et ouvert d'esprit. Nous sommes très autonome, il y a pas mal de communication sur le groupe et les objectifs. En ce moment les possibilités de promotion sont rares au vue de la situation économique."
good,I loved working for Columbia! The discounts were great and the staff was nice! My managers all cared about my well being. Wouldn’t have paid well enough or been enough hours to make it my career job but I loved the people I worked for.
good,"Management provided a comfortable stream for us to learn, feel safe and be heard.  "
good,I'm a contractor at columbia but you'd never know I was Amy different than their salaried employees. It's a great environment to work in. Lots of opportunities to grow and contribute to the team.
good,Loved this company would have stayed with them if I had better leaders when 1st trained. Great company for advancement if you put in the had work. It's like being with your family in the store but higher up managment doesn't really care about you.
good,"It all depends on your boss. If the boss is good, then it will be pleasant to work. Because the work itself does not make you tense. If the boss is not a very nice person, then at work there will often be scandals and you will have to be nervous."
good,"Columbia is a good place to work, it just wasn’t the place for me. If you can handle fast paced, and doing the same thing over and over again Columbia is perfect for you."
good,"When I was hired on, the store was hiring 3 new members of the management team. Myself being one of them, but everyone was nice and was welcoming. The store manager at that time was very understanding and showed a willingness to teach me the ropes of what was needed of me in my role. He did that with every member of the team management or associate."
good,The only bad thing about the job is dealing with the customers and pressure from corporate to implement enough techniques to keep sales on target. Management always reasonable and friendly. They hope you push you to succeed.
good,"The managers were very organized and cared about their employees. The hours were reasonable and there was always something to do around the store. The pay was also reasonable, with raises every year and bonuses on good months."
good,"I was an intern at Columbia for their ecommerce division and I appreciated the culture, fun during the summer time, workers are all nice and easy going and the volleyball during the summer internship was great"
good,until the eu management team changed that is. when this happened all help broke loose - wrong product wrong marketing etc etc. its was quite sad to see the change.
good,"Very boxy and organized. So leaves very little ""room to roam"" in the sense of employee incentives, training techniques or strategies. Although I very clearly understand why, I feel the leash is very short from the out of store management to the in store management. Benefits are great! in store culture is great! teamwork is great!"
good,"a typical day of work was opening all the system set the goals for the day, organize and sort the employees during the day in their areas, complete tasks as the manager opening mid or closing."
good,Overall Columbia has been very kind and nice about my flexibility with my hours. Being a full time college student they worked with me and asked if I needed anything.
good,"I enjoyed working at Columbia you got to meet a lot of different people with a lot of different needs.  The manager was excellent to work for she encourage me to  do things that I have never done on a job before, to organizing the back room so it would run a little more efficient for the other sales clerks."
good,"The job was fun."
good,"Columbia Sportswear is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits along with discounts. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Colombia Sportswear, management was amazing and encouraging. My team was also positive and a great group of people. Things were clean,organized and ran smoothly."
good,"The company has culture of improvement, strive for the best. Colleagues are cooperative towards the company targets. It's a great company to work for."
good,"Busy location beside YVR airport; lots of tourist and local customers. overall a good company to work for; well known, good quality, and valued products."
good,"We accomplished amazing bleeding edge technologies all virtualized in private cloud. Many hundreds of database servers, thousands of databases, reports, etl, while always working for automation and work life balance."
good,"Learned alot about the products, and also alot about the company."
good,"It had a college atmosphere, only I was there to work and got paid.  Employees worked hard and the company provided a fun atmosphere for its employees. "
good,"The best retail job I have had. the company really focus' on employee knowledge of the product which helps sales. we were a new store so you really have to educate the customer. "
good,I think that working at Columbia is a good opportunity for a person who is wanted to be a part of the eccommerce world. The schedules are flexibile and there is room for growth there
good,It was alright but do not do a contract position for the call center job in Hillsboro. The managers play favorites and if they don't like you do not expect to enjoy it there.
good,Everyday I work mostly in the same department and I help those around me to find items in the store or find those that are not. I organize my working space to help my coworkers.
good,"Trabalhei 4 anos com esta empresa. "
good,"Great  place to innovate and work . People are empowered to work . "
good,I liked being able to connect and help customers on a personal level. The only thing that caused me to leave was that my sales output wasn't matched with bonuses or commission and I couldn't afford to live on just their base salary
good,Had the best time of my life working for this company. I learned and a enjoyed every bit of time there. Managers are super and Business clients are awesome! Would love to go back there anytime.
good,"I worked remotely in my midwest territory.  I had a 4 state territory with over 100+ customers traveling every other week within in my territory.  We had 3 selling seasons with over 1,000+ SKUs each season so I worked very had keeping organized and working efficiently with my time.  Columbia has a great culture of support for their employees providing us with all the tools needed to be successful at our jobs.  My favorite portion of my job was making line presentations to customers and building seasonal assortments for all my customers.  I also strived to provide the best customer service and merchandising strategies for my customers throughout my territory."
good,Great environment to work in. People there are incredibly fun to work with and be around. Managers keep the workplace incredibly productive. Lovely place to work.
good,"While I was working at Columbia the general manager was very rowdy & rude & made what should've been the best job ever into an environment where it was simply just draining to be in. However I'm sure under new management things have changed. Always a busy environment, commission based incentives. Positive attitude all around from other co workers and managers. Supportive environment. Hardest part of the job is selling the merchandise which is not hard at all. most enjoyable part of the job was receiving the commission check on top of the standard hourly pay rate."
good,I enjoyed managing a group of individuals that showed responsibility and leadership. We always met our quota with determination and our team was admin about our store goals.
good,"This is a fantastic organization to work for and i would recommend it to anyone. A very large company, but each department has a small cozy company feel."
good,"Working at Columbia in the Mall of America was a great sales environment.  Arguably one of the busiest malls in America, there was always customers to serve and interact with.  Those I worked with were fantastic as well.  They made going to work enjoyable, something that is hard to find in a retail job due to the nature of the industry."
good,Great place to work if you are in school and need a part-time job. They are a family owned company and they are big on teamwork and make you feel like you are a part of the family.
good,"Equipe dynamique et soudée"
good,drove standing forklift all day picked orders and put orders up. Liked it but my contract was up! good environment good people good management good workplace culture
good,"I enjoyed working here, the employees were all understanding and hardworking. The teamwork was great. The leadership and management are also great and don't shun the workers."
good,"I worked at columbia sportswear when I graduated highschool. I believe it's normal standards when it comes to retail stores, having product knowledge was also a requirement. Other than that, job was fairly easy"
good,"Everyone on the team is young spirited and energetic, hard workers able to meet sales goals, and finish tasks on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people as you work on the sales floor, and in stock room one of the benefits of lifting boxes everyday is you get a nice workout from it."
good,Relaxed work place with a lot of good people and easy place to feel comfortable quickly when starting in a new work place.
good,Columbia Sportswear is a really good place to be at.  Everybody was always friendly and wants to help.
good,Worked 9-5 shifts generally. Sold all sorts of different products to wide variety of consumers. I learned how to communicate and help people find what they need. I learned the value of costumer service. I learned how a little act of service can go a long ways. Our work environment was like family to us. The hardest part of the job was having to be on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part was interaction with customers and fellow co-workers.
good,Columbia was a fun motivating place to work. The store was always busy with a lot of loyal customers. The brand sold itself by being durable and innovative. The hardest part of my job was leaving it to move to a place that they did not have a store. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers that it attracted and the employees that truly loved to work where they shopped.

good,A typical day at work would be cleaning the shopping area while asking customers if they need help finding anything and providing the best customer service possible. I learned a lot about people working at Columbia because we encounter different personalities everyday and communication is key to a successful life. The hardest part of the job is everyone minding their own business. It seems as if everyone at work has a need to know everything about everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job is having such a relaxed atmosphere that I am comfortable to be in but also professional. 
good,"This was my first job and i loved it so much, unfortunately it was seasonal but my manager was extraordinary and my co-workers were a joy. i wanted to go to work on my days off!!"

good,I worked for Columbia Sportswear and it was an okay place. Everything was VERY strict but people had good hearts. You couldn't have your phone on you and it made me kind of uncomfortable because my family is prone to emergencies and there were a few times where I couldn't get to the phone when I needed to. The place was always FREEZING cold and you could never stand still. I do recommend this place to those who love the outdoors and can handle such strict management.
good,"Great place to work just need better structure and discipline. The place didn't have it's checks n balances employees hanging out with managers,favoritism and misconduct too often"
good,"good work life balance, very hands on role. The bets pat of the job is the people I work with. The worst part of the job is poor management with no experience in the filed they manage. They cannot be a support system to their team at all as they do not know what we do, how we do it, or why."

good,As a store our goals was to have a good communication with our costumers and make sure they got what they need. The management its okay I did not have to deal with anything except picking some mails from them. The hardest part of the job was focusing on fixing clothes and the enjoyable part was to have interaction with different cultures.

good,"good environment"

We all act as an extension of each other like a well-oiled machine is the way we all work at Columbia Sportswear Empire Outlet, Staten Island, NY"
good,"Good company culture, great co-workers, but the company goes through periodic upheavals that can be stressful.  Advancement is slow or non-existent except for the most driven employees.  Recognition of success does not automatically mean you will be considered for advancement."
good,I love that every day is different.  I like the fast pace environment and also enjoy when we get those nice slow days.  I have learned so much about myself and my management style and really feel that i have grown so much since starting with Columbia.

good,I had a lot of fun at the Columbia branch and got the opportunity to learn lots of cool facts about the products. I was also able to get to understand how the whole processing system works. From when they get the product to when they sensor it and put it out onto the floor for customers to buy.
good,"Great group of people all striving towards common goals. You can build strong working relationships and friendships at Columbia. The only disconnect in my personal opinion was end-user/consumer requirements vs. technical goals never seemed to align. Not vetting out technologies with business goals. Following the latest IT trend... and no data or technology alignment. But hey, partios were successful!!"

good,"Columbia has a spectacular code of ethics and company lifestyle.  I enjoyed working for them and learning about the company. I felt at ""home"" when I was with the company and felt like they really cared about me and helping me grow and progress in the company."
good,"Ok so if it's a part time or fill time job you are looking for in retail this is the one you want.   Working in so many capacities, in so many various companies, hands down this is the best.   I can't say if it's the diverse group of Co - workers, the great management team, or at the end of the hard day the great pay (hourly plus realistic potential bonus every month) but Columbia is one of those down to earth true to word amazing companies to work for.  I work full time at another job about 55 hours a week and they work around my schedule perfectly.   My work life balance is higher tolerance than most and they keep me in check and put my needs first!   The discount is not only for you but 20 friends and family members and the customers are great and love being in adventure filled outdoor places.  Maybe one day I will only have one job and when that day comes I'm pretty sure it will be Columbia Sportswear."
good,"On typical work days it was very fast paced fun , but most mostly exciting . I did cashier ,  fitting room service , go backs , customer service , suggestive selling , recovery and merchandising. I loved working here because it was my first job ever and it was so wonderful . I learned about different technologies that were totally awesome (: Omni freeze , Omni heat and so much more . It was a clothing store for winter and summer accessories for snowboarding , staying cool in the summer , and skiing. Management was absolutely great I loved them , very nice , sweet , and so caring . My co workers were pretty awesome I couldn't complain . We hung out at nights going bowling , having drinks etc. Nothing was hard about the job at all . Pretty laid back never had any bad customers my whole year and a half working there. Most Enjoyable part was helping customers determine there needs so that they can go home happy ."
good,"I would get to work and clock in, after that I would go to the main office and get my ""Gladiator"" wrist scanning device, and Mic, so i could communicate with the office in the warehouse. I would then go up to my section of the warehouse that was located on the third floor, and pull boxes off the conveyor belt, I would find a place for the boxes on the shelves and scan the box and what shelf I put the box on into my gladiator. When I finished with that I would check my gladiator scanning device to see what boxes need to go on the conveyor belt down to shipping, find the boxes, scan them to let the office know they were on their way, place them on my cart. As soon as my cart was filled I would quickly take the cart to the conveyor belt, and unload the boxes onto the outbound line. If I finished doing all of that and had nothing else to do I would use my mic to ask if where I should start cycle counting, they would tell me where in the warehouse they wanted me to start and I would go there, set my gladiator scanner to cycle count and begin scanning the boxes and what shelves they were on, in order, so the office could get a accurate display of where the boxes are located."

good,"J'étais heureuse de motiver l'équipe dès le matin. Nous entretenions d'excellentes relations."
good,"A great job. Friendly people to work with. The managers know their stuff, and everyone else is extremely kind and they are happy to answer any questions you have. It's relaxing because they are extremely helpful. I've learned a lot about customer service, and what it's like to work in retail: not easy. I learned that it's harder work than I imagined. The hardest part would be dealing with customers who can never be happy. Just try to do everything you can to make them happy, and if it doesn't work, get a manager and they'll take care of it. The most enjoyable is knowing that I can go to work and know that I'll like anyone that I work with, because everyone there is awesome."
good,"Come work for CSC!! It provides an ideal work life balance. There are great summer events, and a fabulous volleyball season."
good,I love working with the people there and also meeting new people.
