bad,"This company itself is a great company to work for. However, this Service Center was completely understaffed, the Manager would constantly degrade my male coworker. He was very uncomfortably chummy with the female Account Manager. It was very poorly run and for having only 4 employees at this service center it was the most drama I've ever dealt with. It was pretty much 2 people seeking the managers approval soooo much that it just became a tattle tale game of who did what so they could make themselves look better! The manager was constantly upset and loved to hear himself talk so we would end up having at least 1 meeting a day and it would last anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours or more. Often where he was screaming at the top of his lungs and degrading another emloyee in front of everyone else. I witnessed him take a phone and bust it completely in half, walk by a tall filing cabinet out in the warehouse and unexpectly punch it because he was so angry. The last day I was there the Manager and 2 other employees called me in the office and accused me of tattling on them about the drama there to the SAP trainers that were at the service center that week. The only reason those trainers knew anything was because we were in hostile meetings every day while they had to wait in the break room until we were ready to be trained. Right before I made the decision to leave I finally stood up for myself which led to him standing over me sitting in my chair, slammed his hand on my desk, called me stupid and told me to shut up. Best decision I've ever made to get up and walk out of that place!"
bad,"The account manager (salesman) gets the biggest piece of the bonus money pie, so you can't really earn a bonus check for doing your job. Upper management doesn't do anything to the saleman even though everyone complained the salesman is the primary cause of our sales growth not growing."
bad,"Absolutely no training with their new SAP program, no leadership whatsoever in the company! Very unorganized, treated employees like 3rd class citizens. Interview was absolutely not what the job description represents."
bad,My hiring was great the after that it went down hill they want you to learn every position in the warehouse no problem with that if yur paying me to be a shipping clerk receiving clerk do putaway and etc for a 30 cents raise per year have fun guys.
bad,"This company is a horror. How this company continues to post net gain is a mystery ? The branch staff's are over worked and under paided. The field staff are treated with disdain and suspicion. This company is a work in progress towards an unraveling. They cook the numbers from the top down or the top up. I can't really be sure. If I were a buyer. It would be as a short. As a perspective employee ? Under no circumstances would I say yes to any offer. In the movie 2001 the tag line was ( something wonderful is going to happen ). As to Applied Industrial Technologies ?? Please believe me.. Something horrible is going to happen. The only way this mess can be fixed is to sell the company based on it's good will asset value to Grainger. They have SAP integration and can asymilate the customer base quickly. Otherwise----abandon ship !!! Reef ahead, helm is down, we have lost steering control..!!! WHAT A HORROR.. How can any leader drive a 3 billion dollar revenue stream into the rocks ????"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"They are always very short-staffed and they pretend you get everything done. but they keep firing people. Overtime is always mandatory. You call off and they hunt you down salary is just 11/HR. You call off and they automatically cover the day using your vacation time without letting you know. You get no life in here. Supervising is perseption based, so if you take a quick minute to stretch they eill think you have done anything in the whole day. Favoritism and they always side with people that has been there longer than you and im talking about over 20 years. Dont recomend at all."
bad,"I worked in Fairmont, WV. Management was terrible. Biased treatment of workers, always had an attitude. Not a good place to work at all."
bad,"Fought with the computer system all day, phones were poor and the training was next to not there. You had to learn on your own and they expected me to just answer the phone and I had no knowledge of the products that were sold."
bad,"Training sucked, management really sucked (GM) that is if you could call him that. The guy didn't have a clue as to what was going on the branch manager did everything including hiring buddies that were favored non-stop which included playing golf on Tuesdays while the rest of the staff was left behind to carry to the workload!"
bad,"Not sure where to start... The manager was HORRIBLE and there just wasn't any company ""culture"". There's no employee stock purchase plan and the 401(k) is mediocre, at best. Basically as a ""Customer Service Sales Rep"", you're a customer service agent. There's no sales involved, don't fool yourself. You enter fax orders, email orders and help customers at the counter. ZERO training on the products. Good luck finding a bearing or belt when you have no idea what you're looking at. I'd always just refer the customer to a competitor. Secretly I enjoyed that. My location was AGONIZINGLY SLOOOOOOW. I'm really amazed it's even open as they really only had two account that paid the bills - lose one and it's lights out, literally. The guy I worked with was super cool, he's the only reason I enjoyed working there. The manager was something else - no sales ability and openly cussed and tried to manager by intimidation. I've never seen anything like it. I worked as a temp and would've turned down an ""opportunity"" to work there permanently. I saw no room for career growth whatsoever, nor would I want to. It's just a job and a place to work.  I can't say I approve of the CEO as the only communication was a generic ""Here's to a great 2019!!"" end of year email. I don't even know his/her name? That tells you something right there. HUGE red flag about company culture."
bad,"A typical day involved issues with SAP, Vendors, Employees, and/or management. They hire many people without any education. So, ignorance is common place. The corporate culture is brutal. I witnessed racism, discrimination, people smoking marijuana on the job, etc. Horrible place to week. Week one, I knew I made a mistake working for this company. 7 months later, nothing has changed."
bad,"if I give a true and accurate review I will be retaliated against, so I will submit one once I find a new job.  This should really be all you need to know about this company."
bad,They will bring you into the company and tell you a thousand promises that will never come true. The culture of the company on any level of employment is to fire employees to boost the numbers with that thinking they can just rehire someone cheaper a month later.
bad,In my time I observed several upper management issues and more than one ethics violation. Pay is not inline with positions at similar companies. Healthcare benefits are good. Their software is far less efficient than their competitors.
bad,pay increases are once a year and no more than 3% .
bad,"Pay is horrible.least paying company for all that is done for them. "
bad,"Great environment as far as the company goes, but training was not effective enough for what the company needs. Communication was not as strong between associates and other departments. Unprofessional behavior from associates and within management."
bad,"Typical large corporation who tries to usurp Canadian labor laws, this company needs a lesson in the difference between the truth and fabrication, the employment standards act and a good dose of reality!"
bad,A productive day at work by taking care of all of your customers and still maintaining a profitable GP for your branch location.
bad,"Long process to higher 30 days. Good service center to work for when good managers are in place, don’t take medical leave, HR is very slick in how they do things.( Don’t trust them ) I was a single person at a service center for approx 9 months doing sales, cssr work , warehouse work, manager work, delivery driver, and nothing is ever good enough always wanting more from you. Branlocation. ch managers oversee more than one"
bad,"Normally when a large company buys a smaller one it's a good thing.  NOT so with AIT.  Overtime is payed over 40 hrs not over 8.  Take PTO and OT is gone.  Payroll is a joke, many pay errors occur.  We have to use our personal phones for the time clock, pay stub and many work related tasks with only a certain few that get compensated.  Do not accept employment from thus company."
bad,Location I worked at had great people. Upper management made terrible decisions. Instead of taking care of your major customers they focused way to much on brining in way to many small fish. Major customers became agitated and bought less. Not a very good business model set in place. Compensation for the work you do it no where near what it should be.
bad,Working at the branch level you only had 2 office positions (besides clerical) Customer Service and Outside Sales. There was no growth potential and the base pay was really low. Raises were hard to come by.
bad,"The job itself can be very easy, however it can also be extremely difficult,  stressful, and sometimes overbearing. Within the first 10 minutes of my very first day, I was given the keys to the building and that kind if raised a red flag right away. The people are nice to work with, but over all the pay doesn't match the work ethic they want."
bad,"It can be a great job at times, super fast paced. Very infrequent pay grade increases so it's not a job you want to make a career out of. However, it is an excellent job for a student or young adult."
bad,Long days starting at about 7 AM and working most days until 7 or 8 at night. Working 6 to 7 days a week.
bad,"The issue I had at this company were that they would offer a full-time job to a person and then take it away. That they only offered to non-ethnic person. The company had the feel that the ethnic persons were on a lower level and therefore did not deserve to be giving the opportunity to be a full time employee. If you are non-ethnic then you have room to advance. Also, for those that are in the age range of 40's and up you will be train by someone is under 21 years old and they will be your manager."
bad,"Typical day was spent processing orders, quotes, creating PO's, talking to customers at the sales counter and working on any delegated projects."
bad,Very micro managed. Very little sales training or mentoring offered. Expected to make unrealistic sales calls with little or no training. They hire bodies not seasoned employees.
bad,mismanaged company ran by a bunch of low cost high profit pigs who cannot keep employees around long enough to train them. low wage as standard pay with no room for advancement or bonuses
bad,"Management controls everything. You have no flexibility when working with customers. They try to claim that they support their employees, but will release them as soon as they have to miss work for illnesses."
bad,Coworkers are great. The enviroment is very stressful as an account manager.  I came from a competitor and realized that the promotion wasn't worth leaving a far superior work enviroment.
bad,I liked the people I worked with but the low pay combined with overall poor leadership from managment led to an undesirable work environment. I do believe they pay more than when I started so if your looking for work it's worth a shot it just wasn't for me
bad,"No growth, no open door policy. Current manager is lazy and hands tasks off to others to do. Allows contention amoung employees. Allows people to waste time by making lots of personal calls and no one wants to help the warehouse/ driver get there tasks done so they are ready to make deliveries the following day. The warehouse is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter because the heaters are not adequate for the square footage. If the manager likes you you have it made. I was cussed at,talked to like a dog and always tried to make suggestions to make things better but forget it they dont care. Dont waste your time with this sales center. I had over 30 years experience and they failed to see my talent and what I could have really done for them. Oh well there loss."
bad,Good Work / life balance. not much of challenges. Average Compensation and benefits. Need more architect level guys to decide processes and benefits of them in IT.
bad,"You will never be bored at Applied.  They dump a lot of working on you and its impossible to complete the work for that day of business.  You have to clean the office and bathroom.  In the winter you shovel the snow on the sidewalk in front of building.  They have people that have all the requirements for the job, but if they can’t pass their personality test your out of the running.  Someone may like this kind of job but it wasn’t for me.  Management at the branch are very nice and understanding and they understand that it’s very stressful but their hands are tied as corporate has control of the hiring process. They do have a lot of trading on their system but I never got the chance to really go over it unless I did it at home on my own time."
bad,Mixed Review about the company culture. I am not sure which direction they are headed. Training is poor. Lack of commitment to business. I am not sure how I feel.
bad,This company lacks innovation.  Easy job with little pay.  Older system/website make it challenging to excel in very competitive industry.  LIttle room for growth.
bad,"Was with Applied for over one year as a sales and service rep. Great entry level position to build experience in sales and customer service. The company overall is pretty good with several great benefits and learning experiences. "
good,"The job was great, "
good,Didn't expect to leave the company until management had turnover issues and promotion wasn't handed down. Large corporation that's only as good as the local management.
good,Very laid-back a slow pace.. I had a nice new equipment a nice launch area and a small area the restaurant is pretty clean the parking lot with a nice size
good,"Dixie Bearing was a great company but it went public , all the management is there to keep the stock holder's happy,  the service centers are under staffed , "
good,Too many projects with deployment dates that are difficult to meet due to limited resources.  Lots of turn over. The rules and guidelines change daily.
good,"Liked the people I worked with but no support from upper management. A typical day is answering the phones, waiting on customers at the counter. Quoting customers pricing and delivery."
good,Decent company to work for.  The upper managemenf is disengaged from the service centers.  Many employees are lazy and their model is hurting them. They just laid off many employees.
good,"Handling GE as primary account excluded me from ""core"" business, and products handled were exclusive to that customer. Very little in the way of management since customer is located in Hungary and ended work day at 10am our time."
good,"Nationally Applied is in a position to dominate in  its space. In Chicago and the surrounding area they have a struggle on their hands as competitive forces tend to have a deleterious affect on the quality of the decision making process. "
good,When the CEO changed the company changed for the worse. He drove his most knowledgeable salesmen out opening the door for the competition. This caused year after year cuts which forced more knowledge from the company. You felt like family going to work prior to that then it started going down hill.
good,"More work than one person can handle alone."
good,Was hired as outside sales for drilling rigs.  Driver was fired and I was replaced as delivered and sales but was left with no real time as sales anymore.  I eventually left as I couldn't do my job and it was no longer of benefit to me to stay.
good,"management truly care about employees, if you have a problem they are more than happy to help you figure it out. The company should have a better training program. overall a good company."
good,"A typical day at work includes many tasks to accomplish. I learned a lot about efficiency and how to communicate and get work done as a team. I also like the heavy lifting part of the job here, I like to be challenged day by day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the way they work around schedules easily."
good,The BGC is a good place. The staff and management who took over were not in their positions for the right reason in my opinion.
good,Extensive sales territory with lot's of travel time.  Company was down sized with several lay offs.
good,"Overall, AIT is a good company with a customer oriented atmosphere.  Its a call center environment providing service that seeks to keep customers running and shorten down time. "
good,Une entreprise qui éprouve des difficultés a joindre les deux bout mais les employé en péril à chaque jours
good,Corp.HQ. doesn't even pretend to care about the employee anymore. Restructured the raise system and some people would make less the the year before. Upside is show up and put forth a decent effort and you don't get hassled.
good,I gained a lot of knowledge with Applied in the rock and aggregate along with food accounts. The hardest part of the job was Applied didn't treat the inside and outside personnel like they should.
good,they are all about sales and profits.   they have such a huge product line that it is very hard to learn products.  they watch the margins on every item sold.
good,I have nothing to say. There are good things and not so good things (like anywhere) but I am thankful to have a job. I don't think it is appropriate to write a review at this time.
good,"At the time, they had opened branches in a very competitive market without doing any planning or market analysis to find out if there services were needed."
good,Working at Applied was an experience. The company as a whole is fantastic. Personal collisions with my branch manager made it unbearable to work at.
good,I started as an inside sales rep. and was quickly promoted to outside sales. I gained a vast knowledge of bearings and power train equipment.
good,"Fast paced receiving wolfpack , Ups , & Ltl."
good,This was introducing a new catalog ordering program to our customers.  This was building relationships with your customers for repeat business.  They have a good workplace culture in place.
good,No two days are the same.  Provided ample opportunity to interact with other departments and functional areas.  Always striving for continuous improvement.
good,"Dreary, industrial company with little opportunities if you are not interested in sales or in becoming a mechanical engineer. I am struggling to find another job but it is difficult at my age. This company is fair with wages, but there is little chance of increases once you are in."
good,"When I started it was an amazing work environment. The people we helpful and informative. Then people left , management changed multiple times,  and contracts needed renewed and it fell apart quickly. The only reason I left is because wages and other things that were discussed kept getting pushed back further and further. I would return return in a heartbeat as long as term and conations were set in stone."
good,I loved the mental challenge of this job but very much disliked the emotional challenges of taking over a job that all of my employees applied for before they hired me to do the job.
good,"This job was very productive in teaching me how to get around make deliveries within the city.  After 7 years, I can say that I have learned a lot."
good,"My typical day is very busy. I receive all the customer orders and make sure that they all go to the right customer. I do all the deliveries and receive all the ups for our customers. I run the entire warehouse, and learning the system to help customers upfront"
good,"Answer incoming phone calls "
good,Nothing is hard. This is a pretty relaxed place to work. Atmosphere is sometimes to relaxed for me. I think the policy on attendance could be upheld every once in a while.
good,"Good company, Allot of politics and poor management. Descent pay"
good,Typical warehouse job requiring completion of monotonous tasks day in and day out.  Zero room for advancement unless someone retires.  You will not hear from management unless you do something wrong.  The DC manager has the charisma of a catfish.
good,"Not much to do when it's slow. Run out of things to do very quickly when no one is buying. There is a lot of flexibility, though. If you need to go to an appointment or anything you just go."
good,The job can be hectic and stressful. They ask alot from the driver/whse to pull orders load van delivery product put up inventory receive UPS and morning truck and all without wanting you to work overtime. But all the while the inside people take 5 to 10 or more smoke breaks a day. Benefits are good with the bonus you get but need with the low hourly pay. All and all it's a so so place to work. Got the good and the bad
good,The guy below me is a crybaby snitch. His job is easy. He is just lazy. I'm sure his next employer will be thrilled to have him aboard. His pedo stache kinda freaks us out.
good,"journée de travail sans pause et heures de repas complète, rhytme de travail élevé."
good,"This is a good place to work, upper management needs to let branch managers make more decisions on local scene. Very good training , very busy office  after hours service required 1 week per month 24/7"
good,I liked working for Applied.  The benefits are great even if the pay isn't.  It was a good platform to getting on to something better.
good,"It is a good place to work. I get along with everyone, and the manager is very helpful."
good,"Applied is a pretty good place to work but there really is no way to advance your career here because most of the employees have been there five years or longer and are not leaving the job because they are comfortable there and like their fellow employees therefore any move in this warehouse is a lateral move not a promotional move. The mangagement can be very biased all the managers and supervisors have their pet employees and there is a lot of favoritism there. I do not believe they give raises as they should such as a great employee gets a better raise than a poor employee, raises are pretty much two or three percent across the board no matter if they are a great employee or not."
good,"Work was easy to learn in the warehouse for parts inventory, but more of a challenge in the office where orders took place. "
good,Competitive with other industrial suppliers in pay and benefits. Good mix of seasoned and new employees with varied backgrounds. There is a good customer base with variety of industries to serve.
good,"Good work environment and decent management. There are very limited opportunities for growth/promotions, and very little training provided.  Culture can vary greatly from branch to branch."
good,"inventory, multi-tasking, multi phone, customer relations, & computer entry"
good,Good company in about 5 years.  I think there is a lot of potential to grow and innovate processes. Right now Applied is facing challenges that it is immediately being corrected.  It will take 5 years to get this corporation in a positive profitable streak again with the help of all 10000 employees
good,"I gained valuable knowledge and worked my way up through the organization by holding various positions throughout my career at Applied."
good,They need to get with the times in regards to flex time and working from home when the ability exists.  The bonus program is great if you work in a large industrial area
good,I worked here for over ten years and made many friendships and learned many things to get me ahead in my future positions. It is a nice place for someone to get their foot in the door.
good,"I worked at a Service Center that was shorthanded with no help from corporate to fill the positions."
good,A typical would generally be 10-12 hours depending on customer needs and current Staff for the day.  Management was good to work with.  Hardest part of job was balancing work/home.
good,Overall a nice place to work with the ability to move throughout the company.  If you are willing to invest in yourself the company will invest in you.  That being said certain branch systems seem to micro manage rather than having trust in their employees.  A fast paced environment with new things coming to you on a daily basis which made the day flow smoothly.
good,Great company to work for. Office settings with steady pace company growth
good,Being able to work in a timely pace without constant supervision made the job very enjoyable.
good,"I worked as an Account manager and from day one was assigned to some of the most difficult accounts and told to repair to the relationship. Hardest part was travel, best part was friends I made that I still communicate with to this day after than more than a decade."
good,"I came to AIT from a competitor. It was a great change in environment. People were mostly friendly and helpful, easy to get to know. Work was manageable and you are provided with the necessary tools to do your job well."
good,"I worked as weekend shift supervisor.  We worked three 12 hr. days. Our main responsibility was handling emergency customer orders after normal business hours.  We also did receiving and storing of product, and routine maintenance on equipment and the building. "
good,"No benefits for interns"
good,I enjoyed my time working at Applied. They were a timely employer during a difficult part of my life. I felt that after 5 years of working in the warehouse I had no opportunity for growth. So I decided to move on.
good,Great learning experience. On the job training was very useful. Everyday was different and challenging. Great training tools and material for reference.
good,"I enjoyed working independently with little supervision, each day was something different and kept me busy the whole shift.  I enjoyed working here and it was something I never did before and I enjoyed every minute of it"
good,"typical day is doing 5 things at one time, technical knowledge of the industrial manufacturing/oem-mro field. The most challenging part is finding time to meet with customers and sell, currently being micro-managed, which leads to less time in front of customers."
good,"Good compensation here, high pressure for-profit sales company, good products.  They sell products to industry, so primarily a male oriented industry, warehouse atmosphere mostly.  "
good,No room to advance.Would like to be part of a growing company to advance.
good,"A typical work day for me is usually anywhere between 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. - I'm on salary so our corporate doesn't care how many hours it takes as long as the work is done. I've got a good understanding of the SAP System.  This is a very high paced job.  The hardest part of my job is have to negotiate pricing for customers and get approvals from those in management above me.  Most enjoyable has been that through this Job I've had the opportunity to travel to different locations to help them as the SAP System was set up in their region.  Also, I've had a incredible General Manager, he keeps me calm in times of crisis/emergencies."
good,"I would have liked to retire from Applied. I thought I was going to but was suddenly laid off with no warning at all. They moved my position and weren't willing to move me. I received a fair severence package and was deemed re-hireable, but I felt like a criminal on the day I was laid off, again WITH NO WARNING. They watched while I gathered a few personal belongings and escorted me out of the building. Humiliating to say the least. Their actions at the end clouded my view of them."
good,"Good place to learn, benefits good, my managers were good people and the inside sales staff was knowledgeable and supportive... growing pains with SAP, but they got past it.  I'd work for them again if the opportunity was a right."
good,Overall good company to work for but the compensation is a hit or miss depending where you work. Good benefits and good culture. A little bit old school and not technology friendly.
good,"Inside Sales – Only local distributer selling full line of Makita & variety of industrial parts"
good,"Spent significant time acquainting the new company to exixting customers. Heavily involved in transitioning accounting ,inventory,AP,AP,PR enterprise systems over to the AIT systems"
good,There all ways a challenge with customers demand and as a company they come through for them. There environment in the work place is as a family. In conclusion it good place to start.
good,Great job just not stable .. I enjoyed he work environment and and servicing the customers was an enjoyable thing eveyday.
good,"Applied Industrial Technologies is a Fortune 500 industrial distributor. Promoted to Account Manager in Pompano Beach, Florida. I managed accounts with top-tier firms amongst numerous industries, active involvement with entrepreneurs & C-level executives."
good,"handled outbound and inbound call center"
good,Working at Applied Industrial Technologies in the payroll department was fulfilling.  I learned a lot about their payroll system.  The employee there are very friendly.  Its a nice place to work.
good,"Basically E-mailed Customers regarding Past Due Invoices"
good,"I was nice working with Applied. I have learned how to work in a team and how to balance work and personal life. My co-workers are mostly good, supportive and helpful."
good,"It was hard to increase my expectations of employees due to wages being below industry norms, I provided as many perks as possible an achieved best in class ""Gold Award"" for the region. overall I had a good crew and most put in their best each day. The economy has changed since then and I'm sure wages and attitudes have changed as well."
good,"Applied was a fun place. The work was fast paced most of the time and diverse. Management was flexible and willing to listen to new ideas. Co-workers were the best, they really helped each other."
good,"a typical day at applied consisted of working in either shipping or receiving area driving a sit-down forklift in shipping from time to time, shrink wrapping product's on a skid after we placed them on a platform to be weighed then write the number down in the system and put a sticker on the item/shrink wrapped skid , then loading them on to the trucks in the bay. also sometime's doing vendor return's."
good,Great atmosphere and company. Work hard and you can have the opportunity for growth. They train you in multiple job positions and provide great feedback on your work!
good,"bonne entreprise, bonne école pour la vente de pièce mécanique"
good,"Applied is a great place to work, it would be better if they would have a training program for SAP on their computer system. I was hired as a CSSR, but find myself doing more delivery than sales and customer service."
good,"This is a time sensitive job, but can be laid back at times. Duties are repetitive on a daily basis, but different in a good way. The job allowed me to not only work full-time, but also expand other personal opportunities."
good,"A lot of phone sales. Computer generated sales orders. Counter sales, cash sales. Working with the public was sometime trying. Too many office managers for the amount of employees."
good,Had a wonderful experience working with a great group of people.As a team we were able to efficiently operate a shipping and receiving warehouse and provide outstanding customer service to both internal and external customers. All with only a staff of 4 including office support. The friends and memories will be ones to cherish.
good,While working for Applied Industrial Technologies  I learned more about the hydraulic fluid business. The worst part was being on call. I.e.getting called at 2am driving 100 miles to and back and having to be at work at 8am that morning.
good,"My typical day at work started with doing the daily inventory count. I would then do the receiving of parts when needed. The work day consisted of making calls to vendors regarding products, orders, delivery dates, shipping costs. Also called on customers to give them information on new products that would benefit their company and try to make sales from that call. I took inbound calls during the day from customers regarding their orders and other inquiries. I learned so much about the industrial world of motors, bearings, chain, belting and the types of products used in the different industrial businesses."
good,"Service center keeps everyone busy. With the customer base being what it is, there is little down time. Days go by fast."
good,"A typical day with this company is very busy and fast paced."
good,Hardest part of the job is the commute and the extensive travel required.
good,buildig a virgin territory is difficult
good,"industry leader with fast paced work environment. The company was at the time of my employment in growth mode and invested heavily in training it's staff for the next big in a new systems deployment. I enjoyed most about my job and position was the challenges and working as a team to solve and over come those challenges to grow, profit and succeed"
good,Recommend product knowledge.  Several products are offered but you need to know best application.  training via company and vendor based websites available providing you can find time during the work day to view.  Good pay and benefits.
good,"Make sales calls in a large Territory, and grow the territory. Work with the Inside Sales team to increase Revenue. Source and Procure Fluid Power, Power Transmission products."
good,"One of the top 3 distribution companies in the USA. Huge range of products available. As a branch manager I only issue I had was that all branches where expected to adhere to the box policy, don't operate outside the box."
good,Very nice company to work for.  Good work/life balance.  There is a lot of opportunities to move up or around the country.  Great pay and benefits. My current branch Manager was a lot to deal with and many people eventually quit because of her.  Overall an excellent company to work for and would be proud to work for them again.
good,Office work mostly.  Office management is very understanding and flexible.  Hardest part is it can get really busy but the most enjoyable is some of the people you work with.
good,Very well managed and a very positive environment   Company invests in its associates. Pay structure could improve but is about average. Management provides clear attainable goals.
good,I learned a lot from this job there were new things to learn everyday.
good,Opening up the building checking in the incoming freight that was delivered overbite from sister company's take inventory pull pick slips from the freight I checked in and received unload incoming freight trucks receive freight in file purchase orders and bill of lading package up outgoing freight and put on shelf for outgoing deliveries answer calls from customers enter orders and purchase items for customers to help keep their plant running and make deliveries to customers
good,Great place to learn about several industrial parts for maintenance. I would pick orders for specific companies and deliver them in a timely manner. Only think hard was being alone most of the time.
good,Great job.  Nice people to work for.  I pulled  orders and completed invoices.  I enjoyed successfully completing tasks I was assigned.

good,Very detailed work. The best accuracy I have ever seen for the entire warehouse including incoming inventory and shipping.
good,"Setting up your weekly schedule, and following up on what was scheduled.  Work closely with clients to provide solutions to problem areas.  Managing time is the toughest part of the job as you need to prioritize tasks that need to be performed."

good,"I worked for Applied for over 10 years."
good,I am very proud of my time at Applied industrial Technologies.  I started as a seasonal intern and left as the Director of Global Supply Chain.  The company gave me a chance to show my worth and I believe I proved that many times over with my results.
good,"Culture is fantastic, can be fast paced but generally relatively steady. Pay is below market value, but the benefit package is at market value. Bonuses are VERY hard to obtain, and raises are minimal."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Applied Industrial, but I broke a rule laid out in the customer hand book and was unfortunately let go. There was no was no disciplinary system or warning. It was straight to firing which I was pretty upset about."

good,"Outstanding employer. "
good,"A typical day with AIT-was laughter, work, doing your job to its fullest, helping customers....  I credit most of this to our GM great guy and a good mentor, also the coworkers were great we all worked well together. I don't think there was ever a hard part to the job once you were trained and given the opportunity and not afraid to ask questions which is key cause there is no dumb question to be asked."
good,"Have fun at work with management and coworkers. "
good,"A good place to work. Good pay for the job requirements as well as good insurance and benefits. Some times fast paced and multi-tasking is required but overall more of a regular routine. Even though I say routine, the job is not the same ole' same ole' every day. Some days are more challenging than others and makes it interesting."
good,Applied is a wonderful place to work!  MY supervisors are willing to work around kid schedules and there is a push to better yourself through the company.

good,"Great place to work, if your location has management figured out, your job will be great. Judging by other reviews, not every location is the same. My location had 2 wonderful managers"
good,Great work/life balance. I have learned a lot about the company through the numerous training tools offered to all employees online and in person. The workplace culture is collaborative. It is a high volume company but that challenge is a good one. I enjoy working for a management team that does not micromanage but is available to answer all of my questions. The CEO has a great vision and plan for the company's continued growth.

good,MRO Supply and mechanical power transmission sales are not an easy fields to start in out of college or any other environment.  They give you the start you need to make How It's Made your every day experience.

good,"Applied has lot of on the job training opportunities. Everyday is a learning experience full of valued information, that can be used with day to day problems.  Along with fun and friendly working environments."
good,Where can you go and be part of How its Made.  Right out of school and into a place where you can go into a factory and watch every day items being made.  Big machines for small tasks.  All had to be repaired and maintained.  Relationships was the name of the game in the industry.
good,"Learned valuable IT management skills particularly in the areas of network management, PC and server management, associate management.  Given every opportunity to succeed."
good,"Great place to work! I loved the atmosphere, but the pay was simply not enough. I got introduced to SAP, learned accounting roles and the basics of accounts payable departments, increased my communication skills and customer service, and I also became very organized."
good,"As CSR my typical day was to handle all incoming phone calls from customers along with my other co-workers , process customer quotes and orders in a timely manner. Learned that I was an important part of the puzzle in the work place along with my service center manager  , acct manager , whse staff and the other CSR. I found the hardest part of the job was being under staffed so put a lot of extra work on each other to get our job done. I liked the people I worked with was a fun team to be apart of , dealing with customers and helping to solve there problems or breakdown emergencies that they are trying to fix."
good,Again as a Temp I was treated with respect and as a regular employee. I had also worked in Human Resource and everyone in that department treated me good also.
