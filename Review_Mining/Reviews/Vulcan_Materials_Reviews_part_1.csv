rating,review
bad,The manager fired me for sleeping but another person was sleeping got suspended allowed to keep her job if they would get out they would see who worked and didn't work the mangers need to be trained again
bad,Racism runs rampant in baltimore and surrounding counties within vulcan . The kkk has come to power and the 1 black llouyd henson is a bootlicking tom.
bad,"Not the Respectful , Professional company it’s USE to be. GOOD Drivers are quitting left and right, management has poor communication and operate on the family and friends system. Pay is inconsistent and it’s bi weekly pay with NO real sick time. The Vulcan Academy program requires drivers stay with the company for 3 years or pay the tuition costs for CDL B license. Overall NOT worth the headache and sacrifice"
bad,I would not recommend working for Vulcan they gave me one day and a half training on a Haul truck Turn Me Loose by myself and the first time I make a mistake that could have killed me or other people I got fired I was not ready to be driving a Haul truck and I should not have been fired because I didn't have proper training
bad,This is the last place you want to work. Poor management and a dead end job. Pay is way below average for this area. You will be over worked and under paid.
bad,"Bad managements, older seasond employees milking the company dry, they won't retire and expect the younger guys to pick up the slack for less pay. I wouldn't recommend this jobs to my worst enemy"
bad,This company does not care about their employees at all. They don't care at all! If something goes wrong they don't have proof to back up their accusations.
bad,"This organization truly exemplifies the statement of ""it's not what you know, but rather who you know"".  As long as you network well your job knowledge or work ethic do not matter."
bad,"As long as you are related to or friends with a boss you can do whatever you want, if your not you have no room for error, three strikes your out. favoritism is very noticeable"
bad,Working at Vulcan was the worst 2 and a half years of my life. I was never appreciated and to learn new things you need to be related to and form of management. There was no support from other employees or management. You could do a million things right but they would only recognize the one thing you done wrong. And personal life? Yeah you can forget about having one of those if you work there.
bad,The company in general is not to bad but where I worked was garbage the management was not good they would lie to save themselves they don’t care about family’s it’s not a family oriented place
bad,"Havre de Grace location specifically, the managers and supervisors are poorly trained and self centered. They do not care about your safety or home life. They will go out of their way to make an example of you to make themselves look good. The plant and equipment are unsafe and poorly maintained.  They have fired many good employees with great skills and experience, based solely on their ego getting hurt or someone having a differing opinion. I would not recommend working here unless it is a last resort.  You will be miserable and learn to hate your job."
bad,"No work - life balance, you have to do the work of 4 people, no help, no training !  Vulcan Corp. Management knows nothing about the Heavy Highway Construction Industry.  You will be stepped on.  Don't go there, find another job."
bad,I worked for Vulcan almost 18 years I got fired for missing time family issues but boss. Let his family get away with everything and he favored the snitches
bad,"McCook is a revolving door for Management. Your personal life means ABSOLUTELY nothing. Safety is preached but goes out the window when production is down. Production is down most of the time. Moral has been way down for many years. This makes it hard to work with most of the employees. Quick and dirty work is preferred and rewarded by management. One day notice of lay off, a change of shift for the next week or Saturday work. Harassment is very common. If you speak up about problems then you have a target on your back."
bad,"I would definitely not recommend applying for work at the McCook facility. The company seems good to work at in other locations but this one is the absolute worst. Lots of racial tension, English is not spoken much and the treatment by management is terrible and un organized. You will be expected to work 6 days a week minimum 10 hours a day so say goodbye to your personal life. This facility also has had many safety violations this year alone. They definitely do not practice what they preach on safety. Place is falling apart and the older employees do not care about producing quality work. DO NOT APPLY HERE, especially as a laborer!"
bad,Seams that they are looking for a reason to fire you.Needs better management.You would think you working for the C.I.A .Coworkers don't seem to want you there if your doing your job better then them.Very hard place to work for inless your Spanish or white.The most enjoyable part was not beening there getting in your truck and leaving.
bad,"As long as rock is being unloaded from the train, nothing else matters.  Management complained about cost of every part.  Patch it and go mentality.  The worst work environment I ever experienced"
bad,If your sexually harassed best not blow it off like I did because your in a mans environment. That man will turn it around and You the Female will be fired. And don’t expect them to hear your side of the story either.
bad,I’ve never seen a manager treat or talk to employees in such an unprofessional and intimidating way. Vulgar and has a pet name for everyone. Everyone is beneath him and should fear him. He is very manipulative and plays everyone. Talks to you like a piece of trash then acts like he never did such a thing in front of others. Everyone knows how he is but does nothing about it. Don’t bother with going to hr. Plays his favorites big time. Plenty of hours and the pay is decent but I would NOT work here until he is fired! I’m surprised he hasn’t been already.
bad,"was told to do things that was unsafe and being new to the company i knew better so i said no and they got the other workers to do it "
bad,Layed off after 19 years at the company would not recommend working for this company they do not look out for their employees the only good thing is the benefits
bad,Employee harassment...rushed all the time ...They preach safety all the time and when something safety happens they look around it to get a load of concrete out.....management plays favoritism to certain drivers when it should be equal..if u want to advance forget it unless your the managers let  oh I only made 34000 a yr and you never have a set schedule up all hours of the night 12-16 hrs a day n don't say your tired they don't care
bad,You never know when your getting off.you are just a number. Management is a joke on a average management has 3 employees a peace to manage and some how mess that up.you hardly ever get to do your job for doing someone else's. If your not family you are temporary and you don't have a life outside of Vulcan. When they say family first they mean the family you have at Vulcan cause your family at home doesn't exist anymore. You work 12 hour days without any breaks.you find out Friday at quitting time you have to work Saturday
bad,"Vulcan used to be a great place to work . When I was hired , it was a company that people retired from . A place where people enjoyed working , we had good benefits , retirement , and hard working people. We took pride in our work and our equipment . Then management , chipped away at our contracts , our retirement , our medical , our pay . All while Vulcan was name a top profiting company . They wrote us up for stupid things. Implemented BS , safety rules , not rules that really made a difference ."
bad,They could be a good company if they were managed well they just have no direction and unfortunately the employees pay .too many chiefs not enough Indians.
bad,"Go go go even though the management preaches safety. "
bad,"stay away, pay is good hours vary, stab in the back, and then run you down to competition, conversation with federal inspectors are prohibited whether general talk or business. this is held against you and then your blackballed to hades an back!"
bad,"As the old saying goes.."" whole lot of chiefs and not enough indians"" applies to this company.  "
bad,this job is for College Students not a career or for any advancement
bad,"From the begining this place was not a positive place to work. It was like being in high school all over, from the managers acting like kids and causing plenty of drama to employees who slept with anyone who would say yes."
bad,No set time when you come in for work or do you know when you are getting off. Also you are told to work Saturday at the last  minute. Whenever it rains hard no work. Hostile environment & Management was poor & treat new employee bad. Co-worker who been their for a while was able to get away with almost anything towards the new employees.
bad,Very cut throat and it was always someone elses fault. The lead man in the fabrication shop was not a good role model or leader. doesn't like people never would work with others. Poor work ethics.
bad,"stressful"
bad,"Expect you to be on call but do not offer compensation"
bad,You go in and work your hardest and it will never be good enough. Their mentality is whatever it takes to get the job done until someone gets hurt
bad,"This place (Macon-Postell) is a waste of time. 6-12hr days with little to no notice in schedule change. Still don’t understand why there’s a need for a supervisor and team leader, when both are as clueless as I was."
bad,Works everyone like a dog.  No compassion!  Does not care about their employees.  Everyone's just a number.  All they care about is their mighty dollar
bad,they do not know what is going on at the plant. Good for entry level  employee. Would not go back to stockbridge all about looks not fixing things thats all
bad,The hours were very long. Sometime you worked 14 to 16 hours a day. The leadership was not very good. Equipment was not very good and the customers were very hard to work with.
bad,Not my cup of tea no family time when working six days a week on twelve hour shifts. Advancement options are there but in my experience management not very organized (at the quarry I worked) although others facilities seem to be better ran and pay more
bad,I loved my co workers.  WE/THEY have a untouchable safety record  in the Augusta quarry. Make no mistake that is due to the veterans on staff that know how things are to truly be done and their ability to train the new and upcoming. Surely is not do to management.  If you are a woman you count yourself lucky if giving the chance to work outside the scale house but do not expect to get the same opportunitys as the men. Managment will make sure you are limited to what you can operate and when you operate it!! ALL yard employees are  required to run every piece of heavy equipment in that yard. All employees but the one women in the yard. If the management would spend less time with their feet propped up gossiping and more time doing their jobs I wonder what business would be like. Also if the saleman had HALF OF A CLUE how to do his job the Augusta plant would blow production off the chart
bad,"My job at Vulcan is to fix what needs to be fixed. Also do oil changes replace brakes and water pumps. Hydraulic problems are found,  I take the line off and replace it."
bad,It’s a Company that management try’s to make it like they care for u and your family but everybody is  back stabbing and just pointing fingers at each other low pay and horrible management
bad,Bad management at the local level. Preferential treatment given to customers based on whether you are liked by management. No clear direction from management.
bad,Management was a joke the equipment was garbage they held zero responsibility to the drivers for keeping cement off of the trucks most of the shops did not even have indoor plumbing
bad,"Management is horrible.  The company operates very backwards.  They used to have good benefits, but those were stripped away and nothing was left but bad management.  If one person does not like you then you are left out in the cold and they will find any reason in the world to terminate you."
bad,"Typical day was checking out the Haul Truck, then going into the pit to receive loads from the Loader operator. Upon being loaded, drove to the plant feeder and dumped the load into the trap."
bad,"The company as a whole is well established."
bad,Under staffed management want more and more with interrupting sales always adding extra duties know that it can't be accomplished with the staff
bad,Vulcan is a good company but continues to have problems with promoting people of color and women. Hopefully in the near future Vulcan Materials will play catch up with today's diverse workforce.
bad,Great Company with great benefits. Only issue is during my 4 years here they changed management 3 times.Other than that its a great company with great benefits. Descent compensation
bad,I worked at Vulcan for 1 year 5 months at first it was great.then it seemed as if the workers where less important . And favoritism was starting .
bad,"This is an ok company to work for. I would recommend it as a thriving career. If your ok with just ok job and benefits you may like it here. There is alot more out there to offer if you just look. This would be a great stepping stone to a better job. Young ego narcissistic supervisor here will need to grow into his position, bare with him."
bad,work was good then soon as summer starts when it should be more work we got less and less work and hours and only the top 6 driver got 40 a week were if you were new you get the short end of the stick
good,"The company as a whole is a very well established company but as a division in the San Antonio area is lacking as a whole. Management cares nothing more than numbers when it comes to anything. They praise and glorify other areas of the company but fail to realize that the trucks are the back bone of the company and surly do not drive them selves. With an 8hr turn around,  6 to 7 days a week of 12+ hour days something is probable to happen negatively due to driver fatigue and error. But they expect you to operate like a robot and not have any complaints or they will find a way to get rid of you. Do your self a favor and stay in school."
good,This job is for a single person with no kids or grown kids. You have no life. You cant plan anything because of the call to get your time for work everyday. You never know what time you are coming to work and you dont lnow what time you are getting off. The pay is good and the benefits are excellent.
good,"No room for advancement, poor communication between manager and employees.  Typical work day, loading trucks, over 5,000 ton of material a day.  Worked Monday thru Saturday's"
good,"I have worked for 39 years, doing heavy equipment mechanic work."
good,This is the third review I've written. I don't expect this to be posted either. My boss was a vindictive little boy who has no business being in charge. Many good people were fired from the Brownwood mine due to poor area management. The 'good old boy system' is alive and well at this plant.
good,"Vulcan as a company is good but the management at the Tucson, AZ plants is the worst! If your not the bosses golfing buddy and drinking partner your as good as mud!"
good,"I came into this company with 20 years of driving experience but new to the state, the manager wouldn’t allow following anyone to job sites and GOS takes you ways our trucks can not go like loaded on highways so finding your way around was costly in time and caused controversy within the other drivers. If you was seen following another driver the tenured drivers called the manager and he called us telling us not to. Cameras in trucks for new people and not tenured drivers causing"
good,no breaks no lunch very little raise very fast pace starting pay is decent but not a lot of room for advancement if you want to transfer to another plant it is very hard
good,Harsh working environment poor attitudes from management. Long hours and no time at home. Working 16-18 hours a day 6 days a week gets old fast. No work/life balance needs more pay for the job
good,Economic conditions have forced the company to reduce workforce by approximately 33% over the past few years. Company performance has been poor.
good,Good paying job. Downside is you are always there. Work long hours everyday and always tired even on your off days. The benefits are very good compared to other companies I've worked for though.
good,never specify working stop time on day to day bases and never tell about weekend work until last minute. Not a horrible job but tasks are very repetitive and production side is very stressful.
good,Productive Aggregate industry.  Has good benefits.  Allows you to work flexible hours.   One of the largest aggregate companies in the nation.  Very flexible.
good,Vulcan material was a nice company with great safty procedure and job opportunies. Vulcan materials lacked leadership and employee engagement but over all was decent job.
good,Long hours driving the same routes. Unsafe conditions. Pay was good only because of overtime. According to management was not able to leave for lunch. Had to take small breaks and bring own food.
good,"At Vulcan you will work lots of hours. "
good,The Southeast Division especially in SC has too much nepotism.  Long timers were too complacent on their jobs.  Policies not being followed.  Women are second class citizens.
good,The company needs better management. The hardest part of the job is pleasing the management and also trying to get through the politics. The co workers all were very good and had great relationships with them. I learned that the company has many people that are insecure about they're job. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the great vendors they had in place.
good,"We clock in then go to our shop to look over our work orders. After a short time of gathering tools and materials, we proceed to our designated parts of the plant to inspect our assigned equipment; if problems are found, the equipment is repaired and repairs are documented. Then work progresses to compleating assigned work orders and PM requestes."
good,"Company offers awesome benefits,  mediocre work culture but no work life balance! There are individuals who will limit your advancement if your current position is hard to fill."
good,"good people, no advancement and horrible pay. Learned a lot about industry, helped to launch career, great stepping stone. Management weak and could use a refresh."
good,It is terrible how they treat senior employees. Hew management team could be a lot better. Loved the company until 2014 and everything just went to pot.
good,"I was there less than a year but people were nice, the manager was easy to work with.  I had no difficulties with anyone.  I worked alone in an office so it could be lonely."
good,You are a number to management. If you peak in your pay grade then they are finished with you. Management protects itself and is not worried about hourly employees. Company preaches safety but only when it fits their needs and will hide from Corp.
good,"The hardest part of some work days would be like going to a job site where you never been before and the directions are wrong,you are not familiar with the area."
good,"I come to work from 6am-6pm Monday-Saturday.  I don't get paid as well as I would like to but all of the over time compensates for it, I guess.  I sit in a truck or piece of equipment all day.  It gets boring.  I get along with everyone I work with.  Its a decent job but I feel like I have no time to spend at home with my family anymore because of all of the over time. There is no change of advancement for me, either which is why I am looking elsewhere. The same people working there have been there forever."
good,"6-6 everyday 1.7 miles underground"
good,"the days go by fast you work for hard money, management a little bit shady"
good,"There is a lack of communication from management "
good,The biggest downside to this company was the lack of communication on when you would have to work over your hours. Do not expect to make plans in your personal life unless you have the time paid off and request way in advance. I was denied to go to my uncle's funeral while working here because it was out of state and I needed time off that I didnt have available in paid days. The management currently over the railyard have no clue how to properly talk to their guys .
good,Welded in the plant also lead man and welded all equipment that they had  also work in the shop before I left It was very stressful because of how management they are always right on top of you
good,"Worked 10 to 12 hours a day, 60 to 70 hours a week then laid off in the winter. On a daily  basis you would go in and complete your pre-trip inspections on all machinery and then start up the plant. This position required many different sets of skills to include driving truck, loader, and fabricating and welding."
good,"drive a truck thats all you do. jobs are filled in house, pay is good and insurance too. stock options, but with a company this size you are just a number on a time card. show up do your job and go home. worked 70hrs a week every week during the summer and was lucky to get 40 in the winter. most generally was laid off. no joking and cutting up, it wasn't tolerated. once the shift started only communication was business and only business. management was a joke, never seem them face to face, every heard the saying to many chiefs and not enough Indians. vulcan has it written all over it. they are a discriminating company in more ways then you can shake a stick at. seen several good employees fired for speaking to a MSHA investigator. This alone is wrong and MSHA says so. but vulcan is large enough to do it over and over again. would not recommend for those who like conversation throughout the work shift of any kind."
good,This was actually a pretty good company to work for before they changed upper management. After this change in my opinion the company went down hill. The higher ups were mostly concerned about profits and keeping their jobs more so than anybody else. The good ole boy system was in full effect.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Vulcan, however the management of staff and promotions or yearly reviews with yearly pay increase are lacking."
good,"not a bad place to work, some great people in the ranks"
good,For the most part the people there are good hard working people that treat you with respect.  The only struggle is working the countless amount of hours just to appease to customers.
good,Used to be great don't make any mistakes always listening to the wrong people. Management listen to wrong people. You can and will get terminated for things out of your control. Teamwork good luck with that. If your not in the office shining up your kneepads then you'll be a target. Never been treated like I did there. Would love to mention names but not professional.
good,When plant goes down and it does almost every night they want you to become manual labor shoveling rock and sand off catwalks for several hours until your shift is over too much labor for driver position
good,"Hire managers who actually cares about their team and employees who report to them. Do not hand out management positions without prior managerial experience. Give training to manager without experience. Put them through Leadership training before they scared away company's experienced and loyal employees. Certification does not mean anything if you are not actually know what you are doing. Passing a test and obtaining a certification, should not weight, how smart and great leader the person is. Have 360 evaluation for your employees, across the company and take that feed back to heart and get reed of people who destroy the reputation of Vulcan Materials Company Inc."
good,"Working at Vulcan was a wonderful expericence until we received poor management and unskilled workers. Hours were a perfect fit for me at the time, but going from night shift to day shift put a toll on anyone's body."
good,I loved working for Vulcan materials. My day would begin at 6am and sometimes not end until 10 pm or later. Not much time for family life working there. The management was great until they made some changes then it went downhill.
good,The way situations are handle is very undesirable. Everything is played off and nothing is handled in a timely manner. Nobody is willing to help one another and the management is only out to make themselves look better even if that means throwing you to the wolves.
good,"company under payed the employees, they cared more about production then fixing the problems with the plants. Witch made it longs days for the hourly guys. but over all i good company."
good,"marketing, project management and more. As a result of rapid growth, we are searching for skilled applicants who share our values of quality and outstanding service. We are open to candidates from across North America or Europe."
good,Job Work/Life Balance is difficult to accomplish. Positions require extensive overtime. Overtime is not worked to achieve results but rather to maintain.
good,I work with  great group of men who don't mind helping you out learning about the company and the position the only down side not working in bad weather which shortens your check in the winter
good,Great company and I enjoyed working there.  I would work there again if they needed crane operators.
good,Full time job hours. Maintain and weld heavy equipment machinery but other work positions available at different plants.
good,"Good place to work, stay busy all year long with great plant managers but poor up keep and maintence on equipment and too far of a daily commute from Frankfort to Old Richmond Rd."
good,A typical work day would consist of checking my section for safe operation before start up. Getting the days orders and preparing my section to deliver the product requested. Maintaining correct weights and measures. Keeping visual of gauges and conveyors for warning signs of potential trouble.
good,As a supervisor we work a minimum of 12 hrs a day. This made for no time to enjoy your family outside of work.If you are a title driven person who is single and looking to spend all your time at work this place is for you.
good,Work is hard long days Benefits are pretty good pay is pretty good. It all depends on your supervisor how well your day is gone to go and how far you gonna go within the company.
good,There's always plenty of work to do so you're never really idle.  The downside is a ton of it is self created due to poor communication among different areas.
good,"Support over 250 employees in the division office and maintained over 25 plants network issues and logged tickets of all issues, troubleshoot network and phone issues when they arise. The hardest part of the job was traveling all over the state of Florida and keeping long work hours to ensure the plants was working properly. The most enjoyable part of the job, was taking care of the end users each day and learning something new all the time."
good,"The maintenance of heavy equipment has its unique challenges lock out tag out, safety, and these areas are no less important than actually doing the job. Safety is a large part of the culture."
good,Great people and an awesome company to work for. I would recommend this place to everyone. I had a wonderful work experience with this company. This was such an experience.
good,Good place to start but the management is always trying to find a reason to get rid of you. Most of the drivers that dont get messed with knew the management before vulcan bought out a smaller company so theyre all buddy buddy. Raises are 3 percent at the most a year and a 5 year driver will make the same as a rookie. Dont ever miss any days thatll put you on the kill list most drivers are either going to be here 6 months or long enough to get invested in retirement and cant leave. Make sure you work on the west side of town not the east side or you gotta deal with mighty mouse.
good,"Welcome to Chicago... What can I say , home of political BS. If you start as a laborer the odds of you moving on to another position are very slim. They need people and their for will not help you into another position. If you don't speak Spanish, you will be shuned from the group. Most of the old timers are very hesitant to teach new people out of fear that a non Spanish person is taking their job. If there is ever any kind of issue anywhere, it is usually kept in house and will never make it to corporate or HR like you think it would. Pay and benefits are ok. Lots of hours so overtime is great but count out family time."
good,"Working at Vulcan materials co. at the sun city plant(I really don't like to say bad things about anyone because its a big negative but this needs to be said)  is to date the very worst job I have ever had in my life and what made it that bad were the people I had to work with directly everyday. Right from my very first day I was treated like a second rate person. I never heard anything positive from them about my work or anything but they constantly said positive things to each other all day long.  I worked with 3 other guys and one was our boss, one thought he was the boss and one that was a follower. These three guys are the best of friends too and favoritism is huge there to say the least.  I loved the work I was doing but when you get talked down to everyday for no reason it makes going to work a very hard thing to do. Vulcan Materials company is a really good company to work for please don't get me wrong about that its just some of the people. whats really sad is these guys put on a act when the big wigs are around and then they are nice but they lose the act when those people leave. The big management people don't have a clue about things that go on there until now. I couldn't do anything right according to them."
good,"My job title was area Electrician but electrical work was the one thing I did the least of. They didn’t want an electrician. What they wanted was a grunt to do all the same task as their entry level general support hands (greasing the plant, Manning high pressure water hoses to wash the plant down after shifts, general maintenance and repairs). Being a skilled professional meant nothing to them. The way thru saw it is the more you make the more hard physical labor you should have to do, regardless whether or not the task they want you to do has anything to do with electrical work or not. There were plenty of electrical projects that needed to be done but they were not interested in letting me do them. To them I was just another back and set of hands for the “lead men” to boss around so they wouldn’t have to do anything.  If they would have simply allowed me to do the job I was hired to do I would have been perfectly happy working there but like I said electrical work that needed to be done seemed to be the last thing that interested them. That’s to be expected though when you have unskilled and uneducated people put into leadership roles just because they are buddies with the plant manager. If you are a good or even decent electrician, consider this your warning...run far, FAR away from this company unless you are trying to go to work for one of their large operations. At the larger plants, specialized employees actuallystick to their job scope and are not askedor forced to do things outside of their job description or pay grade. Other than the large operation exception, no"
good,"It is good to work on that environment. Dealing with Dealers, Dispatchers and other channel partners. It was nice experience and learn more.Nice place to work."
good,Good culture and a respected name in the industry. Work life balance was good. Benefits were good. Used to provide a company vehicle. I understand they dont anymore.
good,Good nationwide company to work for. Most employees stay with the company for very long time. There are some transition and growing pains that we are experiencing.
good,Great job to start with in florida but its time I moved on because it is going down hill fast.
good,There is minimal time off and every hour is micro-managed in the accounting department. The department also has poor leadership and turnover has increased significantly.
good,"The hours were not consistent.  Too many early hours, without work being ready.  Uniforms were very poor quality."
good,I've learned alot of stuff working here they gave me an opportunity to learn and increase my knowledge the crew we have get along and are like a family
good,4 star like the people and work not along ride to work run drill in pit on different benches help work on night shift 4 to 4 six days a week office manager is the best help in any way always has time to help you
good,It was a well liked place A lot of the jobs  where difficult and always in a hurry to get back running but all in all it was never too bad  if you were very good at your job it was hard to get promoted I didn’t think that was fair you shouldn’t hold someone back because he does a good job  in my opinion  there was way too many young guys that didn’t have the experience to be Boss I think everyone for safety reasons should be on the ground for at least three years
good,"Decent pay, no opportunity for advancement unless at the division or corporate office. No employee recognition. Great benefits and work environment. Would like to see more employee involvement from managers."
good,"A lot of good, hard working people on the operations team. Will help develop you through in house and offsite training. Opportunity for advancement based on willingness to learn"
good,"A lot of good, hard working people on the operations team. Will help develop you through in house and offsite training. Opportunity for advancement based on willingness to learn"
good,"A lot of good, hard working people on the operations team.  Will help develop you through in house and offsite training.  Opportunity for advancement based on willingness to learn."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Good benefits."
good,Deliver Cement to customers all over the San Antonio area. Worked with many different companies when I arrived at different job sites.  I met alot of people from different companies
good,"Designed satellite, wireless, video, LAN/WAN systems."
good,"Good working conditions, plenty of work available.  Safety was a strong consideration with recognition for maintaining truck and equipment in a safe, usable condition."
good,I really like working at Vulcan Materials.  My co-workers and boss are good people with which to work.  Two things about the job that make it less enjoyable are lengthy layoffs (especially around the holidays) and hours/shifts are always changing.  I prefer a job with more stability.
good,"Best job and great people to work with. Everyday is like working around friends, doing what I like to do. Very safety conscience company.."
good,good place to work. I enjoyed my job and felt real good about it.
good,"Steady work, long hours, good people to work with and I enjoy working with the company"

I learned great methods on working an open mine pit. the work place culture as a company was great and took care of their workers. The hardest part of the job is the amount of overtime you put in with only one day off of work most weeks and can really fatigue the mind and body. The most enjoyable part of my job was that i was able to move around in different positions and cover for other workers that had time off for vacations or other reasoning. That made me experience and open up my knowledge greatly with various other equipment.
good,"Unfortunately I was staffed by an agency, I was a temporary employee"

good,This job was a blast.  I got to do something I had loved for years which was talk about and sell video games.  I was only 18 when working this job and I earned my assistant manager spot withing a year and a half.  After that I did everything from dealing with customer complaints to prepping and executing inventory each year.  I dealt with all the money and did all the reports at the days end.  I had a really great group of guys working around me and they made my job a lot easier.  Hardest part of the job was not spending everything I made in the store.
good,"Typical work day consisted of daily paperwork, loading trucks with heavy equipment and off loading barges. I was able to learn computer skills and deal with clients on a first hand basis. Management team was very helpful and understanding. Hardest part of the job was slow days and idle time. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,Typical day consisted of getting up before daylight and driving 90 miles to get to work. Then you clocked in and checked out your truck to make sure it was D.O.T. satisfactory. You would deliver ready-mix to customers making sure to do it in a professional and courteous manner helping in anyway you could. In your spare time you washed trucks and cleaned up the yard so that it was respectable and presentable to the public.

good,"Through my 25 years at Vulcan Material, I learn that everyday is a new day to learn something new. The work is different every day due to a successful year or problems at the plant. Management is very important due to the safety of all the co-workers. Also I enjoy working with all my co-workers because we take the responsibility to finish the task in time. On the other hand the hardest part of the job is at the end of the year, because I get laid off and I have to wait until the company calls me back knowing i'm the last senior with 25 years with the company. Although knowing the company has good and bad years, the enjoyable part of the job is finishing a project/year with no accident."

I love my roll as Customer Service meeting people, working closely with manager and Salesman getting job orders done."

good,A day in Vulcan was fun most of the time. We worked well together. I had a chance to learn all about the rock industry over my 33 yeas with them. The Management at the front line is great but some of the the upper not so much. 1 of the hardest part of my job was the lack of direction. The best part was the chance to work with the sales and customers.
good,What we do is slip form paving which is a wonderful job. Has some bad times but mostly easy going. The work is hard because it's concrete paving. If you're a lazy person this type of work isn't for you.

good,Plant Production Activity. All areas of accounting on Oracle
good,"The company offers amazing benefits which include, health, vision, dental, 401K, sick pay, vacation pay, floating holiday pay, short/long term disability, and  maternity leave."

good,"On a typical day, check material sources, as well as finished product. On a regular day there has to be a lot of communication to the plant personnel. Management is very involved in the daily results of the materials. Hardest part of the job is assuring all testing and paperwork is completed in a timely manner. The best part of the job is working a long side friendly people who are willing to share their knowledge about the industry."
good,"When I worked there, it was a huge centralized company with many little plants all over the country. The pay and benefits were good, but it was almost impossible for a woman to get anything other than a clerical job."

Management notice their employees for hard work and I personally seen a Vice President walk up to an employee and insist him to take off his safety glasses so he could look him in the eye and shook his hand for the hard work he contributes to the company.

good,"As a dispatcher, I was responsible for keeping the 40 drivers working every day, taking calls to determine needs and making the schedule to deliver on time for every job.  The satisfaction was felt every time I passed by a project that I sent material to, and being able to say I had a part in that, as when driving on the freeway and claiming that it is mine.  The challenges came when mistakes are made by our office or the customer and trying to ""find a home"" for load(s), and making it work, to avoid or alleviate losses.  Those days happened not very often, but when they did, it was those opportunities that showed what our office was able to accomplish under stress and with a goal to reach.  I enjoyed my time with Palomar Transit Mix, the division of Vulcan that was my assignment for seven years, and the new challenges that I received when moved to the Vulcan Asphalt plant after a staff reduction process.  The fact they kept me, finding me another assignment, told me they appreciated the dedication and hard work that I gave to them over those years.  I thank them for that opportunity and found them to be fair, even during the downturn in the economy forced a second staff reduction that finally ended my time with the company."

good,"I was scheduled to work 8-5 but on the avearage day I work 7:30 to 6 or 7 PM. I had the opportunity to travel all over the US from the East Coast to the West Coast and many places in between with a concentration of travel within Texas. My wife and I would have company visitors and visiting vendors at our home for big dinner parties on many occations. We made friends with not only co-workers but vendors as well. We would include our neighbor friends and our work friends from both her work and mine. Because my wife and I are both from other parts of the US, we had a lot of friendships through work. VMC is a large company with many locations throughout the country.
