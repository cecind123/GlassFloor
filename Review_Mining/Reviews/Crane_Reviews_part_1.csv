rating,review
bad,This job was horrible. there was no room for error. they did not pay enough. they have a shortage of workers and make dem work five different people station. Then when layoff comes they lay off whomever that the boss is supervisor friends with.
bad,"If you plan to be applying for any Management or Manager position in any department, please re-consider.  Unless you really need a job badly to get by.  "
bad,Relaxed environment.  However the upper management is horrible.  And has personal relationships with regular crew members and allows them do decide what employees they keep or dont.  Very unethical place to work and it's an HR nightmare.
bad,started early with eyes on your production every day working for superiors that could not do the job you were doing. coworkers were best thing about job

bad,"Great mid management and execution teams."
good,"The work was great, I was hired on full time with promise of getting 40+ hours a week, hourly pay was good but didn't get enough hours to be able to keep up with living expenses"
good,Likely to get sent out on the road every day being a service tech and inspector. Learned something new everyday. Management was questionable at times. Small business so really only worked closely with 2 other guys and it went smoothly most of the time.

good,Customers were generally very easy to work with as well as co-workers. Equipment was updated and taken care of. Work was up and down with the economy and construction.

good,I work in a warehouse where we run reports to determine what product is selling well and what is not. We also run reports to see items on backorder and cross examine them with current orders to maximize out order output.  My co-workers are out going and fun to work with and that is a huge perk.  Hardest part of my job would be learning the ins and outs of the product.
good,"Work in a friendly work environment with helpful and considerate co-workers.  Management are easy to contact and discuss any potential issues as they arise.  It is a fast pace environment and requires a lot of standing and moving around, as well as using motorized equipment and machines.  "
good,Easy yet repetitive work. Small workplace so everyone got to know eachother. Sometimes we'd all get lunch together. Wonderful place if you're into holistics medicine.
