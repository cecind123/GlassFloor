rating,review
bad,Plexus provided a very poor work environment for it's employees.  You were to follow strict guidelines which included requesting bathroom breaks.  Breakroom was located in the farthest corner of the building which meant you had a shortened break time if you were walking from the farthest end of the building
bad,"It was one of the worst work environments I've ever had. There were some benefits, like food trucks, monthly events for employees, decent training, and a lot of diversity among employees. But, wow. All of the employees had extremely low morale everyday, and it wasn't uncommon to hear people talking about how they wanted to quit. While there were some good coworkers, people were constantly gossiping about other coworkers and no matter how hard you worked, you were never good enough for anyone. Leads and trainers would badmouth their employees to other entry level employees and abuse their position by taking hour lunches and half hour breaks. The wages are extremely low with dismal raises. Required overtime almost every single week wasn't uncommon. Random shifts between an overload of work and almost no work at all. It wasn't uncommon to sit around for hours until something to do finally made its way to your station. During slow times, people were told to go help out in other areas, but production associates were not compensated for being cross trained. "
bad,"I use to work there."
bad,"Not organized, Management was full of outside hires, hostile work environment, HR didn't seem concerned about problems, was lied to about my contact, didn't uphold contract and was fired for being sick, was told to do things I wasn't trained on and then getting reprimanded for doing said things, co workers look down on you for almost any reason and no one minds their business."
bad,"Engineering management - if you can call it that is the worst I've ever had to deal with. You may work 7 days a week 12 hours a day while the guy next to you is there 8 hours a day 5 days a week and spends half of that time in the parking lot smoking and the rest asleep at his bench and gets praised for doing nothing."
bad,"I worked at plexus for 2 weeks and it was aweful.  If you like sitting around doing nothing for 7 of the 12 hour shifts and getting paid, this is the job for you. I was bored, it was depressing being there, and the people pretend to love it until you're out of orientation. I Had a problem with my tax forms and kept contacting HR and ended up figuring it out by myself. Would not recommend this place."
bad,I learned about medical billing at this job. I wouldn't work here again.
bad,Management had ridiculous expectations of workers. Manager/ owner was rarely there and when they were they never praised and were inconsistent on the instructions on the ways to assemble the product. Kept changing the way they wanted us to assemble and it changed weekly between quality over quantity and quantity over quality.
good,"Plexus was not very fair when it came to my situation. So don't go by me. I liked working there, I never missed a day, I did everything they asked of me to do. Still, they let me go... They said my production was not up to par. Funny thing is I was in training and learning the job. So I wasnt part of the production team. Go figure!"
good,I enjoy the flexibility to build my own customer clientel and to work from home.  I have done a lot of research on healthcare and weith loss and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.
good,he tenido ayuda al principio en la formación pero después me ha costado obtenerla. Hay buenos profesionales pero en mi opinión la gente va más por libre.
good,"I didn't work there for very long, but it was a typical assembly job. Some days there was a lot of work, other days we didn't have much to do which provided for some long days."
good,"I loved working at Plexus, it was like a second family. I lovedd that we worked with a close group and enjoyed iving back to the comunity. "

good,"I was able to work on a wide variety of projects while working at Plexus Engineering. Due to the customer focused nature of the work, we ended up entering in many different parts of the project lifecycle, using many different technology stacks. It was a great experience to be able to work with all these different technologies."

good,Plexus es una muy buena escuela donde es un diferenciador del mercado.
good,I would have to say that working at plexus is like a Chinese sweatshop you work really hard and make a piece rate depending on how many products you make in a specified amount of time.
good,Work must be done right the first time. Daily shipments. Quality control on all product shipped. Supervisors share feed back an teach proper production methods.
good,very competitive environment with a continuous appetite for business wins.  the culture has transition from a balance work environment to a more focus on work and less time with family time.

good,Gran oportunidad de trabajar dentro de equipos multi-funcionales teniendo la oportunidad de conocer el impacto de mi trabajo en otras áreas de la empresa. Libertad de acción.
good,"Siendo una organizacion matricial la considero una experiencia enriquecedora para poder aprender a trabajar en equipo manteniendo un balance de poder dentro de las areas funcionales.  en la medida que uno se hace multidisciplinario puede hacer mejor su funcion especifica.  La parte donde se complica es donde los paradigmas controlan y cada area defiende su parte pero, una vez pasando esa barrera el trabajo es gratificante.  he disfrutado mucho de trabajar con diferentes espcialistas en diferentes areas haciendome un profesionista mas integral con un enfoque de procesos y de trabajo en equipo."
good,Have to be a people person and be self motivated.  If not it's not for you. If you treat this job as a hobby you will get paid as if it's a hobby but work it like a business and I mean really work it you will get paid well.

good,this was a contract job for me. I loved it there. It took time for all the employees in our department to open up but once they did we all had a good relationship. My manager gave me a hug when I left and wished me well. The items that I purchased were transferred down to Mexico for the buyer down there to order. Thus I got laid off. manager took me out to lunch for my moving on.

good,"Mi jefe nos comunicaba de alguna actividad para realizar durante el día. Visitaba las lineas que tenía a cargo para asegurar que no tuvieran problema con el sistema para abrir ayudas visuales. En caso de que hubiera algun problema se le daba seguimiento inmediatamente. Acudiamos a la junta diaría de producción, meramente para conocer el proceso con el que trabaja la empresa. Regresando a mi área de trabajo, revisaba posibles cambios de ingeniería, que se reflejaban en la ayuda visual en esperapara subir a sistema."
