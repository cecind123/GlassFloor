rating,review
bad,"Horrible company, only promote you if you play the politic game, management will not help you succeed, inconsistent on rules and regulations.. Senior mgrs will tell you one thing then tell someone else something different"
bad,"Benefit: over 250$ A Week.(Trash)"
bad,They need to pay better for the job they provide. They are not felon friendly. The traveling around wasnt bad at all. The mornings are the hardest. I didnt like it very well.
bad,"The job is ok if you have no life and no family, mandatory 6 days a week and no such thing as off on weekends. No time for anything else, its either work or sleep"
bad,"The administration not good  no keep promises they never pay me the referral check asking to be transferred they do nothing for you the account manager playing with his cell phone all day long, and a lot of preferences with drivers. This company needs to review their management. Poor minds for a big company"
bad,"60+ hours work week, plus extra work you get to do at home?! You got it!!!  Management tells you to do one thing, then someone calls and complains about what you did, and management pretends they have no clue what you are talking about?!  You got it!  Would you like to be threatened to be beat up by your employees AND your direct manager, as well as endure constant racist, sexist, and homophobic remarks?!  Then JB Hunt at the Home Depot in Pittston, PA is the place for you!!!"
bad,"Under pay and pay cheat.low ball Ga employees...starting pay from Ga residents 40 cent per mile."
bad,Management priority to drivers who have more time working there. While the new ones get no work or less work. Lost money working for them. That's why they have a big turnover of drivers.
bad,They truly dont care about their employees.  Erratic schedule.  Never know what time you will be done for the day till that morning.  Hard to make appts or have commitments during the weekday.
bad,They will let you sit for hours and then tell you to call it a day. Dispatches are very disrespectful and planner don't know what they are doing. That makes this company very bad to work for.and favoritism is very high.
bad,"It sucked when I first started working there in 01 it sucked in 03 , 05, 07 2012  can’t believe I worked there five times lol dumbest thing I ever done"
bad,11 years I decided to a company I had to walk away from due to a toxic environment and bad favoritism. Benefits weren't good management is horrible. Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Although this company is big and has lots of benefits they have the most judgmental,arrogant,unprofessional management I’ve ever experienced. This company promises one thing but does the opposite. After working there 2 years an being the recipient of driver award(no accidents) I was let go for a miscommunication on scheduling/fires via text/and then they lied to employees unemployment just so they could deny me my unemployment benefits."
bad,"This company though it’s big An has lots of benefits they have the most judgmental,arrogant,unprofessional management I’ve ever experienced. This company promises one thing but does the opposite and lastly after working there  4 years an being the recipient of multiple driver awards I was fired for a miscommunication on scheduling/fires via text/and then they lied to unemployment just so they could deny me my unemployment benefits."
bad,They work you hard feels like ur a slave and mostly everybody takes drugs there and have criminal records didnt feel safe at all they only hire mostly Spanish immigrants
bad,Drove three different states and when payday came nothing was in my account.  Then when I called they said let me put you on a list..  a list of people that didn’t get paid also.  They finally gave me a comp check that I had to cash at a truck stop.  Then they charged me for cashing it.  So too much of a hassle I quit then tried to say to say I abandoned my next load
bad,"Company is always in flux, zero ability to have a work/life balance until you get to director status. Your life is the company and the company is your life. "
bad,JB Hunt is a terrible company to work for. Don't waste your time. The pay is always short. The managers are rude and incapable of doing the drivers job. The hours are lousy. The potential earnings are mis-represented.
bad,I worked in the office with minimum people of color. I worked at the location for 3 years without a title change. Wont let you move up if you are not a white male. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!! This company is for the good ole boys ONLY!
bad,"Not a good job at all...This place will lie to you from the jump,don't trust them at all...No hours,no runs and NOW they have some new dispatchers are young and stupid."
bad,"It was a complete joke. Unappreciated, poorly compensated, overworked and underpaid. If you want a life outside of work, this is not the place to be. There's better. Anywhere but there is better"
bad,This job is way harder than it needs to be due to poor management. This company does not care about their employees. They lie to you in training. They over sell the job and promise you set schedules and advancement but this is untrue. Once you get on the floor your schedule changes weekly from over night to morning shifts. No room for growth unless your friends with upper management. Upper management is non exsistent on the floor that is why it’s terribly ran. Promotions are given primarily to Caucasian employees. That is a fact.
bad,Lease purchase is a joke to be honest. There is a load board but it's so limited it's a joke. They still try to dispatch you and have a attitude if you want to pick your own loads. It's amazing how you can look on the load board and nothing is available but you can let them dispatch you and all of a sudden there is freight it's just not on the board. I tried talking to managers but no help it's just a joke
bad,This company is the worse driving job I ever had. Management walks around like they own it all and your are at there disposal. I would not recommend this job to my worse enemy.
bad,Just about everything that Driver does wrong he can get wrote up for but if the office does not take care of the drivers there is no difference for them
bad,"Poor"
bad,"You make great friends within the company and the day to day is fun. However, there are Lots of new and inexperienced managers. Not flexible with working mothers who have kids. I got in trouble once for having to go pump after I returned from maternity leave. I was told using the mothers room was a privilege not a right."
bad,"Another company not wanting to feed the oxen. If all commercial drivers were to immediately end their employment with all carriers who pay by CPM, the trucking industry could be restructured where drivers have labor rights and adequate compensation. Very sad indeed. As always, only work here if you are homeless."
bad,I worked there for 16 years started in Louisville ky worked there for5 years then transferred to jc penny dedicated for 2 yrs then transferred to south gate intermodal that was the biggest mistake of my career with jb hunt they were awful travis the manager there was unfair and dirty I will never go back for as long as I live.
bad,theyre by far the worst trucking company ive ever worked for. everything the recruiter offered me they went back on the second they got me in the truck e weekend and not answer their phone.
bad,"They are Just, SorrySorrySorrySorrySorrySorrySorrySorrySorry,SorrySorry4 putting fr8 on trains, instead of hiring more drivers, to feed their families."
bad,"It was a complete joke. Unappreciated, poorly compensated, overworked and underpaid. If you want a life outside of work, this is not the place to be. There's better. Anywhere but there is better"
bad,"Delivery drivers are a miserable lot, always complaining and if their issues weren’t resolved promptly then everyone paid the price. If ur smart look elsewhere"
bad,"The worst thing is the managements,  they are racists,  they are like mafia , every dispatch has his own drivers,  all the good loads go to a special drivers ,"
bad,"Check your paychecks, they will short you every week. On their truckload division you only get abou 1,800 aweek. They will tell you lies like it's a slow time of year it will pick up etc... all lies, it never does. Don't trust anything they say!"
bad,"This company hauls American freight with non American equipment. Truck driving company that's corporate headquarters does not have parking for trucks and trailers. The terminals outside of corporate are  where the drivers are taken care of. The terminals, trucks, and trailers are cleaned by an outside vendor whose employees are undocumented workers, making less than minimum wage and not required to be drug tested. The driver managers are college graduates that have never even been in a truck. These managers will tell seasoned drivers how to drive, with no prior experience or knowledge of the open road. Bonus plans are set up yearly, but employees are not paid off of information released to the public. Videos are made to help driver managers understand a drivers life. Apps have been made to try and limit the amount of communications between you and your manger."
bad,Did not have a very great expierence. There was no training at all and I had no work. About the only work i had was filing and I had way more skills then that.
bad,"This company advertises.46 per mile. Problem is you will Not get enough mikes to earn a decent pay check. EVERY JB driver that I come across is singing this same song. Oh and let me not forget to mention, ITS FORCED DISPATCH here as well. Time off requests completely disregarded or they penalize you by snatching loads away.  There is absolutely no regard given to a driver. As long as you have a pulse you Better get your load or they threaten you with termination. Driver manager only concern is you making the company money. They're very rude. Horrible company."
bad,"the company did not offer enough miles to make a decent living. otherwise the management was fairly easy enough to get along with. in my experience with other large trucking companies, this was midway."
bad,"JB Hunt came to town and took over the shipping department, Had to join or leave Joined. Some times it paid well others not as good. Some jobs really tough."
bad,Worked extremely hard for a company that does not fairly compensate.  Work/life balance was not good.  I felt taken advantage of as I worked and gave the company my all.
bad,"This company is no different than any other company, they tell you what you want to hear. When you get here it is toldly different. Contract is not a walk away lease.They are trying to force older trucks with high mileage on independent contractors. No trucks are available for drivers in orientation."
bad,"I was emailed for a dedicated route in my area with home every other day. I was currently driving OTR, so this was perfect for me. I completed all paperwork, passed urine & hair drug screening was set to begin orientation. The day before orientation I was notified by the recruiter Olivia McNeill that the job was already filled. The only explanation I received was that other people completed their paperwork before me. After speaking with other people, I was told they didn't have enough equipment. However, instead she offered a 25 day on 5 day off Amazon route. That was the gimmick all along, since she knew I had resigned from my other job. I didn't ask for that and refused to settle for it. "
bad,Do not believe anything you're told they lie about everything they make everything sound wonderful until you meet the dispatchers and then they act like they're better than everybody else and that you're a burden to even ask any questions if you can get somebody to answer the phone and answer you calling texting doesn't work they have you do a lot of running around to get even in a truck and once you see the trucks that you expected to live in unbelievable it's worse than a prison cell horrible company wish I would have never listen to anything that they told me
bad,Managers and upper management dislike employing women and people of color.  If you are white then you are given decent treatment and advancement despite being dumb or illiterate.  This company loves to hire and promote robotic people that are afraid to challenge the status quo.  Ignorant racist company.
bad,"Management is constantly being shifted or moved, so every few months you have a new manager that does things their way.  Then six months later, it is the same thing again.  It gets to wear on you.  The company expected all salary people to work at least 45 hours a week and 50+ being standard.  This causes home life to become strained.  You don't know when you are going to be able to go home for the day."
bad,"poor  management, nothing good about this company, home time sucks. they never get you home when they say they do. i would never tell a friend to work here. ever..."
bad,no room for advancement and no concern for drivers. Just the product delivery. Safety to them only means the safety of there equipment and loads. insurance was to expensive and room for advancement.
bad,The dispatchers are rude and lazy. Its like pulling teeth to get anyone to answer you. Out for 3 weeks and will have you sitting all weekend waiting for loads. and pay was never correct.
bad,"So the dumb people ""in charge"" don't really care about you or your well being, I was a contractor doing deliveries for them, they only listen to the customer's ""side"" of the story."
bad,To much politics and could not handle it. The company does not care about there employees. The best thing that I like about my last position there was taking care of the drivers because I know how I was treated over my career and I didn't want to treat them that way and the company didn;t like that
bad,Very unprofessional. The management was very mean and was always unprofessional. The management was never available to talk to escelated customers and would make us lie to the customer.
bad,I was with this company for almost 6 years before they fired me for something someone else did...and all you get is the run around from management...avoid this place if you can
bad,i think its a little bit excessive about the way the drivers and managements favor all the drivers who dont like to work hard they want everything handed out to them easy
bad,to me jb hunt is a joke there out for themselves and not the driver i will never go back to them ever again and with there people would quit calling me
bad,the biggest problem was the management was lacking understanding of the industry. the pay was not good at all . the fact that you drove a different truck daily.
bad,"Long hours, no pay for hours."
bad,I would not recommend. I can not describe how terrible this employer is because indeed will not allow it. The truth is ugly. .........................
bad,They lie just to get you in the door. You will not have a life they will try and make you wok 13 hours a day. I was promised day shift and after 4 months told me I was going to have to woke nights and weekends.
bad,Very stressful job.They do not  appreciate good people they have working for them. Christmas they don't do anything for you.  Work long hours and do not get enough rest.
bad,"there wasnt any miles "
bad,i plan to leave real soon  very physically demanding lifting 700 pound refrigerators through a small  ramp by myself.  Look for another job instead of wasting your time. money will not add up. especially if you have a family you need to take care of. Disrespectful managers to was what turned me off about this company.
bad,"Management plays alot of favoritism with employees,strong racial discrimination from some management and drivers with nothing bring being done about it and alot of intentional product damage to get out of work by employees......."
bad,I could not stand the lying at this company. Did not like the driver manager at all. He always told me one thing to get me interested then change it later. Gave me the worst loads at the worst places on the map. Leave stranded at places for days without a load to get out from.
bad,the hour suck and the runs suck thay cheat you out of your pay and the mangement does knot know what thay are doing thay treat there people like crop and dont listern to the drivers and dont keep up on the mantance with the trucks.
bad,Not a good place to work.  Managers a not qualified to manage and they really have no clue on how to work in the transportation industry .  To many rule that are very useless in nature.
bad,poor management of home depot dedicated account .sat in shop with broken down prostars all the time tried to get management to take me out of international pro junk and put me in afreightliner they would not do it and i quit
bad,The rail yards are bad because if your box isn't loaded right on the chassis then you have to find someone to fix it and that may take some time. If your box is blocked by another box then you have to find someone to move that box to get your box.
bad,Class b employees no pay class A little work big money management sucks bad has no clue you get paid like a 1970 rate and there is no way to keep track steer clear
bad,pay and benefits are subpar and all you are is a body behind the wheel to make them money. They don't care about there employees only making money. Lousy company
bad,"The hardest thing to understand was why, when you're allowed to go no higher than 40 points a month for safety bonus, they never explain to drivers what may cause problems, like, not filling out a load tab on your QUALCOMM each day. that adds 1 point to your score each day"
bad,I have no idea could not get pass the orientation. What I did experience the folks there do their best to get through. I had a difficult time getting pass the physical.
bad,"This company may becoming one of the biggest trucking companies in the US, but they do it by treating their employees and customers like garbage` There is always a problem with their trucks arriving late or showing up to the wrong location. They seem to be far behind with time on their software. Their attendance policy is retarted. I wouldn't ever work for this company again."
bad,Have worked here a month. Sad sad sad. Recruiter totally embellished n she didn't have to because my expectations were so low to begin with. Lol no miles. Poor planning. Have a family vacation scheduled in 8 weeks. Hope I don't go broke before then.
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for hands down............ Place is run by a drunk and a bunch of immature college graduates who graduated with below average grades.
bad,Poor driver to dispatcher relationship. Poor respect for drivers and our life. I wouldn't recommend working for them.
bad,"If only there was negative stars option .....There is a reason that there is thousands of negative reviews from drivers about JB Hunt and it comes down to one single aspect of management. Management feels that drivers are not human beings. Day one, was lied to by the recruiter (most recruiters for most trucking companies do it now though, so get EVERYTHING in writing in advance), should have known better but I needed the paycheck for my family. I had a dispatcher (fleet manager) tell me ""When you are in the truck you are company property"" The pay is garbage, with average length of haul dropping and no detention until after 4 hours I would routinely have paychecks with a gross of less than $400 when I'd get sent to the north east coast. In comparison the best check I had was for over $1400 gross on south east Georgia Pacific runs after most of those account drivers quit. Average $6-800gross /w depending on area /freight, The trucks are newish, but they are horrible. Can't idle unless the temperature is hot enough outside, so no refrigerator, and batteries don't last long when truck isn't running for tv's, they are as base model as can be bought FL's, and the International's while they have ok options are super tiny which means every bump in the road is felt and they break down constantly. On bad roads its like free rodeo training. The mattresses and GPS are worthless. If you are thinking about driving here and are insanely desperate, flip burgers until you can drive for someone else. FMCSR work arounds on e logs can be a nightmare but are required."
bad,Typical day at work driving around for miles and hours looking for empty trailers to make a load delivery. I learned that its all a game here and all lies you will learn quickly from talking to people that they are distributing dispatched loads to certain individuals. Most drivers are making about 650.00 a week before taxes. Once a new hire catches on to what they are doing they usually quit during training or not too long after training. So what JB Hunt does is they hire a new group of 30 drivers every week starting on Monday to replace the drivers that caught on and quit. Hardest part of the job is finding a empty trailer. Driving around from rail yard to rail yard for hours wasting your driving time and still not finding a empty. Driving around to customers who keep the empties from JB Hunt drivers. Last the company always saying they don't have a lot of work its really slow but goes and hire a new group of 30 employees every Monday or having other companies haul loads instead of their own company drivers. JB HUNT Is a fraud
bad,pick-up and delivery of cargo over OTR Diver preloaded and live shipments perfom mandatory daily vehicle maintenance and safety inspections.
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone Long hours for little pay. Require to much and management sucks!!! Only thing that's good is the Benifits
bad,treat u like a slave work long long hours for little pay they did not give a dam about there employees here in cassville missouri and missy gamit needs to be fired
bad,The management needs improvement.  Dispatch needs improvement. Compensation by the hour would be ideal for a time consuming job such as working a JB Hunt.  You're in and out of rail yards for various times in addition to traveling to the destination.
bad,"I would not suggest any driver to waste their time driving for JB Hunt. Do not for one instant believe their ""false advertising"" you will not make any money and the waiting period for health insurance is 90 days! They are a bunch of crooks, period."
bad,"When it comes to getting a load, dispatch procrastinates and wastes time that we as truck drivers don't have a lot of as we are only getting paid by the mile."
bad,"J B Hunt was not a good place to work. As a driver Recruiter I was expected to lie to driver in order to get them to hire on with this company."
bad,"JB Hunt's recruiters called me and sold me on a dream. When I started working there, the pay was nothing like they said it was going to be. I could not survive off of what they were paying me."
bad,"Its based on an activity pay scale so if the customer is not home or if the item is damaged, or they just dont likenit anymore after 3 hours of work getting it in their home ..you dont get paid . Management does not have any idea of how to do the job sonthey break dotband osha  rules on a daily basis and yes you are responsible if they send you down a no truck zone and get a ticket even if you tell them you cant go down and they try and force you ...and they will ,its a bad job culture from the start they send you into people's homes with anhelper that has never done the job and expect you to take 400 pound refrigerators down flights of stairs and no it does not sound worse then it is trust me. Also there is no way to know if your really being paid correctly and its not anywhere near 40,000 more like 30,000 and a bad back and neck if your really  really really need a job go for it but the turnover rate is about 70 percent you have been warned."
bad,"The worst place to work by far. You have to fight for your money, was misleading about the pay. Clint the manager is no help. Every time he called you your job was threatened , they say 1075 a week. About 56000 a year. Its a lie. They recently had the state of Colorado labor board in there bec of all the complaints from its employees over pay. If you work over 40 hours a week no overtime given. They conveniently switch your pay so they dont have to pay overtime."
bad,"I work for the Final Mile Service Division. "
bad,Typical day was getting there at 5 am in the morning and waiting for someone to open up the door to get in. I learned nothing except that the people were back stabbers and were rude to work with. My co-worker were rude and nasty except one who was very nice. Hardest part of the day was sitting there waiting to go home. There was nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,"Bad company to work for,they promise one thing and you get another,benefits are terrible,they will suck up over $150.00 a week for a family plan and your doctor visits and medications way up there.......you get stuck on the road the service is terrible trying to get someone on your phone is an adventure   and each call will cost you over 30 minutes of your phone...... my grade on this company will be -3stars"
bad,"If you want to work for a company that will never have your back nor help you in any way, then by all means apply."
bad,200.00 to 300.00 per week is all your going to make and your working 12 hours a day or night.
bad,"very age discriminate treats older employees badly,  BAD MANAGEMENT"
bad,"Immature,   extremely baised employer"
bad,"Okay, Where to begin. Well I started with JB in August 2013 and up until 20 minutes ago, I was still there."
bad,"This is high stress, inept management who have a holier than thou attitude. They treat drivers like indentured servants rather than people. "
bad,"This place is a joke you work 5 days a week all day long til 1 or so in morning, the mgmt aint nothing nobody know nothing about driving trucks n want you to drive tired, sick n feet of snow they don't care bout the driver and top of always gives the good loads to the senior guys n the bs to the new people n I tried to hang in there but you will loose everything working here if you don't curse the mgmt out cuz they trying to tell you how to drive a truck and never even started a truck couldn't tell u where the darn lights are....STAY A WAY FROM HERE TRUST ME YOU GOIN TO HATE IT THEY HAVE HAD 7 R 8 PEOPLE FROM MY CLASS COME SINCE OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR N EVERYONE QUIT BY JANUARY I TRIED TO HANG N THERE BUT AS U SEE HIGH TURN OVER NO MONEY EVEN IF YOU WORK 7 DAY A WEEK! !! DO NOT GO TO THIS YORK PA ACCT........n giving them 1 star is being nice that how bad if account n company they are."
bad,"They told me that I would make $12,000 a month in there power only, So I tried it, in 1 month I lost $4,000 of the $8,000 I was already making which bankrupt me. I was siting at truck stops instead of making miles. Don't fall for the hype, it's not true."
bad,"this company Lie and said i did things that i wasn't even there for ."
bad,"I worked for them long time ago and from what I see being posted by drivers,it hasn't changed,slow trucks,bad management,lots of down time(on repairs) without pay,finding fault and blaming drivers always,(management immune to any faults) , and keeping you out longer as much as they can ! yea nothing has changed since I worked there !"
bad,"There is a lot of bullying and back bitting going on in the operations side of this company, which prevents it from functioning as a team.  In addition, the culture is anti-foreigners, even though they do hire foreigners in IT and Mexico operations.  If you have an accent, stay away from this company, because they WILL NOT like you.  Some will make sure you are out of there as soon as possible. So, if you are looking for a true international,  open minded, and forward thinking company, stay away from this one.  They speak in a very derogative manner about Mexico, even though they do business with that country.  Their knowledge and tolerance of other countries, languages, and cultures is low, limited, none.  The nature of the work is repetitive and people don't talk at any level above TV shows, beef jerky, and beer."
bad,"never had a truck available ,waited 3weeks for a truck i just gave up and went looking for something else."
bad,"Pick loads up from rail and del.them and go somewhere else pick up a load and del. it back to one or the other rails in atlanta,ga"
bad,"Told me what I wanted to hear. No miles, terrible dispatcher, slow truck"
bad,Preaches safety but pushes to work at unreasonable pace. Not a family oriented company either. pEOPLE IN CHARGE WHO HAVE NO PEOPLE SKILLS WHATSOEVER.
bad,If you are looking for a work place that apprecates you as a person this is not the place for you you are a number and only a number manegment is for themself and only them self they or the company does not care about you or the typr of work you do. I personaly wasted 3 years of my employment history at this place the work morell is so you make good money put that is not worth the time here
bad,"Terrible Manangment, if you new, short trips no money,!  ....DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE YOU WONT MAKE MONEY "
bad,"Stay clear, got no respect from any department @ this place, including the railroad. Wrote down 24 reasons why I was quitting.."
bad,"unorganized, long hours bad trucks unsafe unprofessional supervisor"
bad,"Didn't make any money, because of excessive repair problems, and poor service department."
bad,I will never work for JB HUNT again even if there the only job on this earth
bad,14 days out from home with just 2 days at home. Bad management who does not care about the employee. Not enough time at. Low salary.
bad,if u are exp.driver dont wasted your here
bad,Not worth the time and effort! The People were mean and very prejudice. Wish I had never left my office job for this. Always overworked with little pay and no raises or bonuses.
bad,"a good job to learn how to install appliances and taking driving serious and being safe on the road,hardest part of the job is going to going up stairs,easy part is meeting new people,and being free to do your job"
bad,I was usually very busy at work on the phones or running reports. The pay was very good and I loved my co workers. They're a great group of people.
bad,"attempted to do the ""lease/purchse"" deal with this company and lost everything i owned. my home, my savings, my health. they run the truck just enough to collect the truck payment and the fuel that you have put in it. sometimes. went for 8 weeks at one stretch during that one year period that i didnt have a DIME comming to me. was able to go home only 6 times that year and two of those were times that i deadheaded home. many trips during the middle of the week with next day close schedule delivery went within 50 miles of my house but due to delivery schedules i had to keep going. they say that you can find your own loads and let dispatch know so that they can keep you moving. yeah, rite. i sat from wed afternoon until the following MONDAY in cincinatti oh waiting on a load. nothing within a 100 mile radius was offered. on saturday i found a load thru a very reputable broker (landstar) that was 12 miles from me, paid about average money, and had a saturday pick up, monday delivery, 600 miles away. was told that weekend dispatch couldnt accept any broker loads. this company is a CROCK"
bad,"Didnt work there long enough, All you do is unload and load trucks with Aunt Millie Bread"
bad,trips of 400 or less a day. very little sleep due to odd hours.
bad,not truthful about their positions. consisently uses deception.
bad,Good for a rookie but dont stay long get your experience and go the management is scared of the customer and will throw you under the bus after the first sign of trouble.
bad,Managment when I was there were extremely immature.  They were very disrespectful to drivers with no regard for family time or if you could earn a living. Favoritism was rampant.  Managment has been replaced since I left.
bad,Managers lack knowledge of a driver's experience of the work load Management staff mistreatment of drivers Never gave an honest answer on the world glow terrible app problem solved
bad,"Home time consist of 11pm-9am.."
bad,"Lack of Load - No make Money for owner operator - Very Hard to deal with Load."
bad,"J B hunt shop employees used to be greeted by management with the Words:"" leave your feelings at the door, and get the job done."" Now it's all rainbows, butterflies,and unicorn farts."
bad,"Its a trucking company what more is there. There is no job advancement, no way to move up in the company, no secure pay in the job. They tell you not to leave if you are done driving, they will move in the office. Well after being there for 3 years and asking to move up when I hit 1 year. They told me that they will keep looking every time I asked and told them that I am done driving please find me a office job in the company. To end this JB-Hunt never keeps there word or there promise or there respect to the drivers"
bad,Anytime a manager say I wish we could go back 200 yrs. In time. Enough said.  Manual labor with no forklift. They have wheel dollies with broken straps. Stay away from  a company like this who allows Good Ole Boys to run their company.
bad,"Didn't stand behind or appreciate drivers."
bad,"Don’t ever work there. Horrible place to work. No work/life balance. Management horrible. 12 plus’s hour work days. They had a work philosophy that was very simple, drivers are to work until they go into renal failure then they were aloud to leave."
bad,"fast paced, a lot of work hours, was able to travel and learn in different settings, most enjoyable was fellowship with employees.a typical day was 10-12 hrs"
bad,"Their retention of employees is horrible, at only 10 months I was considered one of the top seniority people in my area. They change your shift and job location at the drop of a hat."
bad,Management has short term memory loss. If you needed paperwork sent to a shipper they said they were playing favorites when that's their job. You felt belittled when you had to call in to verify   information.Management frequently sent wrong info or they would not confirm   that where they would send you  the container would still be on train slot of waisted time and fuel.
bad,"This company doesn't care about the driver. No miles, lack of pay, lack of time off , they lie about miles, and time off. If you complain about anything watch out for the retaliation , example ( gripe about mechanic and you sit for three or four days waiting on repairs) dispatcher take loads away. This company preaches professionalism, and communication, JB Hunt lacks both of these, and they do play favoritism! If your looking for a good company to work for go else where this company is one of the worse I've ever worked for! equipment Looks good but , your govern at 62 when the rest of the fleet is govern at 65"
bad,The company can be so much more but will never  be more because of poor management and upper management. The Sterling location is the worst location to work from avoid at all cost.
bad,"JB Hunt in general is a good company, The Home Depot account is terrible. You either work 2 am to 2 pm or the opposite. You are required to tarp loads even just to take them 10 miles down the road."
bad,"This company is prejudice of black women!"
bad,The hours are ridiculous and the deliveries are not routed properly which means you'll pass up a location going to another location and then have to back track.
bad,"after was assigned a truck it turns out it was not ready and had to wait a week to get a different one.  I finally got my first load and guess what, the truck breaks down.  It was in the shop for a week.  Well then I got my load and headed for Arizona on a regional run. I got to the scales and received a big fat ticket because my truck was not permitted for loads over 50000 lbs.  I was constantly living in truck stops.  I managed to pay my overweight ticket with layover pay alone.  And don't get me started on the dispatch they gave me.  I managed to stay with them for 6 months and to my relief the truck breaks down again and I got to be with my family on Thanksgiving day.  plus 2 weeks {that's the time it took them to fix the International bad boy.  I took advantage of this time to land a knew job.  Their was more fun I had with this company but I just assume not try to remember it.  When I give this company one star I'm being kind.Good luck and be safe out there."
bad,"Your paid on a activity base scale so if there is anything wrong with the item or the customer changes their mind after hours of work........you domt get paid,you cant read your paycheck  because of the way its made that you cant so you pretty much just have to take their word that its right and the 40,000 they say is more like 30,000 don't expect management to be of much help they broke company rules everyday. ..literally if you need a job bad and cant wait go for it if you like having a back and dont want to lift 700 pound refrigerators with you and one other guy and hour told to just get it done id stay away."
bad,i worked there for 3 months and the entire three months i was their the managment was so unorganized and didnt care about their employees. We rarely had enough materials to do the jobs we needed to do and in the winter when materials got frozen they refused to allow us to put them inside to thaw out.
bad,the office is a rumor mill and the management team is perfectly ok with it
bad,"Do you like being treated like a child?"
bad,I would not recommend to anyone.  Most jobs are dead end with zero chance of promotion.
bad,Run from this company. The reputation speaks for itself. This company has a high turnover and revolving door.
bad,poorly managed operation.
bad,"Hires you then cuts your pay to put you on ""dedicated"" route which you rarely run yet your pay doesn't go back to original pay. I would NOT recommend this company."
bad,"typical day involves calling boss @6am getting voice mail 98% of time,to let him know you are there, or if the handheld locked up and cant punch in,you fax parts list down to get parts since you don't have any local vendors to use, when you go down 2hr ride to get parts,nothing is pulled for you, you pull your own parts,scary when you have more on your service truck then shop has in it in parts! then you drive 2 hrs back to unload into container on the ground which is your parts storage unit.you run out of tires in 2 days which is 20 at a time, then go weeks without them.you run out of parts regularly every week,which is the norm,plus supplies you need,you run out of them to!hard to get what you need to fix the stuff right.then to deal with the dispatchers is another thing! the drivers are entertainment in stupidity!"
bad,"J. B. Hunt is so-so as long as you don't try to transfer or change to another company. The moment you try to change, they will damage your CDL so you can't go anywhere else and you have to fighr to remove whatever they put on your driver's record! Don't ever work for them, they will screw you up!"
bad,"This company was using me because of my hardworking, honesty, but willing to do the best for them. I always ran 2700 to 3300 miles per week, but what I got pay for was about 1800 to 2500 miles/wk. They cut off about 125 to 145 miles per day. I always worked in about 63 to 66 hours per week. I will never get back to this company, jb hunt, never ever👎"
bad,"Terrible pay, terrible shifts, swap seat, old equipment, non personal management, your a number. i worked for rail in san bernardino,ca. By far the worst company i ever worked for. alot of other drivers who had been there 3 or more years looked drained and angry. not the place for me, brief stint."
bad,Never trust the management. 24/7 lying and will toss you under the bus faster than you could imagine nothing was ever good enought they wanted you to falsified  your work to look good on the charts and could care less about anything getting done
bad,"Good job for someone 'new' starting out in the trucking industry."
bad,Too many young kids running boards who didn’t care about your miles. Too much micro management with safety systems in trucks. No training or orientation for some accounts for new drivers causing them a lot of accidents.
bad,"I worked with this company as a loader and scanner operator, definitely where ever you work you gain something. Working here helped me in striving hard to get things done in all ramifications."
bad,I worked as a dispatcher. The delivery drivers were lazy and NEVER made their stops on time. Always late by hours and customers calling mad about this. You would call the drivers to see how much longer and they would never answer.
bad,arrogance ignorance important management characteristics no joke safety man ignorant of safety regs but will write u up in a heartbeat & chastise anyone who disagrees with his dumb a.
bad,They get you in with a promise of a sing on bonus.  You will not see it they will find a way to take the money back . Giving the drivers bad runs that only pay 150.00 to 175.00 for a 10 to 12 hour shift. Dispatchers are always calling drivers to the office  to grill them about any minor driving errors. This company almost made me wanted to quit driving all together.  Will not recommend any drivers to apply for work with jb hunt.
bad,"Arrogant inexperienced staff , threatened the driver with the minimum guarantee on the Amazon account for no reason"
bad,"I worked for JB Hunt for 3 years. Payroll issues started within the first year but I didn't pay much attention at first. Then I noticed and started checking only to find they were shorting my check every week. It'd be different amounts every week but once it was short by $425! I tried to get the issue resolved, gave more than enough time for a resolution and no one bothered fixing it so I left them finally."
bad,"Advertisement said $1000 a week, more like $400 or $500 and yes I worked my full shift. Dispatch is slow, some good ones but they all collaborate each other’s boards. You get paid for almost everything you do except search for an empty. My question was I need a location for an empty. The answer back was there are trailers in the general terminal location or lots or at a customers. Do you really expect me to memorize these locations? I don’t get paid to search for and empty and also not get paid to the amount stated. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. Un organized, un productive and un professional."
bad,"Poor management that don’t care about people below them. They are just moving up the ladder. There is no such thing as the open door policy and there is no such thing as stop work authority. Your opinion does not matter at all. Do what your told to do no matter how dangerous it is. The sticker on the door says dedicated but not one day have I seen any dedication to certain employees while other advance time and time again. JBHunt is the worst place I have ever worked. To many lies,to many people have have their hand in my pocket. First time I get a chance to leave this company I will."
bad,"Lots of new starters from different sectors. If you worked in a market or you were a butcher in the past do not worry Jbhunt is the right place for you. You can work as Logistics Coordinator or Customer Service Representative. "
bad,"Barely able to get by with the hourly wage while being driven to do the work of 2-3 people. Would not recommend working here- no support, negative work environment, monotony and extremely low paying. Management doesn't care either because with the job market you're a replaceable commodity."
bad,Do not work for this company does not care about the driver .insurance is no good and costs way to much. The maintenance on the trucks is a joke they never fix what's wrong.
bad,"Management tended to set you up for failure, limited training with the highest of expectations. Starting position was 12 hour shifts, six days a week working nights. Equipment was not the best."
bad,"This was a recent buy-out & I have not had enough experience to access."
bad,Everything went 2 steps forward and 5 steps back.  Management doesn't care. puts all work on other employees and expects the good workers to pick up all slack of poor lazy employees.
bad,"I had a bad work experience , I was just a number, didn't care about me as a driver cared more about the load. "
bad,"Operations/Dispatch"
bad,"Could have been a great job if (management) over this account knew what they were doing, and had a better understanding of driver need. They acted like the driver were the least of their worries"
bad,"I worked in the road service department for 4+ years. Started out as a hourly MOC. You will be promised salary at a certain point but don't take it as a good thing. Whenever you go salary you get put on 10hr days and the raise doesn't cover the extra 10hrs you work a week. And then there is the management, specifically the MOC manager . He has some major anger issues, even to the point of bowing up to people and getting in there faces and screaming. If he doesn't like you he will get rid of you. They will load you down with enough work that you can almost handle then make you take breakdown calls from the drivers ruining any chance of getting your work done. Every day I was beyond mentally exhausted. You will be put in a cubical with a headset, a phone, and a computer with two monitors. The amount of multitasking you have to do every day just to stay not so far behind that they fire you is insane. I realized after moving up some in the department they viewed the road service guys and the MOC's kinda like slaves. They will run you into the ground for as long as they can and throw you out when you get to your breaking point in exchange for a fresh person. I left for a job paying much less but the stress relief was worth every penny. I would never work for this company again in any of there departments. If you are a MOC it is a pain to take days off. When you come back to work you are even further behind than you were before."
bad,"By far the worst company I have worked for. You have no life, constantly changing your schedule like every week.  They work you to death with little money, cut you hours and have you work more! They never give you raises when you completed your 6- yr employment. I was a yard jockey but the worst job I ever had.. Even truck drivers were quitting more because you alwAys wait for your load even when it's ready.."
bad,id like companys that promote base and merit.my work at jb hunt was ok the pay was rip off
bad,"JB Hunt will ruin your DAC, fire you and fight to make sure you do not collect unemployment whenever they feel like it! I worked for them for four months. The pay was a joke, nothing like they promised, you might get lucky to see 400-500 a week if you kill yourself. No organization, the favorite drivers get the best runs. Save yourself the trouble and work for a company that values their employees. "
bad,"The culture is very bad, the upper management was bad, and the pay was not competitive."
bad,"STAY AWAY!!! This is a horrible place to work. Management feels like they know everything and wont listen to a word the truck driver says, even when the truck driver is right."
bad,I worked for jb hunt for 3 years the management is bad the safety. Manager thinks his you know dont stink the dispatch are rude and they will fire you for the dumbes things they fired me beca i was taking a non nar med.
bad,equipment was maintained
bad,"A lot of empty promises. Recruiters lie, Never report safety violations against a client. Safety is only important when it's NOT A CLIENT. If you want to be forced out report a valid safety issue against a client."
bad,"The office  workers  are all about themselves,  an not about the drivers . The have thear favorite drivers, whom gets whatever they want.  An the average driver  gets  forgotten an the stupid loads. The trks are  very slow the mechanis are not knowledgeable enough.  An the computer system is allways  shutting down.  And they  dont answer the phones."
bad,"When applying for the job it said $1,350.00 a week. Never even came close to that whatsoever!! And when you arrive at work i have stood around an hour and a half not getting paid a dime because my truck wasn't ready yet or someone else had it. Insane i do not go to a job and not get paid!"
bad,"JB Hunt. Is a controlling company to its drivers. No CBs,No Bluetooth audio. Allowed in Co. Trucks. Management average age what I saw was about 28 to 32. College-educated yes. Any idea about Trucking? NONE! Their pay is .42cpm. Time wasted at this Co. Everybody wants to run the account but nobody wants to take responsibility of their own actions. This company was a big waste of time."
bad,The management is very difficult to deal with. The job itself was fine.  Too bad they have lost drivers due to poor management and their attitudes towards the drivers.
bad,"Nothing was as they said"
bad,Company only concern is getting freight from point a to point b. Poor management at ramp...constant accidents with drivers some of repeat but still employed. Not a good company at all.
bad,"Stay far away if you want a stress-free life outside of your work!"
bad,"I am a former employees. I had a dependable attendance and have a great work ethic. I went above and beyond a what was required of me. I had a minor incident with the cruise control in the new automatics, at a speed of 30 miles per hour, and was let go just like that. If you're a J B Hunt employee, you can be replaced at any time for any reason. I am not a disgruntled ex employee but I am an unappreciated one. This is all true and not exaggerated."
bad,"My account manger was terrible, didnt make no where near what i was suppose to make just terrible planning but the account manger"
bad,"The start of your day in the office is opening your computer to a mass amount of emails to respond to.Then making outbound calls to each carrier followed by booking shipments and managing a load board. You also are given things to do by the sales dept. while they chat & play on their phones. By the times all of that is done, it is 3pm & you get to take a rushed 30 minute lunch!"
bad,"After jb hunt treats you to a $6 lunch, beware of the stress and demands coming your way. Forced dispatch, low paying loads and be ready to go to a lot of under construction routes."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of driving for JB Hunt, was getting out with paperwork and being on the road going to customers, and working with the customers. The workplace culture was clickish. If you didn't fit into a ""Click"", you basically didn't fit into the type of employee management wanted. Managers were unprofessional, and talked unfavorably and disrespectful about employees around other employees. Gave preferential treatment to employees that snitched on other employees to get favors. The hardest part of the job was wondering how some of management got their jobs, managers wanting drivers to correct manager's mistakes, and being harassed for trying to do your job correctly, and professionally, and your computer entries being manipulated by other employees."
bad,"There is so much time that I would waste, daily and not be compensated for it. They pay you by the mile and that is it! Management was always impossible to communicate with and they never had any time for you! I would not recommend anyone to work for JB Hunt!"
bad,The c&s a count was the worst. They only care about them self and the costumer. Every one complains about there job and how much they hate it. Not worth working for.
bad,They are the worst to work for this is a company where you cant have nothing else going on in your life if you want to work for them. fleet manager cut cost to the point where we use to make 700+ a week after taxes to if we are luck 600. he cut cost so he was able to get his monthly bouses. this company also does not protect you in any way and you will get blamed for any thing that happens even if it is out of your control so be preprared for you dmv record to get trashed if you come here
bad,mot very good career choice poor hours poor dispatch and overall a poor company and worst of all is the sitting arround waiting on a dispatch
bad,"I worked here for close to 5 years and the people are snotty. it's a definite good ol boys  system going on, and is  extremely political."
bad,plz dont work for that memphis(local is real mess and manager wont do anything about fixing things here this is one of worse place for pay dispatcher watch your money dont have no idea how to talk to you there is only one lady here that we all dont like and if u ever come here you will know who she is big mouth low down lady  slave detention pay to many live load just stay away there better places to work
bad,Rarely any training. No or little raises. Newer trucks to work on. Insurance is too much. The STL shop is in a bad neighborhood. Gun shots were heard weekly.
bad,Pay is different  every week. Very inconsistent. There’s always some excuse for not being paid the guaranteed minimum. Not being paid the promised rate. Seeking a more promising and secure company.
bad,To whom it may concern it was a decent place till they changed a lot of thing and there mangers dont care about there drivers all they care about is them selfs no pride.
bad,Long hours. Away from your family. When  you get out of work your waiting around for your schedule the next day. Short notice on when to come in the next day. Management in West Haven unprofessional. They speak with slang. Your money is never accurate with your check.  Constantly missing money out your check. I always asked for a sheet and never received one.  Place sucks
bad,I loved the company we were contracted to deliver goods for but hated JBH! POOR Mgmt. These big box companies want to drive your truck for you. POOOOR
bad,Stinks having to be available 24/7. It's hard to take a vacation when you continue to get calls from drivers. Drivers are treated like royalty and office employees aren't treated very well. Health insurance was pretty good.
bad,If you want to be a slave this is where you go work. They start up all techs at double minimum wage but all the techs are getting paid the same. The guy that drops the clutches gets paid as much as the guy that started last week and knows nothing. There certain time lines you have to meet for every job. Some are reasonable but unfortunately you can’t always meet them because of rust or minor set backs. If this happens to you then management gets on your case. If you finish on time or before time you still get paid the same. There is no over time only during summer and you’re hounded if you clock out late. Management was garbage. They don’t care about the techs. You’re just another body. You get a horrible schedule to work. Benefits are not bad they’re actually quite good and affordable. Overall this place is the horrible because of management.
bad,"This review is not a nice one cause they work you, they pay just enough to sweek by,so you work many hours,but routes are predetermined to pay minimum"
bad,"It was a good company till jb hunt bought it out. They said NOTHING will change.... well everything did. Even our manager was so stressed out, she was the only good thing about that place."
bad,"work can be really tough, if you're not hands on and not motivated. really long hours and difficult to balance work and life. management isn't that great ..."
bad,"Too much you don't get compensated for. Faulty equipment, loads with no paperwork. Most enjoyable part of the day was going home. If it can't be done with a computer, it can't be done. Too many millennials in the office."
bad,Would definitely avoid this place like the plague. Management does not care about the welfare of their people. They would give heck if you call in sick whatsoever or ask you to cover the remainder of your shift (if say you needed to leave abruptly for a family crisis).
bad,Would never work there again. Forced to work when tired or sick. Family does NOT matter. Left to sit on side of road for 12 hours or more waiting for road service. Company as a whole is sneaky and undermining. Team leaders care about the employees at first but when discovered they get reprimanded and have to stop or get fired.
bad,"poor management , lack communication, poor equipment, hostile working environment, team work is very absent , lack of support to drivers, hardest part of the job is the down time at the job sites."
bad,It was a ok job until new management came in and destroyed how people where working just to control people and get the on there level. the job would have been decent if they would have left the drivers alone .
bad,"They will give you unsafe equipment (Trucks) to go out with and perform your duties. As well as unsafe trailers. Not always but enough so it became an issue. Would send you down into inner city Boston and other areas with a 51 ft trailer. Making your potential for an accident risk that much greater."
bad,"started out as an otr driver, terrible pay, they keep you out two weeks, over the course of a year, only came home with 700$ or more twice, very safety orientated only as long as it's costing the driver, if it's going to cost them or disrupt a delivery, safety goes out the window, fleet managers think they know it all when most have never seen the inside of a truck and don't want to hear anything, they expect you to blindly do what they tell you even if it's wrong"
bad,"This place is very stressful to work at, they make changes daily you never know if you have a job from day to day. You get vacation and pto time if you take it with out a 72 hour notice you get points, You are allowed so many points per year if you go over your fired. All you are is a number at JB Hunt and you feel it. I loved my job there but there policy's were so unfair, after 2 year's working there i was let go for no reason they fought me on unemployment and lost.. There's more but would run out of space."
bad,"I still work for JB hunt,  but I am looking for another job.  I've talked to other jb hunt drivers that have been working here in Houston for 6-7 years and no one has got a pay raise. I'm sure the company has charged more for freight during the last 6 years,  but I think the profits go to the share holders,  not the drivers."
bad,Not a great place to work. Very high stress in large volume accounts. Nothing to do in low volume accounts. No middle ground. Absolutely poor training. Drivers are babies.
bad,"This job was a complete joke.....YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME driving local, intermodal, or otr .....bottom of the barrell pay trust me"
bad,Raises are almost zero. They will start you out at good pay but the raises are horrible. A lot of politics and the benefits are expensive and horrible. If you have a family you will never advance. Family unfriendly company. Stupid attendance policy
bad,JB Hunt in Romulus Mi. is a horrible place to work. The management is Racist and have no respect for their workers. Good people have left and are happier for it.
bad,They are a companys' company. No more comment. this review should be voluntary and not required
bad,"I enjoyed my short time with JB Hunt although when stopped on I-5 and hit by a speeding tractor trailer, I was put through living THE RINGER by this company and its insurance carrier Liberty Muual. Althugh the Law states that you cannot be terminated when on Workman's Compensation, they terminated me before I finished my medical injury recovery and play with my finances all during my hospitalization and recovery. In the end, I do not recommend anyone work for this company whose only belief is that they are above the law and when your injured your just a liability."
bad,"While being a good company, it's main issues are within the management dept.. I enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers, the shop and facility are a good and clean workplace. However, management routinely micromanages all the way down from the regional director to the shift foreman. Work is based off of standard repair times, if you go over 1 minute you are given a warning and after that can be fired for the same or different offense. Management is selective as to who these policies apply to and what policies they enforce. Management is never consistent with regards to policy or procedure. It can be very difficult to get time off regardless to how much time you have accrued or whether you are a salary employee it is totally a shot in the dark. Shift schedules are day and night shift either Sun-Thur or Tues- Sat. except for special employee's."
bad,"Was fired while I was on military leave...was waiting for a local position I was in line for..could not go back to OTR when I returned, family situation."
bad,"Its not what you know, its who you buy a pizza for ( management) to produce a better pay check.  Pay offs are always welcome.  Low miles for local work."
bad,Good pay but demanding hours. Can get bonuses if the account does well. Benefits are decent. Not a good work life balance. Upper management shows no appreciation to their employees. Company culture is not good.
bad,You would have to be in MA before a certain time but you would get to the yard and have to wait on getting a truck because you do not have an assigned truck. So potentially you can be late for your route.
bad,"You will love them or want to burn the place down. There is no middle ground."
bad,"I left because it turned into a cut throat environment. Many dishonest recruiters had spectacular hiring averages and received accolades, while honest recruiters struggled and were oftentimes written up for bad hiring averages."
bad,"Pc miler rip off"
bad,"Overall, it is a great company to get projected into a multitude of things that you have to self teach yourself through. Problem is overall lack of career development and a very short term view of the business. Corporate culture is phenomenal, field culture lacks complete sense of structure."
bad,"ive had the problem when working on their home depot account, the people at the stores dont make calls to costermors before the deliveries,...wrong/short orders and it takes time away from the driver when he must deal with mistakes from store.no support from dispactch"
bad,"A typical workday includes a whole lot of waiting to get in & out of  railyards, searching for empty trailers, waiting for dispatchers to respond to your messages. Management really doesn't seem to care about your problem unless it becomes their problem. Co-workers are outstanding! The hardest part of the job is settling for less then what you're accustomed to meaning; maintenance is slow & ineffective with a total lack of accountability for items needing repair but deemed unimportant enough to fix. Trucks are the lowest quality bare bone base models without any amenities for driver comfort. The company has no ability to place drivers who do not smoke into trucks that have not been smoked in because they absolutely refuse to place a new driver into a new truck. Drivers who use a CPAP device as treatment for sleep apnea cannot be forced into these older trucks that others have smoked in previously as it totally defeats the whole purpose of using the CPAP device and would contaminate the unit causing a need to be replaced. Furthermore How can you provide those drivers who do not smoke with a smoke free environment when the maintenance personnel have been observed smoking in the trucks as they are working on them performing in-cab repairs where they know a driver has to work & sleep. I have personally seen this happening while waiting for my truck to be repaired"
bad,"long hours, management wasn't there is something went wrong"
bad,"Horrible place to work! Constant: backstabbing, theift of tools, people wondering around looking to steal time from you by doing the easiest assignments, with biggest rewards...as everything is timed proportionally, but most,(Especially), new team members can't reach their time because of such actions taken by their senior members, and unsanitary!"
bad,"Left Jb for poor pay, was given a offer at another company for better pay. Put in my 2 weeks and the maintenance supervisor spoke with the regional director. After 15mins the supervisor returned informing me that I have been terminated. Did all the correct steps but still wouldn't let me finish my 2 weeks. Besides that there are clear signs of discrimination, There are new hires with no experience that are receiving higher pay than guys who have 2-3 years of experience at Jb"
bad,Jb hunt will ask you to allow them to contact your current employer and will tell you everything is good except the company you work for set you up for orientation and then after you quit they will not hire you for something petty BEWARE
bad,"I drove for this company for 4 months then left. I was hired for a SE Regional act then a dedicated act. I was told I would be home at least once a week on the Regional and every weekend on the dedicated account. "
bad,"The job within it self, They want tell the truth for nothing I learn to just do the job, Management I never meet co works I didn't know the hardest part of this job was if you got back home when they say you would, but they never tell the truth just deal with it traveling around the world was the best part of this job."
bad,"not good they say one thing and do another . they tryed to mess me over. they tryed to mess me over coming off hometime. many. then if theyu run a load to lerado , you best believe you will sit down there a two or more day making no money waiting for loads to pass custom and your name goes on a list of driver that are already waiting on loads."
bad,Not interested is a very bad place to wprk . They don't honor seniority . If you really want a job go somewhere else . Don't waste your time with this company
bad,"The recruiter said that I would be able to make $70,000 a year. All lies I am making $16,000 less than I was making at my previous job. And I have been there for over three months and my benefits still haven't kicked in. If l knew that I would be making less money I never would of came to JB Hunt."
bad,"Jb Hunt."
bad,"Started out on the Georgia Pacific fleet 6 days out, reset at home. Average about 2500 to 3000 miles a week wasnt bad..Then tried the Georges account for more home time. The place was a joke. fleet managers had no clue what they were doing, Favortisim was unreal. Racisim was unreal. They let the employees run overtop them and everyone else for crumbs.They can't keep anyone there longer than a month. Had to wait three months to transfer to another accout ""no way"" I got outta there fast. Tried to lie on my report and say they terminated me when I quit. Stay away from JB, the old timers on the radios are telling you the truth."
bad,"Management is a joke. You can hit your numbers but if the girls in the office don't like you. Management will come to you from not fitting in and not being part of the ""culture"". Also, you can be busy working and have a soccer ball kicked at your head by a manager if you are not paying attention. my first few weeks received little to no training as a result of the manager in charge of training was not in due to the world cup being on and he needed to stay home and watch the game smh."
bad,Short and simple my point of view...i started out with an otr company it wasnt for me...got a ltl job with no experience was cool...was well  Compensated for my work if there to day would be at 27hr...jb is a joke they expect you to give 14 of your day to only have a take home total of 600 at week...my opinion if you older and just still want to drive ok..but if you young and trying to start a family...LTL GO THERE
bad,"Work on weekends with no over time pay,     3 years and only $2 raise.   Touch load average lbs 75-90. 5 stops.  And load cardboard to bring back to warehouse for recycling."
bad,"On call 24/7 to demanding customers and pain in the butt truck drivers who know that there is a supply shortage, you can advance very quickly in the company but work/life balance is non existent"

bad,"When I first started with J.B I was on the regional Intermodal , had worked my way up to local. Was on local for a good year..then things started changing on the night shift.. they replace good people with people who cheat you out of money you suppose to get paid for doing activity duties. They threaten a person with their job for not doing an unsafe delivery. Overall look for something better . Jb hunt use to be a good company to work for. Now it's ran by prejudice people in Atlanta and they look out for the good ole white boys."
bad,"J.B. Hunt is not a good place to work, management is great but the hours they make you work for a little pay is ridiculous. You would be better off working for yourself. The longer you work there, the less you get paid. When brought to the management/corporate attention, nothing happens."
bad,I was recruited by a recruiter and not fully explained the job. I left a good paying job with the false promise of a better paying job. They will fire a whole department with no remorse. Think long and hard before you come here.
bad,"i have worked for this company 3 times. first time only because they took over account, second because I didn't give them a chance the first time, third and last time on a different account and location. all they want is to run you every minute they can and compensation is minimal. I average less then minimum wage. I will never go back."
bad,Management sucks. Pay sounds great until you add up your hours and see Walmart pays better. I run local but put in more hours than Otr drivers. Your family life does not matter to them. You work six days and they work 3 to 5 days
bad,"jbhunt trucking co. taken over special logistics trucking and then we where hired and gotten new auto trucks and computer systems pay rays "
bad,"Towards the end of my employment, i basically got scolded cus the last fleet manager i had (which i wasn't aware of due to a change) told me he had recieved a few so called 'customer complaints'. I wasn't aware of either! I always made sure i used the macro to send in a Service Alert which dispatchers always tell you to send in when running late. It's never been an issue til the last week I was there that all these customer complaints started coming up and basically if i got one more id get kicked to the curb. I didnt even know this new FM for more than 5 minutes when he told me this! Or those complaints for that matter. I had to call the next customer myself to let them know i was running an hour late for the next load. It was all good no problem. But upon arrival, shipping/recieving guy told me that no one from JB let him know i was running late. It was right there and then that I realized JB Hunt never called the customers themselves to let them know I was running in late. Not only do I have to let JB Hunt know I'm running late but now I have to personally call the customers to let them know at what time I'm going to be there and then call JB Hunt back to tell them that I let the customer Know Myself! There's no way a customer complaint can be credible if JB Hunt doesn't do their part to let them know about my service alert. Unreal. Basically new FM fired me outta nowhere and left me stranded in Ohio, had to pay $1,000 to get home myself. I guess all I have to say at the end is make sure you have some money saved up to get home because they will leave you stranded!"
bad,Constantly waiting around in Massachusetts for loads got to called every day for a load  if u lucky you get one if not your a spare sitting around waiting and not getting paid west haven office is a joke no one answers their phone you call and call they don't answer why do they even have a job is beyond me
bad,"Mechanics will break stuff for giggles, others will save your bacon.   Very difficult system to figure out what and how you are getting paid other than what People Net confirms you got paid for (you get a check, not much else in writing).  Peope Net is not as good as Qualcom, if you are out of a truck too long they will slip seat you or put you in a sardine rental car to go recover someone's mess."
bad,"I thing that if you don't mind wating around for hours for a truck,"
bad,"Terrible way to earn a living. Drivers are not held to a professional standard when addressing their ""so-called"" managers. Pay is too low for the lack of respect and work life balance."
bad,"JB Hunt is an ok company to work for if you can get on the right account, which I was not. And watch your paycheck because I never made over $350 a week and I was working between 12-14 hours per night. If you don't make more then that in your first few weeks don't waste your time staying because it wont get any better, they just like to waste your time saying it will."
bad,They push you to the absolute limit legally. Not supportive of drivers. Great place if you are a veteran though. They treat veterans great and simply put up with the rest of us.
bad,driving a tractor trailer over the road.needed more miles than what they were willing to dispatch me on.management was all about co.and not the drivers.

bad,"•Provide delivery service to companies all over the East Coast."
bad,My truck has over 500.000 miles and is the nasty equipment I have ever come in. Almost quit on the spot. Drivers cant figure out the eletronics in board. Very complex.
bad,No morals or values.
bad,no company facility in the area to help resolve any issues which I understand. It just makes it hard when you have to travel 3hrs to a facility for company issues.
bad,long work hours no scheduled breaks no pay raises not enough vacation management has no idea how to manage professional drivers or how to route the daily assisgnments
bad,If you a manager and if you don't tell on other mangers there you wont ever get promoted . You have to be young to get promoted that's when you are the Vice President favorite . They for the drivers and don't care about the managers. .. you don't kiss butt they over look you quick
bad,So much work for little pay. Hardly any paid time off. The bosses don't value your effort. No opportunities for advancement. Long hard hours and I never get to see my family.
bad,didn't last long. company kept me out longer than I was told. Truck broke down all the time. Sat at mechanic more than on the road.
bad,"In my experience, this is the worst company to work for. There main concern is the customer, everything else, then comes the driver.  As a jockey I had plenty  of hours,(good pay), but I had to go Over the road and that was a mistake for arranging $1000+ a week, I went to $400 to $500 a week. Lasted 2 months."
bad,"Honestly speaking it's a job. You only get a penny per yr raise. Up to 15 paid days off per yr. Will hassle you if you need more. Will believe an angry motorist over you. Only things good were my fleet manager, & guaranteed 2 days off a week."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you like both making, and spending time with your family... if you work enough hours you will make decent money but in order to make decent money you have to give up a lot of family time. i worked 12-13 hours a day 6 days a week in order to get the bills paid and maybe take the kids to go do something fun on Sunday... Health benefits are really expensive and are only good for the employee being insured alone... this isn't as much of a family friendly company as they claim."
bad,"Long hours, unreasonable expectations, unsafe working environment, poor working equipment, and low pay and these are the high points of the job. You must be able to work well with the public."
bad,"Hired for the Texas Regional totalnightmare. They fail to communicate important information about loads. (cancelled, appointment changes, different drop locations) I started off making a decent check every week but, pay has gotten lower and lower. Not making what I was promised. They also advised you would be home every weekend but they make sure you're never home before Saturday morning then schedule you for early Monday morning. Dispatchers lie. Management doesn't follow through. Complete disappointment."
bad,"I was greatly appreciated for the experience they gave me when my career started,but i probably wouldn't go back it isn't for a family man who have a wife and kids home,no  pay incentives when i was there only paid miles no sick days or personal days!"
bad,"Work life balance is non-existence (10-16 hour days).  No advancement, and no development by leadership team.  Operations managers poorly skilled, and provide minimal support to others.  Expectations are that you do not have a life/family, as you won't see them often. Benefit cost greatly increasing, bonuses shrinking, and staffing not growing with added business."
bad,to many politics in intermodal. lousy benefits and management in Memphis is a joke. long hours short pay. use to be alright until management changed.
bad,"I had many safety concerns and when I voiced my concerns I was ignored , and when I persisted and eventually fired over a forced dispatch overweight load."
bad,"Produce as much in the 8 hour work day as possible, only look out for the company, management mico-manages and has excessive management staff, not knowing what to expect next and knowing that you get to leave after your 8 hour shift is up."
bad,"12 t0 14 Hr Days, Account Manager Confritational, Job is easy not hard work just long hours if you don,t live close, bad pay spend to much time working for free"
bad,Management is impotent.  Salarys need to be increased due to cost of living. The advertised average pay is not reality. This leads drivers to feel they have been lied to and resign.
bad,You were just another number and the management was horrible. They changed your schedule all the time and on short notice. Benefits were not the greatest.
bad,was on home depot route you were lucky if you found a truck to drive for that day never had paper work ready to go long days which aren't bad if your making the money  you should be making
bad,"Drivers are treated with very little respect. The tools needed to be successful as a driver leave a lot to be desired. For example, the route navigation loaded into the OBC is not dependable and the company doesn’t appear to care. The fleet managers do not respect the drivers and often times are not a subtle to assist when drivers need help."
bad,"You're just a number & slave to this mega company. Managers are young inexperienced know it alls who have no desire to learn, nor better themselves."
bad,When I began working at JB Hunt the atmosphere and day to day life at work was enjoyable and you got the feeling that the management wanted you to succeed and truly wanted the best for you. Once the management change was completed the company no longer cared for the employee.  Each quarter the company would see increases in profits and revenue but the employees no longer saw a bonus and their yearly raise was poor at best.
bad,I was let go from this position back in June. There is no ac in the warehouse no exhaust fans extremely hot temperatures and you lift way more than 100lbs. There are about 600-1000 items sometimes that need to physically be moved and put away then loaded back on the truck in the afternoon. The account manager is not there for the afternoon shift and has no idea how to run it. The helpers are unreliable and generally do not speak English and are replaced weekly. Your in charge of staging and scanning out all products for the next day while babysitting these helpers who can’t help you. Then when you do the ykk it’s a nightmare. In the summertime you unload about 3-4 trucks a week filled with window glazing products which weigh 50lbs to 150lbe. After unloading the trucks you scan in these products tag them wait for the office to run  the order through the system so you can scan it out and put it back on trucks to go put. Sometimes you have 5 trucks with 100-300 pieces. Not a good company to work for. When I injure myself in December I couldn’t work for a month I was never told what to do so I stopped in and dropped my doctors note off to my manager he was not there of course. So I made a copy put it in his mailbox and sent him a text letting him know what was going on. I called and texted him weekly it no respond. I couldn’t get my elbow fixed until work acknowledged that it was a work related injury. A month later my elbow felt better got a note saying I was ok to return to work but still no answer from account manager. I called the office in Arkansas and immediately after I received
bad,The account manager was requiring us to bring a back hole from LA and it was not in our contract. We therefore spent that much more time away from my family. Sometimes I got in at 2 p.m. Saturday and 5 p.m. Sunday I had to be in bed to rest for work. Not much Family Life Time. And that was on my restart
bad,"I’ve been an employee almost  2yrs. Got hurt on the job, tried to seek medical attention and was told to go on my own called Worker’s Comp. and was denied then spoke to the insurance company for Jb Hunt do to this bs elf test still in pain I wouldn’t recommend this place to no wine they do not take of the drivers"
bad,"Specifically, time off days I signed up for. The drop and hook dedicated account required more work maneuvering than the average drop and hook dedicated accounts I worked in the past. JB Hunt hid this fact during its orientation."
bad,"Poor management, not enough loads to keep four drivers on the account busy.  Favoritism shown repeatedly to two of the drivers (they were rarely required to take time off when loads were not available for all four drivers)"
bad,Management is not honest with employees. Poor work life balance. Co workers are generally cool the hardest part of the job is payroll. Best part of the job is helping drivers get to their goal.
bad,"load truck for work day, drive various distances to multiple locations state wide, installing appliances, furniture, equipment etc. "
bad,"The workplace is ok when the ""snakes"" are not crawling around. The work environment is horrible! They treat people bad."
bad,picking up containers and delivering to various customers.
bad,"did not like it. Had to move containers from different rail yards, or some times go to customers to drop off load."
bad,picked up loads at railroad yard and deliver to customer then get loads from customers then take to rail yard.
bad,Endless grind of monotonous uninspired morally degrading work. Poor management at best. The management has no idea how to lead people to work hard so instead they try to scare people into working harder. Since i started at this company the atmosphere has become more and more depressing to a point where hearing about somone colapsing due to blood preassure was a weekly occourance.
bad,The company says it is driver oriented and safety concious however the management running accounts are all college grads with no idea of the real working world. They have little regard for drivers and their lives only caring about getting the work done at any cost.
bad,I was terminated by JB Hunt Aberdeen It was my fault. They had drivers begging for the best routes. job paid .47cpm/30.00 per stop in the five months I was there on roughly 5 occasions no tractor available until one arrived. It was ok for JB Hunt to screw up your time. They have a monthly bonus for on time no late delivery etc. I was repeatly written up and lost a lot of bonus some because I was uninformed about the situations. It was the Rite Aide account. I was sent to Nj. and kept running into low bridges called dispatch no clue. Dispatch told me to call the receiving company no clue a police officer finally gave me directions.
bad,I worked long hours low pay or inconsistent pay. This incentive based pay is a rip-off. The goal to reach is set high. You are often times left in limbo for your next load especially after 4am to about 7am. This is a position for desperate drivers I won't even say recent graduates. All of the above describes San Bernardino Intermodal.
bad,"JB Hunt is a very traditional company in that it is a 7-5 schedule, 5 days a week, and even on some saturdays. The compensation for the difficulty and amount of work is relatively low to industry counterparts. They have no problem chewing employees up and spitting them out to fill those seats with new people so that they don't have to continue to give pay raises to their current employees. Great people work at this company, yet management tends to overlook culture to focus on the bottom line. While this is understandable, it leaves the people feeling used and frustrated."
bad,There was no room to park personal vehcile at location.  The hours were long and they never got you home for your hometime as promised.  Benefits were very expensive and salary was not adequate
bad,"Just a good old boy company with lots of tobacco spit bottles, nepotism, cronyism, failing up of management, where physical and verbal abuse is tolerated and is ran by hateful miserable people."
bad,I was a local p&d city driver dedicated to New York City I got some really good experience running the boroughs but everything else about JBH was not too good. Once you get some City p&d work under your belt let's say for 1 year or so it will be enough to move on to a better company.
bad,Having working for J.B. Hunt I know first hand if you want to sit in one location for a few days then this is the place to do it. There were countless times I sat in a truck stop w/o a load.
bad,when I joined JB Hunt Transport I had one year and six months of harsh bad days and the supervisors on the home depot don't have CDL's in which made it not easy for me to work there but JB Hunt does pay well but you'll be under an extreme bad work environment with the flatbed truck and experience hard bad days delivering the cargo while the non cdl supervisors sit behind a desk dictating your every move through a laptop computer. note Everyday was a bad day never good period all they did is pay all my bills and make my finances stable that's it.
bad,"This company is one of the largest in the nation and they know it. They treat the drivers as a number and not a person. when you call they don't want your name, they want your truck number and driver ID."
bad,"Ok place to work, nice hours, good people, management lacks direction sometimes but it goes with the territory. Job security with all the units they have"
bad,I started at JB making around 40 cents a mile and mostly stayed in the northeast of the country. in order to have more home time they can put you on regional ( again northeast ) and they will drop your pay. they will give you a hard time if you idle the truck no matter what the temp is. I was making less than 30 cents a mile when I had to leave because I couldn't support my family. that was long ago so maybe things are better there now I hope!
bad,"This company offers a nice looking job right out of college, but the reality is much different than what you expect.  50+ hours a week with little promotion opportunities if you're not favorited right away."
bad,"Your work day is usually 10 to 13 hours per day, Management works against you succeeding in the company. Hardest part of job is the management who like to strong arm you into doing task. The management  are young kids with no experince in Management which makes it hard to perform job."
bad,"This job has been very stressful, unpromising  financially, very rude managers. Make promises for miles and money you will only see the first months.Always has to ask about your pay."
bad,"JB Hunt is a good company.  They have several drivers with 15 plus years.  The pay is below average.  Drivers don't receive the miles promised at hire.  Equipment is new.  I drove a new truck with under 20,000 miles when I started."
bad,JB Hunt does not take care of their employees. They will work you like a dog until you quit or get injured. If you get injured their insurance will not pay for your recovery. Nor do they have Workers' Comp Insurance.
bad,Work..work..work..avg 15 hr days.....forced to work your days off with NO extra incentive pay.
bad,Not much home time. slim on holidays off with pay. leave you stranded in other states. Need to send a safety message every day. I have other important things to do.
bad,"ok job to work for"
bad,"10 hour shifts"
bad,"a typical started around 1.30 am drive to work witch was about 36 miles away.get to work do a precheck on the truck , check my load see if it was secure in back . Get on the road check see if i needed fuel or not ..drive about 5.5 hours in the truck i had to make first delivery, driving from Smock,Pa. 15480 to washington dc some trips , have maybe 10 stops and they still wanted you back the same day . on time , which would work if there was no delays. my trainer said I was doing a good job.BUT WHEN YOU GET STUCK ON A 6 LANE HIGH WAY AND CANNOT GET OFF ONTIME THEY LET YOU GO . AND BTW THE TRIPS WOULD BE ABOUT 500 SO MILES which would be easy to do if not for the trafic jams. on highway 270"
bad,"A company that promises alot but to get any of it you need a good account manager. The account only goes if the account manager is keen to his employees if they are a company man, then you are in trouble. It is a good company to teach you how to take care of your self as far as checking on your pay and assignments."
bad,"The coworkers that I experienced taught me so many things about the transportation business, and logistics knowledge. The manager at the time was very aggressive and verbally abusive toward the drivers so it made for a very uncomfortable work environment."
bad,"Hr and your driver managers are the same people.  They don't support their drivers when push comes to shove. They don't care about sleep schedule and they don't tell you how many unpaid time off you have. The minimum guarantee isn't legally binding, so anyone looking to see your pay, jb hunt won't say they offer a guarantee. No detention pay. You are always at fault at jb hunt."
bad,"They promise oppertunity and advancement but only if your not in recruiting. Even in recruiting hit a slow drought like everyone normally does and your in constant fear of loosing your job. As a really good military recruiter said ""do you want to do everything right and still get screwed?"" Most other departments everyone actually seems happy to be at work and enjoys the company. Just don't go into recruiting, and if you do, do whatever you can to get out quickly."
bad,"All around terrible management, buffalo terminal is a joke ! Local terminal manager has no experience and lacks common sense! Said managers below terminal manager are just as if not more dumb !! Use to be fun place til local manager ran it as a dictatorship!!"
bad,"Well first of all as with any company in the trucking industry, it seems like  The recruiters will tell you anything you want to hear just to get you in the door, and then lo and behold, and go figure, that’s not the job description at all. Constant harassing dispatchers, dispatchers seem to get off on making you feel small, and they’re always negative. I can’t stand when the company  portrays some type of family environment when it is not at all. You’re just another number you’re a monkey behind the steering wheel.  The trucks are only governed for 65 mph, pretty humiliating on the road. And forget about ever calling in sick, they make it nearly impossible for you to return to work. But that’s another story I really don’t want to get into.  If you don’t mind just being another monkey behind the wheel or just another number, then this might be the job for you. I guess it depends upon the person. The pay was great the benefits are great and the paid time off is great but it doesn’t seem worth all the aggravation."
bad,"I am grateful to have worked there for a few years but the company is burning people out. If you have a family stay far away, as a single person I was exhausted enough with the long hours. I was able to advance faster due to my ability to relocate but if you aren’t willing to do that it is a deadens job. The salary is good for just starting a career but after you have experience there are far better companies to work for. Management will manage by yelling and despite what they say at orientation you will have to train yourself. Start out there but don’t stay there my advice."
bad,If you're a white male fresh out of college then this is the place for you. You're lucky if you get a lunch hour. You're given a brief training session and then you're on your own. You're in trouble if make a mistake because they didn't tell you something in training. The shifts are 10 or 12 hours and holidays are just another work day. No one helps you. No one cares.
bad,the management are too young and know nothing about truck driving. all they know are the computers that they look at all day. the job is extremely stressfuland they expect you to run routes after completing your own route which does not give much time at home with your family
bad,Employees are expected to totally commit themselves to the job. There is no consideration for a healthy work life balance and new tasks/duties are required of you every few weeks in addition to your current ones.
bad,"50 hr minimum per week. Upper Operations Management can be expected to work much more than that. Company phone and laptop constantly has you handcuffed to all aspects of the operation."
bad,"pay is based on pc miler lost 10 to 20 miles a trip 14 to 16 hours a day unpaid layovers. driving in the northeast in my eyes is getting more dangerous, to much stress"
bad,quiet..all business...mininmal training. have to travel which i could not.favorites played.salary so alot of people were always late. played favorites with drivers on who got what loads
bad,Stick you neck out for this company & your head will get chopped off... Drivers beware. You will bust your butt for this company but this company will get rid of you the minute that management gets offended.
bad,"J.B. Hunt has the potential to be the market leader within our industry.  However, despite our positive financial performance, we are struggling to keep our collective head above water because we treat people poorly.  "
bad,This was something I did for the money but I did not enjoy it. They had me working 11 to 14 hour days and pressured me to driver over the speed limit. As soon as I was able to pay off my car I resigned.
bad,"It seems that there is no organization about this company, the pay is not good at all for being away from home.  This would be a grt company to work for if the pay was better."
bad,Delivering materials from one place to another. Management needs to treat drivers with respect when firing them not treating them like criminals. Not allowing the driver to pack up their own truck having to walk the driver to the truck to take medication was the hardest parts of the job.
bad,"Youre not just a driver with them, you are also a customer service representative, Hardest part was being paid for detention, I gave up after 4 tries. Many of thier trailers need work as they are older and have many minor issues. Lost time and miles due to trailer lights. VP of operations goes out of his way to point out problems that are caused and created by the customer costing you lost time and miles."
bad,There is too much down time. The 11 hour clock is not being used to its full advantage. Just coming off home time you should be able to drive and not sit waiting on them to get you a load.
bad,"My initial reasoning for working for the company was to find a confortable life and career closer to home. Over the phone and in all the material sent to me, everything seemed to be in accordance with expectations. When working there it was difficult to earn the finances I expected to earn. In addition there are rules put forward in the transportation industry regarding work rest cycles (drive hours). Unfortunately it was expected for the employee to edit his hours in such a way that the appearance of cooperation was seen on their work schedule. Dispatchers continually quoted incorrect drive times for deliveries leading to overages in drive hours. As a new and inexperienced driver this became to much of an issue and mistakes were made. Unfortunately I was asked to leave the company because of safety concerns. Since then I have reported the company to the FMCSA and DOT, but nothing was done nor will ever be done. I have taken the lesson of not rushing myself for others, yet deadlines must be kept. Also I must be careful when accepting extra work."
bad,"I thought the job would be different. Going into it I was expecting a better company culture and better work/life balance. But the reality of the job was much different from what I was told it would be. The job pays well for an entry level position. Is it an interesting job? Absolutely not. Very redundant work and you don't learn new things day to day. For those of us who yearn to learn, skip this company."
bad,At JB Hunt it is either hit or miss depending on the account. Stay away from the large accounts!! but then again there are small accounts with little supervision. All in all my experience was horrible. Horrible upper management and drivers can be treated poorly.
bad,"The brokerage division will require no less than 50 hours per week.  And you will work at least one weekend every month on top of the 50 hours.  The pay is low, and they hire most of their managers from CH Robinson.  Little room from Advancement.  When you get a promotion, you get more work and responsibility but they do not increase your pay."
bad,The company pushes drivers hard and keeps drivers out rather than home regularly as the state is there plan. They put more intentions on safety as a book sees it than on what job allows. As a driver my job was to move freight from one location to another. I mainly ran from NC to Texas which was route I was hired for then management started sending me to Chicago And Northern States.
bad,"Based out of Elwood Home Depot account. Our mileage starts 15 miles away in Romeoville IL so our mileage is short by 30 miles everyday. Often paid miles much shorter than driven miles, sometimes short by 1/2. Recently drove a run for 176 miles and received 72 miles in pay. Detention often not paid, especially detention that cannot be billed to Home Depot ie waiting for dispatch/ paperwork. "
bad,"0415 come in see if your load is ready and do pre-trip inspection on truck/trailer Fix or call in for repairs on equipment if any, (sometimes there are repairs to deal with (no pay for repair issues could take a couple of Hours and most times you call the 24hr #  for dispatch they don't answer so 0500 they may come in or not). Most of the time you are out of yard by 0500. On most occasions I'll have two drop/hooks loads that are around 100 miles one way with Detroit or Cleveland area rush hour traffic to deal with both coming and leaving stores areas.The real back breaker to this dedicated account is when they added in rout back hauls that was no more pay miles but extended your day 10.5 hrs to 12.5 cause they were live loaded. Management spent more time thinking of ways to make a driver at fault for any thing (hard break recorded on your trk, they write you up then a week later the truck was in the shop for speed o sensor bad). Co-worker for most part was ok, some didn't know how to take their trash with them after using your Truck or calling in defects on trailers they drop on the yard. Hardest part about this job was not getting paid for all the down time cause by the management inabilities to get a grip on the repairs and stopping the drivers who dropped the defected equipment on the yard (these two issues cost me a lot of time and money). And the long hours every day made it real hard for exercising and normal family life. Enjoy ability in this job use to be fun, at the past year I began to think of how much transportation has changed  sense I started 8 years ago. Now it's"
bad,"The driver-to-manager ratio is 20-1. It is required of you to do payroll, discipline, routing, dispatching, observations and inspections of at least 20 drivers and a fleet of 70 vehicles with over 100 trailers. The average work day is at least 10 hours with the need to be on-call after hours."
bad,"I worked for a dedicated account in North Tonawanda, NY and end up leaving after only being there for a month. Long days with not so great pay. I was working 10-12 hour days and bringing in only $700.00 dollars before taxes. "
bad,"The pay is average at best and it seams that the company is always thinking of ways to beat the driver out of pay. At the DCS I work at the manager is consumed with saving the account money which would normally be a good thing. However, his dedication usually comes at the drivers expense. For example we had a yard truck that went down for 2 week during our busiest time of the yard and he made the yard jockeys use a tractor just to save money from getting rental even though he was told to do so by corporate. The contractor pays JB Hunt for 4 jockeys and he employs 3 all to increase his quarterly bonus. Also If you are someone who desires to advance and perhaps transition from driver to manager this is not the company for you. You could have been the CEO of a 8,000 truck company with all the credentials and you will never gain a opportunity to advance here. They would rather hire a 20 something year old kid with a degree and zero experience in this industry over you. I have seen it done 100 times. As a driver you are not allowed access to even apply for other position within the company on company computers. Only other driving positions. They need drivers too bad and have no intention on loosing any even to themselves. Very depressing company to work for in my opinion.    "
bad,"ok ,for now its a job,i cant complain,management is the pitts,but i keep my guards up,they have a lot hireing so it dont matter who leaves,but drivers dont stay long"
bad,"As long as you like being away from home fourteen hours a day, 3-4 days a week, it's a great place to work. Unfortunately, that is not my desire. Family time is important to me."
bad,"JB Hunt never really was stable with pay, they show too much favoritizum, and I just been terminated by them just this pass October over an incident I was accused of, but no one could prove it too me, when I asked them to show me the footage of what I was accused of they coundn't prove but still terminated me."
bad,"The truck will tell on you if you've been to close to someone for to long, it will lock up the brakes if a car gets in front of you to close and starts to slow down."
bad,"was told driver would get help at stores unloading merchandise. only in a few stores, was not told (I felt deliberately ) driver had to take trash from all stores along with damaged/returned merchandise back to warehouse. was told after hiring on, that driver had to move trailers around when route was finished , did not receive pay at final destination  (warehouse) mileage pay ,and 32 $ per stop pay was sufficient  for work done at warehouse."
bad,Transported Goods from AMAZON Facilities located throughout the NJ State & New England Region form Facility to Facility as assigned on a daily basis in a Regional Driver Capacity function.
bad,You will work 50 hour work weeks. Very good on team building and it will train you to become great manager. Safety is their number one priority and their drivers
bad,"Very deceptive info, about job, from recruiting. Extra work expected, without extra pay. No incentives from management. Pay stays the same, no matter how long you work"
bad,"Not going to say its a bad company maybe it was just southgate shop. To start foreman was always on employees back and was threatened by good mechanics. Always had something negative, pay was alright but not enough to live off of. Raises suck, highest raise was 78 cents. Some of the management were borderline racist. I would say the good thing is always got 40 hours a week."
bad,"Management will come buy to do audit's of job performance and will hold you accountable for their set of standards and safety."
bad,"If you like working long hours, this is the place for you. very stressful and tiring job.  Hard to communicate to anyone after 5 pm as you have to communicate with dallas at night and they have no idea whats going on in CO"
bad,"Terrible company to work for..."
bad,Pay doesn't seem to be competitive to similar work in the area. In the past the bonus plan was a good portion of total compensation. As the years have gone on the bonus has waxed and waned. Seems the bonus plan now is set up to pay minimally. Large crux of pay by bonus is taxes.
bad,"Paid by the load. If you hustle and they have the freight, its decent. When they're slow, you may need a part time job!  Management isn't the best, a few are ok. Most are not. Split seating with trucks. Meaning you do have an assigned truck, but they give it out to so many other driver's,  you can go weeks without even seeing it. Which also means your on a different filthy truck almost every night."
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for. You can barely keep track of all the different people you work with in the office because there us so much turnover. Most leave within months, and if they stay that long it's only because it takes time to find another job with the Management at hunt badmouthing you. Pray you dont end up at an account with one of the toxic GM's or you'll be stuck in your position forever. I've seen coworkers literally stuck at step 2 for 20 years. NO EXAGERATION. Jb hunt us where your career goes to die."
bad,"The overall job was ok. It could be better. The department that I was in, we made it fun. However some departments are cut throat. The CEO is ok. Management is ok as well. Pay could be better."
bad,"Not enough pay or home time, not enough mile. Not freindly people. Racist company, poor dispatcher , none far rules, they don’t care about your safety."
bad,"Management personnel are in charge of professional drivers though they themselves have never been a professional driver.  They should be required to have a CDL themselves in order to be able to fully comprehend the roles of a professional driver and before they should be allowed to implement compliance issues regarding their drivers.  If they have never performed the function of the people they are supervising, they can never fully understand the role of those they are supervising."
bad,poor pay at current account manager and company are not driver friendly we took a pay cut and force to work more hours to make up the difference at this account there are three 3rd party and we have to go through them before our manager
bad,"Ineffective dispatching caused excessive waiting time.  I was driving team part of the time, but was dispatched as if we were single drivers.  Lowered our income significantly."
bad,"worked 16 hours plus per day, 5 days a week. very stressful "
bad,managements does not care for techs or mechanics. all they care about is the drivers. when company has meeting to give their monthly updates or how the year finished. they only mention drivers and corporate. they don't take in to consideration the technicians.
bad,I had to move around a lot and was not commpencated  for it.  I was young and getting my MBA but they didn't give me time for school. Worked lots of weekends.
bad,"Organized, this was a good place to work. The fleet was good,OTR was not what I had in mind when i was hired, I signed up to run local, Inter-model, and at the time there was no openings."
bad,"management does not help in making deliveries a smooth process, trucks breakdown 14 hour days almost violating clock reimburstments are a hassle I might as well be working a 10 hr job . too much work tring to make a living working with this company"
bad,ok to work for if u dont have a life or if u just need to get back on ur feets  great on home time and loads management just always wanna ride ur back for stupid stuff
bad,a typical day at work is not knowing what you are doing the management not togther the hardest part of the job is going to the job and the enjoyable moment was nothing
bad,"JBHUNT did not care how you felt. Very Micromanaged, Did not pay well at all. Moving up was not very likely for years.  They never treated us or rewarded us"
bad,"Depending on time and year, work days fluctuate. Peak season days/nights are long and some are short because of lack of work. Wages are paid by work load and not hourly. Raises come in increments of cents not dollars."
bad,poor job poor work enviorment low wages poor insurance new tractors old ragged tralers good hometime  bosseslookingfor infractions to write you up
bad,"it was a good place to work an it had a lot of good people to work around an have nice ,you meet a lot of happy people at this job"
bad,If you want to avoid stress as well as chasing a paycheck then avoid this company and thats just my opinion if you're just starting out in the trucking industry by all means sign up.....
bad,If you like staying at work most of your life and not paid by the hour this is the perfect match for you. If you don't mind management changing your rate of pay you'll be a great asset to j.B. Hunt
bad,Everything falls on the Dispatcher. Either you have a good one that works for you. or you have a bad one that works against you. In my case it was a bad one. but that's not to say that everyone else would have the same experience.
bad,"Its JB Hunt... Need I say more.  "
bad,"Just cannot say how depressing this experience was. I signed on after a horrible waiting period after my final interview, enticed by the pay and the supposed advancement opportunity. The hours were horrible. The TM directly above me was rude, aggressive, insulting, and overall one of the worst bosses I've had. They billed the job as an early start/ early out position. THIS NEVER HAPPENED in the year I was there. I left my house at 6:30 in the morning and came home at 6:00 at night at the earliest. They constantly book impossible lanes to boost numbers at the expense of the employees and upward movement means you give up more and more of your life to this abusive company. The job itself? Prepare for a day of cold calling angry and rude Eastern European carriers who curse you, hang up on you, and debate with you. And the second something goes wrong? Prepare for your boss to yell (yes, literally yell, I cannot overstate how abrasive my boss was) at you that they need answers NOW as you try to get a fifty year old truck driver to answer his cell phone. Just avoid this at all costs and if you are currently employed there as a CSC, I hope you get out soon. Oh, and if they are kind enough to provide you lunch, that's code for lunch being cancelled that day due to a lack of hustle."
bad,I never liked working for them it was just a stepping stone to get somewhere else
bad,its not always greener on the other side of the fence.  they preach in orientation one thing and when out at the account hired for its totally opposite.
bad,"Why you ask? They are dishonest, not forthcoming about their practices, and disorganized. Every time the company starts losing money the drivers end up getting screwed. I received a flyer in the mail after Obama Care was implemented that health care costs would rise and that everyone along with the company would have to share in the increase in costs. It increased $50/wk when the actual cost of the premiums was only $30/wk. The company took advantage of the employees expected increase and decided to start paying $20 less/week than before and allowing the employee to cover that $20/week. They have over 16,000 employees. Saving $320,000/week. Good job guys. Their is no sympathy toward the driver you are just expected to try and complete your route no matter how unreasonable. The pay was good before a recent change (because the company is losing money), the amount you get payed now for the type of work and the amount of hours worked is laughable. The position used to require a class a or b drivers license. Most commercial drivers who have been part of a organized company realize how screwed up the company is and leave. The turn-over rate for drivers is ridiculous. So now the company has no requirement for a commercial drivers license which opens the doors to anyone willing to do the work for the lower pay rates. They expect you to work 12-14 hours/day delivering and installing appliances on a production-base payed system that isn't fair . They may send you out to deliver a 700 lb refrigerator (That's not a typo 700 lbs) by yourself.  They can't keep quality installers (the guys"
bad,"Was Intermodal Driver ran out of Haslet, Tx. Home most weekends. No touch freight! Low pay! Company worked harder at trying to write me up than anything else! When truck went in for service had to get my stuff out of it & get into older truck piece of junk! Will never work for this company again!"
bad,I learned at this job on how to keep my mouth shut because I had called for some directions and when they gave  them to me I had told them that they had sent me to the wrong place but all along the place was right behind me
bad,"Work you hard for little pay."
bad,"the customers are the greatest.the drivers is what make this company rich,and we get very little pay which dont support our family much."
bad,"constanly answering phones, checking on previous inquiries, answering for own decisions. i learned that no matter what decision is made someone will always see a better decision to be made. management will not back your every decision however if you consulte with them before decisions are made they will stand behind their decisions.co-workers were very pleasant and fun to be around always smiling no matter what the day unfolded.the hardest part of the job is the micro-management to many chiefs not enough indians. the most enjoyable part of the day is when you know you made the right decisions and everyone is happy."
bad,"Good paying company , but not enough miles, average miles 2000 a week with them and , slip seat if u want more then 2 days off"
bad,"This was a fast paced driving job. I learned how to prioritize tasks better. I was on a tight DOT schedule to follow or I did not get home that night. I would say that was the hardest part of the job. Management was supportive if you went over by a half hour. But, I felt overlooked being the only female/non Jamaican, when it came to giving out the jobs. Most of the time I was the last one out of 200 people assigned work. I thought I would be compensated more for the 16 hour days I put in on a regular basis. To make 35,000$ a year on top of it was insulting. Every week they shorted me at least 100$. Although when I pointed it out they would cut me a check.  Most of the vehicles had safety issues. My final straw was having the break line pop off driving down the George Washington bridge."
bad,Managers make all the difference. I had one bad manager and one great one. You ARE a number. I did get hurt in an accident. The safety guy yelled at me for a tired mistake. Some accounts for you 14 or more hrs a day and make you cheat the clock. Others care about you. All trucks are broken. Need maintenance badly. Maintenance certifies trucks that have dangerous faults still wrong with steering and suspension.
bad,Poor communication does not truly care for driver ur just a number nothing else. I have heard some dispatchers are good haven't found a good dispatcher on day shift the night dispatcher seem to be better. No respect for driver was told drivers are a dime a dozen per dispatch
bad,"Middle of the road pay, top tier expectations.  Average training,. but ability to advance if you do not mind moving every year or two.  Good place to start."
bad,"Worked very hard for this company. Was not happy in the position, but I still gave all. Company closed the doors on my office with no warning, even though it had been in the works for a long time, I found out. Displaced all of the workers. We were told to move and take another position, or take a whopping 2 weeks severance. Horrible treatment of its employees. You're nothing more than a warm body here."
bad,Lied about pay and when i tried to get them to fix it they refused too fix it. Took  check being low for me to realize they lied about my pay per hour
bad,"The managers are very lazy it is possible to be able to make very good money with this however the lack of communication ,inaccurate order instructions, and just a general laziness of everyone involved makes it almost impossible. This could be a good company however, they are too quick to blame their drivers, will ruin your record, will ruin your reputation for things that are inaccurate bc they are too lazy to  investigate the truth."
bad,"I would not recommend this job for anyone over 35, nor would I encourage women to apply. the work is back breaking, and management treats you like a means to and end."
bad,"Management was average; however, the greatest difficulty was the frequency of short runs and low total weekly hours.  It did not appear that additional hours were to be foreseen and management made no attempt to increase my total weekly hours."
bad,"Don't work here. You are expected and made to work 14 hour days. Management cares nothing about the driver. All the Operation Managers care for is that the load gets delivered."
bad,You put in almost 10 to 14 hours a day sometimes and it seemed like it was never enough and then when you get your check you seem like you was always short and you had to go back in and talk to the manager and get paid the following week for something that should have been paid the week that you earned the money.
bad,"In a big, loud crowded room there are a hundred people. No Privacy. The laceration toon while I was there had bugs on the floor. Drivers and fleet managers were rude and you had to work holidays"
bad,They were okay at the time.Just misled me was told I would be a regional driver but once I got to orientation I was told I would be over the road all 48 states.
bad,very stressfull and dangerous work place  not sure if will be home on time that you should be home not  a garanty to make money while on the road  spending weekend away from family sitting idling in a truck stop
bad,JB hunt nice place to work at first but once u know how the company runs you wouldn’t be so happy the hours are good just the per hour pay not worth it hard labor for low money
bad,"Management is clueless. Promised dedicated routes in state, left state multiple times. Loads aren't promised you may have to move chassis all day, for about 70 dollars that day. Don't work here management will throw you under the bus at the first sign of trouble"
bad,"Supervising drivers, managing routes and compliance. I worked very hard here. Extra days on Sat or Sun in the office was the norm."
bad,"We cannot tell our families when we will be home due to our routes and being forced to stay out to finish our routes. Our routes are long and hard, but we do not receive any help or back up from management. It's a good company only because of the people you work with, being somewhere different everyday, meeting new people everyday. The benefits are not the greatest and unfortunately when you have question about them or the job itself you don't always get the answer your looking for. If something is unsafe, to hard to do for two people, wrong, you still receive no help."
bad,"I never truly had a problem with them until the season started. Not only did they hire far too many drivers, but once the season ended, I was lucky if I was out three days a week. If they had planed it better and not hired so many drivers, I would have been able to keep my miles, and wouldn't have had to quit."
bad,there is a lot of work with this company. Unfortunately the dispatchers are not very well trained at keeping drivers moving.
bad,typical day scaning trailers to dock door pulling the trailers out when they are called out also opening doors for receiver to work on chocking the wheels
bad,"i would come in early to see what needed tone done and prioritize and set up my shift. "
bad,"Was hired directly out of college and decided on this position strictly from a pay standpoint.  The pay is very good and the benefits are also above average but that does not account for the lack of office culture and managing.  Our office was 10x15 and we sometimes had 6 people working in there at once with zero windows.  The managers were money managers that normally did not care about your life outside of work unless they needed something from you then they turned into caring and understanding managers, but that was short lived once they got what they needed out of you.  The training is one week long which takes place in a larger city.  None of the training provided is useful once you return back to your home office.  You will be put on the worst shift they have (normally Wed-Sun 5am-3pm) and stuck there until someone else new arrives.  The turnover rate at this company for drivers and managers is ridiculously high (roughly 60%).  All that aside, they do throw you into the fire and you are forced to learn a bunch of new programs fairly quickly and you become very efficient with Excel, email, JBH programs and other various applications.  Bottom line, if you are coming out of college and have other choices DO NOT work here but it would be feasible if this was your only offer"
bad,Managed truck drivers....a lot of turnover. It was difficult to keep the drivers happy. I worked around the clock!
bad,Expected to work many hours 14 + daily in an environment that is very physically demanding then drive for 30 mins to 2 hours at a time the pay could be better then what is provided. FMS tries to be a jack of all and a master but fails at both.
bad,The co-workers are decent. You can learn a lot but patience is limited you have to learn quick or you will be left behind to fend for yourself. Sever lack of communication and compassion with middle and upper management. Policies and procedures change almost on a daily basis. If you don't cover you butt you will get burnt.
bad,"A typical day consists of taking care of whatever claim issues are assigned to you. Constantly talking with drivers, customers, account reps, operations teams, etc. I like that you get to deal with many aspects of the company and many people there are quite friendly. Doing a good job and going above and beyond your job duties will get you noticed by other departments pretty quickly although your direct supervisor may take little notice. On the downside, they do not have a competitive compensation structure, they are slow to allow advancement, and like to downplay your abilities. If you don't mind being stuck at entry level pay while doing advanced work (going above and beyond) its not too bad, just takes forever to get some upward mobility going. All in all, there are worse places to work in the logistics field."
bad,You work all day for a low pay. Very Stressful. The money isn't work it at all.
bad,"Dont really take good care of there drivers, there pay scale was not intouch with todays competitive wages."
bad,"Basically if you are anything but on the floor working you have to wait for someone to retire, die, or get fired to move up. Also they move your time on specific jobs to benefit them and  leaving your SRT or IDLE percentages less than ideal for raises. Also they have a pretty bad case of playing favorites so much so that the entire shop of 30+ techs acknowledge it, as well as management basically being nonexistent ."
bad,The work days i experienced were 7-5 Very fast paced. One hour for lunch. My manager made the job for me. The best part is having your work shown off.
bad,I really don't have anything good to say about this place I didn't get paid for the work that requires a better pay there was no workers compensation if you got hurt on the job then you just got hurt that was your own fault even if someone else accidentally injures you because of their own incompetence that's too bad management or not very approachable and they have no regard for human safety but I ever go there again absolutely not what I recommend to a friend absolutely not
bad,"Lack of pay, no growth potential, and the work load make this role undesirable. When I took this job the minimum requirement for the role was 12 months and 10 months into the role they changed the requirement to 18 months without HR approval."
bad,"Overall decent pay but will be expected to answer phone calls, emails, and text messages at all hours 365 days per year. Expected to perform round the clock customer service. Managing truck drivers can be stressful."
bad,Went all over the us delivering different stuff did a lot of miles they just wasn't putting me on any money making runs all short runs wasn't making any money had to pull out I had a family to take care of
bad,"Enjoyed the people I worked with, safety was a top priority, pay was decent, we had safety cook outs once a month if there were no accidents, quarterly bonuses given for salaried employees were great."
bad,"Safety Conscious, Good Equipment, Low Pay, Slow Trucks, Great People. Note: Expect to see a doctor for a DOT Physical if more than two days is missed on the job. Good with offering recognition for time with company. Corporate office will mail a small box with certificate, patch and pin for each year of service and may offer a gift of choice if the year was completed without accident. Overall the CEO is only interested in enriching his pockets and the companies bottom line. I know drivers who have been there for years yet still live on a pauper's wage. If you want a pat on the back and a kick in the butt, go work for JB Hunt. And the truth shall set you free."
bad,"Drivers are under paid and it seems that management feels that this is enough to keep drivers happy, well it's not. They want to show appreciation to drivers , pay us maybe they will keep some drivers."
bad,"Very different than advertised, extremely unorganized company.  A huge buddy system and conflict of interest happens all the time. Very unprofessional and for such large company very disappointing.  Admin duties as a 'manager in training' they call everyone a manager in the company. I was on a team of 5 other 'managers'. "
bad,"If you have a family it's a difficult place to work at, if your single and hungry there is money to be made. Extremely physical job, not for faint of heart. 3 account managers within 18 months tells you something.  Equipment subpar,  pay since changed to incentive pay, makes you choose between safety and production,  which is why employees quit often."
bad,They Don't Take Care of Their Own meaning the Drivers that put their lives on the line everyday and they receive peanuts for pay the numbers sound good but they are not the same company that they were when Mr. J.B. Hunt was alive.
bad,"I have personally loved working at J.B. Hunt while I was in college, however, as I am looking for a career path after I graduate, I see that I am looking everywhere but here.  I have had an awesome group of coworkers over the years and I am blessed that I was under the management that I was.  However, as a college student with extreme school loan debt, I have to look for a position with an organization that has a high level of compensation for their employees as well as the opportunity for growth.  J.B. Hunt is an organization that, if you move up, it will take many many years to do so, and you will never reach the level you want to be unless you are on the buddy system, where you have previous connections with those that are already in upper management.  If it was not for the low compensation level for the area, I would probably stay with the company."
bad,"Dedicated account going to San Antonio and back,working different accounts,networking,special projects,when needed,logseetc,"
bad,"Decent pay, 10-14hr workdays. Good coworkers. Not a lot to say beyond that."
bad,"The job was very physically intense. There were times where the employees are expected to carry 4 to 600 pound refrigerators into houses with just two people. There was definite favoritism being played by the management Ford certain employees. Others were expected to do their job as described, while favorites had the opportunity to slack"
bad,"JB hunt has not changed there altitude toward the drivers.  They still talk to them like they are kids, give them no respects,  at one point I eye witness the GM hitting this truck cause he was so mad at this driver.  But the driver didn't report him.  ThThey talk to you in a hostile way"
bad,I really enjoyed working for JB Hunt but the trucks have collision mitigation systems that over ride your decisions  For example the truck will sense a vehicle that it thinks you are going to collide with and slam on the brakes for you  when the vehicle it sees in totally in the other lane and exiting the Hwy. This is very nerve racking. If you do have an accident you will be fired and your driving career ended
bad,Safety was my main concern they also Asked for me to do illegal activities. Wanted to go around waystation’s and pull trailers that has no air breaks. After refusing those loads I got punished and stuck on the worst route we had.
bad,"If assigned to a good account then JB Hunt is a great place for drivers but as with most mega carriers the stigma still exists. If you can find a better job, I'd take it."
bad,"My experience began great, as soon as management changed so did a comfortable, safe and professional workplace. Human resource only cares about moving freight, nonchalant about what you have to do to make that happen."
bad,"The job consists of booking freight with third party carriers and tracking and tracing shipments throughout transit. You track on time pickup, loading, transit time, unloading and on time deliveries. "
bad,It takes up too much too much of your time in a day and does NOT compensate to reflect that. With too little time to deal with everyday living of the average working person.
bad,"It was fun working here, good people, very hot work , and cold. "
bad,"Some teammates were very helpful, others colluded to demean and hinder growth. Overall, it was very uncomfortable trying to offer help or receive help from the senior people as they were only interested in themselves."
bad,Final mile isn't a good position to work in. They expect you to unstack appliances by yourself and haul them into customer's homes without assistance.
bad,Dont like this job and they dont even pay their drivers for a big company like they are. Not the best company to work for and they dont always get you home when you need to.
bad,"My travel time was 140 miles per day to and from work.  Plus the daily driving delivering 2 to 3 loads per day was stressful. 12 + hours a day driving and with no weekends, striving to be home with my wife and children has taken its toll."
bad,This job is made for young men and woman.. You move and install appliances all over Va. This job is very physical and you have no life outside of work.
bad,"Week 1: Orientation HR paperwork, drug, physical test"
bad,was an ok company but I now know why  I have heard the negative things from other drivers about them
bad,"A typical work day at jb hunt is not like no other job; at lease none i've have ever seen before. They treat us (drivers) like we are school children like we never drove a truck before asking questions that should any basic driver should know but do it constantly. They make a easy job hard not by the work that we do but our driving skills are in question like we are not good drivers are something pertaining to that aspect. And the write ups that they issues to the drivers get under the our skins  it get to the point that the drivers don't care no more they will get you from the most simplest thing for ex: the headlight of the truck burns out while in transit,running over bumps that triggers a sensor on the truck . Some drivers deal with it but a whole lot drivers get tried of it very quick. JB Hunt says that they have an open door policy that we driver can voice our opinion about situations but the bottom line it's theirs decision to make about the issue. The most enjoyable time at JB Hunt I'm sad to say is when your day is over and going home and they will still call you asking questions about a whole lot of nothing when you are leaving for the day.        "
bad,Decent co.to work for.Home every night and is treated with respect.
bad,"They’re as great and as bad as any other company. When they’re not breathing down your neck and nitpicking they’re great. But they do not value their Drivers especially the owner operators or Lease purchase drivers. Local drivers make the most, especially intermodal Drivers."
bad,"I started my career with JB Hunt In Driver Personal with high hopes I would advance and eventually retire one day. I did as many positions in the dept as I could to get knowledge to possible advance into management. That never happened, not even considered for an interview... Promotions are given to people who are favorites, they appreciate you when you're doing good but care less to help when you're struggling. Just a warm body who is replaceable. Got to a point I did not like going into work, pay cuts every year and eventually it wasn't paying enough to deal with everything that goes on. Also when you make a mistake you're held accountable at the highest level but when managers make a mistake it's all hush hush. Upsetting that my career there ended the way it did but happier I'm not in the dept anymore. I can't speak for other dept's but the company seems to have good values and benefits but I wouldn't recommend working in Driver Personal unless you like settling and being a warm body."
bad,"A week out of the shop (lowell, AR) after it's inspection the king pin broke off the trailer and the forward collision detection system would lock up the tires on slick surfaces in curves after thanking road signs and overpasses we're vehicles"
bad,"Good for those that need experience, but to make a long career out of this place is ridiculous. The pay was minimal and if you didn't get along with the dispatcher than guess what."
bad,"The actual job has potential if they'd fix major problems. It's 12 hour days with shared trucks, many times I had to wait for my truck to come back. The pay was lousy, I averaged about 13/hr. A lot of local companies factor in when traffic will be heavy for certain deliveries, this company doesn't."
bad,"Your day will consist of sitting at a cubicle for 8-10 hours in a day staring at a computer.  When you do leave work, you are expected to have your cell phone on and respond to issues through out the evening if any arise."
bad,"I'm currently with jb hunt, when they say $60000 a year, they mean it, for certain people. drivers for certain local dcs accounts often pull $1400 a week pre taxes with out the need for special endorsements, and it's fairly easy to get into those accounts if you're willing to move or work hard."
bad,your just a number here! pay is low and people are not as friendly as they pretend.
bad,"I worked for JB Hunt for about a year, they were just an ok company, the benefits were terrible at the time I was there. I can't recommend them considering there are a lot better companies out there."
bad,"To many chiefs not enough Indians"
bad,"working in arkansas in J BHunt has not been a fun experiuence for me, no  good package , no good team support, I wont recommend this company to any one."
bad,They fired me after one minor incident I cracked my right front mirror backing into a very tight spot. I had no episodes or accident prior to this. I would not recommend for anybody to work there
bad,"Don't be fooled if you have a good day, week, or month; this job is a huge waste of time IF your main concern is how much money you're going to earn. You will be deadheaded 50 60 miles into rush hour traffic and all you will be payed is miles (37.5 cents as of 2017.) You're expected to put in 50 hour work weeks minimum but will only average $900. You can make more but you'll be putting 60 hours+ and even then will only make around $1050. I worked here for a year and a half and I can tell you that it's the equivalent of making $16.50 an hour flat. The good thing is getting a day off isn't a huge hassle and you can choose any start time you like so if a set schedule is your main concern this is the place for you."
bad,"Company does not have the drivers back. I recently was told I would not be held responsible for a matter I had been accused of. Safety Manager told me not to worry about. Three months later I was let go because of it, only because corporate decided to pay on the claim. I was never told. management are gutless individuals."
bad,I wasnt at this company long i was hired as a tempory truck driver helper but over all i have nothing bad to say about this company they treated me good there the people were great treated every one equal not a bad place at all just wish i was there longer
bad,"Management don't care about its workers and don't know what they are doing. They have never drove a semi but try to tell you how to drive it. Takes you in the office, gives you a father and son talk with no experience being 24 years old, and don't pay you for the 4 hours it took."
bad,"Fast paced, great co-workers"
bad,"overall company is ok. this dept had payroll problems. weekly route had little variance but weekly pay varied too much. assistant needed more training on figuring pay. when supervisor figured pay I would take home 750.00 to 825.00. When assistant figured pay I would take home 525.00 to 650.00.  "
bad,"I had pretty much the worst experiences working for this branch of JB Hunt. After I left though, things got better because they changed leadership in the main office with someone who knew how to run it."
bad,told you will be making a certain amount and every week just watch your check get less an less. a lot of work too little money.
bad,You get to little pay  for to many hours worked. Some equipment is very old and needs to be replaced. I do not know whay else you want for this part.
bad,"In my Opinion JB Hunt has exactly what drivers need & want, BUT only if they let you have it, they don't just give it to you and leave you alone, you have to jump through a lot of hoops and swallow your pride to get it. Believe me I know."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of getting as many downed units out as possible. "
bad,"Nice people in m department, but the company was run too much like  the large corporation that it was for my comfort level."
bad,Fast growing company with excellent promotion opportunities
bad,"I worked for them in Brattleboro vt. As a yard jockey, the work to pay balance is way out of whack. 16. Per hour is not a lot of money when they keep you near the 45hr per week. The things they have you do.( fueling trailers, door swaps, pretripping equipment, ect... Just not worth it. Jb hunt break down is a joke when you need service on the road. Just overall a bad experience here. Look elsewhere if at all possible. I would consider this  short term employment at best."
bad,"Co-workers were team members not lone rangers, we exchanged phone numbers and coordinated with each other for troubleshooting solutions"
bad,I see a company that could be a awesome place to work but upper management has gutted the culture of the place.
bad,"majority of the loads were 7am del.but would sit for hours waiting on a backhaul.pay is too low not enough miles,no home time,saty out too long to make money."
bad,rail to rail good co-workers company will mess up your DAC report
bad,"The best thing at jb hunt was plenty of work but low pay. They could always complain about yourwork and how you could your job better. Never wrong about anything they say or do, no recreation strictly business all the time.If you need job experience,its a great place to start and move on!!"
bad,"i enjoyed being there because of the manager that i was assigned to. he always stood for his drivers, believed in hometime and always found ways for us to make extra money. the benefits were sensational but there could be no other way because of the industry"
bad,"A typical day of work lasted around 8-10 hours. I worked the loading dock and would load and unload around 6-10 50 foot trailers too the brim. The loads were heavy ranging from 200-700lbs. We lifted this weight using just a dolly and no forklift."
bad,"personal review, JB Hunt as a lot of work to do, as for working Local out of the Fresno railyard, it's not enough work to make a living.  Honestly unless your married and spouse makes good income, its a great place to work for,  Home daily, 5 day workm week, good benefits, but the pay is louzy.  They do like to control your income and spread the wealth to others."
bad,Schedule sucks weekends off lol got one Saturday in 5 months. You will make money but at a cost to your personal life.They will send you to NYC If you wanna go.
bad,They promise EVERYTHING and start delivering less as freight slows. Typical fortune 500 company. You're just a number to upper management. Dispatchers are great. But your job security is in the hands of the top who you never see.
bad,Good Company. Fast pace. Hard to advance in the company. I woud suggest this company for someone to work.
bad,"look for anything that could of happen last night and check your appointment and how is the driver looking, i like to let the customer know if we are running.  Management was awesome my co work became very close team.  i have to say would be Bad Weather the worse. my moat enjoyable days would be everything is on time"
bad,did not like the job because once i started working for JBhunt they had me doing a job a did not sign up for. Had the recruiter told me what i  would really be doing i would have not took the job.
good,"This place is hen freight slows they find the most out of the world reason to try and write you up. Know your worth as a driver don’t let them short change you , literally had to check my pay every Thursday so see what’s missing."
good,"this company is so big they forget about you before long. they sit you too much and way too short distance on dispatches.I like at least 450 to 500 miles a day, not gonna happen here."
good,management does not hear their employees only care about work work work don't matter how much work you put in you are still average in their eyes and they will not admit when they are wrong
good,my biggest problem with JB Hunt is management if you get a good manager its a great place work how ever those were hard to find in my 10 years with the company
good,"Horrible work environment where all departments were at each other's throats, pointing fingers, and not necessarily doing the right things for the Customers or Drivers."
good,"Ran night shift as driver intermodal in Lockbourne Ohio. 18:00 till done, usually by 05:00. Equipment averaged 500,000 miles with BALD tires. Couldn't bring truck to shop because of slip seating and the Day driver would be without a truck. If freight was slow off rail, you might make 30 dollars for the night. Zero communication between drivers on night shift and management because of the hours we ran. Management came in at 06:00 ish, and we were gone by then. We were told we are on night shift as to be "" Out of sight, out of mind"" by ramp manager."
good,They dont allow drivers to drive the equipment but relay on the sensors on the truck to drive the equipment
good,ever since i worked for jbhunt i had to fight to keep loads coming my way cause if i did not stay on top of it they would let me sit for a week at a tume
good,Pay is very hard to understand. Also goes up and down to much. Pay is not  consistent and the management is more about lying to you then being upfront and honest. Other drivers don’t have a say in a lot that happens with day to day operations
good,If you are a punctual and very accurate person that gets put with a very laid back team you will not do well at all. They will throw you under the bus anytime they can. The brokers they hire are straight from college and do not have life skills much less work experience and they are very rude and try to be dishonest with the drivers.
good,"did not like the direction the management was going so I left. the work load is dropping off, and they hired too many drivers. hish level of comepetition."
good,"Place is alright to work,  they usually start off pretty lax in the mornings. Once afternoon hits is when stuff gets serious and work is getting done."
good,"The pay is horrible, and it is hard to promote if you are not working in the corporate office. They do not hire for managers within. The budget is unattainable."
good,"JB Hunt pays or used to pay a great sign on bonus, but they lack logistics skills which prohibit the driver from making money advancing his career."
good,Great opportunity to learn for future companies. You will learn essential things that will help you advance in a company that is willing to pay better and value their workers.
good,First few years were great.The dispatcher and I was working as a team.What I learn was to never ask for a few days off so I could rest and see my wife and kids.The management was only worried about money.The hardest part of the job was being out three to four weeks and only getting two days off.The best part was coming home seeing the family.
good,"I was a lease driver there and I didn't make any money some weeks. It was difficult dealing the different dispatchers. Information was normally delayed, do to miscommunication. Not sure how the company drivers are, but the lease driving program was not something that I would not return to."
good,Good not great. Good place to get experience but not to build a career out of. It’s good to go in get your experience and leave. Management is all bad.
good,Unfortunately this company has different clicks like in high school.  If you are in the in crowd everything is wonderful.  If you aren't then you are shunned even when your performance is tops in the company.
good,"Management, dispatch and salary"
good,"I started off on first shift making 13. I got a promotion by my boss, but then 2 months later my boss was fired. I re applied with another boss doing the same exact job, and I lost all benefits 3 dollar raise, and no overtime.."
good,"Their DCS department is the most awful department you can work. The management is very poor, and good luck getting out of that department if you're a good employee, because they will deny your transfer. I filed a complaint with HR about one of the managers in the department and they didn't seem to care. The manager is untouchable, so good luck. As far as the work, its very easy if you can talk to customers, deal with irrate people and have basic computer skills."
good,"All drivers know every company will tell you what you want to hear to get the driver hired onto their company. Well, it's no different at J.B. Hunt. From recruiters to upper mgmt. mid- management, and lower management. Including planners and fleet managers. Once your in-the company, everything changes. Expect their ""Fleet Managers & Planners"" to talk down to you. Expect those two groups of ""Company"" employees to raise their voices up over yours to put you down. Expect your office manger to stand by their office employees. After all.., you are just a driver and easily replaceable. Stay out of the office! Office personnel are not your friends, regardless of the sweet innocence presented. It's a ""Cut - Throat"" position. Driver against driver, fleet manager against fleet manager, and planner against planner. Being a driver, you will need to fight for trips/runs, fight for miles, and altimately fight for your income. Make no mistake, say something negative against any office employee and watch your income drop in half. The only enjoyable part of working for this company is; once your in your assigned truck...YOU GET TO LEAVE!!!"
good,The job is great for drivers but going local i drove way out of the way and i fealt like everything was set up to use me as a worker and not really a person and if you get injured they will not allow light duty you either work full duty or you do not have a paying job.
good,"J B Hunt is a company for a young man who doesn’t have a family an is willing for your schedule to be shifted around on very little to short notice, plus the staff isn’t very curtious to looking out for the driver"
good,"Pick up at brewery; deliver at distributor - some live load and unload, some drop and hook "
good,run any ware from 100 to 500 miles a day. I learned that over the road was not for me .management was always trying to get more out of you meaning giving you routes that were impossible to get to on time.The people i worked with other drivers are very helpful for the most part. The hardest part of the job for me was staying on time.Although I like driving OTR is difficult at best
good,"In my year and a half at Hunt, I became bitter and grew to dislike my job very much. Pay isn't what it needs to be for what we put up with, and the lack of management skills is apparent."
good,They want to manage your pockets the way they want you to believe you suppose you to make. Pretty much its a starting place for new drivers. They make sure they work you for the little money they give you.
good,"its a relaxed and self paced environment, a lot of moving but not very demanding. management was ok but not very helpful when it came down to helping employees meet there salary requirments."
good,"I was an over the road driver for them, not a lot of time home with family. Got to see a lot of the country yet when it was time for home time they could never get me home on time."
good,"They would give you a list of drop &hook stops for the day which took up most of your legal hours, then you call in to verify your finished and continue to add to your list without consideration of your legal hours."
good,Its an alright job. Just hate relying on other things that you have no control of that determine your pay check. It has nice perks but as does every job has its cons that outweigh them
good,"The old guard has largely left. They got the ball rolling for the new generation to ""improve"".  The new guard apparently feels the need to make their mark.  The current result? It has gone from a good ol boy network to a good ol girl network. "
good,"A typical day at work is a 9+ hour day, moving appliances, scanning the items into location and figuring out whether or not it's going back out to the customer or if it is being returned."
good,"Performs stock and parts checks, document, put stock/parts away, and unload trucks as required."
good,Its a cdl a job only home every night the pay could be better but for who they hire can't really complain this is a place to gain experience and move on I see no retirement with them for me
good,work 14 hours a day
good,"Responsible for completing paperwork for each load hauled, as well as paperwork required for hours of service. Responsible for knowing the rules that pertain to hours of service, FedReg and equipment related requirements. Inspect the load freight in order to comply with weight limitations and how to adjust weight (between axles) in order to bring an overweight load into compliance."
good,"Will not say it’s all accounts on JBHunt. But the ones doing new account unloading tires, I feel sorry for. Especially with no helper. 53’ Trailer full with Truck tires, backhole tires,regular tires and other heavy tires. Unload by hand alone.... they promise you things and it’s not what promise. Also they known to keep the round about time that suppose to go on your over time...."
good,"Energetic environment to work in, very strenuous and fast paced. Open opportunities for OT. Flexible hours and convenient location considering it is located right next to I17."
good,"The company has good vehicles and they preach safety. I worked 6 days a week 12 plus hours a day, dealt with poor management and pay. Management was disrespectful, talked down on you like you were a child, we would work sometimes all day with no lunch break. Couldn't pay my rent with one full paycheck. Just not a good place to work if your wanting to be financially secure."
good,Final Mile your gonna drive around starting at 6 not get back till 6 or later. I preferred to drive most of the time but you have to be a passenger half the time and that seat sucks unless u don't mind being driven around all day. Back breaking deliveries and constantly cheated out of mileage pay labor pay and more...Also you'll probably be stuck with someone annoying all day.
good,I was told by a recruiter. I be dispatched out of jessup MD which is 20 minutes from home after I  started it changes leaving from Aberdeen MD hour and half from where I live
good,I worked with 2 GM's during my time there and neither of them could run the day to day operations.  The last GM I worked for had no idea how to dispatch a driver and he was allowed to not learn any of the processes.
good,I beg and beg to go down south but they ignore me and did what they want.  I told them I had medical problems but felt ignored.  Nice company if you like don't mind being told what to do.
good,"It is a fairly easy job. However, if you happen to have a damaged product that is revealed upon unpackaging, they will try to blame it on you. The routes are horrible and even after being there for a while the route planner will still give you the worst routes and of course the guys that suck up to them and who also cut corners will get the better routes that pay more and get done earlier."
good,"Typical day look to see what arrived how many trucks and containers are in shop. Start ordering parts for what's logged and get as fast as possible. Put all incoming freight away restock floor and answer all incoming problems. Hardest part of day to complete everything in 8 hrs. Most enjoyable part of job is chaos and finish on time. Workplace culture is a little rough various cultures,"
good,"If you like a lot of home time this job is for you. The pay is okay if you don't have a lot of bills to pay, but to make a living here you're going to have to stay out for at least three weeks at a time."
good,"Bluntly put, management was dishonest and manipulative. The work was easy but I had to put in a lot of 14 hour days with just a 10 hour break to make a living."
good,Job is not hard but is fast paced.  Your pay depends on your output. Job consist of delivering coal and stone to the Cleavland Cliffs Mines. The equipment is beat up and needs replacing. They are in the middle of contract renewal or extension talks so I kind of understand them not wanting to replace equipment yet.
good,"Long hours, semi competitive compensation. No paid holidays unless your customer is off as well. limited upward mobility."
good,"Very safety oriented place to work . They need to be realistic on some aspects of their policies in my opinion. Management is not well organized, nor is the communication flow between them. The lack or shortcoming on the two is a great disadvantage on the drivers."
good,"Security specialist to law enforcement."
good,"Great company to work for family oriented. Listen to their employees likes and dislike. Will to changes to help employees apply themselve better,"
good,ok job  if u want to make or get expirience. but to much time consuming and they points system will get you fired out of a job if u have emergencys or if u sick and no union
good,"San Bernardino shop is ran by a inexperienced shop manager manager. with a here today gone tomorrow attitude,very hard to work for, very temperamental with an attitude, no job security,revolving door, and pay is based on how friendly you are to the shop manager."
good,I haven't been with JB long but been around the transportation industry since I was a young boy. Ive  heard great things had some run arounds awaiting change
good,"J.B. Hunt was a great entry level job, however, their lack of proper training in the position and lack of guidance from higher level management ultimately lead to my demise."
good,"J.B Hunt is better than some of the other large trucking companies out there but still suffer from the normal trucking environment issues that make this job less rewarding.  Confused management, last minute changes, lack of support staff, etc...  Pay is ok, but the 10hrs a day minimum work day does wear you down pretty fast."
good,Need more money and hours! They switched management every couple of weeks could not get the route straight which would not allow us to be at home with our family
good,"Good company just not for me "
good,This is not a pay per hour job. This more of a commission. 31 cents per mile to deliver appliance to location. 5 bucks to plug appliance in at location. Impossible Strict route sheet dictated to each driver. All while your TEMP helper riding shotgun seat gets paid 14 an hour and overtime sleeping in the truck between deliveries. Favouritism from management. Great job for single non married individuals.
good,JB Hunt is a great place to work straight out of post - graduation from a university with a Logistics / Supply Chain or Business Degree. There's not a lot of upward mobility.
good,The work environment is  very challenging and stressful at times. It is a great opportunity for a candidate that's interested in the logistics industry and it's very possible to advance your career within this organization.
good,"Enjoyed working with them for over 20 years.  Thought I was part of a really good company that took care of their employees.  When I reached a point of no advancement in my area, I was offered a job with great pay and benefits.  Was a tough decision to leave, but decided it would be better for me in the future.  After putting in my notice, I worked till the last day.  Had over 7 weeks of  vacation and my manager tried to get me paid for it but was denied.  I have went above and beyond many times.  I sacrificed family time and my wellbeing many times.  Up to the last day, I felt good about JB hunt.  My last day was like I only been there a year.  That’s when I realized that I was just a number."
good,This is a good company that will promote an individual if that individual can move where the opportunities are.  A typical work day is a little longer than average and you get calls from your staff throughout your down time.
good,"Leaving my place of resident while it is still dark outside to work and returning home from work at night is a typical day with J.B. Hunt's Intermodal Division. The hours worked are too long, 12 or 14 hours a day. As a family man, this do not leave a person with enough energy to attend church on Sundays!"
good,"Driving tractor trailer from Canada to Florida for JB Hunt delivering various loads from beer to paper products.  Learned how to drive an 18 wheeler, how to drop a trailer and perform safety checks on a my tractor. As long as you were at your designated place on time there was no hassles. The hardest past was usually when you had to help unload. The most enjoyable part of the job was the driving and seeing the country, going through the different states, meeting different people all the time."
good,"nice place to work ,if you can put up with a lot of horse play from managers that think they are still kids., And the driver managers have favorites ,who get all the best paying trips, also some of the women drivers get less miles also if you are not white they will always send you to the east coast   And send all the white to the sunny states"
good,Great Company for individuals to gain experience while working closely with their co workers and superiors. Great benefits. Company has great programs aimed at training future leaders.
good,"This job was enjoyable got to meet people of all cultures. Learned how to time manage. customer service, and use and control of Semi Truck in all situations."
good,"I was happy there at first with my manager, then my manager changed and she did not know how to manage people.  It was awful,, Every time we went to her for anything she would tell us we should know it all ready and then when she was telling us we did something wrong, she would say you can come talk to me if you have questions.  It was a horrible work environment that I was unable to grow in"
good,"J.B. Hunt needs to overhaul it's management and management styles from the top down.  Too many entrenched managers with years of seniority have an old ""maintenance/trucking"" mentality that is prohibitive to the growth and culture of the company.  "
good,"I spent many years at this company.  The training is great but the pay is not competitive at all.  work starts at 7am til 5pm not 8-5 like everyone else. Again, training for the industry is great so ok place to get your feet wet."
good,"Seems professional but if u need the health insurance this company charge a lots of money with high deductible and out of pocket, meaning the benefit is not so good"
good,This is a great company I just feel as if I don't get paid enough for what I do and have to deal with in a daily basis. I'm barely scrapping by every week. And the worst trucks.
good,Takes a long time for advancement even when given the opportunity for training. Non-Union shop needs union behind them which would be the best interest of the workers.
good,"Driving in Chirak(Chicago) on a daily basis is terrible. People cut you  off everywhere. JBHUNT holds you accountable for hard braking or too close following distance when it is not your fault. "
good,"while working for jb hunt I experienced a lot of problems dealing with loads and routes and pay, and also you work on a thin line no room for error expect you to move like a robot don't understand your also human and everybody makes mistakes"
good,"Pay attention: When going through your training DO NOT LET your trainer log you in and out because the person can cause you to get a violation during this period. Make sure that when he is driving, he is logged in. When you are driving; you are logged in. Change your  log in information immediately after getting out on your own. This company has spies to turn people in for things and if you attend any meetings about a union know management will find out. The planners and dispatchers are lazy and love to play games with your money so don't buy anything you can't afford unless you make a certain amount each week. Sign on bonus is given at the discretion of your fleet manager, who may in turn take their time in giving it out. Trucks are always in the shop and never fixed correctly. "
good,Good enter level position.  Room for growth and advancement.  Job quality depends heavily on where you are located in company.
good,"Clock in at 4am-5am, Mon-Fri. grab a hand truck to begin unloading appliances off trucks parked in docks. I learned how to interact with customers in a patient matter. Management was very unorganized at my location, poor communication between management and employees."
good,"With JB Hunt, they offer you a salary with promise of advancement, but the people making these promises actually have very little control over actual promotion. The good ole boy system is alive and well. I decided to make my departure from Hunt after working there for 18 months. I realized that a co-worker had been working at Hunt since the year I was born, and we had the exact same job. A relentless work ethic is almost demanded, with little reward unless you want to stick around for half of your life to get a middle management promotion. No thanks."
good,"the account treated her employees the trash talked to us as if were we her kids, had no respect"
good,JB hunt is an awesome place to work at. the dispatchers are on point and very helpfull
good,Very productive place to work for and that's what I do. ( A Trucker) so  good to do something that I love.
good,I did not work long for company. I found that they do have the work but they expect so much of your time and the salary does not match the investment you put in. The benefits are expensive. The company is MOGUL  in the trucking field yet their employees pay out the butt for them. JB makes and generates billions in profits but does not put back in its employees. I am not saying it's a bad company just could do Better! The turn over is High on account there really is no Personal side to it. TOOOO BIG to Care!
good,People at J B Hunt are nice.
good,people not to friendly
good,Home daily. You get 40 + hours weekly. A very friendly atmosphere
good,"There are loads that goes across I-20 and back everyday an I wasn't given any of these runs. I only got one when I was coming home for time off or for an appointment, or if anyother driver couldn't make it on time"
good,We should be paid by the hour because our time on earth is so valuable and limited. We are regulated by the hour and it's only fair to be paid for our time period.
good,"I loved the people I worked with and for. You work long hours and work very hard, but you also learn a lot. There is room to advance in some segments and the company is growing and stable. As long as you accept the low pay and long hours, you will do well."
good,"They have good core values, but they need a lot of improvement, starting with driver compensation. The pay is horrible, if they improved on that then it would be a good place to learn the industry."
good,"Pay is really not worth the stress on the Target account and there are other accounts in the same area that pay more and you run WAY less...Which gives you the feeling that you're being low-balled. Job description says no weekends off but there are favorites there who do. Dispatch calls you in the middle of the night with your start time while you're sleeping. The runs are not bad but a lot of times you have to think ""ahead"" of dispatchers. They forget A LOT and it will slow your day down for a dispatch.  I actually presented an idea to reduce the high turnover rate and make a win-win situation for both drivers and the account but management wasn't even trying to hear it."
good,JB Hunt has been a learning environment for  me during the course of my commercial driving career.  A typical work day was often slow due to the shipper not being ready for pickup.  Patience was something that had to be learned.  Knowing when to really charge detention was often a challenge as every occasion was not a detention issues.  Overall JB Hunt was a learning experience.
good,Jb hunt is a great job the account with C&S is extreamly stressful.  You work 14/16hrs and go in after your 10hrs. You can't have a life outside of jbhunt. The money is good but this job is very stressful.
good,"Management were judgemental, neither had even driven a semi little one with 52' trailer,"
good,"Unfortunately, my experience has been a disheartening one. Nothing that was promised in the beginning has been provided. Thankful for a job, but not very happy with the department."
good,"Company has multiple departments to work in, so choose wisely.. the department i was in closed down....they put me in another but it wasn't work staying."
good,"Some great co-workers, but many senior leaders were very distant and unapproachable. There is a definite division of  upper leadership and lower workers."
good,You could easily spend 4 hours just waiting for a load and when you finally get a load. It's 12-14 hours long. There's no pay for when you have to take your 10 hour break out on the road. Also during a breakdown if it does not benefit dispatch to pick you up at the time. You can be left stranded for a couple days before they send someone out to get you.
good,"Some departments are really great and others, not so much. There is always something bigger and better on the horizon and they constantly push everyone to reach the goals, some departments treat their people really well and which makes them want to reach the goals, and other departments do not."
good,"drivers are not treated fairly, we seldom get what promised to us, for example, we worked per miles, we didn't have a guarantee salary, in many occasion you don't have enough money to pay bills."
good,"Work load can be overwhelming. Specially since they expect you to cover everything, so you get to wear many hats and cover manager shortages when they are out on vacation or they just haven't filled position."
good,"My experience at JB Hunt was one of both good and not so good. The hiring process was informative, fair and went smoothly and during that time and while on the job, information was always available and managers and coworkers were always willing to help."
good,"Nothing special about this company to set it apart from any other freight of all kind movers. If you have a year of CDL experience, you'd expect to make about $40,000/year with this company as most others."
good,"Work on average 10+ hours a day. Fast pace environment, stressful at times. Advancement is fast tracked only if able to relocate. Pay is average at best. Good company to have on resume."
good,"Managers look out for themselves and the end of the year bonus they get. Meaning, the less money they spend, the bigger bonus they get which means less looking out for you and making you do things that you shouldnt be doing. Also you are not paid enough for the physical requirements of the job and the stressed placed upon you."
good,"This was a great first job for learning about sales and brokerage.  Outside of that experience, J.B. Hunt is an old fashioned company that is slow to react to a changing marketplace.  They struggle to place people in positions based on their success and personal advancement."
good,"Drive 6 hours and take your 10 hour break."
good,I am involved in training two sets of people in our department. I train the Post PDA's as well as the Invoicing PDAs. I also have a full desk to work. I have learned to manage my time very well. the hard part of my job is taking a day off. I love the people I work with.
good,"contract services work not a sure thing,  never know when the work is going to end, and amazon freight is good freight most part but a lot of changes all the time to save money"
good,"Typical corporate management make money,  keep changing for no reason , not a place for a young person to start work they do train but working schedules are not the best odd hours weekends pay is ok ,health care is poor , easy to be terminated for small violations of constantly changing company policies"
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed growing and learning at JB Hunt. It has been very rewarding developing relationships with dedicated partners and drivers alike."
good,"I can only speak for the account that I was on, so this isn't a review of the whole company.  If you like a hurry up and wait atmosphere, then this is the company for you.  You're told your load will be ready by noon.  You show up at 11:30 to do your truck/trailer inspection, and end up waiting sometimes as long as 3 hours.  This was the case about 40% of the time  Then when you finally get to your destination, the load would be shifted, and spilled because it wasn't stacked properly. ie: a pallet of 50 lb dog food  bags stacked 6 feet tall, only wrapped once or twice with shrink wrap(which is basically cling wrap in your kitchen if you don't know.)  If you let management know about the problem, you're told it was loaded by the ""new guy"", whom was new every time it happened."
good,Like any other company.  Didn't seem very loyal to employees that had been there over 10 years.  I have no regrets of the time I was with the company.
good,"I have been here about five months now , they have their ups and downs like any other company. miles are decent not the greatest. The only trouble I'm having with them now is them getting me home for my set home time , I remind them constantly the week before and  constantly been getting home one to two days after ."
good,"good for newbies, since they only ask you for 3 month experience and you get home basically everyday and make a good money compare to over the road companies, but is a time waister job."
good,"Take it from me, this is a Driver Mill if I've ever seen one. Sink or swim is the method of Driver placement with most JB Hunt accounts. Try it out, a the very least you may get some road time in for experience."
good,"Company culture is stuck in the 80s, with 10 hour work days required at all levels of leadership there is minimal work/life balance"
good,"Was basically the role of a telemarketer. Anyone with a High School Diploma could complete that task. At first I liked the work, but it was the same thing every day and got boring over time"
good,"Great pay ... Home every night. Good job. But constent changing management, young college kids looking to move on. Office disorganized and concerned with anything but getting equipment working or problem solving. Need to remove themselves from liability which means they blame who ever they can."
good,"no enough time home, no commuicate i love driving seeing different places.also the pay was not on time, no stable company."
good,i liked it here but it was to hard to get some of the simplest things done. could not talk to road asst or anyone on the qualcom and had to call in for everything. but when you did you had to wait for almost an hr and then it wasnt your company it was out sourced and had to explain alot and took to much time.
good,"night dispatch is a joke, no one answers the phone, never enough staff to answer phones. people net is absurd.."
good,"The typical day for the OTR driver(Company Driver) is not good because you don't get back-to-back loads.  You can waste a lot of time setting and waiting for the next load. I learned that company drivers(OTR) will be very dissatisfied.  I actually had to beg dispatch for longer hauls.  From the beginning,  I was sent to Florida to pick up a truck I was to be assigned to drive.  Upon arrival,  I found a truck that was totally unsafe to drive.  This particular truck had bad tires(Steer tires in place of drive tires and bald),  bird nest,  a cracked 5th wheel,  and totally filthy inside.  Can you believe my driver manager wanted me to still drive the truck?  After rectifying that situation,  I was put into a 2015 truck,  but that doesn't help if you are not being given loads and wasting time setting.  When I picked up the new truck a fellow employee told me not to get excited because ""a snake is still a snake"".  This is what I was told,  and it turned out to be true.  Most of the company drivers I spoke with were unhappy at J B Hunt,  and really wanted to find a better company to work for.  It may be better to be a Owner Operator or on a dedicated account when working for J B Hunt,  because the OTR company drivers are totally unhappy.  I would not recommend J B Hunt to the new OTR driver.  Yes,  ""A Snake is A Snake"",  and I honestly wish I had never started with this company."
good,"Worked Intermodal for 7.5 years and loved the work that I did.  Long hours were not unusual.  Was in and out of the rail yards many times a day.  Learned many tricks of the trade within and out of the rail yard and local customers.  Management needed the most work, unfair at times and biased towards drivers.  Management has since changed for the better.  Co-workers were the best people I have ever worked with and were always happy to see each other during the day.  Many friendships were made there.  Hardest part of the job was the unfair treatment and stress brought on by poor management.  Being able to do my job required management to do their job...many days were cut short because of situations not of my control.  Most enjoyable part of the job was training new drivers to do the job and seeing them years later still enjoying the way they were taught.  Out of the new hire trainers, I had more drivers stick around due to my honesty of the job performance and letting them know what to expect."
good,"Still currently employed with this company.  A typical day consists of dissecting transportation problems that arise with customers of J.B. Hunt."
good,Learned a skill and got good at it.and because of that i went in business for myself.
good,NO work life balance. Twenty- Four hour call. Very little to no on job training. Managed by people with no college education.
good,Co-workers are great and friendly
good,"A typical day at work is stressful most days. If you have a problem you learn how to solve it your self. Management is not a big help, everyone is looking out for there self. Co-workers or cool, the hardest part of the job is just trying to do the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is it not that hard."
good,"Many off the management and support work offsite at the accounts we support. So there's no micro managing from the Sr. Execs. Down side, was my days were predictable and some days I had nothing to do. Because of this they reduced my hours and I was stuck looking for employment again. Also, advancement is tough."
good,load trucks a 5 am deliver to as many as 21 differant customers not get off work sometimes till 9 at night
good,Depending which account you choose to work will have its advantages and disadvantages. Either pay or the work schedule will be the issue. So choose wisely. I would recommend not picking the Intermodal account.
good,"They say will pay you for anything you do(drops/hooks, brake down, downtime,etc) but at the end you are not paying good enough for actually what happened to you or for the things you do.The staff also don't know what is going on with the loads when they dispatch you."
good,It was good we got paid Weekly that’s what I like about it I  was working night shifts so I would have a lot of rest before I go in the job isn’t bad you just moving around a lot
good,"Company is growing IT wise, space constrains to accomodate employees and shifting offices based on supervisor decisions. Work can be a challenge where supervisor just make their boss happy and life of their reportees a mess."
good,when i arrive to work its been 5 different fleet managers the work loads be low and i make less money on them days its always something going wrong no communication
good,In order to be promoted you must move to a small account in a small city in the middle of nowhere. Just because you left work does not mean that work is over. Many times you find yourself at home answer phone calls and emails. It is stressful and the pay is okay.
good,Good company with hard working people.  JB Hunt has a good supporting cast when you need help working on a specific task. Directors and managers look for a good fit when it comes to placing you in a promoted position
good,work was very fast paced always had to trained and hire people while maintaining incoming freight. the hardest part about working at J.B Hunt was multitasking.
good,"It's a good job to get out of high school, however not my dream job. Transferring throughout the company is difficult. Make sure you make friends with everyone. It will help get you moved."
good,"Coworkers and the work itself were fine. However at the SFS location, the branch manager and office manager were just mean and judgmental. It was a bummer leaving, but working with superiors who let their authority get to their head is horrible to deal with. JB Hunt overall was a good company despite them."
good,"JB Hunt started as a trucking company that hauled rice hulls.  This turned into the largest fleet of trucks and trailers in North America in just a couple of decades.  The thinking was simple, Trucks, Loads, Drivers, Big enough home office to make it work."
good,anybody can get a job with jb. its a big company with a lot of drivers and a lot of work. Its all about numbers. its not a company that takes the drivers into high consideration.
good,I just go in and do my runs and try to home as quick as I can. I go to and from multiple railyard and travel no more than 300 miles out. Very easy and relax work.
good,"The ICS business unit is very interesting. There seem to be teams that move in the right direction and make the business a lot of money while other teams are pure costs. The culture is not great, very misogynistic and overall not a professional environment compared to my time at other Fortune 500 companies. In all, I would recommend J.B. Hunt to somebody while warning them of these short-comings."
good,deliver freight timely and safely to customers. as drivers we operate under strict rules and at all times must be safe as it is everything. job can be stressful.
good,Management does not listen or accepts improvement changes from the people who can make a different on the operation. The drivers know more about what is needed than dispatchers.
good,"Good place to learn and gain experience out of college. In final mile division, if you become proficient in inventory you are golden to the company. Hardest part of job is long hours, dealing with drivers and incompetent managers."
good,"It is hard work, i want to be payed for my time an effort instead of being talk down to when i say i am tired do not treat me like a child an question me like i be lying all the time. I work hard do not miss anytime from work but when i call off you give me the riot act you preach safety but when time comes for off time you try and make the driver feel bad."
good,"During summer time there is lots of work, so you have the potential to make a lot of money during this time. I work night time to evade traffic and make more money. This job is activity based pay, so when you are stuck in traffic or dispatch is slow you lose money. You are paid by the mile and load. 27 dollars and something cents for mon-fri shift per load drop and hook. 31 drop and hook for weekend drivers. Live load unload is 41 for weekday and 45 for weekend I believe. 37 cents for weekday and 41 cents for weekend drivers. When there is little work you are given a ton of mt moves which only pay 10 dollars per move. If you are looking for local experience this is a good place to start, but not somewhere you want to be for retirement as income is unstable, but during summer you can make lots of money if you work nights and weekends. That being said you also need to learn the rail and gain experience because if you don't know what to do you will waste hours of work which will be unpaid. You are paid by activity not hourly, so you need to learn to be efficient and learn the los angeles, commerce, and san bernardino rails where you will be picking up containers for deliveries or dropping them there from customer pick ups. Another con is you will never get a raise. The pay is what it is. You can have 20 + years of experience or as little as 3 months and both will be paid the same. It is up to how much you do that will determine you pay check or how much you can do. Sometimes you will want to come in to work hard but dispatch or something happening at a customer delaying you can"
good,"If you live in the Lansing area it a great job Home every day 2 days off a week pay per mile. young crew of dispatchers, overall not a bad gig if you are local or want to live in your truck during the 5 days you work."
good,"JB Hunt requires all full time employees to work a minimum of 10 hours per day, 5 days per week. A lot of employees work more than 60 hours per week. The pay is very mediocre."
good,Work is okay. Miles not consistent from week to week. Good benefits. Pay could be better. DMs need more training on how to interact with the people they manage.
good,All the managers acre about is getting loads delivered ...their slogan or go to line is how many hours left on your clock. Been there 3 years I'm on my fourth manager.
good,Management works to hard at driver retention and less about profitability or common sense management.  So many rules but nothing is enforced at the risk of losing an employee even if they are bad for the team.
good,"To keep it short, the money for being a recruiter or ""CPS"" as they like to call it, was actually very good, all things considered. However, you can do and do and do your hardest, meet their call volume, get X amount of drivers scheduled per day like they want you to, and then whenever they get disqualified for something on their criminal, job, or driving history or they don't show up to orientation, your numbers will tank and put your job at risk. There are quasi-constant changes going on that even to some of the long-time management don't understand the rhyme or reason. Just a word of warning, do not go in expecting an all around nurturing environment. As a recruiter, you're not in charge of your future, and surely don't expect any advancement opportunities."
good,Working there was cool I got home right before bed time with the children and Management had a open policy on your view of things. They try to be fair on the work loads. Some work faster then others.
good,"Work is off & on, pay is up & down. Trucks are okay. But the pay is up & down. There is new trucks & great guys to work with but management needs to see a steady paycheck matters."
good,"I was a project manager at several accounts.  Where I may have been a superstar at one, I was demonized at another.  unfortunately the senior management allows the local management to run wild and make decisions that mostly are a knee jerk reaction.  Hacking and slashing on a whim. Unfortunate at best for what otherwise would be a solid company."
good,Very straight laced workplace that bears a lot of responsibility. Mistakes mean money lost. Jobs are competitive so you have to stay on your game to maintain your employment.
good,"Subject matter expert for Appliances Connection and Tempurpedic"
good,"While job overall is boring. It is an over the road job and nothing to get excited about. I did not like working for the company. It was hard getting out of one location looking for a load. "
good,It was a busy place many different aspects. We did run our own company basically and this was a great experience but we still had our corporate office making many calls for our locations and we sometimes could have done better.
good,Like the Job but the managment was always on a powertrip. it was like they owned you and your family. They did not know how to schedule at all.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the interacting with customers and the pay. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the paperwork mix ups that seemed to happen at least once a day. My day usually consisted of picking up and delivering to rail yards after inspecting the truck. Management was efficient and my co-workers were good hard working people. I learned patience and also got to know the area really well.
good,It was an ok job.  There is only advancement when you live in Arkansas.  The benefits where not the greatest but where also not the worst.
good,i began work at 11.30 pm work tell 12.00 noon the next day the hardest part off the job is the over night driving i being honest the best part is theirs no  psychical labor not to much inter action with other drivers
good,Was challenged daily to figure out how to solve problems with deliveries and making deliveries convenient for the customers
good,"My typical would consist of answering phones, doing computer work, gathering paperwork and information to assist customers, and manage over 90 drivers. It is very straight forward logistics. It can be over whelming, but the interaction and learning about new people can be rewarding, in its own way."
good,Company wants you to manage the drivers so they will be productive and make the company money but so much of your time is spent in adhering to the safety culture and compliance with D.O.T. regulations that you don't have the time to manage the drivers to help them make themselves and the company money.
good,"Overall, I found J B Hunt Transport to be a good employer. There was never any problems with payroll but their mileage pay was lower than their competitors and the amount of miles you were given was low."
good,"JB Hunt Transport is what I call factory drivng.  You are a tool as a driver, and while they maintain their trucks quite well, people for any position there are expendable and easy to come by.  I will say that I agree with a lot the programs and actions that the company takes from a legal and safe point.  Most of it makes real intelligent sense from a logical point of view. However, the working atmosphere can be often cold, calculating, and ruthlessly efficient.  Everything was a driver's fault, period.  The pay wasn't worth the headache."
good,"safety messages and drive to push safety overwhelming!"
good,Many different opportunities with this company as they do a lot of dedicated work.
good,"They are an ok company to work for, have had plenty of work until recently"
good,"This position pays well and provides good experience for individuals coming into the workforce directly out of college. The lack of decent benefits, unusual work schedules, and overall environment is not well suited for individuals with a breadth of experience."
good,If you are a salary worker be prepared to work non-stop with no extra incentive. The management was overall nice however they only cared about pushing you to work more and more. So maybe the nice thing was all just a front to get you to work more.
good,Very good people culture.   Great for people with one or two years experience.   If you look to move up to higher paying job.  May not be your long term job
good,Fortune 400 company but the compensation is poor. Unfortunately not offering competitive wages will make it difficult for the company to retain good employees.
good,"Mediocre company,some loads not paid,truckload does not pay per drop n hook,you get short changed on true driven miles,all your PTO MIGHT MOT BE PAID,no reimbursement for unused medical insurance,no reimbursement for unused Driver Legal Plan,they attach Life insurance to you without telling you and JB Hunt is the beneficiary"
good,rather not say was misinformed of the type of pay. the people were nice and it was a easy environment.  made new friends and was able to get adjusted very quickly
good,Low pay good benefit.. made a bunch of promises to be able to move up in management. Never worked out. Hire as a driver with top notch education and veteran. Company only cares about it self.
good,"Blah is what I will say. The pay sucks n they now to DOT. For such large Carrier, they don't know how to stand up for themselves. Good home time n non forced dispatch but the miles don't compare to the rest of the industry."
good,"Not enough work, lots of favoritism, too many drivers which results in lack of work to some, horrible pay structure. Fleet managers are overruled by senior fleet managers who must cater to their favorites. You get paid for whatever work is available meaning, no guarantees minimum due to lack of work."
good,"Decent equipment, support, pay and management.  Higher turnover rates in office positions than in drivers.  Camera in truck records drivers whenever stopping at traffic lights."
good,"worked 20 years on a dedicated account out of st. louis - first 2-4 years looked good and like a possible growth with good pay, benefits and bonuses. Years 5-10 management changes and no pay increases, but I stuck it out because I liked the company and was hoping for better - years 10-15 bonus system removed, changed years for vacation, changed management often and safety was tossed out the door - new equipment starting to come in years 15-18 but pay still not increasing to match COL and safety really becoming an issue - started to look for better opportunity, really didnt want to leave as I had invested so much time but an opportunity came and I took it."
good,"Many career opportunities here."
good,"JB Hunt has a hard working mentality and culture that can be great to work within. However, to quote my regional manager, employee training and development is ""the wild west."" Employees get dropped in the deep end and are expected to teach themselves."
good,"J.B. Hunt was an alright company to work for.  But when I had a problem that needed addressed, everyone pushed you onto someone else and nothing got done about the issues.  Pay, time off, and benefits were all pretty good.  Just I don't want to work for a company that doesn't back you up when they need you more than you need them."
good,"Culture of driven individuals working to meet the goals of the company. Company focused on growing the technological possibilities in transportation to improve the possibilities for customers, drivers, and employees."
good,"Depending on the department, some positions could be very stressful. Opportunity for advancements. I personally advanced to Safety Instructor within 3 1/2 yrs employment."
good,The job was pretty good as long as I was on an account. When I decided to go over the road was when things got bad. I would sit for days waiting for loads in states far away from home.
good,You Have Good Days And Bad. Management Is Alright. The Hardest Part Of The Day Is Pushing And Pulling 2000 Plus Pounds With A Manual PalletJack In A Hot Trailer
good,"underpaid in every position, work is generally easy."
good,I did not enjoy my time at JBHunt.  There was NO work/life balance and management did not care about lower level employees.  They were behind technologically and did not work on improvement so they can meet their objectives.
good,"An average company to work for, quality leadership is very hit or miss. Work life balance is based on the position but overall is acceptable. Little to no recognition. Decent benefits."
good,The Intermodel side of Jbhunt is pretty good.  They have plenty work so they will keep you rolling.  Set your eta as accurate as possible and you’ll maximize your salary.  Only downfall is in order to make that  desirable paycheck you have to work 12 to 14 hours a day 6 days a week.  It can be really hard if you have a family at home and you can burn yourself out if your not careful.
good,"This is an extremely cut throat job. You are called every derogatory name and cussed at on a daily basis, and your managers cannot do anything about it as they depend on the carriers and drivers to deliver  the product. You have to literally have no emotion when at work or those people will wear you down quickly. I was only there for 3 months and I could not handle it. The other employees were supportive and helpful if you needed it. The office environment was fun, we had a TV on the wall, could watch whatever as we were working. They would toss tennis balls and frisbees to each other. That part definitely helped keep you sane. My managers were great. They were very supportive and wanted you to succeed. They were approachable and easy to talk to. The benefits were good, they provided great medical, dental, and incentives"
good,"Worked as a class B driver and they never knew where they drivers where. They never really had a dispatch to double check in with drivers. Also they allowed temp labor ready's to come help,but they was no help at all."
good,"JB is a good company to work for if you're willing to give all of your time to it. The PTO plan is alright, but you need all the time off you can get when you work 12-14 hours every day and weekends."
good,"Unpaid for overtime, msnagers were terrible. Advanced only if you were a brown noser and would do things illegally. Production over safety in many case. Not a great place to work but steady and benefits were good"
good,I work with a lot of good hard working people.  Unfortunately the majority of the people that work the hardest and are loyal to the company aren't compensated or recognized.  HR is extremely slow to help if at all.
good,I have always heard a lot of negative comments about J.B. Hunt and I was fully prepared to believe them. I was pleasantly surprised to find that J.B. Hunt was not a bad company to work for. I worked 2nd shift so after 7pm traffic died down quite a bit. The management was pretty good and the people at the office I interacted with knew their jobs. The equipment worked most of the time and overall it was not bad.
good,Team atmosphere. Understanding and knowledgeable group of management. Concerned with driver safety. Great training program for drivers. Pay is completive.
good,"verify paperwork and freight. scan and deliver freight at customers request. deliver and install refrigerators, ranges, mounted microwave ovens, cook tops, washers and dryers. also pick up appliances that are being returned. The hardest part of the job is pulling refrigerators up stairs."
good,trucks are pretty good . did not like driving to 5 boroughs but was very good expierence overall. managment was ok sometimes they screw you other times they are good to you! couldnt really complain much
good,The days are long and pay is not good. What they advertise to get you in the job is not what they promise .It's a revolving door for class a drivers. The end of the rainbow is not at this company .
good,"JB Hunt seems like the typical large trucking company. It seems to be more about them and not enough about the driver. low cpm compensation and no structure on dedicated routes. One day we wake at 3 am than 10 am the next, have no clue what you are going to do until the night before which makes it hard to plan your day and harder to get the right amount of sleep. Good job for the single person not for a family man."
good,"A typical day began with the 8am meeting with the Wal-Mart management team, where public humiliation was the order of the day. It generally went down from there.  I have not set foot inside a Wal-Mart since that job.  J.B. Hunt was great, but being on-site at Wal-Mart negated all of that."
good,"In my experience at JB Hunt, there were many opportunities to grow and progress. I felt that there were an abundance of different career paths to take, relationships to be created, and experiences to be had. However, I was in an area that I felt overworked, and I didn't really get a chance to take part in many of the opportunities provided. There was a culture of hard workers who were trying to not just accomplish a task, but many were trying to create a solution to move business forward. Generally speaking, if anyone was experiencing problems they just needed to ask management for assistance. My experience was just a bit different. I had less communication than the average worker, and did not have much follow up in my work area. All in all Jb Hunt is a solid company with many opportunities to move forward, and has a wonderful work culture to really settle into."
good,"This place was decent to me, They didn't really give me that many benefits, but when I needed the day off, most of the time they gave it to me. Over all this is an average place to work at."
good,The problem with this company is that there were never enough empty trailers leaving it hard for a driver to do their work. Getting home time was also problematic.
good,Basic Maintenance painting landscaping things like that. Learned a lot during my time there with all the different jobs I was tasked to do. Made a lot of friends along the way.
good,Steer Clear of J.B. Hunt I was terminated because I changed lanes because a car got on the interstate going the wrong way and I moved out of his path to avoid a head on accident at 0500 in the morning.
good,Working for J.B. Hunt was not bad. 10 to 12 hr days was standard and sometimes 14 hr days when they were busy. I came in with a lot of experience and learned to pace my self. The management was I feel overall good and there was good communication. The hardest part of the job was during the winter months. The most enjoyable part of the job was generally the customers.
good,A typical day is spent negotiation rates and establishing new customers. The mornings are spent covering freight and checking on shipments delivering and picking up that day. The afternoons are spent soliciting current and new customers.
good,"typical 9 to 5 same routine everyday unless dispatch or the warehouse screws you, I've learned how to use the Smith System at all times"
good,"Day to day operations varied due to customer demands"
good,Actively develops and manages a network of outside carriers; consistently ensures adequate capacity for assigned freight; monitors and answers heavy phone activity.
good,Depends on the account you end up working at.  Some accounts are more stressful that others.  Limited opportunities for growth as a supervisor in certain accounts. Pay could be better.
good,"Current work place is never the same day by day. As a third party carrier I was responsible for providing great service, safety, and at the lost possible cost  for our customers, There is daily inter-action with customer making sure we are meeting all exception."
good,Old company with young inexperienced managers.  Pay is less than average for the work and you will work long hours.
good,as good as anyone else OTR Co. what else can I say good equipment but not so good home time.
good,"if you are not looking to drive a lot of miles or if you're looking to sit it as much as you drive then this is the company for you. Very easy to work for. No touch freight. Approximately 2,000 miles a week.if your happy making between 400 and 600 dollars a week then call a recruiter today.Company does not drive all 48 although they say they do.  trucks equipped with electronic logs. also equipped with wingman and rollover sensor. The electronic logs are not that bad but the other two items make the truck very hard to drive and wlll get you in trouble with safety and will negatively impact your driving record.. basically they are not much different from any of the other government subsidized companies. They are big so they can afford to have you sit. I was in over the road truck driver and the worst thing that they would do that would totally agrivate me off would be to send me to the rail yard and move around empty rail boxes. They would pay you $100 meanwhile you're losing 500 miles over the road because that's what you could have accomplished that day. They do not have enough over the road freight to keep all the drivers busy. they're big money making part of the business is intermodal or rail boxes. Next time you see a train pull out of Chicago or any other rail yard look and see how many JB Hunt boxes are on it. That is where their money is. Over the road is it not a priority for j b hunt driving."
good,"good miles, regular work week, good mgmt. If you're looking to get off the road, I'd recommend a dedicated run"
good,Work days are 12-14 hours a day. With a mandatory 6 days during holiday periods. No holidays off. For the most part management is more concerned with getting loads out then anything else. The hardest part of my job is having to miss all family holiday gatherings and being required to work 14 hours a day and passing up on spending time with my love ones. The best part of my job is the income.
good,very hard work 6+ hours a week not able to see family as much as would have liked
good,If they had managers the understand logistics this would be a much better company
good,"Plain and simple, the transportation industry is stressful. Most shipments are time sensitive, and for that reason, things can be very stressful and many things can go wrong during a shipments run. Worked with great people, and had fun, but in the end it was not the career for me."
good,"JB Hunt is a very good company to work for as a solo. But not as a team. They have very good lanes with lots of time on them. The staff are very friendly and helpful with any questions or concerns. The dispatchers are very reliable and understanding. People of diverse background and cultures make for an interesting place to work. The runs within its self were very educational, and at times full of adventure. I enjoyed working with this company."
good,Average work day is 14 to 16 hours long. Absolutely no family life to be had. No regular work schedule.
good,"The position was very fast paced, but the resources were availble to succeed."
good,My typical workday was easy and challenging. It was a good job. The company had good safety classes and year round training.
good,"Overall, there are some major benefits to working at J.B. Hunt, but they don't outweigh the grind that a typical day at work is. As a member of operations, there is room for advancement, but it tends to come extremely slowly within the company, as advancement opportunities are based almost completely on tenure and not on performance."
good,"great company, iam a over the road driver, but JB Hunt is a rail outfit, so home time basically not exist, home time is something iam after now"
good,Very relaxed environment but promotions are not merit based.
good,"Manager was fair, listen to what you said"
good,Plenty of work and job stability. Pay is average at best and could much better based on the number of hours dedicated to the job.
good,"Being with this company on and off since 2003 I have seen this company change with the times as we have had to do in the ever changing logistics business, ALthough the changes as with most company's is not in the drivers favor. As a driver i am the front line and should be respected more than I am. I appreciate the hard work that goes into finding and booking freight. Transportation companies should seek more people who have been on the front line. Who better to work with than someone who has had the experience of the other side? There are drivers who would make great office personel and are open minded to every situation and weights the risk such as myself. Overall I feel the corperate changes that affect the day to day operations are important and have been effective. We all work together as a team and if there isn't someone that is willing to work with the team they should be emliminated from the team and seek other oppertunity's."
good,"Our day starts at 05:00 am, unloading a shuttle and loading our trucks. We deliver to retailers and homes, and also install appliances. Ive learned to use small handheld devices and more about lagistics."
good,"They start you out with great pay, good home time, but then after a few months things start to dwindle. Not good runs, no miles, have to sit at center waiting for load. Service on trucks was a joke, gave me a differant one to use while mine was in shop, had to call service to grt it started at the service yard and then it broke down going down the road, so I was out of work any way and then when I did get my truck back they had removed all my personal things. Big company, felt like I was just a number. With family dallor everything stacked on the floor hand unload, always the heavy things on top of the breakable or lighter stuff"
good,"record of safe operations of tractor trailers, accurate recordkeeping and observance of federal regulations. Detail-oriented individual with over 2 years of performing routine and minor maintenance and scheduling trucks for service. Considered hard worker and dependable."
good,"Changing a project is provided but that is not easy or proper."
good,"when i first started out with JB Hunt i felt really happy Knowing that i was going to be over the road i embraced it but somewhere in my journey i felt loss with the Death of a family member ,and increase pressure from my Fleet Mgr at that time left me frustrated."
good,"I'm on Indeed for job search, not for reviews.  JBH is a good company, and has it pros/cons just like any other.  Very big corporate culture there, though.  Depending on your management team, you either have or don't have work/life balance"
good,This company is an great place to work. The pay was not. The type of work was very demanding and it take a toll on your physical body. I wouldn't go back and work for this company.
good,i was satisfied with the starting pay but it began to decline steadily due to lack of load production. some safety equipment issues also. moved on to a better opportunity.
good,Great company but underpaid and over worked. Very family oriented company. Just a bit too much fir me being a single mom.  But for a single person I recommend it
good,"This is a typical truck driving position. Driver pay is based on miles driven, The number of stores delivered to, and a daily attendance bonus. And you are home daily."
good,Good to work. Need opportunities more to explore the company. Better for fresher's. Don't much about the work environment as I am working as service provider from other companies .
good,I worked for them 2 times once an a intermodal driver and once as a Local Driver . as an intermodal driver i had problems with both my truck and my dispatcher for which i quit then as a local driver when i was told i didn't get a separate raise after a year that they only gave location raises
good,"At JB hunt I was able to sharpen my customer satisfaction ability through residential deliveries and installation. "
good,JBHUNT is a huge supporter of Veterans.  They offer training and advancement opportunities.  They are family oriented and will work with you when it comes to family
good,Good Fexible hours good pay Can take truck home every week end.Can choose days off Pto time Able to keep day schedule.Able to take approved passengers
good,"get up, work 13-14 hours, go home, repeat. absolutely no advancement opportunities. trucks keep having the same maintanence issues. the only upside is if you put up with enough, you get a decent paycheck"
good,"I worked at an account that 3 different account managers in the three years I worked there. The 3rd manager was the worst of all, young, cocky, and clueless. This guy thought that bullying his personnel was the same as training them, and masked his lack of knowledge by attempting to hold his personnel ""ACCOUNTABLE"" for what went wrong....TOTAL TOXIC LEADER!"
good,when spouse got sick i asked to be home more often and they did something for a couple days but when asked why some guys are home daily and i cant they say no one is. then i was told i got a home daily job but it wasnt in writing so they gave it to someone else.
good,Are there any beginning it was good then it got harder and harder and harder to do things but overall the company is a big company has a lots of drivers and has to look out for who they need to look at 4 which is the company thanks
good,Becoming a DMIT (Dispatching Manager in Training) means you're going to be put into the hot seat prior to going to orientation for training. This means you'll have to learn on the fly while having to bug your managers for help. This could be worked on much more efficiently
good,Mgrs no nothing about Trucking.  Never driven before . They work you too many hours.  And make too many demands on you.  They put you in dangerous position in forcing you to drive any hours of the day.
good,"Overall, it was a productive place to work. If you are able to work for a positive management team and positive employees, then your outcome of the company will be great!"
good,Operations Supervisor for 25 five truck drivers  dispatched and inventory. Started with at 4:00 am. Learned 5 s implemented it from the start. Learned Decartes.
good,Dispatch from the rail winter haven was a joke.somedays less than a $ 100.00not structered.need pratical drivers in management.company also needs to have more work hence drivers can make
good,"Company drivers make less money than owner ops. Lots of favoritism resulting in some drivers getting better loads, while others are made to sit around or shuttle empty trailers all day and night."
good,"Has a good safety dept, worked otr, regional, local rail, was driver of the year, 9 year safety award, monthly safety meetings,office manager and staff always helpful"
good,"It is a great opportunity for a new college student. However, as a fleet manager, the work environment is not professional at all because FM's are forced to stay professional but the drivers don't have to follow the same professionalism. This position is not related to engineering."
good,A typical day at work would include the deliveries of product to the client. while working at J.B hunt I learn to work the yard I also learned to back up to the rocks witch help me when I delivered product to clients. work place culture safety was always first.
good,The account i have been on this job has it’s favorites. Working here can be pretty good or a bad experience. Long as you are running rapidly you are in good fraces but the moment you are on the bad side of one of the mangers they will work together to get you out the door
good,"JBH is a 3PL, so depending on your account your work load can vary. You could be solo in a 12 driver account managing metrics accordingly or you could be part of a team supervising 160 drivers and you manage one small percentage of that. Regardless, the basics are the same. Driver interation and form honest relationships with them will be the foundation for your experience. Your client will directly feel the effects of your relationship with your drivers. Transparent, timely communication is what you will need or need to learn. Communication comes at you fast and from the moment you walk through the door. A heavy account can receive 500 emails and hundreds of phone calls a day. Expect odd hours, 3 am to 13 pm or shifts something similar. You will need to develop solutions to your clients needs regarding transportation. It can be challenging especially if you starting out, but learn and follow the examples of your team mates and you will fine."
good,Great company to begin your career. No day is the same. I learned how to manage other employees and managers as well. Workplace culture is good and the hardest part about the job can be work-life balance at times.
good,"A Hire/Fire culture from what I experienced and based on a drug free culture because anyone wanting to drive trucks are employees, therefore anyone else is subject to drug tests."
good,"........Truck diver .poor work team ....Consistent schedule, pay, and time off "
good,stressful place manager would drive around and complain about every mechanic not doing job correctly . would tell every mechanic he can do the job faster . management does not follow company policy and procedures . service trucks are dirty they dont get cleaned
good,Company is contracted mostly for NY deliveries. You will get the most bang for your buck if you are good at diving in New York City or Massachusetts. You will have to like grocery deliveries.
good,"a typical mix of big trucking company cultures. pseudo-safety culture, where being safe is oft preached, but attempts are made at every corner and avenue to hustle drivers - extra loads, and ""pushing-it"" as such. wide array of co-working employees, fair amount of camaraderie"
good,"The pay is decent, and this company will make it convenient with their local positions available to get your life in a comfortable position to call this home. But in return they treat you as if your in corporate America but trucking."
good,i expressed my ratings in stars.  that would give more insight of what kind of company it is . if you wanted to burn your fuel and loose your carrier aspiration go ahead and join. do not expect anything apart from your by weekly paycheck. you have to obey your management rules and if they like it you will be recognized.
good,jb hunt is a beautiful place i loved going to work. but it comes to a point where its more like what have you done for me lately. they will treat you as if you are on your first day everyday you show signs of being upset.
good,"I do not have that strong of an opinion about this company. It is right in the middle of okay and bad for me. The pay was well, and a plus was that I was home every week."
good,"Processed worker's comp claims for injured employees, mostly trucker drivers. Also handled the Return to work for light duty positions. Hardest part of job when the claim was denied"
good,"You have to find your stride as an employee, company isn't very open to change depending on which business unit that you work in. If you are looking to change the status quo, then you might run into some walls. The culture is supportive of their driving force first and foremost, but it seems that operational support staff sometimes take a back seat. Overall, thankful to take advancement within the organization quickly and love that they have a strong safety culture."
good,Good and fresh. No career advancement. good culture. hard job. no work life balance. there are some positive. not sure what else to say to get this move on.
good,"battle with other companies who under bid our account and we end up losing dispatches and have to accept shorter and reduced number of loads. It doesn't""t make sense that we have to take a precious vacation day because no loads are available."
good,they pay fair when I worked for them my mother got sick and was put in the hospital and I called in and said I had to get home the first thing asked me was if I was ok they were always for the driver.
good,"I drove a truck 10 hours a day allover the country and "
good,It was an experience I will keep with me . I believe they could or should I say should pay the Livehaul drivers much more for their services . The Management are a good group of guys.
good,"Upon returning to JB Hunt, I was told that my starting salary would be $62.000 annually. For the first 2 weeks my paychecks was adding up, however; shortly after I started they split my route due to them not having anywhere to place a co-worker who started training with me. Which of course then split my check amount in half. The Manager stated that he would only split my route temporarily, but no change has been made."
good,"Overall a solid company that promotes family atmosphere. In dedicated, you are able to work remotely due to situations that may arise and from my experience as long as the job gets handled, then management is fine."
good,"I drove OTR and Dedicated. They have excellent equipment and it is well maintained; however, you really have to have ""some connections"" and a really good Fleet Manager to really enjoy working there.  It's very difficult work in that you don't have a lot of choices in you loads or routes unless you have a Fleet Manager who will ""take care of you!"""
good,a couple of my first trips were moving empty shipping containers from yard to yard and they didn't get me started on the road right away they don't have a lot of miles
good,"Driving is fun if one have the patience for it. When you goto apply, find out if they have a terminal in your city (and get the phone number to the terminal), find out if an mty trailer can be brought home; if not, don't bother, because you won't make the miles."
good,good trucks and fleet services. fair dispatchers and managers. kept me moving often enough to make money and keep bills paid. it was an experience for me
good,I only made .44 cents per mile with JB Hunt. On average my take-home salary was only about 6:50 a week and it's not quite enough to live off of. It was also not uncommon to text or contact my manager and leaving voicemail and he would never respond or get back to me. Lot of times I felt like I was just left on my own
good,"This is not an hourly job. Sometimes you may have to work long days and it is not worth it. If it were an hourly job, I would recommend working for this company."
good,"Jb hunt was a good company to work for several years ago. Most managers on accounts were former drivers. The rapport was much better. Jb hunt is not a bad company to work for, however there aren't many pay raises."
good,"its job for a student, you can learn a lot things. You be in charge of company than you job is to get freight than your job is to cover those freight, this can be stressfull"
good,It is a really good place to work for i drove a fork lift for they treated me with respect and they was big on safety i really thought that every body cared
good,"I worked in the Regional Intermodal division.  Not bad for a trucking company, but they could definitely pay a little more.  The management is respectful and helpful, and safety is a focus.  I didn't like sleeping in a truck overnight, being out 4 nights a week with regular weekly home time was not something i personally want."
good,I was fired for a unavoidable accident in witch I received no citations from law enforcement. But the company's insurance company insisted on my termination to to accident liability ever after six years
good,friendly staffed always willing to help if they could equipment was good always made it home on time good safety department did target loads with a trader joes run at the end of the week
good,Good place to get experience. Very busy paced office environment in small office. The office is very small and a bullpen type setup that is not very condusive to talking to customers on the phone.
good,good job sometimes hard to get in touch with management but still good place to start truck driving career. I only left because of a death in the family.
good,My day starts out fast and busy.  I have learned to stay focused and organized. I have worked with other Company's across the United States and built great Relationships. I take my job very serious and i am willing to work long hours to complete each task given to me.  I enjoy working with my co-workers and I am willing to assist them in their duties also.The hardest part of my job is having several duties given to me at once and having to get them done while keeping up with the duties already in front of me.
good,"Enjoyed the work ran a lot of miles. did not agree with the City dispatchers at some of the terminals. they all had attitudes, like they owned the company."
good,I learned a lot about the truckload business that still serves me well today.  They give you the training and the resources you need to succeed.  Too much relocation was the reason I lef the company.
good,"High responsibility, but few resources to accomplish goals.  Pay is well below industry standards.  Department management is solid, but company leadership has an unfortunate habit of listening to unqualified personnel who tell them what they want to hear as opposed to what they need to hear."
good,"Specific account I worked for had toxic company culture that zapped employees of drive and energy. Blatant favoritism and lack of professionalism makes it difficult to focus on getting the job done at times."
good,"productive pace, OK hours poor pay, limited knowledge of management, Heavy lifting and hard work at times, must be quick learner and ability to operate a hand truck"
good,"Everyday something new happens, and a new issue arises that you may not be familiar with. You are in charge of a certain amount of drivers that you watch over throughout the day. Your main duty is to make sure the drivers are making OTD (On time delivery). During the drivers tour of duty you are to alleviate any issues that may arise and to make strategic business decisions that don't affect the efficiency and time sensitive day to day business operations."
good,"del food products to dollar generals. check truck out with pre trip inspection. Hardest part of job was unloading all food products off the trailer, pushing pallets into store."
good,would work there agin as owner operator company has great opportunities for drivers and try there best make sure drivers are happy along with long term incentives
good,"great to work for. currently work nights. would prefer to work days so I could be home more with family. typical day is good until holidays then it becomes more stressful, workload is practically doubled."
good,"Good opportunity for those fresh out of college to build the supervisory experience that would lead to higher roles with another company. They have interesting titles for positions, in the amount of work required for a supervisor role would equal a management position within most other companies."
good,"Not a good place to work at. Was forced to work long hours at night. I never got used to the night schedule, plus driving to work in traffic was not my idea of a good commute"
good,I worked for JB Hunt for 6 months. I was an OTR driver. I dont like being gone so much. One week I would make enough and the next week I wouldnt. Not a bad company. Not the best job
good,Move semi trailers to and from dock doors for a major food chain suppiler. Within a 200 door facility. Work outdoors in all four weather seasons in the northern USA.
good,I spent too much time dragging trailers around locally in heavy traffic.  No money to be made that way. The yards at San Bernardino and Southgate were miserably small.
good,"Upper management was great.  Pay was average.  We never had enough people to meet the job demands . Many times I was required to do two, or three peoples jobs."
good,work was not so bad beginning at 9:30-5:30 was able to have over time if desired but have to take the loader road with the drive =r in the morning 8:00-6:00
good,"If you dont have a year of experience and you want to be home somewhat everyday. "
good,"The job was okay.................."
good,I felt like I was chained to a desk.  I had to ask permission from my boss to even go to the bathroom.  It was very restrictive for such a entry level job.  I was well overqualified an had a boss that was 20 years younger acting in a position of power who probably didn't have a degree at all.  It was a very grueling position to say the least.
good,It's a very relaxing job don't have much to do but checking truck and trailers make sure the trailers is belongs to the truck very easy and very simple
good,Fast paced environment with a great many independent moving parts that nurture a very competitive attitude. Opportunities to move into different areas and learn from different people.
good,will never go back to work for them. wasn't given quality work or even enough work. wasn't given any time to go home. lived on $100 pay advances while over the road with my wife because they were not providing me with good paying loads .
good,"typical day :arrive-check truck- sign in (people net) ..."
good,it all depends on the account each account verys and the mangers some are knowledgeable and some are fresh with little real life experience witch can be helpful.
good,"Great people, training was not what it could be. learned to figure things out on my own. hard to do your job when you are so unsure of it. Management could interact with employees more."
good,company doesn't pay per week what they advertise. There isn't enough trucks when you go to the yard. no shelter in the yard to cover you under bad weather.
good,Good job or you get physically beat up every single day are not compensated for increasing difficulties of work and are okay with being injured on a fairly regular basis this is the job for you
good,"Although I'm not a lover of the transportation industry, it was a decent place to work. Would recommend it to a friend. Not a bad commute either."
good,"The corporation is run well, but there is still a lot to be desired from management in the field. The work/ life balance is skewed more towards work with limited real time off."
good,"At J.B. Hunt I have the opportunity to see a lot of the country.  It is like I am a traveling musician going from state to state, and city to city non-stop. "
good,it was ok but i need something local if you want to travel the country and make good money good benefits it is a great place to be the people there are good to work for they help you as much as they can they just didnt have what i needed to stay there
good,"Nice pay, the staff is very helpful just in my opinion a nice place to work. They teach well and have good trucks to learn with. I always have steady work and pay on time."
good,its a job you go to work then go home. you are on the road all the time. 3 loads a day. they unload your truck most of the time.dispatchers are a pain in the but like always
good,"Like most experience drivers eventually understand that there is a vast difference between OTR vs local. Even though the relationship with dispatch was always edgy and the truck assignment was disorganized it is a decent place to get local experience, The part that was horrible with this guys is I remember spending 2 hours in the morning everyday especially winter looking for a truck then another hour for a trailer maybe longer and pay sucked because its per trip."
good,The best accounts to work for in this company is the dedicated or Intermodal. You will not make a lot of money if you work for them over the road. The mileage is low.
good,"I really enjoyed driving and seeing different parts of the world, meeting new people in every city and state was a plus. Hardest part of this job was waiting on dispatch."
good,"Hard work, at an average of 14 hour work days. Great place to learn how to use an electronic pallet jack, on the other hand horrible equipment especially for new comers, down right dangerous in my opinion. During my time at JB HUNT Windsor Locks, CT management was horrible, no respect for new drivers, very slow response time, they were not helpful at all when something went wrong with equipment on the road. Great mix of employees, from different cultures. A lot of Jamaican, and Spanish people, minority were American, Russian and Polish people. The hardest part of the job and most stressful is dealing with NYC customers and NYC traffic. Most enjoyable part was getting to work in the big city, delivering food to downtown Manhattan."
good,"Local work and hours are not according to what local work should be however, I am currently injured receiving workmen's comp and hope to find work after my surgery."
good,JB Hunt is an average Trucking company. The dispatchers are as average as any other trucking company. It is like working for Werner or Schneider.
good,You will work hard here but you will learn a lot at the same time. If you are willing to relocate or work night shifts you will succeed.
good,"JB Hunt is a company that allows you to get promoted very quickly, but you have to put in the work to get there. If you work harder than your peers, show more dedication and organization skills, you will be on the fast-track. Transportation is a very ""black and white"" industry, so if you are looking for a creative environment, this is not the place for you. Having said that, this a role with a lot of management opportunities within your first role, allowing a lot of room to bring your own ideas into play."
good,"I am very grateful to JB Hunt for providing me with employment for the past 21 years, most especially for helping me to obtain a degree through their education program.  I am just ready to work somewhere I might be able to use my education more."
good,work day around 14 hours. paycheck very small .missing stops and missing miles on paycheck . no dispatch no money. office is not providing sufficient paperwork
good,Good company for a young person to enter out of college. Good starting pay and rapid advancement are possible. You must be willing to relocate to move quickly otherwise you will become stagnant and get passed over
good,"Fairly good work environment. safety oriented. no bonuses for techs. This company is a fortune 500 company, budget comes out to penny pinchers for employees and parts budget, more money goes towards useless things and higher positions, such as the foreman's wallets."
good,"Its a nice local job, but looking for a job that pay by the hour."
good,"No work life balance for management at this company. Compensation is below national average with longer working hours. Advancement opportunities exist, but with advancement comes less work life balance"
good,I never seen a company go through so many people in such a quick duration. They do not value the people in their company.  I really enjoyed the free food. Also a pretty office
good,In this planning position I was given an opportunity to learn many new things that I wasn't exposed to in my previous position with the company. Much more analytical.
good,"I have been working at J.B. Hunt full-time (More than a year)"
good,"long days but overall management is willing to work with you if you need them too. Equipment is in decent shape as well, and they have a good benefits package."
good,Really liked the travel aspect and seeing how things work from different sides of the business. Liked the management and the opportunity for growth.
good,"I worked for this company and was happy for the most part with the job duties and responsibilities however the management staff was less than desirable. I believe in a management position you should uphold a stature for your employees with guidelines and rules set forth by the company to progress. Working hard as an individual and not receiving the respect from the company that was well deserved is the reason for departure. A place of employment should be of course of the work ethic, responsibilities and duties you as an employee are responsible for however if you don't have the role models to assist with setting forth this compliance it is hard for growth."
good,"A typical day at work involved permitting tractor/trailers in the fleet and making sure they had all the necessary state permits.  I enjoyed interacting w/ the drivers and the guys in the shop. I would have stayed longer, but the company outsourced my job to a consulting firm."
good,It has good people working there but some changes need to be made to make it a more team orientated work place. The pay needs to be accurate it is not every week i was shorted money
good,"I currently work here in 2015. Work load is based on managers abilities and not the driver.The pay scale is descent compared but when it comes time to get paid for it,pulling teeth is a better word.I was looking for better pay due to slower work at my PAST  employer.Little did I know that it would cost me my job when JB called for verification.Some dispatchers are well and beyond willing to help you make money.But unless you have been here for 5+ yrs you wont make close to 1000-1300 a week.The trucks are very well maintained due to fleet service being on site and typically done so in a timely manner from my experiences.So far I have lost up to a few hundred due (one month time frame)to discrepancies in paperwork or some how the computer missed paying me regardless of the dispatch method. Which in my view should be impossible to miss anything.Overall it is easy but you have a great number of customers who are in NO hurry to move you to your next stop or load.Typical start is a delivery out of the rail the off to the customer for your first live load.I have been asked to move chassis or trailer then not been paid after I asked if it were paid separately.Then not seeing it on a pay sheet and have to explain my self as if I were still in training or cant read the pay sheet.Needless to say I wanted to make money and willing to put in the hours.I figured it on a descent hourly rate or gross pay once I calculated the hours I worked for what I am/was payed for that week.It seems to come out a low hourly rate as If I were making 12-14 hr at 58-60 hrs with no OT. Overall this is a descent"
good,"Fun place to work, fast paced environment. Have learned a lot about the transportation industry. I have moved around to several positions which is nice."
good,I like driving but would perfer to do something else.The company is good but they dont allow you to make as much money as you could.
good,"already did this......already did a review"
good,I do not feel that my skills were utilized due to unorganized employer and lack of communication
good,"I drove an Intermodal Container for BNSF in Edgerton, Kansas. I drove  Kansas, Nebraska, MO, and Iowa. I worked nights Monday thru Friday."
good,Stay busy. Very frustrating to have your success depend on factors outside of your control. Work hours are not good. 10 hours a day.
good,"They did allow me to advance and learn the ropes as a new driver, but was just a little unorganized."
good,good miles and home time. You pick your week days to work. Equipment is decent and pay as well
good,Typical day includes answering and making outbound calls with a daily quota of at least 115 calls per day.
good,J.B. Hunt's DCS division is ripe with advancement opportunities if you are willing to relocate but the job can at times be demanding and stressful by nature.
good,Had MASSIVE problems with the after hours dispatch and quit after only 1 month because of the after hours dispatch.
good,JB Hunt is all about safety ..they have great equipment great staff !
good,"Pick up your load and deliver to customer. I learned what it was like to be an OTR driver. Huge company didn't really work directly with management. Lots of time away from home, but you get to see the country."
good,"Typical day includes loading trucks with heavy duty stoves, microwaves, dish washers and/dryers and prepare them for installation. I, not only increased my driving skills, but I learned how to install. My co-workers were very helpful and together we carried items anywhere from 200 to 500 Ibs. Sometimes, I would deal with difficult customers which could be hard at times. Installing items is what I enjoyed most about the job."
good,"A typical workday would start about 6am and go until 5pm. Through out the day I would assist about 9 managers with the daily funcitons of the office. From Terminal Manager, to Human Resources. The hardest part of my job was seing some get let go due to business needs or seeing someone loose there job.The most enjoyable part of my job was hearing the different stories the truck drive would have each day."
good,"Wasnt a huge fan. You can make the company good money as a broker, but you wont see it. Managment was lacking. Things could have changed. Not a bad place to get your feet on the ground."
good,pick up intermodal trailers and deliver them van and reefers.
good,"at the bottom of the poll with alot of complaints. The company had "
good,"I was hired on for a family dollar account, then was put on an account that was a two drive to terminal up and back daily."
good,A typical day at JB Hunt consist of ensuring that each task of the warehouse was complete as well as ensuring that merchandise was handled correctly as well as in the appropriate location. I enjoyed my job but the compensation for the quality of work that I performed was nowhere near appreciated through the compensation nor was it displayed through accommodation.
good,Great people to work for with good chance for advancement with the company.
good,Making my delivery on time. And just doing my job as a OTR driver.
good,the company is all around a good company to work for cause they have their hands in a lot of different companies so there is always work to be done.
good,Theyre like any trucking company good and Bad equipment was decent and maintained
good,"Ever changing, learned to deal with many challenges, learned good management skills, great co-workers, limited advancement opportunities, the challenge was enjoyable"
good,"A typical day would be arriving on time to do my job.  I learned how to install appliances.  Management had an open door policy, which made it easier for communication.  Co-workers were team players, a very nice bunch of guys.  There weren't any hard parts pertaining to the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going to work."
good,Place is a great place to get your foot in the door of transportation. Ideal place for someone who is single and just wanting to gain experience and make money with very little personal time
good,"Early mornings/late nights.  The Home Depot Distribution Center is very unorganized.  Never know where your load is going until you arrive to work.  Therefore you spend time planning the load after arrival.  Flutuating start hours.  Equipment not well maintained.  Can't get straight answers.  Hired on to run Minnesota twice weekly, i.e. w 2 10-hr breaks at home and one local run, off on weekends.  Now can barely get back in time for home breaks during the week, because running farther distances.  Equipment failure can keep you out  6 days.  Equipment failure.  "
good,"Very busy. physically demanding, Coworkers are friendly. clean environment."
good,A typical day is sitting at a computer and call Truck Drivers in order to hire them for J B Hunt.
good,"Its what you make of it. Over all enjoyed the work, education and made friends with in company. Communication is a major issue with JB Hunt."
good,Transport shipment. I learn saftey on the highway. Management was good. Did not meet all co-workers. Traffic would be the hardest about the job. Traveling.
good,"Almost all jobs are about the same as far as pay rate,but some require more physical work than others.Trucks are good and almost new."
good,J.B. Hunt is a oversll good company to work for. Good atmosphere and good people.
good,50-60 hr work week. Very entrepreneurial. Kind of just throw you to the sharks and see if you can swim. You stay busy and can sometimes be over worked. Overall good experience particularly for college grads who need a baptism by fire.
good,Good dispatchers; who works with you. Making sure things are going smoothly..
good,"Loved the position that I had as it was high paced and let me show my true self and my capabilities. Was one of the few successful females in the department that I worked in. And, it seemed like the men supervisors didn't like that idea so they did all kinds of things to try to get rid of us. And, they finally succeeded with me"
good,I ran regional with this company and i spent most of the time loading and unloading. The pay was kind of low and the trucks ran about 62 mph.
good,"a typical day at wrk is to come in and finish wrk from previous shift fill orders and empty holes, learned that you can always learn new things that you thought you knew everything about,management plays favoritisim,co workers are exactly that co workers nothing more, the hardest part of the job is knowing you have to do other peoples jobs that have more senority than yourself and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting off."
good,JB Hunt truly is the best in the business. Their management is very good at determining a course of action and making sure that comes to fruition.
good,I did good for sometimes but then the office got kind of crazy ..people started quitting and losing accounts and even I never had an accident when someone else did they are on you.i have a great appreciation for safety but no going to the point of silliness I don't like to been told the same thing time and time again to much meeting for the something...
good,"activity based pay. work as much as you want.  organized terminal.  a lot of meeting,  payed for attending.  once you learn the rails and customer locations you can make good money"
good,"Somewhat, a better company to work for because they was always cheating people out of their money, so I really don’t have any good things to say about this company"
good,"Cool place to start your driving career, but there may be better options in your particular area. Training is not in depth as it should be, taking time off is not ""friendly"" as they operate on a point scale (12 points, 1-2 for every absence that you do not have time accrued for. At least you can accrue leave though."
good,JB Hunt was a good company for me to work for over the past 14 years.  However it is important to keep trying to advance your career else they may look for ways to replace you.
good,"For some people this is a great place to work, for others no so much. Depends on where you get your start and if you have support from your manager. There were lots of less talented people getting promoted because of favoritism"
good,"ran you nonstop constantly had to do something, pay wasnt nearly enough or equal to the amount of work that had to be done. management was not on your side,"
good,"The job is ok if you get in at a good account but expect to work long hours. Every account is different in DCS so experiences vary greatly."
good,lack of advancement. lack of time off. they are pretty good at letting you off with no pay but if you have a major life problem there is not enough time off.
good,"JB Hunt has an excellent introduction to the company and training for those who need it.  You are supported every step of the way from driving to the use of the computing systems."
good,Good place to work shops are clean and well taken care of working on new equipment and new technology constantly four day work schedule and new tech trainee programs for up and coming techs
good,"Good overall experience.  Most advancement required relocation.  24/7 type of environment."
good,"I was told I’d be making 50k, it’s more like 37k..  weekends off and holidays paid time off.  Currently not getting these things.  "
good,Pay is far below average. Management has their own objectives. It is a fun place to work. Fun work environment to distract from negatives. Good place to work out of college but not forever.
good,"started great, had what you call tenure pay for senior drivers, meaning they paid you 45 dollars to show up for work, do not know if they have it now, got a new manager and it went down hill, gave majority of loads to part timers, which they received no benefits"
good,"As an intern, you are required to do the same task over and over again with no opportunity to grow or learn. However, this is a very stable position, doing the same thing becomes aggravating."
good,"Great management but compensation is low for the required work and stress."
good,"On a regular work day you would have a full day of driving, safety control, training provided. Meeting every week. Heavy haulage from unknown locations. Weekends off were enjoyable. The company has great personnel fellow drivers and dispatchers."
good,Great company. Great opportunities. Decent pay. Pick up loads on time and deliver on time. Be as safe as possible. Learn as much as possible about your job and be a team player.
good,There are a lot of opportunities for advancement. It is a very good place to start a career out of college. Lots of good hands on experience. Can work your way up.
good,Will I am required to use a minimum of 150 key strokes.  When only I want to use three. Those three would be BOO! Even though I gave the company a three star rating I would not recommend working here if you want any type of work/life balance.
good,"I left intermodal for OTR which was a mistake. OTR is limited to 2000 miles per week and you only get it if you constantly bug them. I could pay my bills driving intermodal, I switched to OTR to get more experience and travel further but to pay dropped by 75%. Nice dispatchers but they don't mind you getting 1100-1200 miles and if you don't say anything, they wont"
good,"Good environment, ok management, didn't like slip seating with other drivers seemed like there was always something out of place or messed up, got layed off and had to find another job within a week to cover bills at home"
good,There is always work available.  The company is flexible with traveling.  They have  a good training program and reward program.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with. My only gripe is money. Sure I make the cents per mile but I haven't been getting the miles. Been with me for almost a quarter now and the only reason I went JB was the possible money through guarantee by even the dispatch team. We all know the game but at the time I recieved the call I was in dire need. "
good,"Drive Semi  pick up loads, Maps, Dispatcher sometimes did not look at a map when dispatching for time and distance to and from a route, getting a home time when required to be home for family function , seeing everything meeting new people"
good,You will learn a lot if you push yourself.  It had its ups and downs but overall was a great experience working with the new drivers.
good,its a ok company they run you to death and pay you average to decent.co workers are good management is management and is ok as long as you get the product of the truck they dont care what you gotta go through to get it done
good,Jb is a steady pay check i dont think the grass is really greener anywhere else.  Pay is ok based on industry as a whole but not on the top or bottom.  Job can be challenging.  Alot of turn over.
good,Pay is good manager are not very friendly. They will only believe what the customer say. They will use what you say against you.
good,"Started here in November 2014.  The orientation training staff was wonderful.  Orientation was paid at $17/hour. "
good,"My advancement and pay increases were too good to be true. Starting a new segment with more experience than my OM was frustrating because he would never take my advice. As the third AM on the site in just over a year, I only saw major changes after a manager left. The company, as a whole, was good to work for."
good,Decent pay and standard benefits with lots of room for promotion if your willing to relocate. This is a great first job out of college.
good,"J.B. Hunt was quite an experience. As soon as you arrive, it's nonstop action on the phones and in the office. There was always someone needing something either in the office or in the field. Every day was different. Customers were very demanding, but their demands showed me that I was capable of alleviating problems before they escalated."
good,"Long hours, never just 7-5 "
good,"often problem with empty trailer location to get loaded (i.e. ""no empties""), will overtake extra loads which are delayed by someone else, good company"
good,Clocked in on a computer then clocked on a job. The book time for doing any job was cut in half so there were many accidents and injuries. The safest oriented company i know that reduces time to perform a job just to make an extra $. I learned that there wasn't enough time to perform the jobs that corporate regulated the workers to do.
good,"I worked here as a java programmer for almost one year and a half, and we worked using agile methodology .  I work independently and program by myself.  I programmed in Java using using a Weblogic server, Spring framework, and Maven, creating a new applications called the CS dashboard that included FusionCharts charts on one the company's largest customer's data:  Available drivers for the day, Drivers on Vacation, Progress of deliveries for the customer, and Deliveries made per driver.  I would be given descriptive requirements and then I would design it for a couple of days, and then code it, and code review it with the team, and then recode and sent it to qa, and then communicated with the server team to install it.   I also used SSIS to create a batch job that would update delivery schedules for distribution centers.  And I created SSRS reports given sql queries to be able to be seen by different businessmen at the company."
good,Work schedules are flexible. Typically work 6-4 or 7-5 monday through friday. Rotating weekend scheules. Management is very involved and depending on the department can be micromanaging. Overall a good place to work.
good,Excellent in the beginning but lack of mileage for a driver had me driving over the road with less pay.
good,plenty of work and the people i worked with were very friendly.
good,"good place t work, nice people. fun hours and great co-workers."
good,JB hunt ask a lot of its managers with mildly competitive pay. Support from upper management is there but could be stronger.
good,"As an office tech for DCS FMS, we edit stops that drivers make to ensure that we are billing companies correctly and paying drivers correctly. We also do satisfaction surveys by calling customers and getting ratings/feedback on their delivery. Management over the group is doesn't really recognize those that are doing a great job. They play favorites and can be unfair. There is no opportunity for everyone to have growth. You tend to be stuck in the same position unless you know someone higher up. Co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job at times is being able to do double work when there are several people out. Some people help out more than others. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact w/ people inside the company and outside as well. Building connections. "
good,"The job could be fun at times. I enjoyed the challenges and interactions with drivers and co-workers. However, I can't count how many weeks I pulled over 80 hours for the week. I missed my family."
good,"Overworked, I just got burned out! Good Job security. Feels like you are running your own business."
good,This is a high tempo fast moving industry. you always needed to be on your toes to either deal with driver issues or customer related issued. it was a great first job for me. it opened my eyes to a lot of different things.
good,The job requires you to be safe and follow all jb hunt safety guidelines smith system and know about tandem and weight when it comes to shifting tandem
good,"Nice company with good job security.  Just doesn't pay much.Management is good but a bit difficult to move up and when you do, not much of a pay increase."
good,Good place to work. Very relaxed but very stressful at the same time. If you love office jobs this is for you. 8 hours of sitting behind a cubical on the phone and computer.
good,"The life and work balance is amazing. In most cases when you need to take time for personal or doctor appointments, there is always time and you are allowed to do those things. They allow you to make time up. If you are ill and unable to shoe up to work at the office, they will allow you to work from home. There is cases when that is not possible. But all in all a very understanding company."
good,"J.B. Hunt was my first job in the transportation and logistics field, and I have overall been very happy there.  The company offers many different opportunities to advance, and on the job continuous learning is available to work through at your own pace.  The new facilities are beautiful and modern, with an on site gym and great walking trails.  Technology is very important on campus and there are many advances being made in this field right now.  Overall, management is very approachable and friendly, and the company does care about their employees."
good,If you have any health issues or anything like that it may not be a job for you because it’s a lot of heavy lifting! Your pay is based on how much work you do so if company is slow you make little money
good,This company gave the the opportunity to go over the road and deliver products in multiple cities. Gave me the experience that I needed to become  a good driver.
good,"It is a good work environment with good benefits and vacation time.  I liked the office and the work/life balance, but I wish the salary was a bit more."
good,"Work/Life Balance is not there most days. required to work 10 hours a day most of the time or more. Room for advancement but is limited. "
good,"JB Hunt a company with a spectacular organization and procedure for each assigned job. A unique systematics in pieces since everything is by codes, control of tools and log out and tag out on equipments. Definitely with Jb hunt you learn to be a good retailer"
good,"High turn over...day drivers are stuck in traffic and get paid by miles and activity. Managers dictate what you can make in a week. Average pay from 130 a day to 200. They should be paying 250 a day. You can make that however at 14 hours a day. This is a review on local intermodal driver. Like the work but the pay is not worth it most of the time. Good job to get local pick up and delivery experience. Its a ""muh"" feeling..."
good,deliver and install appliances for builders all over Texas and other things some you have put together you have a helper with that help with trash or if they know how to do other stuff they help
good,"The other drivers at JB are real cool people and will help you if they see you struggling. Most of the people in the office are cool as well. There are just a few bad apples, just like anywhere else."
good,"The company has a pretty good system for laying out a typical day's work.  I've gained tons of insight as to how the trucking business operates.  As a result, I've improved my knowledge of business and driving skills.  "
good,"It's a good paying job for someone coming right out of college.  JB Hunt basically hires kids with no experience and trains them from the ground up.  The job is very demanding and is not for the feint of heart.  Long hours, no lunch breaks, work nights/weekends, on call after hours, work holidays.  There are opportunities for advancement but everything is political and they expect you to relocate.  There is little to no appreciation for all the hard work you put in each day.  Driver appreciation/retention is huge but upper management does not care about lower level managers."
good,"management sucks. Job is easy, great co workers. management has no clue. they have never been behind the wheel. they have no clue what we haveto dealwith"
good,"First week was great, got nearly 4000 miles, after that it was down hill, average miles between 1500-1800 a week, too many live loads killing your clock and looking for empty trailers. Company shut down for three days during the holidays and did not inform me...I was stuck far from home for 3 days."
good,"While the job was never too strenuous, that aided in the lack of accomplishment that it would give you when you left every day. It's a great place to work if you love the corporate atmosphere, but if you are wanting to do something exciting or fulfilling, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
good,JB Hunt is a great place to work. Some positions are flexible and some are not. Stay positive and motivated. Breakfast and lunch served on campus everyday.
good,I learned at j.b. hunt that you have to be patient with just about every thing and let things come to you and it was a lot of traffic.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with. It is definitely a family.The worst part of the job are the systems being used are a hindrance to performance. I've learned a lot over the years there. The direction of the company has veered off of the path of previous years. Some would say the change is good. Most people leave due to money.
good,"Intermodal driver is easy dry van transport to shipping/receiving centers, no touch freight, and close proximity runs. Sometimes work loads can run you between 10 to 12 hours a day and sometimes earlier. Better treatment than the DCS accounts overall I feel. Pay varies by terminal locations"
good,JB Hunt was my first job out of college and it was very enjoyable.  They also provided a good environment to learn and develop as well as travel to gain industry experience.
good,"Need to be more organized and on same mission.more driver friendly between Arkansas and other division.They say they're for veterans,but this one lost his job for medications they knew about"
good,"Hired for over the road, but did nothing but run up and down interstate 5 in and out of Los Angeles.  Told I could take passengers with me, but all there trucks only have one bed"
good,"Was a Fortune 500 company and proud of if! Loved working for this company. Was the perfect hours for me to be able to spend plenty of family time. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with drivers and their needs, I did however enjoy the challenge."
good,Great place to work minus the pay. work life balance was the best part of the job and being able to have weekends off was a very nice part of working at JB Hunt.
good,Most days were normal via work load but equipment broke down frequently causing lost of time and money and ofcourse stress
good,"Office environment"
good,14hr work days is the typical work day as a Class A Driver. You learn patience in this line of work. Management are very laid back and easy to work with along with other drivers. Not knowing if you'll make it home from  some deliveries is the hardest part at times with the job but its manageable. The places you get to travel to and the companies you get to work with are exciting at times.
good,The people at this company was very nice. The company has been around for a long time and started very small. Benefits are great.
good,"Job security, with decent insurance, but poor management."
good,Lot of driving and away from home . Get your asignment and on your own . Traveling is great and get paid for it.
good,"Perfect place to start career in the logistics industry."
good,"Loved managers I worked with, Had to cold call drivers and sell Jb Hunts Driving Jobs, Sell, Send to scheduling line and stay in touch with driver to make sure they show to orientation and answer all questions they may have about the job. Stressful job when they expect you to meet hiring averages when that is actually out of your hands. For example if they require so many drivers within a 10 week period and you have those drivers coming for you to orientation and they don't pass physical, road test, or drug test I don't see how that becomes against us and we lose our drivers and our numbers fall below."
good,"Stable company, good people. Pay is low compared to other industry leaders. Great culture and values, also has plenty of room for growth and advancement. Work life balance is great as well."
good,The pay is great for the hrs we work. But every account is different. The account I’m on you work every holiday even if you put in to be off 4months in advance. The agg account you run roads trucks shouldn’t be on that’s half way washed out and barley have room to maneuver your truck around curves.  Lots of stress n bs.
good,"I worked at the Denver final mile location. I can honestly say I enjoyed the work. I generally liked all of my coworkers and the management team really does care about it's employees. The work is very physical, and fast paced. So if you aren't motivated or physically fit you should probably look elsewhere. The pay is done by mileage and piece so you can always make good money just don't expect any overtime. The hours are very irregular, you find out the night before what your next days route is going to look like. Which makes it very hard to plan as an average day can range from 6-12 hours. Overall I enjoyed my time there but I am very glad I left."
good,Hard to work under specific criteria driving specifics some times unrealistic for today's invornment position does not allow driver to apply existing experience to be efficient and safe.
good,Equipment is old and breaks down often. Causing longer hours than needed with no extra pay for it. I never made it a full week without a break down. Pay is not competitive. Relaxed environment.
good,"learned a lot about rail yard set up.managment was ok, workplace is laid back.hardest part of the job is new dispatch and not knowing what they are doing. effected salary alot."
good,There is room to move on but you need to be willing to wait. The people over all are good to work with and the job will keep you on your toes. Lots of areas to work with what you need schedule wise.
good,The hours are long we have to work a minimum of 10 hours a day and sometimes more but overall a good place to work with good opportunity for advancement.
good,"Management controls  your  driving time eta in order to decide if they let you pull the freight or not, so they will let You know , you are not allowed to earn the money You need to make to meet uour obligations iam sorry to say that , but it is true"
good,"day started at 5:00pm and went to 3:00am as they had a flexible schedule and I was working 4/10's."
good,Great job security and you're home every day.  Pay could be a bit better considering the work load envolved.  But you can work in peace without being smothered at your own pace.  Your work ethic determines your pay for the day so you get out of it what you put in.
good,this job I learn everything didn't know nothing when I started.  management changed a lot.  co-workers was the best work with.  hardest part was the climbing. most enjoyable part was completing the job and everybody went home safe.  over all this was a very great job
good,I enjoyed my tenure at J.B. Hunt. It's opened up a lot of doors for me and I feel that this was a great company to start out working for.  I learned some valuable information in regards to the supply chain & logistics industry that will stay with me forever.  J.B. Hunt will continue to be an industry leader and I would recommend this company to anyone looking to start out in the transportation industry.
good,I work very hard great team player never time for lunch so long hours without food. Very busy business under staffed high turn over
good,I deal with a lot of customers and project managers.  I maintain reports and drivers logs.  I leaned how to use SAP at this company.  I love my management staff and the drivers.  We are all like family.
good,Wonderful people I met. Constant traveling day went by quickly
good,"Very long hours, but I have learned everything there is to know about operating an entire LDC. From financials to operations to safety. "
good,you will work hard unloading product at stores. Picking up return product to go back to the distribution center.
good,Could treat there employee's better They do not stick to there word they will tell you anything to get you in the door
good,New employees and drivers can get away with murder. But seasoned employees get crucified for any simple mistake and get paid garbage. Haven’t gotten a bonus in years.
good,"Enjoy working here good way to learn hands on. Learbed how to do a vairety of things at the company like inspections, brakes, diagnosing,replacing windsheilds and etc. When you need help you ask other techs for a hand. Very good culture when it comes to help."
good,"Constant 10 hour work day.  Casual attire,  off on the weekendsI have learned rate negotiation with trucking owner operator.  The company as a whole is always updating the shipping programs with times set aside for group training via the web  for personal training."
good,JB Hunt is a good company to work for with great management. It is difficult to be hired among various departments unless you know someone. The pay is poor compared to other large companies in the area.
good,no pay for time away from family. if no work available you wait for free and must be on call without any pay. ...................................................
good,Arrived at work and received dispatch. did pre-trip on tractor and trailer to make sure all lights and equipment was in working order. I picked up loaded trailer at Budweiser and scaled it out and made deliveries to the distributors. I waited for the trailer to get unloaded or dropped it off and picked up and empty trailer and headed back to the yard.
good,Have plenty of work but for some of the managers need to work on social skills and fight for their employees not customers.
good,"Its a great work place. great employees. It has different shifts, and good benefits. the only problem is no overtime."
good,"I enjoy the job, just not the time away from home. The recruiter said it would be 1-2 nights away per week, in reality it is 3-4 night on a regular basis."
good,Good experience I learned a lot a this position and would definitely do it over any day.
good,"World class people, subpar pay.  Truly the most dedicated people I have ever been around.  Turn over rate is high, but that is only due to compensation.  NOT ONE employee has left because of the culture.  That's a testimony to the company."
good,Very fun environment. plenty room for growth. management is excellent and takes initiate to progress their employees career.  Work hard play hard environment
good,not a bad to work at good company to work and also nice people. really good home time fast paced depending on the account that you work with. Alo good for veterans
good,"Good benefits, just not enough miles. The ability to work from different areas is great . Mostly good people & equipment is kept in good repair. Overall a great Company."
good,"Fun to work, constantly working making money.  Long haul driving, this country is beautiful"
good,"This company does not focus on development , but does give a good sense of a strong culture and treats the employees like family. Management has your back and you can trust them."
good,Was not an hourly pay was paid by pieces delivered and installation. Can work 50+ hours and still get a small check. Back breaking work for final mile position
good,.Overall it is a great company but the pay could be better and the employee appreciation needs to be more noticeable. We need to have more interaction with fellow employees.
good,"Okay company to work for but I was looking to make more capital for the work involved on delivery and mileage. I have noticed that within my experience driving tractor trailers there is always something new to learn weather the people you meet or the customers you come across on the daily basis, there is always a challenge to help enhance your customer service capabilities as a professional driver."
good,"Management was great, learn new things daily. Workplace was great. The hardest part was working holidays away from family, The most enjoyable part is working with good people."
good,"My Experience working with JB Hunt was interesting. Great company, great pay and over all treatment of employees.  Unfortunately, my personal opinion didn't really matter."
good,"Long hours, not the best management, dispatch fails to tell you what time you start. Good pay for a young man wanting to work hard for their money. Needs some work but will improve overtime."
good,"lots of company outings,  bbq's onsite there are giveaways and recognition boards every account is different but they are all very special they really make a big deal to look out for the drivers best interest"
good,"Hands on freight position, if you want drop and hook this is not the place for you. If you don't mind the physical labor then the pay is great for the type of work."
good,"I worked at jb hunt for 2 years and got terminate after transfer to intermodal because the trainer accused me for not moving the tandem forward and pre-trip inspection that I was unsafe driver after giving me a very old truck that is dangerous to drive on the road. After several attempt to fix the truck it still has issues and wasting my time.Dispatch  no clue what is going on. Waiting at the railway for 2 hours for billing.  Some of their staff have mechanical problems. As a driver you are being accused for safety issue because some of their trailers are unsafe to drive. African American and foreigner people are second Class workers, first Class worker are white people as you can look it up on their website offices jobs. No Career advancement  opportunity if you are Black even if you showed them you have a bachelor degree. The majority of offices jobs are only for white people."
good,"I was driving within the 4 burbs of NY with my time in JB Hunt. was long hours and very stressful driving within New York, but thrilling at the same time."
good,"Company was great to work for.  Everyone personable, everyone willing to help and answer questions.  Management was personable as well.  You worked with production as well as upper management, this was a great tool to move forward.  The most difficult part was, there wasn't.  Your co workers always made it enjoyable"
good,Nice starter company. for new cdl holders. It was a staart for me.
good,deliver appliances and install
good,"Learning to adjust to different personalities,strapping loads demands you be physically able to move,coordination is needed being places aren’t located on your company gps"
good,"I liked it, there is change need to take place in management. People need to learn to respect workers and not have certain picks.They have up to date trucks and I feel very safe in them"
good,I worked in the customer service and scheduling of deliveries. The typical day would consist of utilizing phones and typing in data about deliveries and scheduling of deliveries. I learned many different things as far as geographics and how to maneuver several screens. The hardest part of the job was I think the angry consumers. I enjoyed trying to help people and working with the deliveries
good,"truck driving for jb hunt isn't easy but a jobs a job. staff is fair to midland as far as it comes to knowing what they're doing, but good people. and as far as a work day there is about the same as any other trucking gig I've worked for, hard and stressful."
good,"I done my routes on time always, "
good,"I am a mechanic at san bernardino shop,jb hunt is a great company with good pay and OK benefits, shop is keeped cleaned and all trucks and trailers you work on are new,only reason im looking for another job is one big deal....management sucks! most unprofessional manager i have ever worked for, he runs the place on emotions,depending on what pill he took that day will determine how your day will go, GREAT COMPANY JUST NEEDS A NEW MANAGER! most techs come and go do to that reason."
good,"Every day was diffrent, I never new what to expect. I learned to work safe and stay alert."
good,OTR at JB is dying and most is now regional or DCS. Anyone with experience can make a living. but I would recommend not doing the lease operator thing. there is no advantage and only more expense.
good,"As a trucking company to let you come home every night, it’s not bad.I’ve been paying more, that being said, at that time I was over the road. Overall not a bad place."
good,"The only bad part is the home time, didn’t feel like enough... but this is a well rounded company with decent management who try to help in any situation ."
good,Job is ok if you want be gone most of the time. no advancement opportunities. pay would be ok for a family without a lot of expenses. Working to long hours and to many company regulation that are not necessary.
good,"Company means well, but there is a big gap between idea and implementation. Great place for recent College Grads and military with few other opportunities. All about which division/location you wind up at."
good,Good company to drive for but managers won’t listen to you if you have concerns it’s their way or the highway good equipment but good luck finding an empty trailer if needed
good,Good work climate but some of the older managers use an outdated management style based on projecting power and putting junior managers in their place.
good,"Co workers were very friendly, we all worked together well. On a normal day I would come in clock in put on all my rain gear and start washing the semi's. Other days I may be doing oil changes or tire replacements. The hardest part of my job was the freeing weather conditions and not being provided with adequate equipment."
good,"The location of the JB Account is dedicated, the only thing I do not like is the Health Insurance.  Every time I ask why it is so high, they say its because of truck drivers."
good,"JB Hunt is a good company with many benefits. "
good,"The Final Mile division of JB Hunt is only about 5 years old and because of that it is still experiencing a lot of growing pains. The upside is that there's a huge market for what Final Mile Services (FMS) is offering, but the technology within the company is still running about two years behind where it needs to be so FMS cannot service its customers as well as JB Hunt would like. This has slowed the opportunity for advancement, but not eliminated it. The hardest part of this job is completing all of your work in any given day. The saying within FMS is ""you have 10 hours to complete 12 hours of work,"" making prioritization a key. The intense workdays can sometimes lead to stress, but it also makes the day fly by. I'm telling you, 10 hours can feel like 4. Management is relatively young which tends to be a negative for ""older"" employees (because they are taking orders from somebody younger than them) but a positive for younger employees. You will work a lot at this job and you will work hard, but it can be very rewarding and occasionally fun."
good,It's a job that you can make money and u have freedom too run as u please you have great trucks and great maintenance driver managers r great too work with
good,To much work for what i use to get paid..id stay a little late and never saw a difference in my paycheck...asked to move up in position or get a chance at something that would pay more and nothing.
good,"This job was a good job to transition from OTR driving. It had good moments depending on who was directing the terminal. As with many low-level management jobs in transportation, the hours were long and the work schedule unstable. This was 20 years ago, and I hope that it has changed since then."
good,"Daily delivery of products from from various retail companies. I was responsible the supervision of 25-30 drivers plus 3 management personnel. I also did payroll, hiring, staff training."
good,"You are micro managed a lot. If you want to make decisions you always have to ask and seek approval first. The insurance is not great. The company matches you 3% on your 401K, which is about standard."
good,"JB Hunt will wear you out, they make you work very long hours and for low salary. I took this job because the economy was down and had to get something quickly for my family."
good,"Company seemed to actually care about the driver's health and home time. Mostly good with logistics. Some gaps in communication, but better than most."
good,My Manager during my first 8 years was awesome but once I was moved under another Manager he over micromanaged and didn't trust from my past experiences. Laziness to even get to know an operation and was always misinformed because he didn't take the time to know.
good,"A wonderful place to work - friendly people, diverse job opportunities, and you get to work with people literally all over the country. Made for some interesting days."
good,Great people to work with. Immediate management very helpful and patient but not so much for the after hours management team. Can be very unorganized when it comes to getting loads or picking up loads. For example sending drivers to wrong locations or sending drivers to locations that their particular transport division does not handle causing extra cost to company or driver.
good,It was a good job coworker was great i learned a lot. I was delivering the whole Northeast Dollar tree. Learned a lot about communication and been a great professional with customers and well as traffic.
good,"I was an ambient loader/unloader/drivers helper "
good,J B Hunt provides good training to move elsewhere in logistics. This is a great out of college experience for anyone and you will learn a lot. Just don't have plans to stick around at home if you are working for J B Hunt.
good,"I LOVE this company, and the Executive Leadership has almost everything right. The only things lacking are: below average pay, above average working expectations and extremely outdated views regarding work-life balance."
good,I had a great time learning how to put together cases and learning what how things worked in our government organization.  I also was able to to learn some key attributes when it comes to putting together and working with legal cases too
good,This job was a very good job i would load and unload trucks with whirlpool stoves and microwaves into apartments and houses.The hardest part of the job is going up and down steps.
good,I enjoyed my job but would like to have more responsibility.
good,JB Hunt offers a great place to work with good compensation.  The only problems are the hours and management at some locations
good,expect to do a lot of intermodal work. Rail yards know JB well. Long hall is left to the rails.
good,was buying truck from them was making good money had problems with dispatchers at times but found a good one finnaly and started running great till had personal issues with exwife
good,"Great company, decent pay, some opportunity for advancement. Company culture is the best part of working at this company. They allow you to have fun but hold high standards for completing your daily task"
good,"All in what you make it; you have to create that part. Come in to work with a positive attitude, because all that starts well, ends well. On the plus side to it all, they number the inventory/appliances, so that you can easily load truck."
good,Competition is ripe.  Great if you apply yourself.  Just a job if you don't.  Possibilities really are endless if you can stick it out.  If you can't usually people find great opportunities quickly at worst.
good,"If you can get in the right division and the right team you will have a great experience.  However, if you do not, you will likely not enjoy your time there."
good,A good organization that focused on its drivers most of the time.  There were times that I felt they forgot about how much they needed to value the needs of employees and letting needs of the business blur the lines of being employee centered.  It was also difficult on a personal level to be able to leave work at work.
good,Ok place. Long hours with afterhours work every day of the week including some weekends. Since I left multiple others did too and they made some changes to schedules.
good,"The company spend more on managers, trucks equipment and safety gadgets than on their drivers, that was my concerns when I was working for them. Pushing the drivers to the limit and not taking your complaints into consideration. The company managers will decide for you..."
good,"45 hour work week expectation"
good,I really enjoyed the route i had. I also enjoyed the clients on my route. the route had 4 stops. Two in San Francisco and two in the east bay.I drove a 10 speed tractor.My career at JB Hunt was exciting.
good,I enjoyed my time at JB Hunt. I worked closely with 4 other people in a relaxed atmosphere. Our job was tedious at times but we got through them together.
good,"low beginning pay"
good,Good job to have if you still live at home with mom but with family not good  just need more pay it could be grate  job  local work gets slow then your money get low I gust every job has it’s up and down just save your money
good,"J.B.Hunt was a awesome company to work for in many aspects, but once you reach the top of their limits, there is no more advancement for you to make! The management can be cut throat at times because they get bonuses and they use specific drivers to help make their money. As long as you are hauling freight for them, they are okay. Once you stop hauling freight for any reason, you are just a number to them! Overall though, they are a good company with great benefits."
good,A couple things I liked about working for them was. I never had to call dispatch to get a load. While on a load I always received my next job. My Driver Manager had no problem getting me home when I needed to. As far as the pay. It goes by experience. With that being said I was a Regional driver. They do not go into New York but will send you very close to it. One thing I wish was that I had a more powerful truck (2015 Cascadia) to get up steep hills and mountains.
good,"Good company to work for. DMs keep you moving. good miles. Many good communication avenues. Equipment is well maintained. Most of the freight is ""no touch"""
good,"Very high pace job duties, working on dual screen monitors. Can be stressful at times working with difficult drivers and managers. Need to have thick skin and short memory."
good,Driving manager was kind but routing went wrong leaving me sitting at a truck stop over the weekend without pay. Dedicated route was the best thing for me.
good,A typical day at work consists of coordinating deliveries and resolving customer issues. Long hours make for a taxing work day but management is helpful.
good,"Great company for the driver. Management was looked at as secondary when it came to needs being attended to. While drivers are the core commodity of the company, all employee's should be treated with respect and treated equally."
good,"Great equipment "
good,Good company to work for. I pulled flatbeds for the home depot account. That was the money maker account. The managers as cool and easy to work with and for.
good,"This was a great company to work for, and the equipment was in decent shape. I hauled hazmate material from the shippers to the receivers while maintaining log books in compliance with federal laws."
good,This company doesn't have many benefit but overall is a decent job. Just lacks sick days. A good job for those starting in the field or working their way up.
good,A typical day at work for me would be; Wake up do my pretrip inspection on my truck and trailer. Update my log book then plan my route. Call customers to confirm delivery time and location. Proceed to my destination and wait for the receivers to unload my trailer. once unloaded message my dispacther to let him know my trailer is empty and i am available to pick up another load. The hardest part is being out on the road away from family but the enjoyable part is traveling to see the world and being your own boss.
good,"I've been working for JB Hunt Trucking since Penske Trucking lost their contract with Whirlpool and JB Hunt took over the warehouse, drivers, and equipment in December 2007. At first we were told that nothing would change, in regard to, pay, paid vacation, Health coverage, etc. That changed real quick, as far as pay goes, and it's so confusing we don't know if we're being paid for work done, or not! My annual gross pay has dropped approximately $14,000 in the past 3 yrs. The job I do is driving and installing Whirlpool appliances. I try very hard to do my job correctly, both in regard to trucking and installing! I am a hard-working, dependable and willing to work until the job is done! These are attributes that I don't feel are appreciated by JB Hunt! If they did, they would pay their drivers a decent liveable wage!  I work at least 50+ hours each week only to see my annual gross income drop approximately $14,000. I don't mind working those kind of hours, as long as I get paid fairly!"
good,"Coming from someone who has only worked in the field branch, the opportunities for advancement are limited. If given the opportunity I would suggest starting in the corporate office. This will allow you the chance to really get to know the business and determine which division of JB Hunt aligns with your career aspirations. "
good,Very relaxed and laid back atmosphere. Great management has its pros and cons like every job. The hardest part of the job was moving appliances and the hours were long.
good,Good over the road job. Good benefits. Got to see the country being a over the road truck driver. Some parts of Canada to. Rider program. over all a good place to work.
good,It was a TDS and very hard. Especially during the winter when you had to put chains on the truck and trailer... You also had to follow all DOT regulations state and federal you had to keep your truck up to par lights going brakes working make sure everything was clean pick up deliveries on and drop them off and different States from coast to coast
good,Delivered product throughout the USA and Canada. It was such a fun experience that provided the opportunity to travel all over the country and the Canada.
good,"I feel as though I have grown up at J.B.Hunt, they have taught me developed me and shown me my own potential. I have enjoyed every minute of my ride thus far and wish I could one day retire from here."
good,Face paced but not overwelming for someone willing to learn. On job training available as well as tuition reimbursement. If you don't like talking on the phone or looking at a computer all day this job may not be for you.
good,"Answering phones, fielding questions, entering data.  I learned a great deal about the trucking industry and all its moving parts.  Management was tough but fair.  Enjoyed all my coworkers.  Hardest part......Working a seriously bad accident.  Enjoyable part is working with good hardworking people."
good,"24/7 multitasking"
good,dedicated account loved the home time and fast turn arounds.  then they started keeping us out like a OTR driver which is not home time friendly
good,its nice place to work plenty of freight and the managers to can actually have conservation with they treat as equal as long as you don't disrecpt them
good,Work is consistent enough. The problem I have found is that there is little to no cohesion between driver managers. No one seems to be able to do their job effectively.
good,A good company. By only issue was not enough staff.  I had to do two peoples job every day. That is my only  con. Okay pay.  I liked my Manager  a lot.  Good guy that cares about his people.
good,Great culture and friendly people. Learned a lot about the industry. Constant job advancement. Always learning and ahead of the curve.
good,"Long hours, average pay and benefits."
good,"Very organized, very focused on maintaining communication with the driver. Its a friendly work environment. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get home."
good,"It's a good, flexible job to have during college. You will have opportunities if you ask, but as a part-time employee you are not eligible for any benefits besides the retirement plan."
good,"Hard work, logistics, team work, cold calling, great company with movement ability"
good,"Day started around 1a.m., hooked to my trailer, then set out to my destination. Had to be prompt on time. If there where any problems with my route somebody was always available to help me get around the situation or coordinate with my stop to fix problems. It was an all round good place to work"
good,"***   The interactions I had with the corporate office were great."
good,Well thoughtout training and management. All employees are instructed on the expectations of the company and provides extra online instruction thats mandatory for all employees to perform their job with more effective techniques.
good,"JB Hunt is a great company."
good,I liked driving for the company. It allowed me to see different states.
good,"This job involved a lot of customer service tasks, and learning how to manage people.  The account that I was working at had approx. 50 truck drivers.  It was a very rewarding job because it was challenging and there was never a break from fixing problems.  I enjoyed it and learned a lot while I was there.  "
good,"I enjoyed my job with this company but unfortunately had to leave due to personal reasons, I would reccomend this job to someone as a futur employer."
good,"J.B. Hunt offers many great opportunities for a diligent, hard working, and dedicated manager looking to move upwards through the ranks of management."
good,A typical safe Dedicated Contract Services day possible. Always learning. Management managed. Professional co-workers. Challenging to drive using perception. Home time is always enjoyable.
good,"They have the best equipment, good dispatchers.If they had a set pay scale. It would be a wonderful company to work for. The routes aren't evenly given to the drivers."
good,Didn't care for being gone all the time. Made good money on percentage as an owner operator.
good,good crew. good managment. great schedule. good benefits.
good,"A typical work day involved meeting with the staff and drivers to outlive the daily expectations and workload, developing a plan of action, and addressing any concerns; afterwards meeting with customers and reporting account statues to the district manager."
good,love working there drove all over the states seen places would like to see again.met all kinks of people.being your own boss. but getting the loads there on time.
good,JB Hunt is a great company to work for. They are very proffesional and have a high regards for their employees safety overall.
good,great company to work for. i was just attached to a account where i was not getting enough miles.
good,I drove over the road in the Southeast region. Typically you are away from your home and family for about 1 1/2 weeks. It can be very dangerous when resting at various Truck stops. Driving in different climate of weather. A driver will have alot time to think when on the road alone.
good,"That is if you’re just starting out in the industry, young families, or your close to retirement this is a good company to start with. But if your in the middle, benefits suck as well as the pay! Does not meet California standards by the least!"
good,A typical day at this job included answering several dozen calls and a hundred or so emails from drivers and their managers. It was a high stress office environment.
good,"J.B. Hunt was fun to work at, especially to start a career. Most people within the company are a pleasure to interact with. Rapid growth, plenty of room for promotion in some areas, none in other areas."
good,They always found a way to make my dr. appointments every 3 months  for bloodwork. Overall they are a good company to work for just wished  to be home more oftento be home
good,The work is pretty easy. The pay is very good and the work environment is relaxed as long as you do your job the right way. After 3 months all employees have the option of transfering to different accounts all across the country granted you meet the driving requirements.
good,"The warehouse workers and managers for JB hunt itself we're great to work with, but I couldnt work for a temp service that was poorly managed and reckless with how the time period and pay period and checks were handled. I told the JB hunt manager I would gladly come back and work for JB hunt directly"
good,"on a daily basis i would have to check the terminal for containers and make sure they did not miss appt or miss getting to rail locations. along with helping drivers with courtsey car, getting towels or hotel vouchers. even make keys for drivers who have lost there. its a busy day."
good,JB Hunt is a good company to work for there are a lot of hours required for you to work but company has very good benefits. I would recommend this company to anyone who is willing to work long hours and enjoys what is required to get the job done.
good,"J.B. Hunt is a great company that has a high ceiling if one sticks it out. Know what you are getting into when you sign up. The benefits aren't great, and the pay is below average. It's a corporate business. Some of the bosses are also stuck in the old ways and make it hard for you to advance. At the same time, the company is transitioning and is getting stronger every year. There is a ton of potential to do well there. And if you have a great boss, then it can be an excellent place to work."
good,when i started working with JB Hunt i wasn't used to getting out of the city often. the company gave me a chance to explore Florida and get to know the ins and outs of my state.
good,JBH's journey of agile transformation is only just beginning. They have some pieces of the transformation in the right places but still have far to go. I hope that they stay the course and continue to grow towards a culture where their servant leaders empower their individual contributors to make the appropriate decisions to remove their roadblocks in a quick and efficient manor.
good,"Comity show on a daily basis. Always something dumb happening, if not with employees but with management. Can say is a good company to work for and with"
good,"driving and meeting people is fun."
good,"J.B. Hunt has a lot of different divisions in it and the one I worked for, Final Mile, was a good career with potential to grow (if you are willing to relocate). Working with truck drivers can be a little rough around the edges but they like things to be organized and good for them. Was labor intensive at this job because we unloaded trucks when needed too."
good,"Very good company to work, however, very micro-managed once hitting a certain ceiling. "
good,I enjoy the people. The workplace resembles a family environment just with numbers. My enjoyment is seeing my workers grow into professionals and attain a strong sense of work ethic that is provided by leadership.
good,Good Opportunity if your just out of college looking to wet your feet in management and operations. For drivers pay is decent and they are treated very well by management.
good,Solid company with a good corporate culture. I have had a good experience but have not seen a lot of potential for advancement.  It is a place you can start with no experience in the field.
good,The company had good benefits and pay when I started but over the years those have declined. It is overall a good company being that it has over 10000 employees working.
good,"They were on top of drivers training like defensive driving, customer service and technology. They did demand 12 hour work days, which was very demanding in city traffic and difficult within the customers hours of operation."
good,Good transportation company to work for.  Non-salaried positions do not pay all that well while the company is trying to stay competitive by merging into the technological field.
good,"picking up at all railyards in Chicago, il and delivering to final locations, and picking up at shippers and taking it to the railyards in chicago, good equipment to drive depending on account on could be home every weeked"
good,Solid management and a place that values loyalty. A little low on the salary side across the board and promotions can be very slow as experience is often the deciding factor.
good,similar to other companies has its good at its bad points. They are implementing a bunch of new changes to keep up with the now trends in business. :)
good,Fantastic company to work for. Great opportunity and compensation. Growth opportunities are limited to where you are willing to relocate to. Hardest part is dealing with drivers.
good,"it was an okay job, the majority of their work is overnights excluding intermodal work. Work/life balance was terrible, you would work 10+ hours a day. But the good side is if you ever needed to ask for a day off they were usually more than excepting to let you have it. But they are pretty strict on accidents, had my very first fender bender here (a not at fault accident) and the let me go the next day after telling me I was going to be on suspension for a couple of days."
good,"What can I say, it's a typical drivers job.  Great dispatchers for the most part.  It's the new kid dispatchers that are hard to work with.  The equipment is average."
good,"start my day at 5am organized the routes for the truck driver then move truck in out of dock to be loaded for the daily deliveries.before I leave to do my route got to make sure I have all my installiation parts. I deliver from appliances to furniture. management is fair and work with you. we have a diverse group of drivers.  I learned to install all the appliances in a house. the hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting almost everyday ,going up stairs with a dolly up to a 4 floor sometimes. the thing I enjoy must about my job is providing good customer service and driving in this beautiful state of Florida."
good,"Very busy and the company wants their employees to work to their best ability.  I have learned patience. Management and co-workers"
good,"If you're willing to relocate, opportunities are endless. JB Hunt is all about the driver, so don't get discouraged when your concerns/priorities are put to the side."
good,"long days and nights, learned a lot about safety.ok were the staff,workers were great. Never ever home. Seeing the 50 states was the thing that moved me here."
good,"Good company. Work life balance can be a challenge. If you can move, you can move up. On call 24/7. Pay is good. Challenging job. Management is good."
good,Good company to work for; However being on a dedicated account having a truck ready when it is time for you to start work has been an ongoing issue
good,In the Inter-model dept there is a serious problems with its managers they upset me and the lack of respect and passing judgment before all the facts were in and the complete unprofessionalism is why I quit...other than that it is a good job I worked mon-fri at .42 cpm picking up comtainers at rail yard and delivering them to our customers and visa versa.
good,"Dedicated Driver for several different accounts. Learn day to day operations of customers and apply to their standards of shipping/receiving as it relates to truck drivers delivering/pick-up loads."
good,"not much to say, i know i can do better.  i need to work for a compine that takes care of its drivers."
good,"There are a lot of perks to this company, the pay is great and depending on the account you are on great home time, and you will get all of your comp pays such as lay over breakdown detention etc. Now for the bad never in 2+ years employment have I met a driver who didn't whine about everything lol, the driver managers are a joke most of them have never seen a truck till the started working for JB, they are good about getting you the miles but for not being forced dispatch they sure force you to take any load they push on you, and usually the loads are already late when dispatched or you'll have about 1 hour to deliver or pick up 3 hours away, that being said a great company to work for since all the bad is not as bad as most trucking companies out there, and there are way worse companies"
good,"My typical day varies week-to-week.  Some weeks I am developing managers, reviewing accidents, team building, and handling driver issues and complaints.  Others I am working on cost saving methods, P&L analysis, customer service, and industry knowledge.  "
good,"Work environment seems to be characterized by top-down, need-to-know management style, which is great for people who do not feel the need to be in control.  Work flow can be heavy, but the company does allow for variance when employees give their personal best effort.  Work assignments and work loads can vary greatly and change quickly, so working for this company requires a great deal of personal flexibility in working styles.  Overall, a great place to work when looking for a great challenge!"
good,"I work all different hours, I unload my truck and drive to different locations! I learn different ways to travel around the usa."
good,"I have been with J B Hunt for several years now and my pay is still below poverty level. I don't intend to stay around much longer waiting for the right pay to come to me, I plan to go and find it. Although my manager is a great boss and he allows me time off when I need it to handle things with my family, I am worth more than he's allowed to pay me."
good,"Dispatcher would send me a load, and I would run it. When something went wrong with the load or equipment dispatch would help me to solve the problem"
good,A standard work day was generally from 8-10 hours. Sometimes I would work Saturdays in addition to monday through friday. No holidays off. Responsible for sheduling inbound and outbound loads for the entire distribution center. Worked with almost zero supervision. Small office environment that we shared with our customer. Scheduled every individual driver's work week in the fleet which was compiled of roughly 70 drivers. Hardest part of the job was sharing an office with your customer. Most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation.
good,start of a day was to inspect my truck and drive.I learned a lot about the rules of the road. mangers lots of times treat you like a number.co-workers are good.hardest part of this was driving in the winter mo's most enjoyable was when you got to where you were going
good,Driven in and the states aroung Coloardo for multiple acounts and equipment to all type's of customers.
good,"If your are married or shave a family, you will sacrifice and surrender both. All work and rules with very little rest."
good,"The job is great, but when you have a family you be wanting more home time and they will work with you if there's an opening in your area. The job keep me working and they fixed their equipment when you reports a problem and get me back to work great company to work for"
good,A typical day at work you will start your day checking your truck making sure everything is good to go on the road. what I learned on the road was all the different ways to get to your offload. in all its a good solo driving company
good,My shift was Sun-Tuesday and every other Wednesday  06-1800 and it was fantastic for spending time with kids and going to school which they strongly encourage.
good,"It was a good experience working with Jb hunt, I always have the mileage I expected and a good pay check never stalked out on my time off. I had enjoyed work for JB hunt if they ever running freight local in my area , I would still be with them! They are real good"
good,"I was happy driving with JB hunt, no forced dispatch. Over time available. Driver manager was very cool,  overnight dispatch very helpful. I would drive for JB Hunt again"
good,Been working at JB Hunt 4 years. Never had any issues with management. I would definitely recommend working here but the pay could be better. Home every night was a plus.
good,"A typical day is chaos ... but not in a negative way. You come in with a plan for your day and then next thing you know you're doing something completely different. It's exciting and fun. You never know what you are walking into, whether good or bad, but it's always interesting."
good,"JB Hunt  is a good place for a driving career. They offer  consistent home time, and  worked with me when I needed time off for medical appointments of special events with my family."
good,"Decent home daily job with decent benefits. 6 am daily start time with no exact time off. Know your route the day before, rarely work weekends. Mildly physical job."
good,JB Hunt takes care of their associates from hours worked to benefits. They provide great time at home with your family. They keep you moving to ensure you get decent pay.
good,The company is a great place to work with limited growth potential do to plenty of talent.  Like most companies there is a $ figure upper management thinks the job should pay and they often adjust to keep it there often causing a roller coaster affect on incomes.
good,"Very fast paced and stressful. Although great pay, hours, and benefits. Recommend job to those who are good at computers and multitasking. If not, this isn't the work place for you."
good,JB Hunt is a great company for drivers.  They drive the inner workings of the company and without them none of us would have a job.  Managers and office staff are focused on maintaining a good work environment for them.
good,JB Hunt is one of the special ones out there.  They are very competitive in the industry and provide a immense amount of training to their employees.  They are a very forward thinking company led by very innovative and fearless leadership.
good,"I learned very much at this position."
good,"It's the transportation business so we operate 24/7, the freight never stops moving. It's a relaxed work environment, the people who work here are good."
good,"Good company not the best but fair, safety oriented and honest management. They provide very good trining for people interested in impruving and brnrfits are in level with other transportation companies."
good,When my account closed There was no local office for me to commute to without a 90 minute commute in traffic or work overnights. If my local account was still open I would not have left.
good,Orientation at JB  Hunt is great we make sure that they have a great experience by playing games and including them in everything and keeping them informed about what is going on with them.
good,"Great co workers, great bosses. "
good,I have no problem working with JB Hunt. Low stress and they don’t force loads on drivers. Pretty much can make what you desire within there pay scale of course.
good,Good company to work for. Fast paced work environment. Management is good but seems limited in capabilities. Typically 40 hours per week. Relaxed atmosphere.
good,"Always busy, but not super stressful, unless there were many things going wrong. Most managers were helpful and wanted everyone to succeed in all aspects of the job."
good,JB Hunt is a fast paced large coorperation who works 60+hour weeks in the peak season.The manager is on top of his warehouse. The pay isnt great except for when your into the overtime and double time.
good,"Your time = money. Certain times of the year can be tough to handle. Be prepared for everything. Weather, break down, freight overload, exe. I’ve personally made 700.00 to 1800.00 a week depending on the flow of freight."
good,"Have not been working there long enough to give a review.  From what I can tell, it is not a bad company to work for.  The people seen nice and the emploees seem to have a nice attitude about the company."
good,Loading the trucks and getting prepared to drive. Management was good and fair with all. The hardest part of the job was going to new places and getting lost. Enjoyable part of the job was seeing different places and meeting new people.
good,"Need to change pay scale. The work you  do, i think they you need to pay more for. Its labor  you install everything on truck, they dont give you the right help."
good,"The hardest part of this job is also the most enjoyable to me which is the constant interaction by phone, email and sametime. Constant communication with the customer and co workers are key to resolving any issues surrounding their freight."
good,"Worked night shift  Wed - Sat 6PM-6AM managing intermodal fleet."
good,good pay for driving miles and also good pay for non driving duties. will pay for drops live unload breakdown and lay over pay. big company with lots of aacounts.
good,"Great culture of working on a team and with really smart coworkers. Difficult to balance work/life. 45 hours per week is expected, but only from some departments. Some lack of consistency."
good,"hours varied from day to day, could work 6 hrs one day and 14 the next. what they called local, it could only be done under ideal conditions. some areas had heavy traffic, others did not. pay checks were good with direct deposit for those late days. week ends off."
good,"Working for this company was pretty good, good working environment. Very friendly employees. Only problem was finding hours. Having a 2 year old daughter it just wasn't cutting it."
good,Typical day is unloading appliances from one truck onto another delivering to homes and installing the appliances. Learning how to install all appliances was the best part about the job.
good,I like JB Hunt. It's been good to me. I have enjoyed the learning experience they have provided. I like my coworkers and meeting new people.
good,I interned with JB Hunt my senior year of college and was eventually offered a full-time positions for after I graduate. It is a great learning experience and first job for students straight of out of college.
good,Normally i drive to my delivery and unload cabinets and counter bases and tops then drive to pick up a load going back and deliver it then go to the yard to get another trailer to deliver another load of cabinets
good,I like working for jb hunt but it takes a lot to advance in the company. You start as a driver and it seems to be that that is the only job you will have in this company.
good,On a local account. The job is fairly decent for what it is. My only problem is you can't plan a day out. Preplans are constantly changing throughout the day and it's hard to plan fuel and breaks.
good,A company built on drivers yet the office people really make the difference. The benefits are good however read the fine print.
good,"Everyone knows about JB HUNT. They are JB HUNT. It's not about the money, it's manly about family stability. JB HUNT in my opinion is more for drivers that don't want to take the hard of being an owner operator. JB HUNT is a good company to retire from. But I feel that JB HUNT is for more of the older drivers that cares more about home time, weekly paychecks, steady work and light driving"
good,i really enjoyed the managers but sometimes they just don't put enough time to do a task for example weather issues and expect you to not break one of the dot rules which is bad for me and my license and for the company's reputation but i really enjoyed working here
good,very productive great logistics and load planning however management and dispatch is a very tight nit group and when it comes to being a driver they are quick to railroad you and push blame onto driver and have no regard for driver safety during adverse driving conditions remember any good driver knows when it's time to get off the road and a drivers safety is every ones safety
good,We enter work start unloading trucks and we joke with each other while getting the job done in a timely fashion with out injury and damaged goods
good,Great place to work. Management was not the best!! Raises are not given to the drivers. Management was not knowledgeable of there job.
good,"A typical day would start at 6am cross docking inbound shuttles, loading outbound trucks and dividing pull ahead deliveries into regional areas. Leave the warehouse around 8:30am usually driving to the farthest point out and making the deliveries on the return trip."
good,"If you are a driver looking for a driving job then JB Hunt is the company you want to work for. They take care of their drivers, have great benefits and will do whatever is necessary to make the driver happy. "
good,"7 am - 5pm workdays, Monday- Friday."
good,"A typical day starts in a drop yard, picking up a shuttled load, or an empty trailer and driving to the terminal for your load assignment.  Operating in the extreme conditions of New York city and the 5 boroughs with very tight streets, one ways, and blind side backing, low bridge heights, and L's.  I was taught the Smith system of driving which on open road is great but much more difficult to apply in the extreme conditions stated above.  The co-workers there were always very helpful even if the company didn't stand behind the driver but instead blamed them for any and everything that happens.  Overall a good place to work and would be better with a little more tolerance of drivers having a difficult time adjusting to what is expected."
good,"I would start my day with my per trip inspection then start my job assignments. What I have learned as a young driver is that you have got to know the the DOT laws that are out here. I also learned you have to watch for every and anything that is on the road while driving so paying attention to what you are doing is a must do. Safety is always first. My fleet manager was a big help to me by sending me good loads to run. The hard part is backing some of the customers spots was not truck friendly. I do got to say it made me a lot better now I can back almost anywhere."
good,"Always a busy day a lot of interaction with the drivers and customers. Constant contact with Vendors Telephones were a major part of the day."
good,"I was the first onsite manager in St. Louis and was challenged with growing our fleet, driving force, customer base, and improving relations with our customers.  "
good,"fast paced and constantly working. you will almost never get an ""at a boy"" so do not expect it. you are on call 24/7."
good,JB was a pretty good company. I was always rollin in that big yellow and white International.
good,for me its a fair place to work...wheres my raise!!!! Stockton dispatch has been good to me and i get along with everyone. Would like to see a raise for the drivers .we all work hard from the cleaning lady to the big boss.but it seems we are always overlooked becuse we are a dime adozen..it shouldnt be that way.my2cents.
good,"J.B. Hunt is an OK place to work. ""Holidays"" should be in quotes due  to their lack of observing them. It takes a long time to build up vacation or earn that next extra week per year. Opportunities to move around are available, but they'll pay someone coming in from outside the company more than they would you to promote you up. In other words, no loyalty. Health insurance does not cover much. My wife and I were ill at one time and went to the same clinic. Her total payment for the check up was 75% less than what I had to pay. They do have good attitude towards being healthy and give you time to workout at lunch. "
good,J.B. Hunt is a hard driving company in which I personally enjoyed. The senior management always put forth challenges in effort to push us to grow. I was able to take away a lot knowledge and valuable experience in my time with this company.
good,"good for new drivers out of school. like all big companies they watch out for themselves, drivers are just a number."
good,if you can find a run that works with your schedule this is a great place to work
good,Always on the road everyday the same just in different states.Didnt have much to learn other than driving and doing paperwork. Didnt have any co-workers around everyone had their own truck.There wasnt any hard part of the job cause everything was drop and hook. The enjoyable part was relaxing after a long driving period.
good,This is a dedicated account that should be paid at a different scale than what is done now.
good,"Ok company to work for, raises not very consistent, drivers are very friendly and work is slow in the winter"
good,This is a key to our transportation needs. I also learn something new everyday. The connection between the office staff and drivers is like nothing that i have ever seen before.
good,Good place to work. Some managers bring down the rating but a lot more good managers. Good pay. Hard work. Flexible in time off requests if you give them notice.
good,"Overall good company to work for. All companies are the same for the most part, it's all about what you make of it. My advice to you is to do your research."
good,"I like J.B. Hunt, They try to accommodate you in any curistances in your life, I like that I go home every week, if you want to stay out, they also set you up for loads, I find so far they have treated me fairly and I feel good about my pay...Every company is different,  You just have to fine the one that works for you."
good,"JB Hunt has invested quite a bit in Engineering and Technology with the introduction of their JB Hunt 360 Marketplace platform in the past two years, which has transformed the work environment for the better."
good,"It's a great place to start your career in logistics. ICS, specifically, was always a fast-paced, and fun environment. The only thing that I would change would be their pay scale."
good,"I enjoyed my time at JB Hunt. I never lived the same day twice, and I loved learning a variety of skills and exercising problem solving and critical thinking skills. I most enjoyed the time spent helping my customers."
good,"Overall great place to work. Great culture, Positive environment, Opportunities to advance, etc. The pay doesn't compensate for stress level though..."
good,"Typical trucking company greedy for money. Truck drivers work long hours and sit in slow traffic too often. I used to love heading away from the city, but too many times and right at rush hour, I would be required to make deliveries locally at an appointment time which forced me to take my truck through rush hour traffic."
good,"I am paid for a forty eight hour work week and usually work fifty two. I love this job, but they need to pay a bit better for what some of us have to do."
good,"They do have a very liberal time off program and you can manage your/work/life schedule rather easily. Technology is the achilles heel here, as our systems are always slow and work properly seldomly."
good,They have kinda poor management. They are bad about hiring dumb college kids to manage their local trucking accounts. They most usually don’t know anything at all.
good,The company is so wide spread that no two work locations or account offices could be the same. Trying to put together a company wide review based solely off of my experiences would not do it justice
good,"Some nice accounts but pay is low and needs to be moved up, Drivers take on an high risk driving these trucks and away from their family members.I would love to work for this company with Decent pay and it has the best safety training."
good,It's a pretty laid back environment for a big corporate campus. Dress code is moderately enforced business casual. Most teams are pretty lenient with WFH as long as you get your stuff done. Hardest part about the job is having to slog through multiple teams of approvals to get anything done.
good,"Within JBH, I feel that we all are accountable for our own learning and education. I have learned that constructive criticism will help in growth and will allow you to gain more knowledge within the work place. I do feel that JBH is not the place for proper training if not know of what transportation consist of. It is very difficult, especially being in a group where there is not the same day to day task. I do enjoy the environment as well as the people who allow work to be fun and not a normal ""day to day job."""
good,Decent pay. Consistent miles. Friendly managers. Not a lot of home time. I have some local work but mostly Regional or OTR. Only left cuz I wanted to be local and they didn't have local work where I lived
good,"Coworkers are great"
good,Managers can be fantastic if you get the right ones. The most amount of stress comes from customers or management expecting too much out of an employee. Training is not the best
good,"Haven't quit, yet. Everytime I get it in my head to payday rolls around and i stay a few more weeks. I have worked for better and worked for much worse. Would love more hometime but with that would be smaller checks. Take your pick. Nowhere is perfect. Driver managers, as they call them now, change too often. Pay dips a couple weeks with every new one. They are changing over to automatics, hopefully they still keep some manuals or I'll definitely be gone. Money or not, don't do automatics. The rail is 5000% better than it was 25 years ago. New tech can be an awesome thing.  Right now bnsf elwood is ticking me off. Not jb hunts fault. Work in progress i suppose. Overall not a bad place to drive for."
good,pretty fast paced with decent pay. High turnover makes things difficult some times. Overall not a bad place as management was fairly attentive to driver's needs.
good,"If it wasn't LA traffic, I'd probably liked it more.  I always had a base layer of stress at work.  I didn't feel like the pay was fair; you could make $350+ a night working the safe streets, but struggle to make over $200 during the day when it's dangerous to drive.  The gap shouldn't be that much between day and night drivers."
good,Would definitely go back. Decent pay and nice set hours with set days off. Very relaxed pace of work and all the managers were very easy to get along with
good,Founded on family values and continues to run on the same values. Many opportunities to grow and learn and advance. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time at J.B. Hunt and I’m looking forward to what the next chapter holds.
good,"It's a decent job, most positions are entry level. If you're willing to relocate you will move up very fast. The work life balance among different divisions really vary. ICS = more relaxed. Intermodal = more stress."
good,"I enjoyed working at JB Hunt. "
good,"This company is great for advancement. It is very easy to move up the ladder. However, certain people and positions can allow for employees to be taken advantage of."
good,great place to work. at least in this office. each office differs. Each office is like its own company with the JB hunt name so it depends on management there for culture. pay is low across the board for industry norms
good,Expected to drive around 9 hours a day and or use around 12 of your 14 hours. Pre and post inspect equipment each day. Pick up and deliver loads in region to rail yards for for transport and take loads from rail yards to deliver to region.
good,"Workdays are okay. Management was hands down the best part. Hardest part of the job is being away from home constantly. Dispatchers are fairly understanding and willing to work with you unless it's night or weekend, they're still understanding but they'll want you to wait to work anything out with your typical day dispatcher."
good,"Local positions have you home everyday, the grass doesn't get much greener at other company's, they care about you as an individual. The only issues I've ever had were things that were not within the company's control, but that's every employer. The only reason I'm leaving is because my spouse wants to start work again. If you prove yourself here, they will take great care of you."
good,"As with any trucking company, your experiences will vary. I was lucky to be on a dedicated account where the job had a small company feel while still maintaining the benefits of working for a large company"
good,"A lot of good, hard working people. Fast paced environment with long hours. Must be good at managing people in Operations, a lot of responsibilities in early stages of career. Must be self-motivated to strive in this field."
good,"Great company to work for. Fast paced, always something to do. Great job security. Only downside is long hours and work year round especially around holidays."
good,"Spending nearly the entire day on the phone and responding to emails - keeping up with market trends, negotiating, communicating to customers, and pricing."
good,Enjoyed Driving for JB Hunt. I was never lied to and had I not gotten sick I would still be with them. The only real complaint I have has nothing to do with JB Hunt but with the customers. Too many times I was delayed being loaded though JB does a good job compensating drivers.
good,"Easy to get along with management."
good,"Job was good, people good, a little stressful at times but all good"
good,Overall this has been a great company to work for. Advancement is definitely there for the people that work hard. A great resume builder. Takes time to earn your way up financially though.
good,"Great career, must have ability to adapt to changing customer needs with whatever account working for. Having these abilities will ensure a successful career with JB hunt."
good,"Gained valuable leadership skills in a very hands-on environment and applied to a specific business setting. "
good,"JB was a great company to work for both OTR and local runs, dispatch did a decent job of keeping me busy, miles where enough to get by plus a bit, but not high enough to brag. Pay rate ended up a decent dependably average."
good,"Compensation was a little below the average for the position."
good,I drove for J.B. Hunt for about ten years and do not have any major complaints. I was fortunate to have many good/great account managers and only a couple of bad managers. The problem was that I could have a new manager every week. Pay and benefits were average. Management expected safety and not only preached it like I found with other trucking companies. I was never forced to drive unsafe equipment or in unsafe conditions.
good,A good company to work for. No complaints. I worked for them a few times and always kept a clean driving record so they were always willing and still willing to hire me.
good,"The majority of the employees at JB Hunt are knowledgeable and courteous. The work hours are long, but the pay is fair. However, if you want to work on a various dedicated account that JB Hunt has with various customers, be prepared and expect that they could lose that account at any time under any circumstance due to contract disputes, negotiations, etc."
good,J.B. Hunt is a good place to work and start or career or to jump start another. They will take the time to train in new positions.
good,"I learned a lot working here, I believe they could do better at training and explaining company policies by the book instead how workers interpret them. I learned so much about organization, computer skills, and time management."
good,"Get up drive to the shipper or deliver the load."
good,A large Company that is hard to make an advancement in. This Company seems to strive more for family within family type of business. You will have a better chance of growing there if you have family in he company already. A lot of areas of Management here do not process good leadership or Management skills.
good,"Great teamwork. Busy busy busy! Loved being on the front line with customers. Upper management was fantastic but hard to find time to communicate with,"
good,I enjoy working there ... Pay is decent but the dedicated waiting line is long and other better opportunities come along quicker but I give it a 4 stars
good,In the mornings the truck is loaded with merchandise from the warehouse. We leave the warehouse to deliver and/or install merchandise to customers house or office. when we finish we head back to the ware house to clock out.
good,"Lots of inbound and outbound calls for regional and local distribution centers all over the US, I have four locations that I call and schedule home deliveries for :: One in Hanover, MD, Corapolis, PA, Wichita, KS and one in Port Allen, LA... Love being able to come through for a customer that is in need of an appliance if they have been without for a while.. or if a birthday present can be delivered on time.."
good,Typical Truck Driving Job. Mostly Intermodal. Work week is 5-6 days at a time. Management is good about getting you home for a 34 hour restart.
good,"I started there with 6 people 3 were in charge of booking loads and 3 were in charge of dispatching.  Quickly this changed to 1 (me) booking loads, scheduling maintenance and dispatching with one supervisor.  "
good,The position I was hired for was very simple and easy to understand.at time.The majority of the staff were extremely friendly and co workers as well.
good,"The CPS position is not for everyone, but JB Hunt as a company is a fantastic place to work. Extremely high turnover in the CDP department that won't stop anytime soon, but the rest of the company is solid and retains employees well."
good,"Let's get this straight: I don't find the transportation industry the least bit interesting. It's mind-numbingly boring to me. So being a programmer here hasn't really struck my fancy. "
good,"Seems to be an issue at times getting the answers we need to pass on to our customer, seems like some departments try to work against you instead of helping you."
good,"Great learning experience for learning the transportation world.  Long hours when you are starting off, but well worth it in the end."
good,"First thing I did was check and make copies of all paperwork that would deal with next day deliveries. Following up with checking my email or any pass down sheets that might have result in changes of my load out. I would Then Log into the Telzon Scanners and Laptop so I would have the tools to verify I had the correct Product for my Helpers/co-workers. "
good,"Drove the c and k dedicated account 4-6 days a week. Pallet jack in store delivery at a grocery store. Once established you may serve the same several stores each week, allowing the building of good customer rapport."
good,"Fast paced, fair treatment by staff and Management. Pay is competitive with industry standards.  Equipment is good. Co-workers are great, hard workers, and dedicated to what they do."
good,learned how to drop and hook deliveries and also able to learn more about transportation. I had never delivered containers my past experience was delivering produce. I was glad to learn something new
good,"I ran dedicated lane from Dallas, TX to Laredo, TX and delivered all types of freight. My home time was every week and that made the job more enjoyable."
good,"Freight Brokerage, cold calling, carrier sales, carrier customer service, price negotiation, problem solving, leadership roles, team work, multi tasking, presentations to management"
good,"Am working night shift right now, The work is not hard manual labor, and you can make a good wage at J.B. Hunt. You will sometimes have long days, and some days will be around 8 hours. Management is pretty fair,but none have driven truck before to get the perspective of the driver experieces."
good,"Great company to work for if you know the right people and they are willing to help you. Was misled a few times about advancement opportunities, but if a person was on the right track and knew the right people, they could really go somewhere."
good,"over all , good place to work, co-workers are helpful, again management needs to hit the road to get some pointers"
good,"In the DCS division, a typical work day involves making/receiving several phone calls, lots of monitoring of your drivers and enforcement of company policy. Multi-tasking is an absolute must. The hardest part of the job is probably finding work for drivers during the slow season. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. Must be willing to relocate to less desireable areas for advancement."
good,"JB  Hunt has grown within in my tenure and I have seen alot of employees advance and many of them be unqualified. The work can be overwhelming sometimes, but if you are good you will succeed."
good,hauled glass out of dewitt ia in the begain. at the end hualed for home depot pro account. sleeping 15 miles from the house was the hardest thing.
good,Overall its been a wonderful experience. I have been able to work with a divers community and learn a lot about account based management.
good,"Up front I would like to say I enjoy the people I work with. I am looking for local employment.  My reason for leaving is; because my commute to work consist an hour to an hour and a half depending on traffic."
good,Good company with good values based culture.  Management is forward thinking.  Company is starting to put more resources to IT development which has been lacking in the past.
good,It is a very fast paced job with not much time for lunch or breaks. Their objective is to push you so that they can move as many trailers as possible.
good,Good pay and benefits even though the benefits keep going up in price but that is everywhere. Off on weekend but you pay for through the week. My family dont really know me at all Monday-Friday because of the long hours but i do like i said get off on weekends. It is a plus to be off sat-sun.
good,"My latest position was in a fast paced environment setting intermodal appointments for many Fortune 500 companies. I request delivery appointments via phone, e-mail, and websites. Work closely with our Ops team as mediator between customers. My co-workers are committed and helpful. I have learned valuable customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is completing the volume of work in the time allotted."
good,"A typical day at work for me is coming in running my reports, interacting with my piers and customers, and being as productive as I can to ensure my company reaches its goal for the day. On a daily basis I learn different things about our company and our customers. I work for one of the best bosses and groups a person could have. The hardest part of my job is convincing customers that our charges are valid and they should pay, but the most enjoyable part is knowing that everyday I work is a profitable day for me and my company."
good,This is a decent company to work for the prequalification process is a
good,"My biggest issue working for JB Hunt, was that I hadn't driven in quite a while. When I went through the orientation process, I didn't legitimately pass my road test, instead I was told that I would be at the correct percentage the following day. I then had to beg to retest. They still put me out on the road. The first few days were rough and stressful, but I survived without an accident. I eventually told them that I didn't feel safe driving. Luckily for me, my significant other was willing to help me out, so they allowed us to drive together, so that I could learn the ropes again."
good,JB Hunt was a good experience for me. During my time with JB Hunt I drove the southeast region. My duties were to drive safely to customers and most of the time drop their freight and hook to an empty trailer. This was also a good company to work for.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and had world class employees that help each other when in need. This was my first job after the military and I felt that it was a good transitional job.
good,Enjoyed my time at JB Hunt but there comes a time for change. I Have nothing truly bad to say but it is a cliquish environment. The company helps out those that can locate and want to locate no matter how much of a bad manager you are.
good,"You can make a good living here. Your experience greatly depends on the account your on. Pay range $50,000 to $75,000. PTO accumulation day 1 and Holiday pay after 1 year."
good,"Decent Company with stable and reliable financial future. Worked there almost thirty years. Only gripe: after a light stroke in Feb of 2019 I was forced to take a year off, and not once did anyone there check to see if I was okay. Of course, no one at JB Hunt owes me anything, but it was a bit disappointing not to hear from anyone. after working there almost thirty years."
good,My department was big on team work. We were not afraid to ask each other for help and could always count on each other when needed. The job was very fast paced and required multi-tasking in which allowed be to become a better team member.
good,"A typical day is full of phone calls from both customers and drivers with issues ranging from unanswered calls to customers to missed deliveries to the customers.   I enjoy my job, the responsibilities, coworkers/managers and environment.  The hardest part of my job would be dealing with complaints that I cannot readily repair.  It usually can be taken care of the following business day but that, at times is not the answer the customer wants."
good,Its  a great place to work at I rather have a pay raised or bonuses to show our appreciate towards the good work I do. There's  better opportunity and good work environment out there for me to make progress
good,"If you like getting ripped off (miles) this is the place for you. Example. one place was 147 miles, and paid 117. Another 97 miles, paid 81. If you leave the Ayer rail yard and drive over to the Lancaster terminal 15 minutes one way, you won't get paid (miles). If you go from the Worcester yard over to Shrewsbury (15 minutes away) you won't get paid (miles). In their own words it's all considered the same zip code, even though you go through multiple towns / cities. I got sick of being ripped off and left. Multi billion dollar company taking advantage of the little guy. If other companies can pay practical miles, they can to. It's all about taking advantage. Also, you need to track all your own pay and submit it. They will either accept or deny it."
good,"I work hard to develop new business prospects, manage existing accounts and strengthen existing new and existing relationships."
good,Great company to work for just have to get in the right division. J.B Hunt has a lot of different divisions that will work for any driver. Its opportunities working for J.B Hunt
good,"I was happy with the interview and my the manager I was to report to. Things changed later on with different management coming into the system. It was like moving the uprights back just before the kick. I don't know if it is the CEO or who is responsible, but it is not a good environment  for POSITIVE growth in the company. People were moved from department to department and even city to city instead of being let go even thou they were toxic to the company. I enjoyed my time with JBH until the last 4 months. That is when things changed."
good,Working at jb hunt was overall good and  i had such a good time being there.   I liked the staff members they tried to make the job fun for me so i give them 5 stars
good,Long hours but money to be made Manager was ok but stand your ground on them over running you. They will run you into the ground. just be careful move at your own pace
good,"I really have nothing negative to say about JB. You have the usual office politics like anywhere else! If you are a hard worker you can make some money, if you like to nap during the day you can do that as well...lol.   They have the intermodal freight so make the most of it!"
good,"Great culture, great management, great professionals and experience.  Enjoyed it the whole time. Only real downside is the pay. It is not very competitive to the market. On average my old co-workers that left received jobs that paid 44% higher."
good,"In my role within ICS (Integrated Capacity Solutions) I am tasked with procuring capacity for multiple accounts and providing excellent communication on driver eta's and ensuring on time delivery of customers freight. The atmosphere is great, however; during slower seasons within the freight market may have you sitting idle. Atmosphere is great, a lot of younger people tend to work the brokerage division at J.B. Hunt. You can regularly see people throwing darts at each other, tossing footballs. Teams coordinate potlucks."
good,J.B. Hunt is a great company to work for.  They only thing that they need to work on is training there dispatchers a little better and hold them more accountable for there actions.
good,"Management has been on point."
good,Good Company with great benefits ... But you can get misplaced if they get outbid or lose an account ...also many safety features on truck and company on a whole has strict safety policies..
good,People are very helpful and it is a great place to learn and get experience. Not a very stressful job. JB Hunt is a very family orientated company and very close to community.
good,JB is a good company to work for. I feel they pay a little less than they should though. Provided good training and always encouraged you to take any classes you needed to advance your career.
good,Big company. Lots of opportunity to grow. Must be willing to move to climb ladder quickly.  I learned a great deal when I was with the company. Vacation time could improve
good,The mgmt dispatch needs to be trained on pride and dignity and how that gives the driver a better day when you speak with respect and dignity to the drivers
good,great place to work if you’re a person that doesn’t mind to run long hours to make a good check. If you put in the effort here you will make a lot of money. And if you don’t put in the effort you will still make  at least 50k a year. The sky is really the limit.
good,I answered 3000 calls a day. Never took a lunch. The culture was nice because I got transfered around left and right because everyone wanted me. A typical day was me getting to work at 6am and not supposed to be their till 7am so I could do more.
good,I enjoy working for jb hunt all the trucks was very clean all the driver manger nice and easy to talk to they help you out anytime you ask but the pay was up and down not consistent enough
good,You are working from the time you enter the building until the day ends.  You have an hour lunch break but you really have to take more breaks and go get your lunch and eat while working because it was only two people in the office and it was very busy with incoming calls.
good,This job provided everything I was looking for at the time. It pays very well and the benefits are competitive. The employee atmosphere is positive and there are career development opportunities.
good,"Starting pay is very little and it takes several years to move up the ladder.  However because it's corporate, there's a lot of opportunity to move around.  Self funded insurance which may not cover certain items - check first.  A lot of effort is made to keep drivers on the road safe.  Departments are broken down and therefore it's easy to learn when you're a new employee."
good,Once you were dispatched using an Electronic Log and logging on to your assigned equipment a pre-trip inspection of your equipment was performed. Trailers were pre-loaded and you hooked onto then weighed by you. You made adjustments where you needed and proceeded to your destination and return in a day or weeks time.
good,"In comparisons to other company it is above the average, they have a good system of operations, key on safety is a big issue which make them above the average in the long hall."
good,"Didn't really want to get back into trucking but JB Hunt took me, so here I am. Went to school for IT and want to get back there. Home every weekend, but just isn't enough for me any more."
good,"J.B. Hunt actually is a fairly good company to drive for. No company is perfect, but they definitely do many things to improve the life of the driver and keep you rolling as best they can."
good,"JB Hunt recently raised some of the pay but then has hired many more drivers. This has caused many drivers to now slip-seat which actually decreases the amount of loads one can do in a day. "
good,"J.B Hunt was a good place to work. It offered a steady job, and it was work that I felt pretty comfortable with at first. In the beginning, they didn't care how long a job took. All they cared about was getting it right. Then there was a management change, and they started stressing time on a job, and that is when I started messing up"
good,"I really enjoyed interning at J.B. Hunt. It was an excellent learning experience. The management team that I got to work with was exceptional."
good,Fast Place lot of work lot of pickups and deliveries on time performance excellent equipment brand new trucks pay was / container management excellent plenty of work pay could have been better
good,"The company is like a big family. They take care of one another and its a very fun environment. The just is very tedious. You come in and do the same thing everyday, which was not a bad thing for me."
good,Good people to work with.  Manger is the best boss I've ever worked for.  The only downside to this position is the pay.  Not quite high enough for the work we do.
good,+Excellent Benefits package
good,"JB Hunt is an awsome company to work for just has poor management. Work any hours you would like with OT available, Allowed to listen to tunes while you work. great lunches"
good,Management is there to help and see you succeed. It is a team based environment. Great company to work for. I enjoyed the interaction I had with potential new hires and over seeing the interview process as a whole.
good,"As the Network Engineer responsible for the B2B environment, I found my job very challenging, but rewarding.  The group in which I worked was a close nit group of friends who supported each other professionally and personally.  The greatest opportunity that I faced was the constant challenge with the EDI team to balance performance with stability.  I wish I had never left."
good,"Enjoyed it, but just wanted to be home more frequently.  They had an app on your phone that made work easier and more efficient.  Has great benefits and and great staff."
good,"Could be difficult at times due to expectations of the owners,"
good,"JBH is a good company and I started with a great team. After relocating management was a nightmare. Controlling environment with emphasis put on 1 team member. Abusive conduct toward employees of the Chicago Refrigerated is known within the company and nothing has been done to correct the issue,"
good,This is one of the best trucking companies you will work for. This is a company that actually cares about each individual driver and their unique needs.
good,"I loved the drivers I worked with and the mangers I worked for with one exception.   I left the company because the regional Ops Mgr was not professional in the least and hit on me every time he was in our facility.  I did not want to go thru the channels to have this investigated to otherwise tarnish my own career.  I would've loved to have been able to stay.  Other than this, I'd say JB Hunt was a great place to work!"
good,"Very flexible job! Allowed me to grow! Assigned truck, great scheduling, management was easy to communicate with & valuable experience...just couldn't get the home time I needed."
good,"Study work load, with a great group of employees with easy spirit to work with. No worries to not enough work, and have regular home time, with a least 2 days off, and some holidays,with pay."
good,"Good workplace and managers, just not much room for advancement or pay raises. Work becomes a routine. Not really a place to stay if you would like opportunities to grow."
good,Driving a truck to deliver goods helps you to manage your time. It is definitely a full days work and then some. Not too strenuous but you have to be hyper alert and safety conscious at all times. Other drivers over the road are super kind and helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Final Mile Services in the Boston area."
good,Depending on what account you work for its not a bad place at all. I really enjoyed working on a Home Depot account but now that i transferred to inter-modal in Chesapeake Va im not enjoying it as much anymore since i dont have weekends off anymore
good,"There are many opportunities with JB Hunt.  Work hard and be willing to be educated, there is plenty of opportunity for advancement and empowerment."
good,"Dedicated account. Good money. Everything JB Hunt said they would do they have. That's saying alot in the trucking world. Account managers seem to be pretty good. Equipment is plan but good. Governed at 62mph but u get use to. Lots of safety equipment that does help but can be a pest at times in traffic. Nice uniforms provided. Dedicated account I'm on is very demanding,  but the pay is adjusted to match. Work mon, tues., off wed. work thurs. fri. Off weekends. U will burn your 14hr clock up the days u work. More than a driving job. U get to build relationships with your customers.  That is a big plus. Physically demanding in short periods that is good. Not for everyone! District manager is not that great but it could be a personality conflict. Orientation in Atlanta was great! The gals up there put u through the paces and are knowledgeable,  they were and are drivers. Meals were not that great. Hotel was good.  Pay has been spot on except for one time and my manager took care of it asap. The people net sucks! Not as good as other units. U learn to deal with it. Safety is good. There all about safety but listen also. This is a thinking man's job, u have to problem solve. If u want to hold a steering wheel and hang out in truck stops waiting on a load then this is not for u"
good,I worked here for awhile and I really enjoyed working for Kelly. He knows everyone so it was a good way for me to get a job and get some contacts for people I could be working with in the future.
good,"In this Co I stated as a long hold driver were I had the opportunity to travel cross country for several years,"
good,it was alot of moving around but you did so much work that when u got to your senses it was time to go. if u wasnt ready for work at all it would put a tow on you.
good,"To be an intermodal truck driver at J.B.Hunt, you must learn the ins and outs of the job. Know the rules, know what you get paid for, and be safe. If you can do this, then the company is pretty nice to work for."
good,Very good experience. Nice terminal throughout country.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,The job allows you a certain level of independence to run your business as an entrepreneur. Overall JB Hunt is a pretty good place to work
good,This position consisted of setting appointments and some tracking tracing. They really work with their employees and allowing working to be fun and low stress. Management in 2013 was amazing.
good,"Work was pretty easy. "
good,"I like that they gave a rookie a chance to go out over the road but it isnt for me."
good,"dont have any complaints about this company, wasnt there fault that glass factory shut down.the management was excellent. i learned to always drive safe and use safety to unload. loved the job for most part, sometimes weather in my delivery area was bad.hardest part of job was unloading the big heavy sheets of glass"
good,"It is a normal day at work definitely would work again for JB Hunt."
good,a typical day at work was working in a warehouse with other team members making sure to complete orders in timely and safe fashion. i was able to walk away from this job with the found skill of working with a hydraulic jack. my coworkers and managers were very nice to work with. the hardest part of the job was not able to work more hours. the most enjoyable was forming a bond with my supervisor
good,"JB Hunt is one of the best logistic company out here.  Their stocks says it all. However, you must bring ur A game working for this company n just being a part of something that is consistently growing. As with anything,you must put in the work to get what You....need from them. This company has much work, it's all where u live or willing to travel.Not all accounts are the best,the money accounts are the worse n stressful but each week you see your hard work n that gets u thru the following week. The jobs or accounts that less stress n gives u more personal time are the jobs that pays way less..This company strives on Safety.. If ur reckless or not good being detailed or good being proactive n taking responsibility for your logs n other people safety then this is not the company for you. You will loose ur job. I was suspended for 6months but they hired me back n gave me all my time back as if I never left once I completed a year. I lost my wife late last year,the year I came back n they gave me money to buried her.. This company is a very good company n u just have to examine urself as the type of employee u are.. it's easy to criticized when u was the wrong one.."
good,Got only one day off per week. Would have to wait two weeks to get two days off. Paid was OK but not enough miles. Missed our family a lot. But they had a Rider Policy. Learned how to be a Safe Driver with this company. They did not want me to leave. But I was getting Guardianship of my mother but needed to be home more in order for it to be granted. They tried but could not. So I had to get a new job.
good,This company rewards those who find a niche and can grow a customer. This will help you get noticed and up for advancement.
good,Got to see 48 states got to live on the road you had to drive in hard rain and snow  you would stay out for 3 to 4 weeks at a time come home for two days then be gone again
good,"On a typical day, i would take nightly truck list and find the pallets that would go onto each truck and mark them. My crew of 4 and i would load each pallet while scanning each individual piece. On this job i learned how to supervise my crew and kept everything timely and in control. The manager on duty would drive trucks into the designated bay. My co-workers were very helpful when needed. If someone was behind, we would all jump on to the lane that needed help. The hardest part of working there is mixing up truck orders and putting them on the wrong trucks. We would then have to unload the truck or trucks and load them back properly. I enjoyed working at this job for its fast pace and the crew members."
good,"Solid company to work for.  You have the ability to make your own decisions, and if your work hard you will move up in the company.  The company is very stable, and is consistently getting better in the industry."
good,"Solid company, good management and advancement opportunities. Awesome people to work for."
good,"I start my job very early at 5:00 am. My job contains to: repair trailers, repair the roof, side panels,flooring, tires etc."
good,"A typical day at work is extremely busy with managing drivers, warehouse employees, supervisors, and temp labor.  During the day you complete safety conference calls, customer meetings, and route freight for the next day.  "
good,"Long work hours. Away from home most of the time. However, this job would be great for a single person with no kids. In addition, there is plenty of freedom in this career."
good,"Overall I like J.B. Hunt. There are a lot of directions you can go with this company, as long as you are willing to relocate! That is hard for me specifically, so I am confined to my office alone, where advancement can be tough."
good,A good Company . If you could do 6000 loads without incident you will be the best driver in the company. So if you could be a perfect Driver good for you.Some drivers are able to go for 10 years without a problem.
good,They’re a good company they got their problems but not too badThe only problem is slip seat and sometimes the dispatchers cannot know what they’re doing and they will tell you you were going home every five days but really is every 2200 miles.
good,JB Hunt is a good company to work for a lot of discipline they respect their employee JB Hunt is a company you need to work for it I spend some years working for this company I learn.
good,"Like most big companies it's hard not to be seen as just another employee. I say this because as long as you're performing to standard you hear nothing from management. As soon as you have an issue, they are quick to have a conversation with you."
good,They have plenty of Semi-Local assignments available. Follow rules of the company. They work well with their clients giving decent assignments. Usually pay 0.47 per mile.
good,Good company depends on the account you work on. Depending on management the company would be great. Flexible schedule for the over the road drivers and local drivers
good,Had 2 consecutive bad weeks combined with not being able to get home as desired since my wife needed my help with the kid on Saturdays. I wish they had a better local job in my area.
good,Jb hunt was a nice place it has alot of diversity and plenty of good drives if you need too learn or no things. i would reccomend someone or return to that company..
good,"Good equipment, good managers ... Follow your pay ... The pay is low for the amount of work and time required to get a decent check. .. pros...95 percent of the time you'll have work through the week or you can ask to make up on the weekend."
good,"Typical day is running an outbound load to a customer. Pick up a load from a vendor and head back to town. Repeat that process once more before going home or taking additional loads. They pay hub miles and some locations that are shorter runs will pay an additional rate on top of your mileage. Intermodal prefers using the OBC to communicate with management. Dedicated accounts prefer a phone call to management as they don't check OBC messages as regularly. Safety goals are team goals with some rewards for drivers. The most difficult part of running intermodal is looking for containers. It's always nice when we are allowed to get a container from CZ in Cicero, IL. Dedicated is a little bit different. Most complaints about dedicated stem from the customers/vendors we have to deal with that take 4 hours to load in some cases. Those customers/vendors are few and far between but it should be noted. My favorite part about being attached to J.B. Hunt is the team culture. Being in the office in the morning or afternoon is one of my favorite parts of the day. I just love interacting with the people in the office."
good,There’s always work. But there’s only so much you can make money wise. You get paid per mile and per load . It’s an ok job if you have a small family.
good,"Jb hunt is a very fun place to work I did work there for over ten years they also treat drivers good leaving there because I'm getting tired driving truck,"
good,"ok for what it is, you decide your roll and competence, management can be better, good equipment, for all the money invested, dispatch should be better,"
good,I love what I do. Some days are stressful but that’s life. Management can be a problem some times bc they never drove a truck and don’t understand what we go through.
good,"This job has good customers and difficult customers. Trying to appease them while managing a fleet of drivers can be a challenge at times. It is a fast paced environment with great opportunities to advance your career. Every account is different, but your work life balance can suffer if you are trying to climb the ladder."
good,"I've only been on the Anheuser Busch account for a little over a month but so far im enjoying it. I'm home every other day and take home around 700 a week and have a full benefits package. The only cons are long days (but thats trucking),and dispatch can micromanage at times. Overall i'd recommend JB Hunt to my friends. Unless things dramatically change I plan on staying here for a long while."
good,"Management was good, but he couldn't get us the pay we deserve! The work was too much for the salary, equipments well taking care, a lot issues you won't face when working for JB hunt, they will assist you on everything, brake down, fuel, time off, except the money, they are cheap"
good,Good place to work with many opportunities for advancement. Sometimes can be overwhelming with the rapid change.  The leadership is very aggressive about growing the the company and grabbing market share.
good,Solid company with high diversity and ability to grow.  Great opportunity to learn chain mgmt andlogistics. As a national carrier multiple opportunities to transfer nationwide.
good,At JBHUNT I got the job done! I was always on time to do the job right.Being I Driver at JBHUNT it was a wonderful job to start a career and you learn a great deal about safety while operating a motor vehicle on the road.
good,"I mean look it's a trucking company,  but overall not too many complaints from me. I have been there for 2 years and am pretty happy. I'm driving local for them now and that's where it's at! What I like best about them is the fact that they are big enough that if you dont like what your doing they can and will move you to something  else. For the most part the managers are very laid back and helpful.  The pay could be better but it's not bad"
good,"Great play (by the mile) and great home time. Verry relaxed. Open door with management.  Drop and hook.                                 "
good,"Great place to work if you want to drive truck. The administrative positions come and go like every quarter"
good,"Overall, my experience was good. I enjoyed working with JB Hunt. However, I relocated and changed jobs. I gained additional experience and knowledge ."
good,"I joined J.B. Hunt as a result of a business acquisition earlier this year.  Overall, the company has quality leadership on the corporate level and provides its employees with excellent benefits and growth opportunities. Downside: excessive meetings along with certain policies and procedures slow productivity."
good,"I was recruited by J.B. Hunt and loved working there. We were given a new manager who was not prepared for the work, but we as a team managed to get the product to our customers as it smoothed out. I moved from this job and would have loved to have been able to stay"
good,Overall I've had a good experience working for JB Hunt.  I started there right after college of mid nights.  In a year I was moved to days and six months later I ran an account.  After a year and a half I was promoted a regional position.
good,The time of day to work was the hardest part of the job. To adjust to early mourning deliveries was hard. I enjoyed the connection with management and customers.
good,"Friendly staff, customer was competitive and a bit hard noised but overall good place to work.Routed and scheduled  loads daily moving trailers from location to location loading beef to fill up the trailer.. Management was committed to servicing the customer the best that it could and dedicated to the well being of the drivers."
good,"Good company to work for, fast pace at times very safety conscious, Hardest part about this job was having to wait on containers coming off the train.  also waiting for shoppers and recievers to load or unload your trailer.  Could take from 30 minutes to several hours"
good,"J.B. Hunt is focused on its mission, but they do care about their employees more than any company I have worked for. They're main objective with employees is to find people that have no problem BTGT, Being The Go To. Learn as much as you can about your job, and do whatever you can to be the person everyone else relies on. A simple concept, but there are lots of competent, hungry people following the same path."
good,"Vast amount of opportunities to zone in on your skill within the transportation industries.  Promotes from within and invests in it's employees to better themselves.  They offer many classes for leadership, excel, management, etc and have many opportunities to sit down with VP's and Executives with Lunch n Learns.   Values their employees and overall is a great company to work for."
good,I prefer all my skills and experience in the freight business be weighed heavily. My formal education is diverse and as a Marine I can take and follow policy.
good,"I had no qualms with much of anything at JB Hunt.  I had opportunity to advance but, that at least at the time involved relocating which I was not able to do at the time.  Nice facilities which have been added on to at least twice since I was there."
good,"I would definitely recommend J.B. Hunt . I had some personal problems. And had to take a lot of time off. They really worked with me. I regret I had to leave. Good job, great company, great people, management to.  Long day's but that's Trucking."
good,"Good place to work, I have enjoyed my time with the company.  Just needed something local for personal reasons. Only down fall is that  I didn’t receive any benefits."
good,"The environment is definitely fast-paced, and I do think there are different ways we can be training newcomers so we don't have to clean up after their mistakes. Messing up in this position can cause big customer escalations that involve management. "
good,"good environment to work , good dispatch gain experience from driving and customer service and dealing with company system (PeopleNet) and fair pay but not satisfied"
good,In the midst of a transition to a more technology based platform and growth culture. Great opportunity to build your skills in a variety of engineering departments.
good,"day at j,b hunt is typical fun co-workers make the shift go by fast but also friendly and very helper every one helps everyone is somebody doesn't know how to do something or just need help in general"
good,"Entering a  truck driving career, I couldn't have selected a better company than JB Hunt. They were fair and upfront on all requirements. They kept me busy, and provided all the tools to be safe and productive."
good,"Worked for this company as CDL A driver for seven years."
good,"Schedules are fair, pay is adequate, work/life balance is okay, benefits are about the same as anywhere else, steady and dependable company to work for."
good,Worked here 14 yrs ago and it was a pretty good company.  Good benefits and always took care of me.  Not sure how it may be now.  Havent worked there since.
good,I was overall satisfied with this company. They have a strong company mission for safety. They have opportunities for advancement. Compensation has been good.
good,The compensation and benefits are the only thing that are lacking at this company. The pay is a little less than average and the health insurance is minimal (and expensive). However the work environment is awesome. The management genuinely cares about the employees.
good,Very busy and stressful but there is fair pay and job security. Good place to start a logistics career. There are opportunities to advance that may require relocating.
good,"a typical day would be about 8 to 10 hours a day, i learned to be more aware of the people that i am around listen to management the hardest part about the job was the wait time the most enjoyable part was driving."
good,"Standard large trucking company. Heavily focused on safety. Teambuilding exercises optional. Multitasking is a must with this company, as with most of the industry."
good,A typical day at work started 7am and drove to deliver loads from one point to another point.  Learned about driving in inclement weather and stopping distances and safe driving.
good,My boss is easy to communicate with and engaging. Parking is terrible and the trucks that we drive can be more adequate and in better condition. Trucks can be better maintained.
good,"good place to work, management is good and theyre willing to work with you if you need time off for family, very good hours and always out out at a reasonable time"
good,"Fast paced, dealing with drivers and customers. Negotiating rates and prices. Analyzing the current market to make the best logistical decisions in regards to moving freight."
good,"didn't always get to leave early in morning not all loads where ready yet, makes it hard to be scheduled when loads are not ready....once you show you will be ready and able to work they treat you better"
good,"It has been along time since i worked there, dont really remember much, only left due to no advancements in the company and they were making cut backs as well."
good,"Delivered to JIB restaurants in Texas,make pickups returning to JIB warehouse in Dallas,filling out required DOT andJBHunt paperwork and relaying information from the restaurants to the warehouse"
good,"Good company, good hours, good pay. Reliable and cares about their associates and company. Enjoy working for this company due to all these circumstances."
good,Much responsibility is expected of drivers in safety performance. Management works with drivers to ensure loads are picked up and delivered safely. Feedback from drivers is usually attempted by management to be implemented. Excellent open door policy. Drivers are highly respected and appreciated. Highly safety oriented.
good,Starting as a regional I found didnt work for me but management was very open door to see a better fit and moved me to more dedicated local driving. Alot less stressful except the going to Chicago everyday was just to much. I was intermodal going to railyard. I got burned out with the Chicago run. Overall though it was great people to work with and the home time and paid time off was great.
good,Top notch transportation company where you can learn the importance of safe driving and timely delivery of goods to customers.  Project management and recruiting are fun.
good,Good place to grow your career.  Good overall company that care about its employees and the safety of others.  Hard work 10 hour days but good benefits.
good,"I really boosted my confidence with the environment what  I got at my workplace, I am very thankful as its the best place which I learned at lot regarding the Management of work balance"
good,Easy going job  with great schedules. They try their best to give u good paying loads and get u home to your family at a decent hour. It's a good job.
good,Went in one day to quit and they said i was terminated due to violating company policy. Shows that on my dac report. Was not able to collect unemployment for that reason.
good,Great company and has given me opportunities to succeed at every aspect of my career. They are the reason for my financial stability that I currently stand in. I appreciate everything that the company has given me and allowed me to do.
good,"Nice place to work. Friendly co-workers, great pay for starting out. Wish this would have been a temp to hire position instead of a temp position. Easy work."
good,"My co-workers were the best group of people. I really enjoyed working with them."
good,"Great place to work if you like being on the road five days a week, minimum !"
good,Days were fast pace and very demanding time frames.  Each day was a new challenge and new goals to obtain to ensure costumer satisfaction. always need to to think fast on your feet
good,"12  hr days "
good,"My direct supervisor was amazing, as many of them are in the BVS department. They understand we are all have lives outside of work and do their best to accommodate as long as you give 100% while you are there."
good,This is a company that does pay well. They keep you moving so your checks are very good. Give them a try. Management are very easy to work with.
good,Man I really wish this would recognize same company. 8 years worth is getting old trying to rate everything. this cannot even begin to cover what an interview can.
good,I've been loyal to the company for 12.5 years.  Worked for a great Director!  He will be missed!!!  I'm ready for something new!
good,Monday thru Friday with the rare Saturday.  Early in the morning to late afternoon or evening delivering and installing appliances some days are hard and others are easy.
good,"I work anything between 100 emails a day to problem solving several 3pl accounts."
good,I was a solo driver so I really didn't meet any other employees. I enjoyed the open road. I learned patience If you ran hard then you could make a decent pay.
good,I enjoy working for the company and there is a lot of growth potential is you apply yourself. I've moved to a couple of different cities and every time the process has been smooth and there's a lot of support from upper management and corporate.
good,"•	Responsible for pricing the highest volume region of the country for intermodal"
good,"Pay isn't great, not much home time.  Other than that, good company.  Big company and a lot of different accounts to try. Cool place to work."
good,Great company to work for. Good Benefits and Bonuses. Good Training courses. Great place to move up in. Great managers and Employees to work with.
good,"Great Company with good pay and benefits. The people in the office are good, management will go the extra mile to train and help you. The downside is that it is tough to get promoted."
good,JBH is where I learned everything that I learned regarding transportation as a whole as well as account management.  Management working closely with sales and operations as well as coaching sales and operations is a driving force in that corporation.  I worked a lot of hours there but never minded doing it.  I never minded being the one to go above and beyond the call of duty to get the job done.  They recognized hard work and dedication.
good,"Typical is the same as City of Cedar Rapids."
good,"Processing damaged truck claims, how and why JB Hunt will not pay for the shipment. The co-workers were nice and helpful."
good,"Company overall is not to bad to work for,  good system for paying you on time, benefits offered.  Pay not to bad. They keep you busy most of the time."
good,"Responsibilities include driving a 18-wheeler transport goods throughout the United States delivering merchandise to warehouse and companies. Was responsible for keeping up to date records of cargo, weight, and keeping good driving logs.  Working in a fast pace environment and meeting deadlines in a timely manner."
good,"A typical day at J.B. Hunt for me was preparing drivers/ installers product load and route paper work. After that task was done, i would make my way to the docks where i would scan incoming and out going products and label them accordingly. What i learned from this job was how a warehouse operates from dock work, shipping and receiving, bill of ladings, labeling, and route paper work. I was also assistant to the dock manger. The co-workers i had were amazing. We were a great team that were all in sync to accomplish tasks that were asked of us. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 2am Monday through Friday and the most enjoyable part of the job was pay day."
good,"Payroll invoicing and Fuel PO'S, Very consistent work every week was the same, if you missed a day you would have to catch  up or bring home. co workers were great people to work for and management as well.."
good,Grat place to work but the cons are that they suck at training their co workers. It's a family based company. I just wish they can train their co workers better.
good,"A very hard job, with lots of hours. not the best dispatch but its not the worst i have seen. i enjoyed working here, but wanted something closer to home."
good,"Pretty much your basic trucking company, no real surprises. I have enjoyed my time here for the most part. Really good managers."
good,First company after training.  Over the road and long distance driving was required.  Not enough miles issued and therefore my salary was low.
good,My job was varied and fun they recognized my ability to learn and work ethic and compensated very well the mid level managers I had were some of the best I ever met.
good,Great school to learn of the transportation business in all areas. Opportunities are out there...
good,Culture is strong work ethic. Expectation is at work on time every day. Some time for fun and some days are stressful.
good,Always kept buzy. Lift heavy equipment. Go to costumers house to drop furniture/equipment out
good,Company maintained good work relations with workers.  Work was enjoyable.
good,good bunch of guys to work with always some where different every day
good,This is a great company to work for and promotes from within. It has a good corporate culture and outstanding benefits.
good,"safety conscience,do trailer repairs,self, independent"
good,"Driving the vehicle is the main responsibility of the commercial truck driver, but some also need to load and unload cargo. Long-haul truck drivers must maintain a logbook of their driving activities to ensure compliance with federal regulations governing the rest and work periods for operators. Drivers also keep a record of vehicle inspections and make sure the truck is equipped with safety equipment, such as hazardous material placards. Some long-haul truck drivers plan their route according to a delivery schedule. Local-delivery drivers may be required to sell products or services to stores and businesses on their route, obtain signatures from recipients"
good,Loved working for  JB HUNT .  I have been working for JB Hunt for 5 yrs and very dedicated driver for the company unfortunately I had to moved to Las Vegas to be with family. They don't have any local driving position in Las Vegas .
good,"Worked at the San Ramon branch, northern California."
good,There are a lot of wonderful people working at JB and they work hard to make the company great.  Benefits are good but compensation can trend toward the lower end.  Many positions required extended working hours and responsibility that follows you home but I believe this to be somewhat indicative of the transportation industry as a whole.
good,"To arrive at the terminal and exchange experiences about certain locations and to help other drivers arrive there safely without any problems. get your preplanned assignments for the day, plan your route and check out your truck and trailer. Get to your location in a timely manner. You help out unloading your freight if needed, and keep and good relationship with the managers and receiving personnel to make it a smooth transition at every location. The hardest part of the job is to deal with the traffic certain parts of the day that with strain your driving time but you get through it. The best part of the day is knowing you did your best and every store received all that they ordered and returned back to the terminal without any problems."
good,"JB Hunt's ICS division located in Atlanta, Georgia was a very demanding but fulfilling job.  My job duties included code calling, tracking and tracing, dispatching drivers, building relationships with customers and carriers, and helping both the carrier management and sales teams thrive through team work and synergy."
good,"Felt part of the team "
good,"Good Company. Learned to recruiter a difficult group of people, owner operators"
good,"•	Establishes recruiting requirements by studying organization plans and objectives; meeting with managers to discuss needs."
good,My day would start with logging in to my phone taking calls to help customers track their packages. I learned how to use a multi-line phone system. I also learned phone etiquette and how to resolve a highly escalated customers problems without becoming angry myself. Management was often changing but overall they did care to have weekly meetings and listen to what the operators concerns were. They did what they could to make our situation better but weren't able to change the system effectively. My co-workers were spectacular we kept one another uplifted and in good moods. We had open communication with everyone in order to better help our customers. The hardest part of the job was to talk to angry people and sometimes not being able to help them. The part I liked the most about the job was being able to completely change someone else's mood by giving them a resolution.
good,A decent place to work lots of available hours and nice people
good,"Company has a strong safety culture. As a driver I was trained in Smith System defensive driving. Then asked to be an instructor, teaching 2 classes a day in the Safety Dept. The hardest part of the job after getting out of the truck is also the most enjoyable. Interacting with new recruits and other drivers. Instructing the Smith classes was not in my comfort zone, making me put myself out there, exposed as it were. I was never really one to be comfortable standing in front a class, or group of people, but it was a great learning experience."
good,"Fast paced and promotions from within, Great culture of growth and advancement"
good,its one of them places that you can work and fill comfortable of coming to work with no pressure 
good,great place to work nice .Hardest part of job is driving long hours.
good,I picked up loads from one part of the country and delivered anywhere from 20 to abt 2000 miles away. I got to see all parts of the country.It was really like any other trucking company.
good,"Intermodal Driver since 2005 demanding yet, enjoyable work"
good,"visited interesting places while driving, it was fun and I love it. They call us 'King of the Road'"
good,Company itself is one of the worlds largest trucking companies. When I first moved to Arkansas I had the opportunity to work for Wal-Mart & Tyson's but elected JB Hunt because the environment. My immdiate supervisor was compasionate and very understanding. I was promoted in 1 year to the Credit & Collection Trainer and enjoyed every student I worked with.
good,I can say that I have learned a lot from J.B.hunt. I have grown as a person and i am more confident as a worker when speaking with people because of my time here.
good,"With a positive mindset, genuine motivation and continual drive, one can be successful in this quick pace environment.  Leadership is actively engaged and allows all to elevate ideas to better the business.  Great culture, great company, great people."
good,If I lived where the actual job was based out of then I'd be much more prone to stay. Pretty good job. Minor problems every now and then as to be expected from any job.
good,"A safety first environment with a 10 hour average day weekends off. It seldom felt like ten hours, I was kept busy enough and felt I was accomplishing something worthwhile each day. I learned more about the transportation industry in 7 years than any were I have worked before. Most of the managers I worked with and under were competent and motivated. as with most large companies there were exceptions but with the opportunity to transfer to other locations you can find a place were you will be fit with people that you can work with"
good,"I worked with Cory Home Delivery for over 12 years reporting to executive leadership. I was able to make an impact by having this direct line of communication however with more layers of leadership, things tend to move a little slower."
good,"My team at j.b hunt made my job way more fun. The job sucked but the team was great. I love carrier support!!"
good,Great company to work for with so many opportunities for advancement. Management and executive team are phenomenal. Salary structure is below the industry standard for management.
good,JB Hunt is a large company that gives employees the opportunities to develop themselves and gives them the tools that they need to succeed.

good,Nice place to work. using latest and greatest technologies. very supportive leadership. Great work culture. Explore to new technologies. love to work hear.

good,fast paced with a youthful vibe. high expectations and you are given the room and freedoms to grow. plenty of opportunity to advance and it could result in a long term career.
good,Job was fun got to deliver to different places and meet different people picking up at the rail yard was cool experience. Just wish the pay wasn’t so complicated and people and management where great equipment was great and well maintained
good,Work was manageable and management was very good. Loads were good and the miles were paid accurately. A driver days would have depended on a live load or a drop and hook.
good,Employees and management are easy to get along with. There is always steady work. The benifits are alright. The pay is competitive. They do provide training
good,"Very good training, a little overboard on safety but to be expected, overall good. many chances for advancement, friendly environment, they do their best to take care of one another"

good,"Transportation is fun and challenging.  Every department is intertwined in goals and objectives.  This makes for a cohesive environment that promotes a great ""we're all on the same team"" feeling."
good,"Everyone has the right to form their own opinion, and I do not have the best knowledge of anything out of my department.  I am more than happy to say how I feel, though.  "
good,"I worked for JB Hunt's Intermodoal Division out of Haslet, TX. The miles were steady and rarely did I have to spend more than an hour or two waiting on loads. Their vehicles are well kept and run well. The intermodal boxes are mostly fine, but they always use recapped tires on them so they are prone to blowouts. "
good,"Work days started early as midnight, with no real load security.  Many days, I would sit and wait for dispatch, only to have the load pulled and given to a more aggressive driver.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being relieved of duty after a stressful day."

good,worked as a local driver hauling hardy board was a good job and home every day and off weekends  great benifets   only bad thing is there is strick rules for workers that get hurt and cant come back to work  to many hoops to jump thru and they put you on back burner
good,Good hrs to work you get to go home anytime you want and its okay to be on the road with them they are very laid back no talking on the phone while driving
good,Nice place to work and room for you to grow and move up in the company. Great experience but is very demanding need to have flexible schedule and be willing to move around the company.

good,For the most part I have nothing bad to say about jbhunt it's kept me afloat I get miles I get benefits my only complaint I don't like the international truck the inside is the sign small to be for over-the-road drivers
good,In most areas J.B. Hunt is a great company to grow your career within and develop your professional skills. Just pay attention to words of caution given to you regarding specific departments.
good,Family oriented is what made this company.  If you are willing to advance you can easily if you're willing to show you have what it takes.
good,Great place to work. Management on my account was the best.  Equipment isn't well maintained. Plenty of opportunities for home time. Pay was excellent.

good,"When I first took over my 'Store' I reorganized the DWCC (Del Will call coordinator) and his directives as far as deliveries were routed. I increased the amount of deliveries and decreased the miles the store was charged. I increased my position by gaining two stores for delivery and because of my performance times, I started training drivers  in clearing (Evaluating) their times for release. I then assumed the role of Asst Safety Coordinator by attending training seminars in Dallas at the Regional Operations Terminal and assisted in the Coordinator in the Safety Training Program as designated by the Main Office "
good,Great company very understand of your situation willing to work with you never out of work they will find somewhere to get work very easy and a safe company to work for

good,"You could not ask for a better Manager. The entire office is awesome! Real family atmosphere, any concerns with routes or a truck, it's handled ASAP. Only problem i had was the directions and obard system is outdated and was trash!!"
good,"The engineering and IT dept is top notch. The jobs are less stressful the other places, and the people are willing to do what it takes to help you advance."

good,I worked and drove in the 11 western states and was out 2 weeks at a time. All I did was pick up material and drop it off so I left to become an local driver. I wanted to be home more.
good,Very clean and safe atmosphere to work in on a daily basis. A great staff of professional personal  to work with.
good,"I really enjoy working at this location. I've been able to link with other hard working, goal oriented individuals like myself who have trained me well. Management at JB Hunt is awesome. They make sure you know what you need to know and continue teaching daily to lead employees like myself into stable positions within the company."
good,"I learned about driving safety, through a class called the Smith System. This class helped me keep safe, even when other drivers were not paying attention."
good,"I started out on one D.C.S. account as a local day cab driver. then when things slowed down I was told I would be the first out the door because I was the first hired. so I reluctantly took a transfer to J.C. Penney out of wauwatosa, wi. and later moved to wisconsin. to hopefully get some higher mileage runs. which hasn't happened. I am also in a sleeper now and home only on weekends and sit around alot without getting any loads."
good,JB Hunt is a great place to work they treat the drivers like family i had great miles every week the pay was on time and if there were any problems it was work on right away.
good,"The Odessa Family Dollar management has a great leadership roll. Very hard workers and always willing to help their employees. Due to medical issues, unable to continue to deliver for Family Dollar. Management very helpful on keeping me in the company and having an income."
good,was a great place to work made a lot of friends and learned a lot about the trucking industry. the only issue I had was with my last manager. but before that I was promoted to five different positions within the company.
good,good company to work for but if you drive local you never know when your load will be ready. if you are a new employee you start at the bottom.you the last load that the warehouse loads so you work all hours of the night. the pay is good for being local avg 1000 a week. if your looking for a job that you can advance in management then this isn't for you jb hunt hires managers right out of college that never drove a truck before.
good,JB Hunt was a nice place to work especially being over the road seeing different places and meeting different people I really enjoyed the entire experience.
good,"low pay, long hours, I change tractor every day but is a nice company to work for."
good,I really never had a problem with management if there was problem they did there best to fix it. They took care of me in made sure that i had my miles and was comfortable with my load i ran. I learned if u love what u do make the best of it. The most enjoyable part of working here i able to ran in make money and still make it home to  still spend time with the family.
good, Daily payroll and clerical duties that involved 70+ employees.
good,"Long hours, I enjoyed working at Jb hunt, however, I'm currently looking for a new opportunity, and a better place to work. My life is changing, and family is changing  which my employer no longer meets my needs."
good,"its ran very racial. very uncomfortable. ran like a bootcamp. people love trying to tell the next person how something goes, even though thats not there job description."
good,Started my day at 0:500. I would get a load of feed and deliver to a hog farm. Go back to mill and get reloaded as quickly as possible. Sometimes would sit for hours waiting for a load.
good,In times past was a great place to work. The original owner retired and the new manager did not apply an acceptable work ethic.
good,"The will not show you how much each load pays but want you to run it as a leases operator.after all week,You make all payments and go home with less than a company driver."
good,"Very poor dispatch communication ...high turn over of drivers, too much driver back-up statuses I came to work not sit on my butt, I don't care if I get paid for it I need hours."
good,standard day for otr drivers. ecellent for letting you experience the us with time needed.
good,It was a great company  but the dispatch   doesn't  have any respect  for the driver  that is  mean reason  stop working  for them as drivers  class A
good,"i would come into work at 2:00am, our shuttle would be at j.b. hunt around 2:30am. apond arrival we would abstract appliances off of our shuttles. after that, we would put our appliances inside the warehouse or to its designated shuttle, for delivery."
good,Not a bad company just not a great account for the amount of work to be done . And the mandatory 6th workday every 3rd week worked . Being denied off time even if you have the pto for the time vfc requested
good,"You'll start with the basics, which can be slow and boring.At first, the work-life balance is non-existent."
good,Lack of communication with staff could cause major disruption in the work flow. Accurate measurement were paramount.
good,Nice trucks good comp to work for benfits was not all that good work hoildays
good,break rooms are set up for the drivers to be able to finish there paper with no prolbems
good,Great job could be better there over head is always hard so it makes ur job harder cause you have to work faster to get the job done but its not that bad
good,"It's alright for the most part, you just have a certain group of people who feel favoritism should lean towards them. Its understood because of the amount of time working there, but If I'm an employee treat me as you would treat the rest."
good,"Great company to work for and continually grow and develop. "
good,There a great company I would recommend J.B. Hunt to anyone. Great pay tough hours but at the end of the week it’s very much worth it. Also you would have to be in pretty good shape.
good,Wake up at 3:30am clock in at 4:30 am then start to unload and load trucks and  trailers. Consolidate material and scan products. Material handling was one of the most important things I was doing.
good,Great company to work for good Benefits great local accounts get you home on a daily basis. The account managers are great for some parts some of them don’t care about the drivers
good,working with J.B is great depending on the account requirements you could work very hard or not as hard. just keep your head up because it can get demanding.
good,"we were able to create new advertising promotions, within ""house"".  This was great, because, before I joined the department, the company had utilized an ad agency, which was called upon for any ""different"" ad material.  Once we were allowed to absorb this function, it was much better for the company, because we had a ""handle"" or idea on what was being needed for the project (as we were familiar about the needs of the company).  Truly, one of the best, fun, and most creative jobs EVER!  I was asked to come back, a few years after I left, but, chose not to, at the time."
good,JB Hunt is the best Intermodal company in Chicago. The pay was great do to mileage and activity based pay. The equipment at JB Hunt was great. The planners and fleet managers were always available to talk to.
good,"This company is top notch. Amazing management and wonderful people and community, they really are the benchmark for the transportation industry. Willing to help you succeed."
good,"a typical day is at work would be to come in and log on the computer and get ready to guide, assist, and reschedule truck load appointments or pick up and drop off days when needed."
good,On this job you have to deal with the weather that makes it difficult to drive . But the good thing is that you see new place that you wouldn't see at any other job.
good,I have work for jb hunt 2 months and I love it I like the labor work and good pay when hired on the company full time. they treat you fair because they know it hard labor.
good,The people are great and the environment is clean with easy access to tools and equipment.  The hardest part is the point system and the regulation of off time.
good,I liked the company and will work for them anytime that they asked me to again. The people are nice and friendly and will help you learn to do your job correctly.
good,I wasn't there long we lost the contract. the team i was working with really seemed nice. the company in general was very professional.
good,Finds the right path for you to expand your abilities. Gives great sense of belonging and gives you responsibilties that you can call your own. Puts great emphasis on family importance. Gives you the right tools for the job. Will suggest this company to anyone looking to find an awesome carrer path. I really like the department food celebration of birthdays.  Great retirement plan with merrill lynch. I really like that you get paid time off with every check even on the first check.
good,Seeing most of the country at different times of the year and meeting different people. Just about sleeping in a new state every night.
good,"I have nothing but good to say about JB Hunt. They gave me work when my business was struggling and they have always done their best to help me in any way they can."
good,Great position to gain real-world experience and tremendous responsibility directly out of college.
good,The day starts out by knowing what needs to be done. Once we know what to do we get started staging our first shipment. My co-workers and I have great chemistry wihich makes the job easy and the days move along quickly.
good,A typical day at JB Hunt was morning meetings.  Setting up phone interviews with possible candidates for hire.  Conducting back ground checks and making sure that the driver is the right fit for the company.
good,"Like any other big trucking company, they service as many customers.  They have different divisions, which one can transfer to using a bidding process based on seniority, if they so desire, after a certain period of time with the company. Along with amenities, such as showers, a driver lounge and employee parking."
good,"My job at JB Hunt Transportation consisted of payroll, data entry, answering phones."
good,Administrative working with Drivers and there training. Tracking and issuing Com Data cards. Load Planner working with Carriers and Customers. Solving issues in time sensitive loads.
good,During the year I was with company I was treated well and paid decent. I would have stayed if not for personal problems. I personally believe this company to be the best trucking company around.
good,Worked in J.B. Hunt's Dedicated Contract Services division. Helped start-up two accounts with brand new customers and worked on-site at their location. Helped the customer analyze their production workflow and gave ideas as to how make their workflow more efficient and cost-effective. Organized all of their outbound shipments and helped manage the deliveries to their customers. Managed up to 10 employees and worked with customers' employees as well.
good,"good company plenty of miles, had paper logs back in the day, good benefits"
good,i would load trucks and load trucks and deliver appliances and install them also due to the customers request
good,"Was a good company to work for, if you work for the right people. I hold no grudges against them but the time i was collecting unemployment. They had to go to the courts 4 times to get a judgment in their favor. I would go back and work for them, but make sure you talk seriously about your salary."
good,typical day starts out pretty busy. hardest part of job is dealing with people that dont know how to do theirs efficiently and productively. i get all work done within about 4 hours.
good,"As a trainee you will be responsible for managing your own operation.  Once proven, you will be promoted to Operations Supervisor.  Pay could be better, but is competitive."
good,A lot of different accounts to work for so you have a lot of choices for refrigerate trailers dry van flatbed and some other specialized kind of trucking is just too time-consuming keep you away from home they have decent benefits and some of the people that you work with are pretty pretty good
good,"Very competitive place to work, and hard to advance, but still overall enjoyable despite ""cubicle life."""
good,"Logistics and distribution managers organize the storage and distribution of goods. In this role, you will ensure that the right products are delivered to the right location on time and at a good cost. You may also be involved in transportation, stock control, warehousing and monitoring the flow of goods."
good,"The systems they have in place are great. The managers don't really grasp them. They don't understand life circumstances. I had 2 deaths in my family and my father had heart surgery within 2 months, and go figure, after being recruiter of the month, my numbers dropped from not being there. I really wish I still worked there. Sometimes life takes you in a different direction."
good,"Very energetic place to work. Must be able to maintain calm in a high stressed environment. Everything is Day-to-day operations. "
good,"Good pay rate"
good,"Local work with low miles, can't make the money they promisse..."
good,Dandy overall
good,"A typical day is prospecting for customers and doing the follow up necessary. My co-workers are helpful and fun to work with. I have learned that in the transportation industry, just because a customer wants to do business with you, it is not always possible to service them. This makes it very challenging to sell. The work life balance is hard because the branch will be moving out of my reach of a realistic daily commute."
good,You get paid on your performance. If you put in work you'll make a good living. 401k is great here. It's physical work but you are paid fairly. Current manager is no good.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. There was certainly room for advancement depending on the position you were in and if you were willing to relocate.
good,"Great learning experience, and stepping stone on your career path. They stress the basics that are very important to learn, but you have to know when to move on and advance your own career."
good,"Typical day of working with JB Hunt."
good,"Loved my job as an administrater/dispatcher people and customers were great!!! actually miss working there too bad someone else came in the location I was working and downsized, because I would still be there."

good,I learn in jb hunt how to work as a team it was amazing job take appliances up to the 4 floor by yourself up the stairs I loved the job the reason for leaving was the job wasn't worth the pay
good,JB Hunt is a great place to work as they are moving forward to reach some significant financial goals. Talent & Development and training has been low on their radar for some time but they are improving this as quickly as the culture will allow.
good,"I like this company and I love my job overall. However, there is little room for advancement in my department and there is no job security. They base everything on a scorecard that is out of your control and I don't think it is a good reference to your job performance or work ethic."
good,"Safety department staff are required to be able to travel for the company and the hours may very depending on circumstances."
good,good place to work for other then the management job was ok if you don't mine working fast and having your boss down your back 24/7 the company has good tools t work with
good,"Good company to work for, constantly growing and is great job security. This company is primarily customer service and it helps you not only in work place but outside."
good,"Very fast paced environment, must be able to multi task. Answer the phone , book loads and keep up with my daily emails. Iam ready for a change transportation is an acquired taste. I enjoyed being a legal secretary , I felt that the work I did made a difference. I want to be a part of a company that I feel is better by me working there. I WANT to make a difference.  Transportation has its moments can be very stressful, never a slow time. I enjoyed the people I worked with they made the stress not so bad."
good,"Loved working for Herb, the company changed management and they offered less bebifits and outsourced jobs to part time workers. Felt like the management wasn't interested in long term employers anymore."
good,Over all it's A great place to work had a lot of fun metting new people  and learning new things and the travel to southern california was great.
good,Hard work on the road 8 to 16 hours a day lots of lifting by hand or hand truck. learned a lot about loading and unloading trucks.management was not good to me and others.my co-workers were great the problem there was they were hourley and i was paid by the item delivered the hardest thing was taking washers an dryers upstairs.the most enjoyable was going to different areas.
good,I enjoyed this company for its fast paced but very fun team. The challenging task of the job were small in the overwhelming team atmosphere.
good,I learned it takes every body as team to get the job done and we do it in timely fashion and I learned how to keep youp with my numbers and I learned how to use the scan gun And to hats about it in that field thinks and I hope to hear from you soon thank you very much
good,Company has plenty of advancement opportunities. The opportunities come by how much you are willing to put in. If you work hard and are willing to put in the time the opportunities come by more often.
good,"Very nice place to work, haven't had any bad situations since being hired on with the company,  i look to be here for the long haul. Operations are easily accessible,  no chain of command type deal.....just if theres a problem,  management is there for you."
good,"A good job with opportunities to work with a large group of different corporations, servicing their individual needs. I loved this job. I was very sorry to leave it."
good,"Dedicated work is best. Managers are always available and pay is good. "
good,It will all depend on the account in which you will work for. I worked on various accounts and for the most part I enjoyed working for the company!!!!
good,There is nothing bad to say about this company. The opportunities are there if you are patient. Management is honest and accessible all the way to the CEO. One of my greatest regrets is leaving for money.
good,I love workin for them it was a great experiment wit them live goin to work nd gettin paud every friday of course it was a pretty much laid back job nd i love workin for them
good,"worked 0600 to 1700 typically, hardest day at work is just working on Saturdays. most enjoyable you work alone and you meet a lot of good people. great place to work"
good,Please check reviews. They will definitely work you and definitely have the loads but stay in intermodal if at all possible don't go to DCS if you to have to
good,"This company was fair with me and provided an atmosphere of growth and training for all their employees"
good,Great place to work.  Corporate is fast paced and continuely changing. Management is quick to recognize talent and promotions happen often. Work week is 45 hours
good,"Often long hours managing all aspects of the account.  Dedicated accounts run as individual businesses with P&L, payroll, invoicing, maintenance, safety, logistics planning, dispatching all handled locally."
good,"safety is a big part of the company"
good,"Working at JB Hunt provides many opportunities."
good,Good opportunity to learn how different modes of transportation work. Working with a team and the ability to network is a must. You have to sell your customers as well as the other people you work with. Can be very rewarding if you are driven and passionate. The hardest part is getting started and building your book of business. Can be a lot of fun when you land big deals.
good,The Best of the Best; an excellent company to work for and advancement.
good,"If you have a felony within 6-10 years old JB-hunt will not discriminate against you for employment. However it's not guaranteed but if you have a good driving record don't let your pass charge keep you from applying. I worked with JB-Hunt for 8 total years, 3 as a temp and 5 full-time. They hired me with  a charge on my record.  I was open and honest since day 1, a very hard worker and it was a great partnership."
good,"Only reason I left was due to poor dispatching.   I even took a load on the day my wife went into the hospital, and still got the shaft.  Very next load was up for 25 hrs and then scheduled to take early load.  Ca;; me for details."
good,JB Hunt is a great company to work for. The support from the company to ensure success is tremendous. As a driver I get to visit many different places and experience many different cultures. My job allows me to interact with many different people.
good,"For the time I worked there it was a good job with a good work environment. Competitive pay and additional hours available if wanted."
good,"I enjoy what I do, always enjoy learning new tasks.  The only drawback is pay rate is not great for the amount of work that you are responsible for taking care of.  Required to work 45 hours a week.  You stay very busy which I like but they require a bachelor's degree so you would expect the pay to be better, that part id disappointing."
good,This was a great place to work. Management very Friendly and reasonable. Extra work if you choose without force dispatch.  And many options with local and dedicated positions.
good,It was a good company to work for. I would go back if offered the right amount of money. I never had any problems with my pay checks and the had 401K that you could take any where.
good,I loved my job there.  Management was on top of everything which made all of our lives better to work there.  The only problem I had with JB Hunt was the pay.
good,"no forced dispatch, you knew well in advance what you were doing the following day, good communication."
good,A typical day of work would consist of clocking in and going through emails and printing out new orders from the customer. I learned a lot about logistics and transportation in general. Management all around was good and some even better but there were a few bad apples that i would consider to have bad management skills. The culture is strong and prideful and there is a bunch of positive energy in the air. Hardest part of the job was adjusting to the fact-paced environment and not make any mistakes in the process. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work for a company amongst the greats in transportation and being surrounded by coworkers who i know personally from childhood friends to new friendships and being a part of something bigger than myself.
good,"A typical workday includes, taking and doing inbound calls to help customers schedule, locate orders, and help with their questions. This job also requires to speak with the warehouse at times."
good,"Work day is anywhere from 8-12 hours a day. "
good,"Working for JB Hunt gave me an opportunity to travel and experience the railroads, as well as helped me develop my skills as a professional. I was given all the tools needed to advance"
good,The management is hard to beat. The management team is encouraging and approachable. Management and coworkers go  of their way to provide assistance and further training for new employees.
good,"good company"
good,The management in the Cap Center was horrible. Other than the management the job was a fun job and there is a lot of room for advancement. The work environment was interesting and all around good.
good,"Love to drive, need good benefits and good trucks. All you need is 6 months a verified driving and a clean background. Paid orientation, managers that answer the phones, people know who you are not just a number or a phone number."
good,"Busy, stressful environment.  Management is great but the stress to perform is constant and pervades every minute of the day!!  Multi-tasking and good time management play key roles in success here.  Super nice people and facilities."
good,They went out of their way to try to take care of their drivers.  There wasn't always freight so i spent allot of time sitting in areas I didn't want to be but my driver manager did everything in her power to right any wrong.
good,"good work experience there, i was a name and not a number. fleet managers where very helpful and had and open door policy, good home time, nice trucks"
good,"Daily, transport of materials and products, must have great attitude, must be willing to work overtime. Give 100% of work ethic. Team player. Carry oneself as an valuable employee."
good,A typical day at JB Hunt was to pick up and sometimes help unload deliveries. Its hard to make it on time to every pick up or delivery because of traffic.
good,It is a great starting Job for anyone straight out of college that wants an opportunity to prove themselves. It has Job security as well. It is a stressful job but if you keep your head down and work it will open doors for your career.
good,"A typical day at work is getting in at 6am. Starting the day by checking on my drivers positions along their routes. Notifying the customer, Cargill, if any problems have or will arrive in the future. Holding drivers for 2nd runs or random pick-ups throughout the day. I completed: payroll, vacation time, Physicals, DOT requirement, KPI's for customer and JB Hunt, Forecast, safety reviews, driver monthly training, violations, and multiple other things like a small business. I see my boss twice a year. Much of the account is left in my hands to run at tip-top shape."
good,"Good Intern Opportunity Overall. Team is very good and the project is challenging. "
good,This position was extremely fun and exciting place to work.  Lots of knowledge learned in the eight years I worked there.
good,Overall maintenance of truck was done in a timely manner.  Problem with getting dispatches created 34 hours or more downtime for drivers.
good,"Check trailers for necessary work or federal inspections.Write up work orders,check working order of all welders,generators,and all other work equipment, check for quality of work and show other tech how to achieve the quality of work expected. I learned to use all resources at hand to make work and goals easier to achieve.If you work with co workers and teach them in away that is easy for them to understand they appreciate it and and are   happier at their work.The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with workers who had no interest in the job.I enjoyed learning and implementing new procedures i had never attempted before ."
good,A typical day as a tuck driver is to wake up every morning and prepare you paperwork to figure out where your next adventure will lead you lol. i had learned from truck driving was how to operate a commercial vehicle. Also how to drive safely and efficiently.
good,"good company,stable work place,however dcs closed with out notice.I would have liked to stay with company,however no interest in driving over the road,ie,14 days out ,2 days at home."
good,"A typical day involves soliciting customers for freight and carriers for coverage to maximize profits on all published and spot business.  Both were accomplish by phone and email through company provided and an extensive self generated database."
good,"Pick up intermodal trailer at railyard and deliver to customer warehouse and pick up backhaul to return to railyard . worked in IL,WI, IA ."
good,"The job that I am currently doing I am extremely happy with. However, we have some massive goals and they seem challenging to achieve. Knowing our team we will likely blow it out of the water."
good,Fun work environment and flexible with things going on in life. Good management. Great benefits and lots of opportunities for advancement. The work life balance is very good.
good,"Average day consists of deadhead to pickup loading and delivering to receiving account "
good,Great pay and benefits. Very structured and organized.  It is what you make it. Not a pit stop job. You can gain a lot of knowledge about logistics and they have a great software system.
good,The manager took their time with me and made sure that I understood my dispatching roll from beginning to the end of the day. It was always easy for me to ask any questions I may have. The drivers that work there were very nice if you needed any help or trying to locate something they would help you without hesitation.
good,Good people easy job not stressing dispatch very helpful service department excellent 👍 good routine  time off when you need it co-worker are very good people
good,Good company to work for. Honest upfront with every aspect of the job. Pay was good and competitive for a company driver and always had opportunities to advance to different routes. This company rewards hard work and dedication. If your looking for a just a pay check this company is not for you. You get what you put in and they recognise hard work.
good,"You get a new truck, No new manuals unfortunately, but very low miles on all assigned trucks, take it home if you live more than 30 miles from nearest hub. Management really values the drivers and work to get you the miles and schedule that works for you and your family. Might retire from here"
good,"I couldn’t get home enough. Every now and then I would get home during the week. I was killing my 14 everyday. The money is good. But, not 14 hours a day good."
good,"I have no plans on leaving this company, hope to retire from this company. The management is great  and is a laid back job. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Great place to work.  I do wish that the training was more structured, but overall a good experience.  My first account assignment was by far my favorite.  Awesome culture and again, a great place to work!"
good,"good place to work, management seemed to care. easiest trucking job I ever had. Pay was low living in the Seattle area. Equipment was well cared for if the drivers red tagged equipment."
good,As a utilization office specialist you are the backbone for billing. It is hard work at first and things change with the growing market but it really helps you when you want to move up into different departments.
good,"JB Hunt is a great place to work and offers great opportunities."
good,"Really enjoyed my time here. I've worked a total of 2 years for them, but had to leave due to medical condition. They aren't perfect, but they do a lot of things that make sense. Good equipment and good people!"
good,"You have different driving opportunities to choose from. Like local work, regional work, dedicated work and when I was there over the road. I also did auto motive lanes."
good,"JB Hunt is a great company to work for if you're just getting started into truck driving. Even if you plan to retire they're great to work for. I worked for the Chicago intermodal division, Typically you will recieve a dispatch the pick up a load at a rail yard or shipper/receiver. Then take it to a rail or reciever/shipper. you will always go from shipper/receiver to rail, or rail to shipper/receiver. Which makes it great from planning you're trips for the best milage. If you are on top of setting your ETA then you will more than likely be have a good week and will make it much less stressful to do your job. The only con I have about this company is sometimes the dispatchers arent on the same page as you are. and it can be hard to understand what they are talking about over the OBC system. Yes they do use electronic logs and PeopleNet systems. All in all a great company to work for."
good,B sevice and preventative maintenance removing and replacing parts  and detecting and noticing any safety conditions that were brought to the attention of our driver/customer was what i enjoyed.
good,"I have enjoyed working here.  I jumped from trucking company to trucking company for several years, but I finally settled in at JB Hunt, and it was just fine."
good,good job with good home time and decent pay. my schedule was very attainable and I was able to make decisions about weather and road conditions. I was treated fairly.
good,"Worked in a large company, which I enjoyed  very much. I worked on a team with 12 other people doing similar duties. We had a team leader who guided us when needed."
good,"fast paced, on top of current trucks and requirements, good team to work for. good software , hard workers, and good equipment from trucks to computers. great boss."
good,"good company to work with, always proactive and get all load done as needed, and always helping my co-work when they're behind on the load."
good,The hardest part of the job to me is that I'm away from my family too long. Other than that the open road is good but I've really been looking forward to doing local work.
good,"truck driver duties planning multiple stops and where to eat"
good,Great and Safe working environment. Enjoy working for such  great team.
good,"Get to work a half a hour early,  get dressed look at work load and punch in for daily safety meeting ."
good,"Most of the days working for jb hunt were good they have a wonderful safe team I learned so much from them, most (not all) of the employees treat others with respect, unfortunitly the DM and Manager on the contract I worked for does not repersent jb hunt in a professional manner. The jobs it self was not hard and the most enjoyable part of the job is being on a dedicated account and getting to go home to your family every day."
good,its a fun fast peace work place.i got paid 12.50 just starting out so the pay is pretty good.
good,pick up load deliver make back call am authorized in all rail yards have hazematt an fbi registration containers you have to pre trip very good make sure corners are clamped locked weight has to be legal may have to move rear axle to adjust weight its not good to be in violation good to be dot legal i have tx endorsements i am not a kid i am a carefull driver
good,"Great co-workers, simple driving routes, and no worrying about the equipment/trucks because if there is something wrong it will be fixed. The best thing is your home every night and off on the weekends."
good,I made a mistake not let them know what happened im very sorry let to have another chance to come back to work i love working at j.b hunt and was going to retirement from their thanks for let me work their mark jones
good,One thing I love about this company is that they care about you and your family. We all know that things happen in life we can't control. This company don't hold it against you and they give you the opportunity to make up days you miss. I've been driving trucks now for 12yrs now And to be honest with you there the best company I've been with. I'm here for the long haul
good,"Best job I ever had. The only reason I’m not still there, is my class A expiring. I love everything about JB Hunt. Their family oriented and treat every driver like family."
good,The pay scale is well above average . Working a 10 hrs / 4 days a week job gives you more time with your family. Cook outs every month. Employee of the month bonuses.
good,"I've been with JB Hunt over 17 years, by far my longest a job tenure. In that time I have worked on three dedicated contract service accounts. There are many such accounts within JB Hunt, and each is different, both in requirements and pay scale.my experience has been that the company provides good if not fancy equipment, well-maintained, and has a very strong safety culture. There is probably no better company to work for among the large truckload carriers."
good,Great company to work for they pay you well and tries to make drivers appreciated bad part is I didn't talk to my FM since orientation which isn't bad unless u need something asap
good,Started a couple months ago with JB Hunt after leaving a previous company. Came here because they offered me a dedicated position that guaranteed weekly home time so I took it. So far so good! There will be long days sometimes (mostly waiting at a shipper to be loaded or unloaded) but that's trucking. I also have a good fleet manager so that's a plus.
good,"Really great company to work for. Can advance quickly if you put in the time and effort. I worked in the field and have had all the autonomy to allow me to make decisions for my business.  This is not a 9-5, but you are rewarded with an incentive bonus. Work hard and you can make a name for yourself."
good,Approach every day positively.  There is plenty of support and training. Like any company there will be challenges but a great place to learn and grow.
good,I have been there for almost 4 years and have nothing to complain about. The benefits are not the best but whose is. Management is there for us. I would recommend this company to anyone who is willing to show up to work and do their best.
good,"Plenty of hours when needed, a lot of physical labor with good drive distance between deliveries as well. Opportunity to see towns all around with the wide delivery area covered."
good,"As a driver you will be in a position to earn consistant income with industry leading support, but you must be a safe and smart driver.  Not the biggest paycheck or the easiest, but it is the best."
good,"clock in, perform my work duties, clock out. Hardest part of my job is keeping up with time on jobs. Great guys to work with and management is great to work for. They have to me how to mig weld."
good,"This is a good company. The people are nice, and the atmosphere is conducive for productive work. There is opportunity for advancement. I enjoy coming to work here."
good,"A great place to work doing delivery routes and installing , I do appreciate working there and being able to communicate with the customers that I had to do work for ."
good,"Fast paced , phone ringing constantly , drivers in and out of office  constantly , printing driver worksheets, updating driver schedules,  loads and coaching drivers as necessary"
good,My experience at JB Hunt was amazing. I hope to work at JB Hunt again. Never a dull moment when you work with amazing people. It feels more like a second home than a job.
good,"Great company to work for.  Family oriented, excellent management team.  Benefits are awesome as well.  Advancement is encouraged and fairly easy within the company."
good,Been here since December 28th of 2016 and JB Hunt is home im on the truckload side if i have a family emergency or anything specific like doctors appointment etc they get me home and always tell me set eta Estimated Time of Availability not arrival we dont have estimated time of arrival dispatcher/dispatch is great and caring if you come with an attitude how do you expect to be treated.... With an attitude if you come with i want to work for you and only you they are the best of the best JB Hunt Is really great to drivers unless you dont want to work now its understandable on emergency cases but this career is earned and earned for your earnings the best part i like about jb hunt is they listen and dont force you to go where you dont want to go i average 2500 miles weekly in otr gotta be a go getter not a lazybum this is like working a hometown job work work or not earn but its worth being a go getter if you're not a go getter you aren't going to make money any where in this career i get what i get because i am a go getter i dont complain about where im going cuz i have yet to see NYC OR Top end of northeast i love it work environment is the best of the 4 companies ive driven for want a great company JB HUNT IS FOR YOU! Don't come with an attitude like appearance...  And suggestion for everyone when freight is slow they do what they can to still keep you going here at jb hunt  now stay ontop of your game..
good,"Working in Transportation can sometimes be a overwhelming. JB Hunt tries to balance a frustrating industry by creating a fun working environment. For example, they provide food days for the company, games to play around the office and get celebrities to come to the office and speak to the entire corporate building . "
good,"I work at the mechanicville NY dedicated rail division. Flexible schedule, very easy money. Home every night. Work a minimum of a five day schedule with the option to work an extra day if u want to. Plenty of work. If u finish ur shift early, u can head on home or call night dispatch to receive more loads to do. Everything within a 250 mile radius of Albany ny. Wish I had made the change to this division within jb hunt sooner."
good,Enjoy my job at jb hunt and the work I do at the toys r us in lees summit mo the people I work with are the best we all wor as a team and that helps the yard run very smooth
good,"I perform federal safety inspections daily on vehicles so that they are safe to travel down the road and meet strict federal safety DOT regulations for 50,000 miles. These vehicles routinely have failures that require immediate repair or replacement to safely operate the vehicle or to maintain optimum life of powertrain, electrical, and mechanical components. These jobs are timed and graded based upon completion and accuracy. I am trained in diagnostic scanning equipment for Cummins, Navistar, Detroit Diesel, and CAT. I am a quick study and require little to no supervision. I lookforward to reviewing my quallifications in person if you believe that my skills will benefit us both mutually.  I am looking for a career with an establlished company who is exited to expand on my skills.Thank you for your time and consideration."
good,Well 1st and foremost the most enjoyable part of the job is payday!!! Nothing is hard on your job if you know and perfect what your doing. I usually don't have co-workers as a truck driver. I manage the truck and my schedule and my sleep so that my work day goes smoothly! I learn not to trust vehicles around me because I just don't know what they are going to do!
good,"My day is pretty busy, day goes by fast. I learned a lot about the trucking industry. Co-workers are great. I love what I do and like helping people have a better life."
good,"Ensure deliveries are on-time, billing/payroll, select following days' delivery routes to meet customer and company goals. Plan and dispatch pool of drivers on selected routes ensuring DOT regulations and delivery times are up to standard. Learned to work under pressure and the responsibility of managing a $4 million revenue account with 20+ drivers on the roads."
good,JB Hunt is one of the best in the industry.You hear a lot of negative things about the company that are not true.I worked for JB Hunt for 19 years but was terminated due to my own bad decisions.Every trucking company has their faults and issues.If you’re looking for a company that values you as a driver then I strongly recommend JB Hunt.
good,"Once you develop your method of getting the job quickly and efficiently, the pay and the reward is good. You can work safely, with new equipment and the little tips from the experienced workers helps you to work quickly without compromising safety."
good,I wish I could stay with this job but my wife’s health is a concern of mine and I have been on the road for a very long time most of 39 years with a great driving record and lots of experience
good,Only reason I left was I had to move parents in with me and my wife to care for them other than that I would  definitely still be there enjoyed the work and management works well with you on family emergency
good,I love working at J. B. Hunt. They are very understanding and completely open to any and every situation. The work is never stressful and you can almost guarantee close to perfect equipment.
good,"If they had any local contract in my area I would go back and work for them again. Good pay and benefits, plenty of overtime. Management was very good at their jobs."
good,J.B. Hunt was founded on family values and they’ve worked hard to keep it that way. The company culture is next to none. Although pay is much lower than other Fortune 500 companies they continue to work on correcting it.
good,I had a good dispatcher and ran a couple Regional deliveries. I lot of drop and hook loads at customers. They keep you moving and a lot of safety training on computer.
good,Wonderful Trucking Company no touch freight good mileage High pay enjoyed immensely working 3 months and earning a month off a work and returning two wonderful management and coworkers.
good,"Why? Because in reviewing this company I never left the 'driver's circle'. That's to say I depended on word-of-mouth or forums where drivers had left them. That held me back. In time my employment record was so full of past jobs it was grueling to hire on with a company but the Hunt recruiter made it easy, just the last 3 jobs and my social. "
good,Great job awesome place to work! Job advancement is nice. Lots of opportunity. Very resourceful people. Hours vary but not typically too long. However management could use some improvement
good,"Is one of the best companies to work for. Go out of their way to help and support you during time of crisis in your personal life. They have always worked with me when time off was needed, or change up work load and schedule to accommodate my health issues and make sure I could still make a pay check."
good,J.B. Hunt has Engineering groups responsible for covering virtually every facet of the technology landscape. They go out of their way to make their employees comfortable and satisfied in their work environment - as a result they have very little turnover (at least in the Engineering groups). The only negative aspect is that no (1) person typically has answers to technical questions outside their specific scope - as a result you may have to reach out to multiple groups to get the information you need. Best part of the job are the people - they are talented and pleasant to work with.
good,Enjoyed working at J B Hunt for 7 1/2 years. got along well with others. Learned so much there. Hardest part of the job not ready.Got along well with management. Workplace culture is very good.
good,"great place to work at the job setup is great and the people I work with are very good to get along. the job is fast paced and will definitely keep you busy,"
good,"J B Hunt is driver, family, and safety oriented.  while they are a freight and customer service company they believe in taking care of driver and family first.  To J B a happy driver and family is a productive driver thus the freight and customer service is taken care of.  They are constantly training their employees - office shop driver etc.  They believe in a well trained and safe work environment and staff.  Anything less than a safety minded employee is unexceptable and they WILL do everything they can to get the untrained unsafe employee improved - not just for J B's benefit but for the employee and everyone their employees come in contact with throughout the day.  As a driver the dispatchers are very knowledgeable in their jobs and are very effective with being multiple things at once - a boss, a friend on bad days, a therapist, a motivator - the list goes on and on.  even the night dispatchers know their jobs are the most competent that I have ever dealt with in the industry. when it comes to the shop/road service, the staff is very knowledgeable, and informative.  you don't have to guess what's happening - they tell you and you don't sit for days or weeks waiting on repair.  the shop, dispatch and the company wont allow it.  JB dislikes an idle driver when it comes to maintenance etc.  they want you rolling so you can make money for you and your family."
good,"typical day would include morning equipment inspection, and backing into a dock inside of the bldg."
good,"Good Work Environment."
good,"It was ok except there a couple of driver managers "
good,It was pretty fun working there.  I got to talk to  a whole lot of Drivers every week Amsterdam getting to know them before ether were hired for the company.
good,"0700 to 17:00 work hours Monday thru Friday."
good,"I loved working for the company, They don't call you as a number, but by name. If you run in to issues, they will do everything they can to help you resolve it. Their trucks are top notch and confortable. and the mechanics know their stuff."
good,"Fun work environment and supportive staff, For a big company some places act like you're a number but JB Hunt is a very decent trucking company to work for, unlike others JB Hunt cares seriously about safety."
good,I enjoyed working for this copy but the long hours were to much. I thank goodness for the experience that I have had with this company. I moved up in the company to better myself but the pay raises were not increases to my stardards.
good,As I moved forward as truck driver I learned many things about responsibility work ethic and customer service. J.B. Hunt was good to me and the atmosphere was calm and helpful.
good,"I miss the open road, had A lot of fun out there. If I can do it again I would. Not have a family at the present time makes this job ideal. My  driver license is under restrictions so it not A option at this time. Over the years I learn a lot and grow a lot. Yes it was the best job I every had. They have a great staff in New Jersey."
good,"Pleasant place to work and I loved all the people I worked with, was sad to see them close down"
good,running I 5 corridor. learned on board computer. liked I 5 corridor
good,good place to start you mechanic career they love new people from school.
good,"Great place to work for High Stress individuals. The demands are high, but the rewards are worth it. A day in the life was tough, with high expectations."
good,Jb was a very good company to work for. They were big enough to keep You rolling . Never had a problem getting a load and they were pretty good at getting Me long distance loads also.
good,Typical days were nice and pleasant!
good,"driver payroll, customer service, verification of employment, setting up/taking off direct deposits/wage assignments and garnishments"
good,wish i was still there....had fun and worked hard got treated great
good,"Excellent, affordable health care/dental/vision."
good,Great people to work with and the work was challenging.  Met a lot of good people through my interactions with customers and friendships I made.   Have really no complaints
good,They have a great team of members and good work ethics. I love the consistency of the work. But be sure to get plenty of rest because the work was physical.
good,Working as a Transportation Manager with J.B. Hunt has given me a wide variety of opportunities. One of the biggest one is working with a diverse group of people. I have learned allot from the drivers on my team and from my fellow office workers. It was a unique change from the jobs I held before and the military environment i spent most of my working career in.
good,Everyone is all ways willing to help it's family oriented bonus I'm home often nice trucks if need to take off jb Hunt is willing to accommodate your needs and your job is secured
good,Loved working at JB Hunt! Wish the pay was better in the intermodal division but overall it’s a great company to work for. Great management! Great drivers! Great facilities!
good,Great place to work very clean and safe environment to work in. They have tight routes for the drivers. Manager help you get the job done. They help you in any way possible
good,"I'm a dedicated company driver for j.b I got nothing bad to say about them they go over n beyond for their driver's I'm actually a human n not a number or driver. Family and safety is their main priority if I got kept out longer then planned they gave me a extra day to be home I do alot of off account work for them but the key is U GOTTA WANT THE MILES AND MONEY they will not push to do it so if u don't make good money honestly it's on you j.b has so much freight to move it's unbelievable FIRSY REAL HONEST REAL TRUCKING COMPANY THAT STANDS BY THE CONTRACT I SIGNED u show them u wanna make money man ur all good to go just don't lie and always be safe no matter what j.b hunt will fit ur career far as a professional truck driver.

good,It’s a great safety come first they care about Driver they always make sure you satisfied with the company management look out for you if you need time off to take care home they pay you on time

I had a friend who left the oilfields in North Dakota and went to work at B. He loved it. Sio I decieded to give it a try. I worked Intermodal regional going to rail yards to pick up containers and delivering them to customers. All drop and hook no touch freight. Worked there for a year.

Great company, excellent benefits and I really liked my terminal manager in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and my dispatcher. andtcustomers itbusinesses. . It is 99%"

good,"J.B. Hunt was hands down, the absolute best trucking company that I ever had the privilege to work for. Yes, they had stringent rules and company policies. All meant for your safety and the safety of other highway users. Yes, the hours were long; they are in any driving job unless you are hourly and not getting overtime hours.

good,They have an open door policy to talk to your managers if you have concerns...down to earth management...made you feel as you were appreciated as an employee...always safety first...
good,My position felt like I was my own boss. I only went to my management with questions on how to proceed or solutions I could offer my customer that were outside of the norm.
good,If and when my truck was down there was a quick turnover for it to get it fix and there was always a truck available to use. Managers always did what they could to treat you like a person not just a driver. Managers office always open to go in there and talk. When i needed time office there was not a problem. I left in the a great place in my job career. I would go back for the right opportunity comes.
good,"the office atmosphere is great, the people are very welcoming and helpful. Support staff is very prompt with all your needs and HR is as well. Work hours and pay are competitive."
good,A great place to work because they will work to develop you within their DMIT programs so you are fully trained once you are placed into a role. This program is what helps set them apart.

good,"This company is amazing to be apart of , I am extremely happy to be a part of a winning team that genuinely cares about its employees.  I highly encourage all to be a part of this team."
good,"I have had a fantastic experience so far from dispatch and being out in the field hauling. If you are just starting, take it step by step, the San Bernardino rail yards can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but as long as you ask as many questions as you can during training you will set yourself up for LESS STRESS. I came from a job that was 95% touch freight, so this job makes it much easier on my bones. The JB Hunt truck driving app on your phone makes this job so very less stressful. It tracks everything you do and all assignments that are dispatched on you and have completed. The trainers here are very respectful and take the time to show you how to get the job done correctly and safely. I would highly recommend those with (experience) to give this company a go."
good,My only problem I had was not getting paid for the miles driven. Other than that it's a good company to work for. I have nothing bad to say about the company.
good,"Working at J. B. Hunt was great, there I was able to perfect on my time management skills. Also, become very goal orientated, career focused, and a better driver."

good,Driver Managers are always there to help you with anything you need. You will receive a Load Assignment before you reach your destination for the receiver.
good,"Learned how to install different appliances, meeting exciting people. Visiting locations out of my state and learning new ways of ways of installation."
good,It was a pretty laid back environment just long as from time to time there trainer seems to push people thru thy seem like that only trainer to gt the extra cash
good,it was really fun and very productive but it was sad i had to resigned from this good job i liked it a lot since the first day i started working there

Amazing training program. I launched my so far 25 year career from that training and knowledge I gained. Management team is world class and employee/corporation oriented and balanced the two well.  Hardest part of the job was simply balancing the demands on my time and making sure I got all the information entered into the system correctly and no mistakes were made.  My coworkers made my days enjoyable. We shared a lot of laughter.
good,"Went in at a reasonable hour and left at a reasonable hour. Learned how to form a career in working with carriers, brokering freight, negotiating rates, dispatching drivers, load monitoring, and working with corporate reports."

good,This job allows you to meet so many good people. Be it in management and those drivers in the industry.
good,Enjoyed working for JB Hunt. Their Customers enjoyed having me as well. Went out on a non work related injury for surgery and was out for almost three years and they would not take me back because I was out too long they said.  So the lost a great driver but I know they have rules also.
good,Worked for them for over three years on a Petco dedicated account. Petco loved having me drive for them. Everything was great. Had to leave company because I became sick and had to go on short term disability for a few years and they couldn't bring me back because I was out for three years not driving truck :(  I don't see how you forget to drive a big truck in three years but it was one of their rules I didn't agree. So they lost a good driver. Overall I miss working for them locally.
good,Great managers and full time technicians. Learned the process of procurement and PC support. Enjoyed meeting new people everyday.
good,"JB Hunt is a great place to work, I enjoyed the challenge of taking any job given to me and just running with it.. making my job position necessary. I learned multiple programs needed to do my job.. My manager Darrell is a awesome guy, he trusted me to just do my job and never had to be micromanaged. At JB Hunt my coworkers always treated eachother with professional respect.. and the most enjoyable part of my job was watching my account grow to multi million dollar a month account. Taking care of the JB Hunt drivers and making sure they got paid for the work they performed under my board."
