bad,"If you are not related to someone there, you will not advance."
bad,"Learn a lot about Maintenance, Culture, Customer Service, Learning to be a Team Player.  Learn different types of Equipment, People skills.  Ability to multi-task assignments as given."
bad,"This is a very poor management team. It's not a professional"
bad,totally company was thinking about its own profit then employees progress. and its totally different than USA profit companies. this company did not follow Afghanistan rules and regulation
bad,"The days of family and corporate respect and caring are over. The more corporate can take they do. Benefits are shrinking and games are being played. Corporate feels they can manage facilities of which they have no understanding. They are consolidating IT, travel, accounting etc. making all these services more expensive or less productive. Soon we will have to pay them for health insurance, vacation, dental, even for the privilege to work as they make millions."
bad,"I enjoyed doing the job that I had done for six years, but when this company too over everything went down and none of the higher ups or government would listen or see the issues"
bad,This company cut peoples salaries in half just so they could be the underbider! We do not have the proper equipment nor supplies to work with and are in a war zone where we get shot at from outsiders!
bad,they are not giving any raises this year and hinting at no raises next year either. Layoffs regularly every 6 months. Benefits being reduced every day. Divisions with work are miss managed and require working unpaid overtime. Cutting edge jobs such as anything with communicats have been lost to GD and Harris. Jobs that are left there are for leggacy projects that uses 30 year technology using assymply. Managment is cluless and froze raises to keep the stock price up so they can exercise their options. Co workers are good but most of the good talent left the company so what you are left with are lazy dinosours. Hardest part of the job is the day they have layoffs you sit by your phone hopeing that HR does not call you. Moral is very bad espcially at the clifton building.
bad,"I worked for approxiamtely 10 year for theis company. Before they changed hands in 2007 it was an above average plac to work in terms of the culture. As it grew and they were bought out to ITT and the culture became a very fear-based negative toxic environment. The company is run by ex-military and he riles with the philosophy if you can't work 7 days a week find another job, They pay 45% under what any ""fair market"" would pay for the same job. My average work day was 12 hours plus and production and engineering people work longer. There is no ""Quality"" of life there, you become the company in spite of the lack of any kind of ownership. I stay in contact with the VERY few who are still there and they say one thing, ""You're lucky you don't work here anymore"" it's horrible. Most of the people I knew..many who had been there 15+ years fled from this place and their division across town. Upper Management and Mid Management value their OWN jobs and the bottom dollar, vs. valuing employees. There is very little if any co-worker teams because people work in fear. It's the worst job I've had in my career and I would highly recommend running far from this company if you value and respect yourself! If you're a woman...there's a ceiling..concrete! One positive thing was I was able to gain alot of experience in a new field."
bad,"Poor air quality and noise level"
bad,Management is poor and people are not treated fairly. Could be a good place to work if the proper people were in place.
bad,Pros
bad,Cutthroat environment. Managment looks for scapegoats to fire when business goes bad.
bad,"Absolutely no management support for activities,  poor leadership with  blame deflection.  finger-pointing.  Fellow employees  harassing  with verbal abuse and belittling the job I did,  despite doing the job of four people with an enormous growing workload."
bad,This company was in transition since I commenced employment.  There was a lot of turnover in management and the environment was inconsistent.  During the buyout there were layoffs and merit withholds I would suggest allowing the company time to maintain its structure before choosing this company for a career choice.
bad,If you are seeking financial stability then this is NOT the place to work. After ITT split and Exelis took over they have successfully run this place into the ground. Layoff after layoff. It finally got me after 17 years of working there.
bad,"It was fun before exelis took over. here we have to many chiefs and not enough Indians people are dropping like ants, and management response we don't care anybody can do that. Terrible place of employment  make this your very last place to look for employment horrible upper management, middle management tries  their best bottom of the barrel wages, and they promise you all kinds of things then never go through on them. I mean really the raises are nothing not even cost of living"
bad,Typical out of touch centralized management system. Does little to create a empowered culture.
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. They have no regard for employee well being. Management runs on an out dated fear based model that no longer works. They have changed the tech’s hours and moved our schedule around 4 times in the 2 years I worked there. And yet, if someone needs different hours, forget it. I was told “We can’t move someone if it benefits them”. When people started quitting after the last change, I heard my supervisor say “Where else are they going to go?” as if that is the only place to work. They also tried to talk us back into the building 2 hours after an exotherm and were told by the safety guy that he refused to have the air tested, but assured us it was fine, even though we could see that it was still a hazy yellow color and could still smell it from the parking lot. 90% of the shift declined and went home for the day. People are treated like machines. If you need a place to work to get your feet then fine, but continue your job search and DO NOT turn anything else down. This is a good place to learn bad habits, so watch that, too. And educate your self on safety matters and think for yourself in regards to your health."
bad,"This company is a high stress environment and expects long hours. They do pay well, but there are many times I wonder if it is really worth the money because of the excessive hours."
bad,There are favorites that get treated like gold and everyone else gets treated like dirt.
bad,"ITT Exelis Mission Systems HQ in Colorado Springs, CO is definitely the WRONG PLACE TO WORK! The company constantly reminds everyone to ""Do the Right Thing - Always"", but I guess they have to when VPs and Sr. Managers, in particular, constantly have no regard for the words and do what they want to, even if it puts the company in jeopardy. So much for P/SPs and the FAR!"
bad,"Mission Systems won a $30+ million OCONUS contract early 2013. Capture Manager (CM) was to award a 1+ million dollar ""Thank You/ Non-Competitive"" contract to a subcontractor who got Exelis' foot in the door, but was stopped by a member of the Business Development Team. All team members were reprimanded, even if they had nothing to do with the actions of the CM. Certain members of the BD Team were Laid-Off a couple months later under the ruse of sequestration and the lack of business opportunities."
bad,"Poor management, almost no chance for progression, multiple labor law violations and a long running good ol boy system"
bad,"Morale is decreasing due to no raises, healthcare benefits costing more, and poor leadership. Processes are inefficient and result in a loss of focus on what is important - The Customer, Product, and the Employees. Top management is arrogant and out of touch. At this location, Exelis should be only be considered as a last resort employer."
bad,"Proposal writers and proposal managers have a short life expectancy at ITT HQ. ITT often staffs-up for one or two proposal efforts then lays employees off. ITT depends heavily on consultants to work on a proposal then lets them go. ITT has reorganized its business units annually since January 2010 and is constantly reorganizing its BD, Capture, and proposal management."
bad,Look elsewhere for employment. Exelis is a bottom-feeder company with very poor management.
bad,"The job was very interesting, but no communication between worker and management. And when management became involved all they want to do is cause issues or road blocks for the projects instead of fixing issues so the projects could finish."
bad,"While I enjoyed the job and my coworkers were wonderful, hard working employees; the management and supervisors for the most part are difficult at best to get along with. "
bad,"Job had great potential, however the supervisor picks favorites, and if you weren't one of them, she ignored you. Coming in I was warned that she was unfair and didn't play by the rules, but I went forward any ways. Now I am out of a job."
bad,"Exelis is an excellent place to work to get experience in the aerospace industry.  However, it is an extremely immature company with poor values and unorganized upper management.  The ""Do what it takes"" mentality is abundant, but the serious lack of training and support from the top makes it nearly impossible to be successful."
bad,Company cut everones salary on day one of contract by four and five dollars an hour. But you still have to do the same amount of work not good at all . Project manager was sorry .
bad,"Unless you are used to being stabbed in the back, lied to, and required to pay for items required outside of your contract, do NOT work for this company."
bad,ITTExelis is a substandard contract company that was based in Kuwait during the time frame of 2012 to 2014. EEO has no relevance in solving employee relations. this company can terminate you without any cause.
bad,"ITT used to be a great place to work. We had a lot of fun and most everyone got along with one another and worked well together. It was not a stressful place to work. Since Exelis has taken over it is very stressful,not knowing if you are going to have a job when you go in to work or going to be laid off.When i started there sixteen years ago there were fifteen hundred employees now there are less than two fifty or so. Its really sad to see such a great company like ITT go in the direction it is going."
bad,"Joined Kodak C&G 10 years ago and with each transition (->ITT, now Exelis), the work environment is on the decline.  Pension is now gone, wages frozen for a year (but high level exec still got increases in their bonus)."
bad,Managment needs to define the strategy for the business better. Benifits are not that great and the work life balance is nonexistent.
bad,I did not enjoy working there. The last five years were miserable. Middle manager was a self serving narcissist that played off the success of others.
bad,"Depressing work environment, managers lacked leadership skills, co-workers however were for the most part nice and hard working"
bad,"The leadership with this company is any word worse than horrible. No matter what you do you always have to deal with the lack of good quality leadership. I can't stand the favoristism, and over managing the hard working employees. I strongly believe that a psychological test should be administered before promoting anyway. I don't have enough words to describe my first experience with this company at all. "
bad,"This company used to do some great work as ITT but when they split off to become Exelis then everything went downt the tubes, upper management cut raises then jumped ship. Promotions or training were non existent and the manangement staff was only concered about their own job no body elses and if you weren't pulling your weight to make them look good you were fired or laid off. It is a horrible place to work and I would never work there again."
bad,"Typical day at work includes working on Tech Manuals, uploading ECPs and NORs into MEARs website. Learned on the job through co-workers and management."
bad,"During my time at this company it seemed that favorites were given unprecedented amounts of attention, support and assistance. If you were not one of these people oftentimes you were left out on your own to figure things out and seek out help and mentoring from outside of the company."
bad,This compnay is so under staffed that the few of us here are doing a three to five person(s) job daily. The hours are very long and the pay isn't what you would expect from an overseas contracting company such as ITT Exelis. The management & work environment has to be the most unprofessional work environment that I've been around. I only have a few months left on my contract & can hardly wait. I'll never do overseas contracting ever again.
bad,The two worst supervisors I ever worked for (30+ years now) were on FOB Shank in Afghanistan.  The job was what I expected it to be - incredible pay but everything else pretty much sucked.
bad,The company had no annual cost of living increases for three years. Budget problem every year which causes layoffs every fiscal year.
bad,"I have worked hard to help the company succeed, the things that I have learned have been great, the promotion process is slow"
bad,Recent layoffs and reorg are strong indications that Exelis Space business is failing.  Sr. Leadership team is taking big bonuses while taking away pension and vacation benefits.  Merit increases also went to a two year cycle.
bad,Contract work is not reliable. I was with this company for 6 years to be laid off or not picked up by the next contract winner.
bad,The company continues downsizing and shrinking the employees benefits.
bad,"Management had not got a clue, pay was appaling for the amount of work we were expected to put in. The culture was based around stealing each others ideas for personal advancement. A total ""Junior vs Senior"" attitude from middle management upwards."
bad,"Primeira tarefa era o tratamento da correspondência, só depois a contabilidade. Agendamento de entregas e montagens."
bad,"Exelis has a very old workforce- some people have been there 30+ years. Given this, starting out as a 20-something in Finance who was to replace one of the more seasoned billing analysts, I was not given adequate training and then expected to perform my job responsibilities perfectly. When this didn't happen and errors popped up, there was no room for grace. My supervisor did not actually do our work but only oversaw it so she didn't agree that I hadn't been properly trained and sided with my coworkers who came to a joint decision that I was not cut out for the job. I was essentially bullied and chose to resign. I enjoy a challenging work environment and like to know I'm adding value but the expectation to work 12+ hour days without support from peers or management, without sufficient training, and then being left on my own made this experience awful. After I resigned, a former coworker of mine got in touch with me and let me know that the person they had hired to replace me went through a similar experience. The team is now under review and unable to hire anyone else because an ethics complaint was filed. I would not recommend working for this company unless you are extremely experienced in whatever field you're looking at already and don't mind the lack of work/life balance. More importantly, beware of the management, quite literally, they don't know what they're doing."
bad,"If you need a job, this is one. The hardest part of the job is showing up and maintaining a positive mental outlook.The work JPL doesn't want to do has been contracted out to Exelis.  A majority of the people have been here 10 years or more. If you aspire to anything don't work here."
bad,"The company must do a better job managing its talent, because rehire and new hire costs for specialized talent can be expensive, impact morale, and impact customer relationship management - long term."
bad,"Process retrograde medical supplies and equipment from units within the theater properly. Recieve, classify and seperate by category of expired, distruction and equipment that either can be repaire and place back into the system to be reused or destroyed. Maintaining accountability and secure controled supplies for proper destruction. Provide reports through both military and project management channels. Ensure contract online ia adhered to and policies followed. Enjoyed returning to the same work location under a different company however, it was harder when the staff was new and unexperience to the basics of the operation. Co-worker's were nevervous but willing to learn. Management rxpected allot but was not willing to follow through. Instead, found it easier to have me do a job without support of training the whole staff to include lead and supervisor was hard. What made it worth the effort was that my co-workers did learn and corrected allot of the errors and was able to maintain and learn as they continued."
bad,"Consistent with other major Aero/Defense giants in terms of pay, security, culture, management, etc."
bad,"report in @ 1330hrs and check with company's as to their needs for trans. as 1st shifts turns in vehicles i dispatch vehicles to 2nd shift drivers and assign them to different locations. i monitor our hand held radios to stay on top of the needs of the company's and the drivers. i set up any transportation needs for the following day. enter mileage,p.a.x., and any gas receipts. all vehicles are turned in at 2200hrs.   "
bad,"Completing a personnel information request form. No clear answer as to why, in 28 months, I filled out 5 of these. So what has happen with the previous ones, after all these are ""Personnel Information""."
bad,I have worked for several successful organizations in a 30 year period but ITT was the first company that I did not care for simply because of the lack of honesty regarding my performance! I was given a great deal of latitude regarding how I lead my department but without any authentic feedback on my performance caused me to be dissolutioned about my overall standing.
bad,"When I interviewed for this job my concern was the commute to and from work. I was sold the fact that they provide transportation to and from the train station. They have since taken the flexibility away and indicates that if you need to leave work for an emergency outside of the two drop off and pick up times, you must arrange on your own. SO you are asking co-workers for a ride to the train station."
bad,"A typical day at work is alot of driving, paperwork, and data entry."
bad,"The title says it all. The work here is very fragmented and the environment highly political. Some senior engineers are permitted to pick and choose the lower level engineers they work with and do not show any respect for them at least in the hardware group. Code of conduct is merely lip service. Managers are oblivious to code of conduct violations and sometimes are in violation themselves and play favorites or are intimidated by the more domineering engineers that think they have leverage because they are the only people that have the subject matter expertise to do a job. Their authority cannot be challenged to do the right thing. Inclusion is selective. Many lower level engineers have left. Many that have called attention to code of conduct violations mysteriously end up laid-off, fired, or put into resource pools waiting for assignments that never come. The division is not aggressive enough at getting new business and is tightly coupled to the military which these days is not lucrative at all. Mentoring is awful at the Bloomfield/Clifton site. No one has the patience to do it. Overall, not a good place to work for a less experienced engineer. Speculation by many here is that the entire company is preparing itself to be bought out if it can attract a suiter. If you do have work it's under the tightest of schedules often requiring vast amounts of overtime which on some programs is unpaid. They call it casual overtime. Last year routine merrit increases were cancelled indefinitely. The only saving grace is the work itself and the products that one can make a difference developing"
bad,"If you liked high school pep rally's, you will love Exelis. No substance all rah-rah-rah. They got by because some of the employees were passionate and dedicated. While others sit on the sidelines, out of sight and out of mind. "
bad,No one feels their jobs are secure.  Management is constantly restructuring and reorganizing which creates tremendous stress and unmotivated employees.
bad,"Employees were forced to use Backward Low Tech Poorly designed work processes to assemble equipment at lower quality standards than ever before. Management rarely listened to employees suggestions. Benefits were reduced while employees were charged higher prices. Company was in violation of many Quality Standards and Employment/Labor Standards of Defense Contractors. Company was so mismanaged, virtually all contracts were lost and no work could be garnered for the employees. But we loved having to only work 4-5 months per year to give our bodies a rest. Plus, we didn't really need that much money to live on anyway, since we would only spend it on gasoline or utility bills for excessive comforts."
bad,"ITT was a good place to work: great people, benefits, work-life balance...only one poor manager"
bad,"Fine aerospace employer w/ good benefits and integrity."
bad,"3 years of corporate datacenter, perimeter firewall, or endpoint security design and deployment - both green field and legacy experience"
bad,I would avoid the Defense Section; if possible in the future. Acquired by Harris Corp; the uncertainty escalated. Defense sector is struggling both domestically and internationally.
bad,"EE Hardware ::Good managers - but are hands-off managers.  Very low caliber technical leads, IPT's, and chief engineers.  Unacceptable  disrespectful, personality disorders.  VP engineering needs to remove or ""promote"" these few who degrade a very capable group.  This is a very common feeling amongst majority of engineers : most with 25 to 30 years experience"
bad,"You can only work there if you are a ""Yes Man"". If management wants to do something stupid you have to agree, and when it goes wrong you are blamed."
bad,"Decent place to work, from the standpoint of the work environment. Great coworkers."
bad,"IT Company, It pays decent salary.  Company is professional."
bad,"Right now everything is in trumoil, they have split the company from ITT and renamed the defense division Exelis. For the Geospatial systems division they have decided to restructure with a blueprint from a company call ProObis. This has only added to the management confusion and disarray. Because of this they have also decided to forgo raises for 2012. There is also great concern by employees that work in plants other than in Rochester, NY that their jobs may be in jeopardy since most of the management is located in Rochester."
bad,Bad management always micro managing your work and questioning everything that you do. Would not recommend working here for any reason. This is why I am looking elsewhere.
bad,"This was a pretty good place in 2011.  Good people, good culture. But, once Exelis bought it at the end of 2011, things went downhill quickly.  Poor management decisions led to two rounds of layoffs inside of 12 months.  Numerous people have resigned for other jobs.  Senior management does nothing to improve morale or keep valuable employees - they've given up, but continue to pull down their 6-figure salaries and big bonuses.  People who have left or been laid-off haven't been replaced.  The company can barely get the work done now.  YOU DO NOT WANT TO WORK HERE!"
bad,"Exelis was a very stressful, uncoordinated workplace that was understaffed for the workload. There was a lot of positives with the company as far as experience and culture. All of the employees are like a family, not just there to collect a paycheck."
bad,"A typical day at work changes from day to day.  Some days I will be working on designing test equipment, other days testing hardware and others day managing budget.  I currently have a great supervisor but this is not the case for all departments."
bad,"Fast pace work environment, opportunity to gain more knowledge.  Lack of faith and trust with Management, co-workers are not always team oriented.  Hardest part of the job is knowing that all it takes is one negative comment (true or false) from a customer to cost you employment.  The most enjoyable part is when a customer is satisfied and appreciative the efforts you went thru to support them."
bad,This company hired mostly temporary employees but they were very good with employees and seemed to have a good hold on manufacturing environment.
bad,"When our location was still part of ITT  Corporation,  this was a 5* company.  The company still pays well above average and the overall benefits package is great."
bad,Division was shut down due to management decison. Was a good place to work.
good,"Exelis Management sucks bad.  No hope of ever moving around with in the company. no raises, no rewards for good work.  You are allowed to have family time, and the majority of employees are good people and easy to work with."
good,the experience  and the knowledge I've learn from this company make me a better worker for different jobs
good,The management doesn't interact with lower level personnel and the human resources dept is non existent when it comes to work related problems.
good,"Good place to work.  small company, benefits are not all that great ."
good,its a good place to begin a field of experience in order to procure a better career. good people and dangerous work its not for anyone who is shy or easily intimidated.
good,The work day is usually busy. A lot of customers requesting VTC'S we try to provide the best customer service possible. To make sure all the customers needs are met.
good,"My day is usually busy, so it makes the day go very fast. I learned a lot about professional cleaning, using all kinds of cleaning equipment.  I enjoy every aspect of housekeeping"
good,"Corporate management makes decision based on short term gains.  5 year plans are the maximum most of the Corporate management plans on staying, so they are always looking for their golden parachute."
good,"slow days"
good,This company waits until the day before you are being laid off to tell you
good,"This company was once a great place to work. The economic climate, along with the change of hands over time, has changed the atmosphere there."
good,The leadership team in Roanoke needs an overhaul. Best thing that could happen to this company is to be sold.
good,"This is a company that is focused on meeting schedule and budget regardless of what that does to employee morale and career path. The organization and business model of the company has changed every 2 to 3 years. The last 5 years have been a trend of increasing employee workloads, while cutting benefits and raises. Workforce reduction happens every 6 months to a year, with many of them being small silent layoffs and firings to avoid disclosing to employees what they are doing."
good,Local Management Team is completely dis-engaged with the mission of the SN.  All functional decisions come from the deputy manager level and below.
good,Poor management with lack of knowledge in S.O.P. and S.O.W.
good,"Exelent place to work, pleasant personality and I was given proper training on office procedures."
good,Highly demanding work environment with an extremely talented workforce.
good,...that being said each project under them has its own pros and cons.  TAC-SWACAA and APS-5 are not as professional as I had hoped.  I hope the others are better.
good,"An experienced DoD professional with 28 years managing multiple programs in Configuration and Data Management.  Assist in the growth of a corporation by providing diversified work experience, acquired talents, openness to continue learning, and a strong desire to be part of a winning team.  My personal commitment is to motivate and inspire other team members with a positive attitude, a desire to succeed and determination to achieve and exceed corporate goals. "
good,Well defined process available but people do not follow. The most enjoyable part of the job is to learn the estiablished processes.
good,"Company went through a buyout, personnel were treated poorly... Most people I worked with were extremely professional and treated others with respect. upper management was poor, as they were never able to resolve internal issues in a timely manner."
good,Ok to work for but fast passed environment with constant changes. Management does not back up there employees and play favorites.
good,Too much disconnect between upper management and employees. Serious communications problems. The company  does not demonstrate a real concern about the employees career path.
good,"The management structure at Exelis (in the Rome location) was not thought out thoroughly. The job to skills matching was not optimal, and due to the company acquiring that location from a private owner, favoritism and unfair employment opportunities was often the norm. This is not an Exelis issue on a corporate level, but more of a location-specific problem."
good,The management at this company didn't take the time to show the gratitude like other companies that were in Afghanistan.
good,"On the plus side, I've gotten plenty of exposure to tasks outside of normal accounting, and am able to work without opressive management.  On the downside, management doesn't promote from within, there's few opportunites to move, and there's clear age discrimination."
good,"Typical Day at Work - Receive subsystem/subassembly to repair and test.  Repair subsystem/subassembly using the latest drawings and Acceptance Test Procedures.  Test new subassemblies in accordance with the latest Acceptance Test Procedure."
good,My work environment was interactive and collaborative. Worked with a great boss and team members.  Also worked well with other team from other divisions. Company needs to understand the importance of a creative easy to use web site in order to grow business in the federal and commercial sectors.
good,Management and employee relations are terrible and this company has absolutely no job security.
good,"Nothing good to say. No sense of ownership, meaning no one takes their job personally and the ones who excel at their job, are always the ones that get overlooked.  Instead of Company standards, it is more on the line of Standards of Convenience and this goes from the worker all the way up to management."
good,The company was a good place to work for.The employees all seemed to work together as a team to get the job done.
good,"The company split into 3 companies late last year, and now is publicly traded on it's own financial performance without a corporate umbrella to hide under. What matters most is stock price and the benefits to upper management, cost cutting included lay-offs of senior employees and reduction of employee benefits."
good,Great working enviroment. Employees work well together. Federal holidays off.
good,The company no longer is operational. They were bought by another company. It was not able to secure contracts to keep enough people employed and generate a profit.
good,laid off....was a great place to work till excelis took over
good,"arrive at work on time complete pre-work  briefing,,do a through pre-trip inspection of vehicle .complete a 12 hour work schedule  do a 360 post trip inspection complete and turn in all paper work.."
good,Challenging place to work due to so many people getting laid- off .
good,I loved what I did and the staff I worked with was ok. The drive to and from work was the difficult due to the crashes and deaths on the highway. The weather for the most part was really hot.
good,"Work is steady. I have learned a great deal on the job. Our management is alright, but could be more supportive in terms of our current benefits package. Co-Workers are mostly friendly."
good,"Busy most of the time"
good,My most enjoyable part from work was knowing that I was reminding students that safety is a very important factor in their lives.
good,Typical company.  Best part of the job was the co-workers and the work.  Worst part was poor management that like to micro-manage the work.
good,I started at the bottom of the food chain and worked up; only took 7 years.  I learned tons of information and my co-workers are like my family!
good,*Sign Soldiers In and take care of classes of 200 soldiers plus
good,"Some days work could be stressful and some days you'll find something to do. I've learned how to wash motors transmissions after taking them apart,then rebuild, test, and packed. I've learned what and how to sand down vehicles and trailers. How to tape certain part on the vehicles and trailers before getting painted. i also did spreadsheets everyday for production, and every Mon. i was responsible for managing S.A.S."
good,Jobs were easy. Having to bid on them was all about seniority. The drama was overwhelming!!! Company big on union or called a scab. Pay was great. The changing of company hands with different policies took getting used to. Having to scan your badge to leave your area for a bathroom break left you with no privacy.
good,Submitted a review and report to Exelis expecting to get a report or comments as a result of the terrible opportunities while working in Afghanistan and Qatar.
good,"I enjoyed working for Harris.  The work was intellectually stimulating and the people are talented. The layers of management were oftentimes rather thick.  The culture was quite paranoid from a security standpoint, which is understandable given the nature of the work. This meant that things took much longer than they otherwise might take due to the high security scrutiny.  Despite these difficulties in the culture, I loved working for Harris mostly because of the people and what I learned from them."
good,"Although I did enjoy learning AWRDS, I was stuck doing one specific job that got old after a while. During my six months in this position, I realized that there was no room for advancement and the leadership did not care. My manager and supervisor allowed a soldier to yell at me across the room because I was doing my job and to this day they never addressed the situation. I had to handle it on my own by going to the NCOIC without the support of my management. There was and still is a lot of backstabbing and unprofessionalism going on in that section."
good,"The work day is normally routine different day same procedure."
good,"good learning experience, jobs are fast pace , great co-worker"
good,"warehouse workplace , typical 8 hour work days with 30 minute lunch breaks."
good,"Continuous down sizing of Long Island operations since Clifton take over (EDO was bought out by ITT, now Exelis), combined with shrinking defense budget from Washington is effecting general attitude.  Company is good and solid as a whole.  Offers good benefits but focus appears to be off Long Island."
good,Used to be ITT. Very similar with decent benefits and comparable pay.
good,Good place to work but lots of issues caused by upper management that the regular workers pay for.
good,Upper management could be more creative and give opportunities to their employees to reach certain goals with numerous incentives.
good,"The people I work with are incredible, but the sequester has resulted in tumultuous changes within the company. Management has been affected and there have been numerous layoffs. The remaining workers have to do more with less. "
good,I have several nuances of my job. I was busy but would have down time once work for the day was completed. I learned a great deal from working with innovative thinkers and gained a wealth of experience as well supporting them in various task. The managers for the most part are strong. I enjoyed working with a diveres group of co-workers. The hardest part of working with Exelis is the fical nature of being a contractor. Not havaing job security was a very unsetteling notion. I enjoyed working with several government employees.
good,"My location at Exelis has a union which limits economic growth for the company; however, there are alot of hard-working individuals at our company. The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet my customer's requirements in a timely fashion due to departmental cutbacks which have increased my individual workload by 300%. The best part of the job is being busy and challenged enough that the work days go by very quickly."
good,"Most enjoyable part of job was being able to work without supervision and being able to assist everyone not just my department with my knowledge.  Typical work day is setting up numerous travel itineraries and expense reports, assisting other divisions and locations also with administrative needs."
good,"More of my duties were related to making coffee, ordering catered lunches picking up catered lunches with no mileage re-imbursement, working with a team of Engineers 200 or more engineers that reported to the Director of Engineering Stephen Pierce. Lots of travel and expense reporting for all employees, all day meetings with bfast coffee, catered lunches and snacks at 3pm all day meetings with US Military US Navy highly secure building. You could not take pictures of any thing inside. You had to present your American Passport, drivers license and Social Security card to get into the building."
good,"•	Gather reports on use of stock, adjustments of inventory, damaged materials and weapons, location changes and shipment denial."
good,"Culture has take a turn for the worse since being acquired by Harris Corp.  Harris Corp has only two concerns cash flow and accurate forecasting.  It seems that everything else in the business is secondary to these two things.  These are undoubtedly important, however, they shouldn't come at the expense of employees and customers.  Have a feeling that short term financial gains in the stock market will take a turn for the worse if the core isn't protected"
good,Company treated employee's well from the corporate level. I do think there's a overall good opportunity for better management training.
good,Decent amount of red tape and politics.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"A great opportunity for someone looking for entry level work in as a Security Professional and also to work on the Exelis Information Systems Aerostat Mission. Site Manager was always motivating, willing to train employees, fair, and understanding. The fellow employees were some of best co-workers I have had the privilege of working with and best friends I have ever made. Long work weeks, but plenty of days off. Good medical and retirement benefits."
good,Upper management was not connected with the labor force. Upper management was not able to get contracts. Upper management had a downsizing but everyone was given jobs in different positions. Upper management protects its own.
good,"Good company to work for, positive work environment.  Ethical, good management."
good,"Processed weekly Accounts Payables"
good,"Lots of good people in the organization, but company is being acquired.  Changed from HW/SW R&D orientation to other foci."
good,"Fair company to work for, however focus is on numbers, not on the people that make the company what it is today.  benefits are average."
good,"-slow"
good,Lack of leadership and coordination is needed with specific individual and group goals.
good,"The company has great potential and amazing people committed to good work that adhere to the core values. However, management is shortsighted in valuing opportunities for the present and the future. It is very reactionary to new developments instead of taking the lead in core technologies where it holds a competitive advantage."
good,Day to day operations were hampered by lack of management interaction.
good,LOGCAP IV provides logistical support to the warfighter in Afghanistan.
good,"As the manager of the OSP portion of our operation, I was responsible for keeping up with the details of pending and upcoming building projects aboard the base. Such details included the requirements of customers moving into the building, project deadlines, coordination with other entities in the building process (electricians, painters, engineers, etc.). It was primarily my responsibility to ensure that the data cabling was in-place, terminated, and tested before customers were ready to begin the move-in process. I was also considered the first layer of security when it came to the physical network. Access to network closets was to be approved and provided by our shop. In dealing with classified and unclassified networks, any customer requests for cable runs on the installation, had to be first scoped out and approved by me to ensure that the proper standards were to be observed. The other major portion of my job as the Lead OSP Technician was the management of the technicians in my shop. Supervision, employee evaluation, training, and looking after the needs and well-being of employees (being in a combat environment) were required. The last portion of my job was the general responsibilities of an OSP technician. Running copper and fiber optic data cabling, splicing, termination, and testing for quality assurance were the typical day-to-day tasks."
good,"When I first started at Exelis it was ITT Industries and I knew nothing about Industrial Security.  Everything I know I learned here. There were many things that were great about working at Exelis. The benefits were decent, vacation and sick time were great, and the week off at Christmas couldn't be beat.  I enjoyed working with my peers and got along with all of them.  The worst part about this company is the management. Most of them are out for their own gain and have no interest in helping you move up.  They would much rather find a way to make you fail than succeed.  In my opinion, and that of many others, this company needs a major overhaul on the management side."
good,"Learned so much working at this company and my co-workers were great people.  This company is extremely top heavy and company politics are a huge part of their culture.  Their motto ""do the right thing always"" only applies to certain people."
good,"Supply Technician on Camp Arifjan, Kuwait."
good,I really enjoyed working with the senior management team on a daily basis.
good,A typical day 7:30-4 I've learned alot . Management was great back then. My co-workers were like family. The hardest part of my job seeing people mistreat one another. The best part of my job is interacting with the customers.
good,assembler and solder. how to solder and how to build Power supplies. Management was ok and co-worker you have good one and you have ok one.I did not have a jobs that I could say was to hard.enjoyable parts of the jobs was some of the people and assembler buliding power supplies.
good,ITT is a great company with great salary and benifits.  Sadly they have seriously lowered the bar for who they higher and the managers and fellow staff are not qualified to run a helpdesk much less a domain. Most of your day is spent fixing privious tickets that were done.
good,"Projects were really cool and in general co-workers were great to work with.  However, Management rules by intimidation so back stabbing and/or blaming others is SOP."
good,This company needs to work on their company structure. The top management team likes to micromanage and it seems that everyone is running in circles.  On a positive note the company offers decent fringe benefits. 
good,"Business is closing, that says it all. Poor decisions were made, and we are all paying for it."
good,great people work for me. I have learned to become a great manager. Hardest part of the is that the business is closing. Loyal employees.
good,I conducted roving control or office duty with the alarm and radio systems.
good,"I've experienced good and bad at ITT. Fortunately, I've experienced more good. The good:"
good,"Unfortunately, with the lost of a huge contract. The company was forced to downsize at the DC location where I am currently located."
good,"A typical day at work was the morning safety briefing ,distribution of the work packets and waiting for parts and getting started on the job. I learned with hard work dedication and working together we can meet our goals."
good,I really enjoy the atmosphere but felt my pay was too low for the amount of work and effort
good,"Implement, maintain and troubleshoot the network for the Army in theater."
good,The company has good benifits and a good working enviroment
good,"Did not stay long at the organization to give a thorough assessment, but I experienced a community and involvement culture well embraced at Exelis (now L3Harris)"
good,Company neither cared about nor worked to maintain employee confidence.  Management skills lacking from top down.  Atmosphere at site was typical for International work.  Improvements at site never fulfilled.
good,"This is a great place to start your career, but unfortunately the company does not value education. Salaries are not competitive."
good,Good Place to work. Times not as good as it was back in 2006. Future looks grim at the moment.
good,"I was fortunate to be mentored by a great manager, which made a great difference to my career."
good,Servicing 500 soldiers a day. Learned more patience. My co-workers were great people to work with and the management went far and beyond to make the work environment to work in.
good,"All in all EXELIS is an enjoyable place to work. ""All-Hands"" meetings arranged on a quarterly basis include company provided lunches during informational meetings by management.   Workers mostly fall into two categories: those with over 20 years of seniority, and those with under 5"
good,"daily new challenges"
good,"During my two years working with ITT Exelis which came at the beginning of the contract startup, there were many low points that had to be worked through, especially due to employees who were not familiar with the job requirements and dealing with different management styles from new managers on the start up contract. The work was very invigorating and satisfying as a quality auditor there were many responsibilities which had to be achieved in order to have contract success. As a multi-tasker my input was appreciated but not recognized, but the work was enjoyable."
good,I grew with this position from a newby perspective but skilled to accommodate. Up for the challenge would best describe my mindset at that time. It grew to a very challenged position in many ways. I am most fortunate to have walked away with a feeling of growth and appreciation. More to follow ...
good,Decent place to work. I have enjoyed my time here but there is little to no room for growth unless someone leaves the company.
good,"Good benefits and pay but within a high stress, Government regulated environment with little job security. Most of the managers have been promoted into positions based on seniority and not skill set."
good,We had to work as a family and watch each others back. This was in Afghanistan and this was a great job. I was sorry it was the end of the contract. It took awhile but the fire chief and I got everyone on the same page. It was great working with the military to make the bases better. The respect I gained was nice.
good,"Building antennas for aircrafts was interesting. The operations management liked to micromanage a bit, which made the job a little bit stressful. My co-workers were friendly, but wished they were compensated more for their extensive periods of work for the company. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constantly changing flow of work (ie: working slowly when there's very little work)."
good,"Very dynamic work environment, Highly skilled professionals working to accomplish one unified goal. A normal work day is full of unexpected tasks but co-workers are always ready to help. While working with ITT Exelis, I fine tuned my management and people skills while increasing my knowledge in many other areas."
good,My job with Excelis was to provide Logistics support to the directorate. I was the key inventory management person and responsible for all new equipment bought. Also responsible for logistics support Analysis.
good,Administering 13 contracts as well as writing 2 additional ones keeps me busy.   Good environment to work in and colleagues are pleasant.
good,I have a good working team of three people and we all get along
good,Working for Operations at ITT Exelis challenged me in ways I did not expect. I was working on complex parts with technical machines. I was in charge of two key pieces of equipment that I needed to learn how to operate. There was little training provided to me so a majority of my knowledge came from trial and error. I enjoyed the challenge of learning the machines and the feeling of seeing the machines operate was most satisfying. The people I worked with were extremely knowledgeable in their respective fields and were willing to help out whenever possible.
good,"I have learned a lot from this company. Management was ok, I learned leadership, and how to interact with customers. My hardest part of the job was when the contract ended."
good,I enjoyed the job.  It was always an opportunity to gain new knowledge and to apply learned knowledge.  The only part of the job that is not favorable is the job security.
good,"Most people there are good to work with. I have some good co-workers, and this makes the job easier."
good,Fun place to work.  Working with other contractors and the military was most enjoyable and rewarding.
good,properly maintain vehicles and safely transport passengers. excellence management and good community  with others was happy work.
good,"Going to work every day on time was my schedule, when we were busy me and the team each had our duties to perform then we would combine our duties then complete product. the hard part was when the building got hot. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,Enjoyed working on the production floor and the manufacturing field.
good,"With each new company transformation came new job opportunities, career growth, and new skill set. The last transformation eliminated the IT support staff."
good,"ITT Exelis is a decent company to work for when new and upcoming safety specialists continue their training; however, progressing in the company is limited due to the nature of contracts and the current management system.  Overall budgeting and schedules are strictly limited based on position and personal life is pretty much put on hold since most employees work 48 hours a week (6days week).  "
good,"A very competitive contract dependent environment."
good,Solved many problems that were hard to do with not knowing who to escalate to. The challenge of an unsure career path was hard to deal with sometimes But over all I worked with some excellent people
good,Enjoyed my time at Exelis unfortunately FSS was relocated and then the company was sold. I learned a tremendous amount from my superiors that I was able to take with me to my new role.
good,"Great People"
good,"working with various people, having work in there for so long answering questions and helping people was always fun for me."
good,"I started out at this company as a summer temp and have worked several different positions with this company. I worked as a counselor, lead counselor, inspector and supervisor. I have loved all aspects of this job. The only thing that I can say I didn't like was the fact that the whole time was that this was a contract job and every five years the contract came up for rebid and eventually they lost the contract to DST."
good,"Very low volume, engineering intensive, cost plus environment. There are no ""typical"" models / methods. The backlog has a lot of variation. The forecasting is very subjective with a large error factor, hence there is no such thing as to level load or smooth the load."
good,"Fun place to work, Friendly co-workers. I Liked working in the department i was in. ( Installation ). I enjoy working with cabling and equipment. I would like to work this type of work."
good,"they changed names and got bought out twice in three years.. same people work there ,needs work. bathroom to small for the amount of people there. needs up grading ."
good,The company as well as the job was decent to work for. The downfall is that the contract could be pulled or something could happen before the end-of-the contract. You also had to deal with hoping to be picked up on the next contract once that contract was up. It was like living on a wing & a pray whether or not you were going to have a job or not.
good,"Enjoyed competitive information technology environment where collaboration among contractors, civilians, and military led to productive solutions for USAF."
good,"I have few complaints, my biggest issue was that I felt underutilized.  However, when I did have sufficient work and it was interesting."
good,Exelis Incorporated provided a productive and challenging work environment. I was able to refine my accounting and administrative work skills to produce a successful electronic filing system.
good,"I like my schedule in this company,the management is good,my co workers are nice,full benefits company.I did not feel any hardtime in my work here because i enjoy what i am doing."
good,"I learned alot, the coworkers were nice, good pay,traveled the US and abroad, drove all types of equipment worked at railyards,shipports and airport"
good,"flexible hours with no over management. technically challenging with a very diverse workforce. some project management could have been better, with communication improvement."
good,"Able to adapt to changes"
good,"Work in a great team environment that allows for free flowing ideas and recommendations to better our deliverable products to our Government customer.  Immediate manager is one of the best manager's I've ever had the pleasure to work for.  Lets me do my job, but is always supportive of the work I do and is available should I need assistance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with."
good,Pretty Good company to start at. Started at the Help Desk and work my way up
good,My day at work consist of taking care of my team members and completing the mission
good,"Learned a lot about troubleshooting pick and place machines. Too bad that the company merged with another, downsized and then closed due to government cutbacks."
good,All the co-workers are great and share a common goal to accomplish all tasks and challenges that come along.
good,A good place to work. Good local management.  The corporation management is questionable.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is finding creative ways to maintain budget and schedule."
good,"•Manage complex product development including project and resource planning, specification development, financial cost control, design review, validation testing, equipment specification, process development, and quality product launch, this includes sub-contract management. Design team sizes have ranged anywhere from 5 to 25 engineers. Team members include Systems Engineering, Digital Designers, Analog Designers, Power Supply designers, Software and Embedded Firmware Engineers, Reliability Engineers, Project Engineers, Manufacturing Engineers, Machinists, Interns and Technicians (both full-time and contract)."
good,Managed an Equipment Repair Facility with approximately 50 employees. Responsible for planning and resourcing of every aspect of the maintenance operation to include administrative support. 
good,Very friendly work environment.  Highly competant employees.  Compensation is above average.  Company benefits could use a little improvement.  Job security is low due to defense budget cuts and Sequestration.
good,Good place to work as a small team on a project. Management up to the program level knows what the customer wants and needs. Upper management lives in their own world where the right and left hand do not know what the other is doing. As with all military contractors - employment is never stable. Layoffs happen quarterly to meet the stockholders report expectations.
good,"The products produced were unique and provided a vital role to specific customers as well as everyone else in general. ITT Exelis at Fort Wayne, IN. built radios for the military and the aviation industry as well as cameras for weather satellites. Making sure the test, measurement and production teams had the equipment they required and that the equipment operated properly and to specifications provided a high level of job satisfaction."
good,Professional work environment. Highly educated technical staff.
good,Good Environment and Management to allow creativity and productivity
good,we had a good working environment. safety was the key to begin  any task with us. That is the reason why we never had commit any accident or incident in our work place.
good,Able to work on a product used by nations military. Traveled for 2 years at customer sites collecting positive results while demonstrating product.
good,"Depending on which business area or design group someone would like to work in a typical day at work varies. As a systems engineer the work may vary from test and integration, system/subsystem design, to data analysis. The management is to be desired however the people are great."
good,"My primary complaint with this company is that they hold on to too many individuals that lack job performance.  The pay is great, the people for the most part are great, I worked there for 9 years, but was laid off due to lack of work.  I would most definitely go back if called to do so."
good,Great people with a positive work environment.  Management has an open door policy where all are welcome to discuss any issues or concerns.
good,Productive environment. Self-starter's welcomed. Every day was just as challenging as the day before.
good,Great opportunities for advancement and education. Very active in community projects and fund raising for several charities.
good,One of roanokes best places to work. The pay and benefits are good for this area. Work enviroment is friendly and I made lots of frienships while I was there. There down fall was do to the cuts in the DOD spending.For the Roanoke Valley I hope that they will be able to get back to full strenght. They are a inportant part of this area.
good,"It was a boring job except when I was learning and when something broke. The network hardly ever goes down so most of my time was spent reading and learning about the different devices in the work center, and doing online training with Microsoft office and various other programs. "
good,"A friendly environment with supportive supervisors to balance personal & professional life. Due to the nature of the work, does not always feel like stable employment."
good,Due to this being an overseas deployment position only I have had little contact with ITT Exelis. The PM was extremely helpful when issues did arise.
good,If you are looking for a to just get into the field it should be OK but most of the production workers do not have schooling and the pay is not great
good,A job is what you make it. It is laid back and enjoyable for the most part. The hardest part of this job is the fact that I am way from my family for a year.
good,"A typical day would be clock in at work station ,calibrate tools ,bring up work instruction on computer and start work.I learned that when me and my co-workers work together it made our job a lot easier .My co-workers were great had a lot of good times working and laughing together.The hardest part of job was soldering small parts but got good at it.The most enjoyable part was the people"
good,"Co-workers were easy to work with"
good,"It is an odd relationship as there are direct and indirect management. This review more comprises of the Exelis organization as a whole. The pay and benefits are rather generous. However, I believe the downfall comes with the lack of ability to recognize top talent and generate work for their personnel. In short, the Exelis management needs to recognize the contributions of their personnel and take the time to set them up for future success and endeavors. The communication has lacked at times from upper tier management. I will spare the details, however, job security is tentative on contracting and hours available."
good,"I love working for this company. My co-workers are easy going, friendly, and willing to help. If after the contract is over, I am able to continue working with this company- I will!"
good,Exelis has a small travel office. The work day consisted of doing our job and going home. I did learn Concur and in the process of learning Trams.I currently have basic knowledge with Trams.
good,Like all companies this company has its ups and downs. Contract work is always iffy.
good,"I am part of a support team"
good,"Exelis was a great company to work for. I worked there for 11 years but Corporate decided to shutter our office in PA, work was moved to site in Long Island, NY. At this point relocating was not an option."
good,A great job but a lot of drama among employees. Very poor management from the top down. No one is truely in control. Most employees do as they wish. No structure or strong leadership at all.
good,Great place to work
good,Enjoyed going to work. Management was great and fair across the board.
good,"I, hardly work togethet with my co-employees doing the assigned job as a Senior track and wheeked vehicle mechanic at Track & Wheel Shop at Camp Buehring Kuwait. Work also as a recovery mechanic as per assign to do so. I dida tough job while on exelis. I thanks the management for all if those? Need to be with them?"
good,"You know what you have to do on a typical work day, there is a lot to learn there but management will try to hold you back. I traveled to get trained but if I had to get trained here it would have been a struggle. If a supervisor gave you a hard time HR wouldn't do anything about that. Theres no one that will investigate management. or go against them. I have seen a lot of things go on there that shouldn't have been taken lightly."
good,Enjoyed working for Exelis. Great benefits. The pay was lower than I was used to receiving. The leadership kept employees engaged and excited about working as a contractor.
good,The work environment at Exelis was a great working environment however most of the work was independent yet enjoyable. Each day was an adventure with meeting new people and seeing some of the regulars come through the base. A typical work consisted of completing daily reports for the next shift and participating in debriefing meetings from previous shift.
good,"They build some of the world's best satellite imaging systems, along with the state of the art test systems to Verify and Validate those systems. I had the opportunity to work on an adaptive optics control system for a large ground based telescope. I combined FPGA, and Realtime Linux systems using LabVIEW. Also some high speed multiple channel control systems. This was some of the most fun work I have had in years."
good,"A fabulous 23 years of work. Great team of workers, met a great number of good people and learned a great deal from them. However, due to a low demand for company products, the company reduced the work force and a good thing came to an end."
good,"Typical day was design and test of electronic system."
good,"Exelis was purchased by Harris Corporation in 2015, it was a great place to work, over the years and especially during the down turn the company did a lot to look out for the well being of the employees."
good,"The HR office was setup to be run by a single person, however once we reached 120 employees it got to be too much for one person and made the days very long."
good,"Prefer not to answer as the company has gone through 3 corporate re-structuring initiatives, change management was a challenge."
good,I am not at liberty to discuss such matter due to the nature of the contract. The organization was ran systematically on a daily basis. All employees knew what was expected while the management managed the system. the Co-worker were courteous and extremely profession. Hardest part of the job was being away from home. I enjoy this job because it allows me to utilized all my skills and challenged me to seek improvement.
good,"•	Manage a proactive employee relations climate to provide advice, counsel and guidance on employee relations issues and employment law to department managers, supervisors and executive staff."
good,"I prefer to wait until a later time to complete this as I still work here.  At this time, things are not representative of my overall experience in working here."
good,Exelis is a good company to work for particularly is you are an engineer. Multiple contract vehicles enable one to acquire experience in all levels of government contracting.
good,"A great diverse group of scientists, developers, product managers, and management before the corporate acquisition. Now everything is very unsure. The company's business model is unclear to the employees."
good,There are excellent components of working here. Primarily management respects work/life balance and has many avenues to doing many functions. The negatives are the slow process changes that impede work.
good,"Under above ratings, I initially put a 3-star rating for Job Security since I have just been laid off. Upon further consideration, 16 years in one job should be given at least a 4-star rate. It wouldn't let me change the form to a 4 though and remains blank."
good,"Worked a second shift, so went directly to get pass down to start the day from fellow co-workers. Talked to supervisor to receive the expectations and work load."
good,"Was very excited to get a chance to work at Exelis.  Learned about different companies that work for Exelis. Prepared 10 different payroll  on AS400. Worked the helpdesk and had a chance to resolve problems for C0-workers on the Concur expense system."
good,"En general un clima de trabajo agradable. Con bastante interacción con otros puestos de trabajo. "
good,Good company to work for. Very interesting work depending on the group you work for.
good,"I love working with my team, we help each other out a lot and learn from each other."
good,Have worked for 4 years with ITT and have enjoyed the people I work with. The company is currently in a re-bid effort for major vehicle maintenance contract. No negative experiences with management or co-workers.
good,always busy and fast paced
good,"There was a backlog of paperwork when I started my last assignment, so addressing those reports was very regular. Occasionally there would be a new issue that needed solving, and I enjoyed the challenge."
good,Prior military experience is a plus - you know what it is like to live in spartan conditions. Little or no privacy - community toilets and showers. Food at my location was mediocre at best. The occasional attack made things a little more interesting. Other than that a pretty standard sys admin job.
good,Good company to work for. Many locations on Ft.Benning are contracted under ITT exelis.
good,"Great place to work. The company has been going through expansions meaning growth and many opportunities for advancement in the company. The company has a great work environment where the employees generally feel appreciated. The only downside to the company is that they don't pay well. Their pay is well below the industry average. However, if you are looking for job security, this is the place to work."
good,One of the only companies that I worked for where I enjoyed going to work almost everyday. Learned so many new things and met a lot of very interesting people. The pay and benefits were very good too. They also have a cafeteria and credit union on site which was very convenient. With the recent DOD cuts many jobs have been eliminated.
good,"Working at Exelis project was a new experience for me with foreign culture. the management was pretty good and everything in a great way, but the hardest part of job was the project site where i worked."
good,"enjoyed working with group and supervisor to make the company grow and improve things ,learned a lot about electronics and instructions as well working with amazing management  !!!"
good,The work environment is relaxed and collaborative.  Everyone works well together in a team environment.  This is a fun place to work and the company overall treats the employees well.
good,Vast amount of team work and variety of personalities and cultures. Provide open door conversation with management. People generally care for you and your goals
good,Liked the work but it didn't challenge me technically. Work location was in Colorado Springs and travel was below 20%. Worked in a team environment. Very supportive boss.
good,It was enjoyable helping the us military get their mail sent off to their families and to make sure they received their mail as well.
good,"Work environment is great and well taken care of as far as benefits, pretty solid on most government contract. overall not a bad place to work"
good,Worked supporting government contracts providing manpower and training documents for the Navy. Learned a lot in regards to the process and procedures in supporting the military in a government contract position.
good,Coordinated and Scheduled access to Software and Hardware Lab for Development and Sustainment of Launch and Test Range located on Vandenberg AFB in Ca. I expanded my System Engineering knowledge of the Baselined Systems which supported the Launch capability at Vandenberg AFB. I supported my manager by providing status of all development and sustainment Engineering Change modifications. I worked with a diverse team capable of developing and trouble-shooting hardware and software supporting the Launch capability. The hardest part of my job was making sure the baselined configuration was not disturbed due to multiple engineers working on a large integrated system supported by multiple servers and support equipment. I enjoyed the challenge of working multiple activities while ensuring the efforts did not impact each other.
good,Great team environment. Great leadership team. Fast paced and demanding but very rewarding.  I worked for ITT Exelis Corp for 28 years and had ample opportunities and support for advancement.
good,Company was always employee oriented however a little stingy with the benefits. Recognized for excellent performance with emails and positive performance reviews however I felt the company did not go far enough to reward great performance by offering  fair merit increases or promotions. Overall though a good company to work for. Because I am a self starter I appreciated being able to manage my projects without being micro managed.
good,"Direct government support. Everyday is a learning experience. Management care about their personnel. My co-workers were professional. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer."
good,"consistent volume, high quality standards, independent and team operations, nice work schedule "
good,"Leading others, giving out work orders for the day. Driving and operating heavy equipment. Submitting SITREP, IDR’s and accountability for our department at the begining and end of each day. I’ve learned how to work in diverse country, enviroment and living. My co-workers and counter-partners  were great to work with and get to know.  The hardest part of the job was the language barriers. I enjoyed meeting new people."
good,"I enjoyed coming to work every day, but managers began to manage via spreadsheet and set unrealistic goals.I had fantastic co-workers that I still consider friends."
good,"While I have appreciated working for Exelis in my role as Technical Order Manager of one of the Air Force's Weapon Systems, the contract is preparing for recompete soon.  I have worked on the SENSOR contract for almost 11 years; first as a subcontractor, and then later as an Exelis employee.  I would like to obtain a position in the private sector where I will use my other skills and knowledge."
good,Exelis days are long but full of challenges. There are lots of programs going on at the same time and alot of manager depend on your services to get the mission accomplish on time and accurate.
good,Great opportunity to work on advanced systems.  Current NASA budget climate however make job security very low.
good,"Working alone in main reception."
good,There are large disconnects between the corporate office and the world on the ground.  But overall a good company.
good,"I was with the company for over 2 years and loved it. The company took care of their own. However, with all the govt issues, as all contract companies are, they are having to draw down as the future is unknown."
good,"Great job,had a work reduction,would love to work with ITT again"
good,"I like this job,but also I like to try for the better future"
good,"Varied workload, not chained to a desk. I learned a lot about satellite fabrication. Management is top notch. Co-workers are rocket scientists. Hardest part of the job was the commute. Best part of the job was the people there, all good eggs."
good,"My typical day once I arrive on the floor.  First go to the production control meeting to ensure the management team is on the same page.  Second ensure all personnel know what they are going to do and that they have the things they need to be successful in their job.  Second review BOM’s, drawings etc. to ensure their accuracies.  If documentation isn’t accurate redlines the documentation in question and submit a request for change.  Once redlines are approve make changes to the BOM’s, drawings, procedures, travelers and train co-workers on the new process.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people and making sure we build a high quality functional product."
good,I have been there for 9 years. It was the best place to work at. The people were very helpful and kind. I just think it is a shame that they do not have the contracts to keep us all there. As of april 5th I will be laid off. I have no negative things to say about itt exilis. I enjoyed every moment that I was there.
good,"The environment was that we were a team, and encouraged willingness to do whatever was required to help the team reach our goals. It has been a very positive experience for me. The Managers were generally very supportive, and they and the Directors were on a first name basis with most people, as was the President/CEO. The Management encouraged training, and supported and rewarded those efforts. The company is now going through ""growing pains"", therefore a reduction in headcount is required as a result of the current economic times. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet deadlines with a skeleton crew. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with co-workers that seemed more like ""family"" than just coworkers. They were all a pleasure to work with from the bottom up! I did not see employees looked down upon because of their position. We all treated one another with respect, dignity, and concern for one another. It's been such a pleasure, and a privilege to work here."
good,Good company to work for. The pay and benifits are good. Health care provider is one of the best and you also get a bonus yearly. I would work for the again.
good, Led a team of 8 technicians
good,ITT Exelis was an exciting and challenging work environment that matched your skill sets with assignments.  It offered career advancement and educational opportunities
good,"A typical work-day was dealing with the inventory of weapons and various Sensitive items. The management and staff was very hard working and always willing to assist with anything work related. The hardest part of my day was having to identify and inventory all Sensitive items at the start and end of each day. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with accountability of all Sensitive items, which I take very seriously."
good,"High intensity level of interaction required on all levels from employees but well worth the effort. Excellent opportunities for advancement, personal development, team espirit is very high and great people to work with."
good,"My Management leads were beyond amazing and even all the way up to the Director level. I was always rewarded for a job well done. I was able to cross train and transfer departments, leading to knowledge growth. Group events were fun and morale boosting. Participated in community service."
good,too much upheave at upper management. no one communicated what truly needed to be done and caused issues with the need for change and the implementation of those changes that caused the stressful environment and furthered the lack of communication between departments
good,This was a good place to work. Fair days pay for a fair days work. It was too bad they moved the communication side of the business out of Fort Wayne when Harris took over.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company.  The job always kept me busy.  Each day had a new issue to deal with and it made the job exciting.  Security is a great field.
good,"A high level management system was applied to the exelise policies and administrations system."
good,A customer came into the warehouse and never been here before. I helped them out in a timely manner and they were very pleased with my service. The customer went on an wrote a thank you letter to the company.
good,I enjoy what I am doing and look forward to going in to work every day. Compensation and benefits are good. The cafeteria serves a wonderful breakfast.
good,"My goal is to continue working in areas as a security guard, security officer to security manager. Given that I have significant experience in administration, military and police forces I would welcome opportunities in these areas, as well as where my experience, knowledge and skills will have benefit for an employer."
good,"Perfect company . For the first time in the company and get dinner with the CEO . That is unbelievable. Very cool company ,respectful ,encourage the employees to  get training ."
good,Good company and exceptional technical staff. Working on an active military radar system was similar to repairing a diesel truck going down the highway at 80MPH but very challenging and rewarding.
good,"The workplace environment is not forgettable, very calm, enjoyable, wonderful people, great people."
good,"My Job with EXSELIS was a wonderful opportunity, it was a place where I could learn a lot, the vital things I learned was about the time management."
good,Too bad they sold out to Harris.....  One of the better companies I have worked for.....  I would recommend this company to a friend....
good,You will work in Kuwait and have to drive 45 minutes to work and home. The team in the ESH department are very helpful and friendly. You will go to your sites everyday (or as needed) to create a bond and understand that we all work together. The hardest part of the job is understand the different languages accents from different ethnicities but thats also the best part of your job to learn and grow.
good,People in my section were good and worked together very well. The supervisor had much experience and used it to help his personnel.
good,"Professionals.  from Management to the last person all "
good,"Working as a contractor is different from a regular employee, the vacations were great, management was easy to get along with, gave employees multiple opportunities to succeed."
good,Exelis has many offices but the Philadelphia office is very small which allows you to showcase your personal discipline and commitment to your work. If you accomplish assignments in a timely fashion with a high level of accuracy it can be the perfect place to develop a wonderful work/life balance.
good,"Good working environment."
good,"The largest forward deployed Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS-5) in the world. Troubleshooting faulty modules for Abrams Tanks and Bradley FVS using DSESTS.12 hour days, 6 days a week can put a strain on the body but the pay makes it worth it."
good,Overall Exelis is a Top Tier Corporation. The hardest part of the Job was the constant fluctuation of mission requirements pertaining to the Area we worked in.
good,"Although it was a short tenure working with ITT Exelis as Logistics Supervisor providing logistical support and coordinating with the vendors in accomplishing projects assignment to me in timely manner."
good,"ITT EXELIS,"
good,Solid company with many benefits and excellent pay. Overseas civilian deployment employment required so did not have a work/life balance.
good,Not a bad place to work.  This place is not bad.  It is not bad to work here.
good,This job is really great. Working with the military is my pleasure in saying thank you to the troops of the United States. I enjoy talking with them and their families. Making sure that their visit here is an experience so that they will always feel good about trusting us here at Exelis. I really enjoy customer service. 
good,I have worked with ITT over 9 years and I have learned and applied so many things from this company. Promotions are readily available depending on your work performance and Job Knowledge.
good,A great place to work. Theer is little upward mobility. Most leadership is hired in and not promoted up.
good,"very enjoyable work atmosphere, laid back when work load is low, and high pace when work load is high... I go to the gym during my lunch break which is VERY convenient, and i am allowed to eat at anytime through out the day so it works out. i work a lot of hours and the commute is longer than I'd like but all in all a great job... work 6 days a week and 13hrs a day, management is great always willing to help people better themselves... my co-workers are my best friends i love the people i work with... I have learned everything about military weapons and how to tear them all the way down repair clean and reassemble them... I have aquired a secret cleance granted by the government... however due to the budget cuts in our nations defense and gov employees, the contract i am on most likly will not be renewed for this company so i am looking for a new career"
good,"The company strives for excellence and pushes their employee’s to think the same of themselves and for the mission. I appreciate the opportunity to interact with individuals from all backgrounds, ethnicities and cultures."
good,A typical day at work consist of thanking the man above for waking me up then heading to work for the next 12 hours or 7am to 7:45pm including 45 minutes for lunch and two 15 minute breaks. I've learned AWRDS since I been on ground which is ruffly 6 months starting March 28th 2012. Management is really helpful when needed. my co-workers are awesome. Not really a hardest part of the job because I learn how to meneuver obstacles at times and last thing what I most enjoy about my job is team work which if you ask questions or have a plan of action it get heard.
good,I have only been here for a couple of months but I have already learned a lot and made some friends. The management has been very helpful considering I didn't get any job training when I started. They are also very understanding when it comes to family things.
good,Chance for advancement if you want to work hard and willing to do what it takes.
good,the weather is hard and the work is hard too but went you give back the the military it is worth it
good,Easy going group with the abilities to get things done. Typical day include working on legacy software and communicating with the users about what they wanted to be improved. Learned volumes about debugging and OS architecture.

good,Everyone is so helpful and willingly offers assistance and answers questions you might have as a new employee.
good,"Good company to work for.  Management wasn't bad, they weren't all that great.  The were just okay."
good,"Overall, the job was satisfying. The various types of equipment worked on allowed for challenging circumstances, with virtually no boredom from continual same jobs time and again. Each job had it's own special requirements, and continuously challenged an experienced mechanic. I was able to further my personal knowledge on many different types of equipment. I was fortunate to have a good bunch of fellow mechanics, and we all worked together when figuring out troublesome issues. The hardest part was the constant issues with the inspectors and their unwillingness to accept what a technician told them in regards to the need for additional parts, or the fact that they mis-diagnosed a problem. Also their incomplete knowledge of all the various types of equipment that we took in for repairs. Management was very weak and non supportive of the people actually performing the repairs. The best part of the job, would be the work week. 5 days a week, Monday through Friday, and being it was a government contract, all the paid holidays."
good,Everyone has different opinions and experiences while employed with this company and fortunately I've been blessed to have been surrounded by good leaders that paved the way for me. I have no major complaints or nothing of significance to present at this time. Exelis has been good to me and my family and that says a lot.
good,My office/program was staffed with friendly and highly knowledgeable people. We all pitched in to help in areas that needed attention. Very little micro management with plenty of leeway for work/life balance.
good,Productive workplace. Cannot elaborate due to security reasons.
good,"I am the Executive to the president and he expects top performance, but does not micro-manage. The job gets done, on time every time and correct. The Sr. Leadership Team rarely have to ask to get things done, they are already complete before they think about the next step. A great Executive Assistant will provide the background and work, so everything is ""seamless"". I enjoy the hours, employees both Sr. Leadership and Production folks. It has a ""family"" atmosphere even though we are part of a larger company."
good,"I enjoyed working with cross functional teams and other departments to get the job done, benefiting the company as a whole as well as my own department. I worked with good people of all age groups and ethnicity."

good,Maintain and update inventory records
good,medium size place of a big corporation company with family type that everyone could be known by everyone.
good,For the most part it is a good company to work for. I am just now being told there is a law suit againt the company for money we should be getting working overseas. I was shocked to find out that the company i work for would try and cheat its employees out of money.
good,"ITT Exelis is a good company to work for that had great opportunities for advancement. With that said, you have to be self motivated in order to advance. During down time most locations are OK with you studying for certification tests as long as there is no work waiting to be done. The pay is good, although not as good as many of the other companies providing IT services in Afghanistan. The only downside is that there seems to be a bit of a disconnect in the management area. Items like hiring just enough peopl to create a 24 hour coverage environment, without the forethought that people are eventually going to go home on vacation or quit. Leaving a minimaly manned situation where management starts threatening to turn down employee vacations due to minimal manning."
good,Long hours and many days in a row but the work was rewarding and I never minded going to work. There was a lot of opportunity for advancement if you worked hard and followed the procedures in place.
good,Typical day talk with team and manager on direction of project and contact engineers on questions and then process my work for that day.

good,The Air Force is one of the better military branches in regards to living quarters and quality of life. I recommend the Air Force.
good,EXELIS was a dynamic company that had many product lines that I was associated with. They were forward looking and continually sought to expand the boundaries of their product lines. There was no such thing as a typical day. Each day was like a new adventure where both domestic and international customer requirements had to be addressed. The Integrated Product Team (IPT) worked tirelessly in pursuit of the contractual requirements.
good,Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part was couriering data to another destination off base. A typical day at work could be hectic meeting the demands of the customer.
good,Great job and environment. I really enjoyed helping the service members with the transportation of their household goods.

I attended weekly, sometimes daily meetings with higher ranking Command making HR data aware to them as well, as I was in charge of financials, awards, NCOERs, OERs and every HR status.  Before I ETSed, I trained two non-HR clerks the ins and outs of my daily job since I had no replacement, I created a book full of every action, detailed step by step, that they may come across and actions they will do daily."

The hardest part about my job is actually having to see the expressions on some of the soliders faces when they need a piece of furniture and we dont have it in at the warehouse at the time, and they have to wait until and order come in to get it. The most enjoyable time, is when you know you have done a great job, and your superiors acknowledge you in front of the whole company just like they did for me this year, being name the employee of the quarter and receiving an award."
good,I found my experience with DAV-Force to be excellent. The company is owned and operated by a small unit of individuals who can give their employees one on one assistance. Overall a great experience.

We would transport the Military for a week to and from scheduled appointments . I learned to drive at a much lower speed, to be very cautious for other drivers as well as personnel while participating in PT training.The hardest part of the job was working with our transmitter radios. Half of the time you could not get a signal to transmit or to receive any commands. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay rate."
