bad,"The owner treats him workers horrible. "
bad,"I get along with everyone, but i told my manager that i cant not work 3rd shift and she has gotten mad because i couldn't come in and i told her i cant work that many hours because of my medical and food stamps and she still trying to schedule me over and i cant do it. This is why i need a different job right away"
bad,Don't apply for this job if this gas station is even still open. You'll get written up just for not smiling at customers barking orders at you at 6am.
bad,Valero is not the company you want to work for if you are looking for more opportunities from your employer. The company draws in its employees with promises of high compensation but no guarantee for any raises. And the district manager is unprofessional and unfair to female employees of color.
bad,"Speed though the day enjoyed customer service cashier, keeping store stock but cause I didn't answer my phone on my day off they let me go I was feeling sick I tried to explain but she hung up on me."
bad,You had to litterly beg to get a day off.  They loved to belittle you and lecture you when you were doing your job and everyone else's too.  They would praise you for NOT doing your job.  Management was a bad joke
bad,Extremely paranoid  they are constantly watching you on the camera and over explain everything to you multiple times  Like you can’t comprehend simple instructions They will watch you on the cameras and then call you on the phone with an attitude asking you questions
bad,Working at Valero was horrible. Never could keep help because of it. We were fussed on daily. Never got a raise and never appreciated. Management is poor and the people you work with aren’t the best either. They never do drug screens and they obviously need to
bad,"Started out good, worked great with everyone. Got sick and even with a dr's note I was wrote up. DM was notified and SM cut my hours and put me on swing shift (got off at 6 am then had to go back at 2 pm the same afternoon). Basically tortured into quitting."
bad,"Average entry level job...     Not somewhere I would want to work toward a career at.    But if you need work, then it serves the purpose.  Customers are friendly."
bad,"Pay Sucks, And The Manager Is Just As Sucky (smyrna). You do ONE thing she doesn’t like, or if you dont cover for her, she’ll cut your hours to ONE day a week. No one can survive off of $8.75 with only getting one day a week. She’s extremely spiteful and a bitter old lady."
bad,"Overall, the managers were terrible. They both rarely remembered when you requested days off, scheduled during days when you couldn't work, and general lack of respect for some of their employees. Some employees had an obvious higher level of respect and care, and  others were obviously not the managers favorites. The one in specific had a knack for complaining that everyone was in her business but always came into the store and basically announced all of her personal life to employees. I gave this one star because it wouldn't let me give it anything less. The job itself was easy and manageable, it was just the managers and some of the coworkers."
bad,"if you got good in with the some coworkers they would help you out. some coworkers wouldnt help, you an you would be doing your work and their work too."
bad,Poor work environment. no perks or benefits. little advancement opportunity. employee retention not even a minor priority. You are either in favor or out of a job
bad,"You work with customers, clean the whole store and stock the shelves. Make coffee, put tobacco products up and fill the cooler. The customers where overall nice except the drunk demanding ones."
bad,"Good place to work in between jobs, easy pace, responsibilities are reasonable and lots of assistance if you need. wonderful place to work for students and high school kids."
bad,Working there is like working at a slave plantation you can work a double at anytime if the overnight person don’t come in your stuck no growth with the company at all
bad,"i was the only female working for a foreigner and i was the only one expected to count my drawer, clean the store and parking lot and do other things the men didn't have to do because they were the same nationality as the owner."
bad,"the store is old and falling apart, plumbing is bad and leaks, co workers are nice. You dont get paid enough and they dont have enough people working to accommodate the amount of traffic"
bad,"Would not recomend this job for others. Very little pay with no benifits whatsoever. Only speaking on the Tuskegee, Alabama location specifically not all Valero."
bad,"pleople  are very  disrespecful"
bad,They changed my work schedule about 3 times a week before they got the right one. they do not give you a lot of hours. I was hired on full time and was only getting 12 hours a week.
bad,The expectations for new hires was unrealistic. every day I was criticized for not doing something right. Management was strict and overbearing. Don't work for Valero.
bad,I did not like the manger she was annoying and i disliked the hours it was poor hours and communication she was not consistent and she got peoples personal life way to much
bad,"Management does not know how to schedule employees. They want you to get in and out within minutes of shift change even during the busiest times. They doc your hours without notice. I never know how many hrs a day I will work and cannot schedule any other daily activities because it constantly changes. I've had 1 day off per week for the last 3 weeks. Yet if I get anything above what is scheduled they take time off next shift without notice. The pay is 8 dollars an hr for which they expect you to stock, change inside, outside trash. Floors, grill, bathrooms, run register, cooler, front and face. Etc. You would do better working fast food."
bad,Harassment from store management poor management from area management. Store management cut hours when you made mistakes or tried to stand up for yourself. Store management would also play favorites to the cashiers he liked.
bad,It was a fun job and I liked it but got fired for calling in sick my first time ever. If I did went in that day I would've gave everyone the flu. The hardest part was night shift. The easiest was the cleaning.
bad,"I enjoyed working at some of the locations. however, the last store I was at the store manager was racist and made it very uncomfortable to work with her."
bad,Enjoyed working here until it had changed hands. The vendors and customers and my co worker were great. I learn a lot that has help me in later jobs and will continue to help in jobs opportunities to come.
bad,"a day at my job was stressful from the get go its fast pace handling money dealing with lines of customers and moving fast. I learned to think quickly and keep calm in all situations , management is organized but very dehumanizing . the job culture  is everyone talks about others . the hardest part was doing a million things at once but the most enjoyable part of the job was when I got a paycheck we all need to pay bills"
bad,"i learned how to be a store manager.  "
bad,It was always conflict within the company. I did like the customers at the job however the management and the some of the co-workers were not up to par on work ethics.
bad,Valero is very weak about keeping workers. They expect you to work until your hands fall off because nobody shows. I wanted to take some schooling to further my career.
bad,This is a great first time job if you are looking for something easy. Just make sure that the bosses don't take you for granted. Don't expect to climb the latter at this location.
bad,I did not working here the managers where rude and ugly  they never treat  your with respect they treated you like your where no body .  You work very hard  for lest pay.  they want you to clean and attended the customers  and clean out side the gas pumps refill the windshield fluid
bad,"Management was very crooked and manipulative and training was sub par.   Job was to stressful and  never got any breaks. far to much work assigned to get done during shift than anyone could ever get done. "
bad,"This has to be the worst job I have ever had, the pace is very slow and working over night by myself is very dangerous and I did not like it at all, managers were always late for their shift which made my job more difficult."
bad,Just like I said cut throat back stabbing environment. Management is  poor. Treat their employees poorly. Training is lacking.Safety stinks too. Stay far away.
bad,"Not the best job theres alot that could make the job better from my perspective. I wouldnt mind doing it again because it's an easy job, other than that its no good"
bad,"This Valero gas station is owned by one person, No lunch, no break was ever given.  And there is no holiday pay or break, it is a gas station.  The owner does not care and is probably bipolar and has serious trust issues.  I wouldn't work there ever again.  And the pay is poor also. Dangerous area also."
bad,"Typical day was busy,busy,busy,which was the basis of the idea to bring in more patients,to a more pleasant atmosphere,spacious waiting area as well as exam rooms, being a recent graduate from tech school I learned the front office first hand experience and help from co-workers, management picked up where co-workers left off in certain criteria situations, one of the most  difficult parts of the job was to be able to translate messages from physicians to patients on telephone conversations, the most enjoyable partof the job was when the lead Physician was to come to the clinic with a smile on his face"
bad,"The manager was very unprofessional. Horrible wages. Overworked, no benefits, no climbing up career wise. I was there for almost 2 years and saw over 30 people come and go employee wise."
bad,"A typical day at work is when the gas pumps quit working and I learned how to maintain with everything in the store as far as putting up shelves, displays, stocking etc. The management was outstanding they made sure you was okay and did not need nothing as well as the co-worker to. The hardest part of the job is stocking the freezer because it is so very cold in there and the most enjoyable thing is face to face with the public."
bad,not a good job it fluctuates to much with the oil and gas industry i would not recommend anyone working there I feel that it is definitely a childish enviroment
bad,Not only does this position require you to work a lot but you must be flexible to move around. You learn a lot at this job. This job you learn to use your math skills to its fullest.
bad,My supervisor was crazy. My schedule was never once the same. The pay was terrible. 0 overtime. No respect from boss or other employees. Expected to do way too much.
bad,managers pick favorites to advance as management while csrs who have been employed for a longer period of time do not advance
bad,"When I first started, I was already told that my job would be terminated if I did not pass certain training requirements. Luckily, I did pass. But throughout my time there, the manager was incompetent and lashed out on his employees daily with rude notes and verbal threats. I ended up voluntarily quitting after finding employment through a staffing agency. I would recommend working anywhere else but Valero."
bad,"I do not recommend this facility to anyone looking for a job. The local and corporate management is horrible. The employees are treated as though they do not matter and they know nothing."
bad,Worked for this company for two yrs got 1 raise and they treat there employees like there children
bad,"I worked there for 3 days, 4 hours first 2 days, 3 hours 3rd day, they called that being trained, have to take each customer and have them out of the store within 6 seconds, no matter what they purchase, including lottery tickets."
bad,the current employees have their job there because they make sure that any new person is fired for false info.
bad,"This store started out to being a good place to work at, the management was ok, the personell was nice, learned how to operate a cash register, nothing hard about the job at all"
bad,"Company makes about 65,000 the first three days of each month. And pulls in about 12,000 a day after but cannot pat there employees more than 10.50 ph."
bad,"I was there for about 4 years. When I started my pay was 7.25 and when I left I was making 8.50... I've been hurt many times on the job, I hurt my leg because someone left a tote in the middle of the floor and I was told it was my fault because I was picking up my pants, I had a bruise for 3 months. I pulled something in my leg because the trash was heavy cuz it hadn't been done during the day.. Therefore the trash had been sitting there for 16 hrs. When I had made an incident report about it.. I was told that I shouldn't have done it because it was heavy but if I didn't do it I would get into trouble, which I did either way.. Awful place to work at unless you have an awesome manager... Which I've had but they said the store was too political for him to stay there"
bad,"I ran the entire store from open to at least noon alone. Really don't have much to say ...Just moved needed a job to keep the rent paid."
bad,It was a hostile work environment because of some of the ladies having bad attitudes.
bad,"Very interesting place to work. I did love that it was right next to my house and then I could walk there if I absolutely needed to. It was a very slow store, so I appreciated that they let me work on my online classes while I was there"
bad,"Very poor leadership in the operations department. Immature management who sit around and bad mouth their subordinates. It’s also very rare to hear a sentence from management without a ton of curse words. Everybody always on edge thinking they’ll be fired unless they play golf and hang out with management. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other sites. Valero is a great company, just not Albert city until personnel changes."
bad,They all ways keep me under the bar so I couldn't get benefits. Hours anyway. They promised me full time on graveyard then I was training the new full time graveyard guy that's why I left valero.
bad,"They needed better training. They stressed all the employees out. They didn't even know how to do things when asked, how. Afterwards they were mad because it didn't work out."
bad,Good people person fun environment cashier check merchandise put away schedule flexiblefun work nice manager decent pay manager cool like being there great place good people ghyjkddght nice fun
bad,"Hardest part of the job was language barrier. "
bad,"I cannot speak for the relationship between management and employees at other facilities, but I can give my perspective of the Welcome, MN facility."
bad,I worked long hours. I learned how to pump gas and keep the customers happy. I worked alone most of the time so I didn't see much of my co-workers. the work was easy but the workplace wasn't too safe for someone who is handling money. There were no cameras.
bad,"Maintained a standard of professionalism and personal sales that set a leadership example for the sales staff. Responded to inquiries regarding the sales representative position and the business in general. Prepared and delivered advanced training workshops on such topics as personal selling, developing leads, closing the sale, communications skills, and time management"
bad,You work longer than 8 hours if they need you too or if someone calls in.   You have more than one task to do than being a cashier. The mangers basically depend on you to the run store
bad,"Management is the #1 problem. The culture is failing. Promotions are given out on the buddy system rather than on actual experience, hard work, or even ethical work practices. If you're good at bluffing, this may be the place for you. Make yourself look good by making others look bad and move up before anyone realizes that you never really knew what you were doing in the first place. Half of the refinery workforce is retiring in the next 5 years, the other half are desperately trying to find jobs anywhere else. This is not the place to maintain a long-term career. If you don't fit their profile and they can't use you like a puppet, they will find a way to get rid of you. "
bad,Most employees are treated badly.  Promotions are not based on merit or education or experience.  Many employees are kept on who do not have any work and management lacks backbone to do the right thing.
bad,worst job i ever had!!....the management is very unprofessional and uneducated. I will never consider working there again and all the other past employees they hired and fired within a months time would probably agree also.
bad,The management team i had at the last store i worked at for them is the reason i left. They were unsupportive of team members personal needs and took advantage of some team members with regards to scheduling.
bad,The management treated me good when I was the only employee.. I was running the store at night by myself for 3 months. Then she hired a lady that I trained and she made her assistant manager. then the assistant manager started talking to me crazy like yelling not asking for me to do something. I spoke to the main manager about this and she didn't do anything. so I quit.
bad,"I have really nothing to say about this company. I really liked all the people that came in. But managment was a little hard to deal with, four managers in my whole two years working doesnt seem very professional to me."
bad,"I love the actual job, and the responsibilities. I have learned a lot about the paperwork and Ohio Lottery. I dislike the pay rate, inconsistent hours and no chance of advancement, raises or insurance. To get more than 24 hours a week, you have to work in more than one of the 7 stores, ans get a separate paycheck from each one, as well as a separate W2 for each store you work in at the end of the year."
bad,I liked this job a lot just the environment was very racist and hostile my area manager was great but my store manager was ignorant and unreasonable always leaving people on there own my assistant manager got robbed and she didn't bother to show her compassion or any remorse to the situation you could say she really didn't care about anyone but herself. She was always getting in people's business and talking ugly and rude things about people. Just very ignorant.
bad,I have learned while working at Valero is that women should not work at night by themselves because there are too many possibilities to hurt or even killed.
bad,Store responsibilities vary from shifts Often during peak hours maintaining store appearance and preventing thefts were common duties. The surrounding community will affect your employment experience.
bad,"You had good, bad days & sometimes crazy days. Sometimes very slow gravy yards. The enjoyable was most of the time was customers   would make your day short and enjoyable. The holidays where something else, but good pay."
bad,"The job was great for anyone in need of a part-time or extra income.  "
bad,very good company to work for only don't pay enough to deal with what you have to deal with management wise is horrible...
bad,"It amazes me that corporate is fine with the extreme turnover due to the pitiful production manager. The plant manager and others are good guys, yet they allow the terrible management. Work here for a few months and you will become targeted and fired. The production manager admittedly enjoys firing people he simply dislikes. Unemployment money is nice and almost guaranteed with how they treat people here"
bad,"Working as a maintenance man for Valero in Lompoc was a terrible job experience because most of the equipment for the store was broken or breaking, and our schedules were made randomly. Our schedules would change almost every 3-4 days. I would not recommend working for Valero in Lompoc to anyone."
bad,"Working there was stressful, not so much due to the actual job but because of the management there currently at that location. I was not impressed by the high turnover rate there and how strict they were"
bad,"Poco respeto de trabajo mal pagado, te humillan, desastroso tema limpieza...."
bad,i worked there for a couple days and never even met the owner. they did not pay me for the days i worked there still and its been over two months trying to contact these people. they are extremely unprofessional and the coworkers did not care about their attitudes towards customers. i could go on and on. i would not recommend working for this company to my worst enemy.
bad,the work was a lot and the the pay was poor the overworked you at times I had to work double shift and never got paid for overtime.
bad,"All female staff was not all that great, daily getting false accused of this or that. Seams that right before anyone thats not the manager bestfriends have a issue come up a few months before their year mark. I would return under another manager and area manager."
bad,Cooking in the deli. Poor management. Unhappy working in that environment; prefer not to work there again.
bad,was flexible with hours while i attended college. trained you well and even the company paid to get the TABC alcohol seller certification. Pretty easy job.
bad,"I would not ever work for Valero again. They do not listen to employees, they do not advance from with in the company, they let employees work for to many hours and do not acknowledge the work they put in."
bad,"Don't get paid enough, plus it's hot in there, drinks were not cold Enough, not good training. Worked extra hours but always got paid the same. I think he was keeping my money"
bad,It was poor management if like or didn't like not on how your performance was. Saw things the manager did  now she is manager of 7-eleven of our old station and has not changed
bad,"I guess this job depends on what you like. I hated it. Especially working in the deli. It's so stressful. The coworkers and customers were awful. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. And if you work in the deli, especially as the lunch person, the morning people would leave their dishes for you to clean and you're their by yourself after 2pm to do everything."
bad,"I knew my coworkers very well, they were family friends of my significant other at the time. We got along, but when it came to scheduling and wanting to pick up more shifts or asking someone to cover, for me personally, it was always a problem. When I wanted hours, family was given the opportunity before anyone else. When someone wanted to call off, they could but when situation was reversed, I wouldn't have no choice but to go in."
bad,"This project was doomed due to Valero management. Valero dictated daily what could be done or not, so planning and being prepared was difficult. Each day was a struggle."
bad,"Valero could careless about it's employees, the only ones that do care is your store manager. And you were lucky if you had one that would work with you. I did...after she learned people skills, at which the time of hire she had none."
bad,"This job was just to get started and make a few bills. The hours were long and hard for little pay. I was required to work off the clock on a regular basis. Breaks were short, and I was in a bad part of town, often late at night."
bad,"Open store count registers,log in gas pumps and lotto machine.. make coffee and start drink machines.Wait on customers,stock cigarettes,cigars and etc.Take money,and make change for customers.run the lotto machine and scratch off pay outs,and stock cooler and shelf's in store."
bad,The management was the most unbearable part of being employed with this facility. I learned very little other than the daily front desk tasks and propane filling. I had very little co-worker whom I never saw for more than 10 minutes between each shift. The hardest part of the job was the incompetent management. The most enjoyable part of the job was free time to catch up on my studies and the regular customers.
bad,"overall rating the store equipment was junk everything broken and out of date they never fixed anything and they management sucked real bad. They never interviewed and gave anyone a chance they picked who they wanted to work there and that person never worked there long we could not keep help long. I couldn't even take vacation time owed to me cause we couldn't keep help there long enough trained and ready to do it on there own and then they would quit  I was always working days straight without a day off and pulled many doubles cause the boss would not answer the phone to call and let know that employees didn't show up to work.I ;learned how to run a store by myself.  I learned how to order merchandise and lottery, I learned how to do inventory from the all from the previous management not the present. I learned how to stock organize the cooler tobacco beer etc... I learned management is not always right even if they are the manager. The hardest part of was dealing with bias management there was not a team work effort it seemed like I was always fighting a loosing battle. the customer made my day."
bad,"River Dock operations was enjoyable, most of the co-workers fun to work with the job was physical, fast paced, 24 hours a day, dangerous and interesting."
bad,"For all the work they give you, for 9 hours a day and 6 days a week, they could pay you over 7 dollars an hour. How can anyone with bills and family to support live their life. Over worked and under paid."
bad,Don't work there. At that pictular store there were always different employees working the manager wasn't a very nice person and is she didn't like you for some reason made it hard for you at the store.  I advise her I was disabled and yet she ignored my disability   keep me working on lifting heavy items that after work I couldn't move. She continued to make work hard til.i quit
bad,"It was fine until the managers' son decided to take charge and replace me and a friend with 2 friends of his. As a condition of employment we had to sign our quiting papers when we signed on, so they wouldn't have to pay unemployment. Shady practices and i'm not sad that i don't work there anymore."
bad,My manager was rude. I didn't get proper training. I was made to do the managers work because he refused to help. The company tried to not pay me because I refuses to sign a write up I didn't agree with.
bad,"They would have you work 10-12 hours alone, and want you to stock all coolers and shelves, while cleaning and taking care of parking lot and customers."
bad,"I worked at two locations in Friendswood as a cashier, I loved both of the managers that I had and before working there for a year I was already working morning shifts, the only problem is the pay and the higher up, I feel that they don't really care much for the employees in the store and can be very rude. When I worked there the pay was terrible which is why I eventually found a new job, they have a high turnover rate and are constantly having to hire new people. The only reason I would go back here is for the store managers both of which no longer work at the Friendswood locations"
bad,Management was no used. There were never no good schedules. The boss will fire you if you didnt go in on a day you werent supposed to go but he wants you too cause someone didnt call in. Hardest part was being the only one working.
bad,"Maybe every location is different but the pay was not good and the bosses weren't always nice. not flexible with school or family. and very demanding of things that weren't in job title "" such as custodial work""."
bad,its a good workplace because you can interact with new people everyday .
bad,"The plant in Linden has very biased management. If you are not one of their ""favorites"", you will get poor yearly reviews and raises. Believe me, I saw it first hand. A lot of disgruntled employees there. Didnt matter how hard you worked, all that mattered was your relationship to management."
bad,"You must be a yes sir man and kiss their a** to advance with this company, otherwise they will find a way to get rid of you! They tell you that their employees are #1 but when it comes down to it, the company comes first."
bad,"The work itself is very standard for a gas station/convenience store; mostly comprised of aiding customers with their purchases and maintaining store inventory and cleanliness.  The management was frequently absent and there was no upward mobility, but the client base was vibrant and represented nearly every demographic Wichita, Kansas has to offer; making the over all work experience a fairly positive one."
bad,I really wasnt comfortable working there they do not have any communication skills and the pay wasnt great either for the things that go on up there and for the stuff u have to put up with
bad,To many changes with negative aditude and unable to keep employees I worked there for 9 years keeping customers happy and the store clean and we did work together very well before my boss was let go.
bad,"After doing all of the cleaning and going around the store making sure that everything is nice and neat, there are extremely long periods of time that the store is empty and quiet. There is only one person working in the store overnight and I come across a lot of rude people."
bad,es mas omenos se que nesesitas ser barbero con el manaller para que le caigas bien tienes que ser barbero con las companeras que son espasiales para el manaller y hay mucho favoritismo del manaller y con la los empleados que me llebaba bien se ret6iraron antes de que yo fuera retirado pero el manaller de esta tienda no ase bien su trabajo
bad,"It started off as a decent place to work. A job was better than no job. Over time it became more frustrating on how many tasks were not explained to the fullest by manager. Had figured out most things on my own, or by other employees. (Which a lot of time not all of us knew, being a short amount of workers.)"
bad,Typical day is testing samples and signing in chemical truck and watching over a computer that controls corn oil tanks. The job itself is great but it was terribly managed and unethical training and work disbursement. No real order in much. Training and managing of training was done by qualified workers but not qualified to train others. Co workers were decent.
bad,"very busy gas station off the interstate, management wasnt the best, worked alot of overtime due to bad scheduling, didnt see other co workers, was always on shift by my self."
bad,The managers were not following policies regarding privacy when it came to their employees. Posting note and comments to each other in the open for anyone can see.
bad,"I learned to be more patient of customers having a bad day."
bad,"A typical day here would be just a basic cashier plus maid service.  With all the cleaning and stocking that was required, there was certainly not enough in payment."
bad,"Arrive at work about 7am and empty daily safe drops, check both ATM's , wait on customers, check in vendors, do store inventory and place inventory order, stock inventory. I learned how to manage my time effectively, and how to keep my customers happy while completing my daily work load. I was Assistant Manager and had a lot of responsibilities and task through out my work day, the store Manager and Owner relied on me for support. Hardest part of my job was getting everything done as soon as possible. I enjoyed my customers the most."
bad,Everyone but the 1 mgr was great to work with. You always have to worry if the mgr is going to stab you in your back. We always tried to make our shift fun. Our regular customers were a joy to see everyday.
bad,Pay is alright but if needing a dependable job for a family then this job is not a good choice. Its a good job for kids out of high school or if a job is needed.
bad,"Become accustomed to being treated unfairly and as if you are of little or no value to the organization no matter how many sacrifices are made to sustain business operations.  This was the worst work experience I've experienced, but every location is not equal.  Maintain your will and know your worth because this local organization will test it more than this brief description will allow me to elaborate."
bad,"Management was extremely one sided with fairness and showed extreme favoritism towards other employees. Harley ever available for problem solving and left it up to the employees to ""figure out"""
bad,They dont pay you well. Even if it's a dangerous job. It wasn't a hard job. If they paid more better and provide better safety is probably have had stayed.
bad,"My time at valero was hard,they took advantage of me. They also didn't pay me for doing two jobs. I couldn't afford the insurance. The management was horrible,out of the two managers that were there at my time ,they both were bad. Its a corporation and all they care about is the bottom dollar you can make for them."
bad,No review or assistance  from management.  Pay is much lower than industry standards.  Local mgt just drifting; don't know what to think  of their lack of interest.
bad,"I really needed the money and it was one of the only jobs around my town, but they take advantage of you, but you can do everything they ask, and they will never be satisfied. You have to run the store by yourself in the time of night where there should be more than one person. Management is ok, but could be better."
bad,Management is horrible! Always a witch hunt even when no personnel did anything wrong. They have to have someone to blame for everything. Company vs. Union makes a very stressful work environment.
bad,You try to do your best  but there is no appreciation for your job ethics attendance or hard-working . No future career or any benefits. Very poor management
bad,"Valero management wants employees to put the ""job"" before everything else. Family doesn't matter...you are married to the refinery as far as they are concerned,"
bad,"Through out the day, once I arrive to work there is a lot to be done from stockings to cleaning to helping customers have a great experience. I learned a lot about fire hazard safety to how all the computers in the store work. There was nothing hard about the job. Maybe the most difficult were the employees who never take responsibility and blame others for their incompetence."
bad,"Management does not listen to experienced mid level supervisors concerning proposed plans and projects that could help eliminate wasting time and money on infeasible ideas,"
bad,My time spent here was great the customer base was growing and was very fun to interact with. the only thing i can say that didn't sit right with me was the way management did their job i couldn't get a raise or advancement because of the area manager. I was passed over for assistant manager position because they were looking for a female to take that role.
bad,i mostly worked alone as the main graveyard worker when my manager couldn't find anyone else to work those hours I was working 8hr shifts 7 days a week and wore on me quickly. I made sure to lock up after beer time and unlock them in the morning kept track of inventory aswell as kept it front stocked. made sure to keep store and restroom clean. all while maintaining good customer service
bad,"I work for a private company that was attach to Valero which was call The Industrial Company, my position was a fire watcher I made sure that no firer start while the welders where working. If any think would happen I would inform the supervisor."
bad,A typical day at work is cleaning mostly and being attentive to customers and store merchandise.
bad,"It was a great company to work for. However, there was a lack of team work, motivation, & rational managmemt. Located out in the country, managment rarely place tasks for employees, & instead would sit around on Facebook stalking employees, & watching footage to listen to conversations between either the staff, or employees & customers. When mngt got the heads up from other store that corp was due shortly, mngt would flip out, run around & scramble , getting employees to get store cleaned, stocked, forwarded, & up to par before corp arrived. Enjoyed the experience & met some great people, but when polotics at work interfear w/ your personal life & daily moods, I choose step back."
bad,"Every manager at Valero has an other above them. Every single manager, be they local, district, zone, area, or even higher, is NEVER satisfied with the amount of work done. Coworkers are constantly promised promotions so that they will assist in perpetuating the stress and insults. My store owner had been with the company for twenty-five years, and was still underpaid and mistreated daily."
bad,"The manager as well as the supervisor was very bias and prejudice with people of color. The supervisor had very little knowledge of the operation, when he would make an error both the supervisor and manager would find a way to blame an employee.In addition, I was a manager of a much larger company than Valero. An employee was asking me about FMLA and I was explaining the process to him. Both the manager and supervisor came over to listen what I was telling this employee. Neither of them knew the correct information. If there was a question about the operation you had both the manager and the supervisor never knew the answer, they would go to the lead employee for the answer. It was obvious they were embarrassed and threatened by experience, that they pulled me aside. The manager sat directly in front of me and the supervisor to my right. The supervisor pointed with his finger within two inches of my face and stated that I was not the supervisor and for me not to be talking to the other employees. The manager said the same thing and also related that I was being insubordinate. I asked him how and he told me that I hated my job and that I did not like it here. That was the furthest from the truth. There was only one thing that bothered me. There were a manager and supervisor who worked day shift Mon - Fri. There was need for only one of them to work days. There was no supervision at night and no supervision during the weekend, day or night. I made a copy of the picture that the security cameras caught of the supervisor putting his finger in my face and showed it to the manager,"
bad,I loved this job it was my sense of mind it gave me hope when I was sick I was able to still work and do my job it was my start to letting people know that kidney patients are not dead they still can live life
bad,"management was very poor, she had favorite coworkers. she was always mad and nothing you ever did was done the right way. she was always critiquing your work."
bad,A typical day at work was getting yelling at constantly and never doing anything right. It was a lot of work with barely any help and you had to do it perfect or you had to re do it.
bad,"Many people who work here who are not favorites do not get advancement or opportunities, lots of favoritism in many departments. The company says there is work/life balance, but not if you want to advance in your career, you need to be prepared to spend lots of time there and willing to do whatever it takes, even if it is not what the company preaches they are proud of."
bad,"We had a horrible manager. She would talk down to your quite often."
bad,Our plant manager retired. He was replaced with a young (under 30) production manager from a sister plant. He removed the production manager in less than a year. Replaced her with a shift supervisor from his old plant.  No room to move unless you move.
bad,The manager was good at working around school schedules and anything else. Quick paced and always something to do. Definitely had the chance to work with public.
bad,Valero could be a nice place to work depending on the department and team you are on. I was not a fan of the constant office politics.  I enjoyed most of the time I was there.
bad,Didn't pay according to what was expected of you.  Didn't have good teamwork. I only worked there  about 7-8 months. Not a job that   I would apply for again.
bad,"I had never worked as a cashier and I learned a lot but I realized this cashier was not for me, employee's were nice with the exception of one she was very rude in training and got frustrated with me."
bad,"company overnight needs more associates to assist customers, and Gas Station attendents, no relief for restroom breaks. enjoyed speaking to customers,"
bad,"They will get you in the door, than change their story after you have been there a while. Told me I would be automatic full time after 3 months. But human resources says that is not true any more they cahnged it about a year ago"
bad,"Valero expects salaried managers to work 80-90 hours per week. When I first went to work for Valero they were a good company. They allow area managers to yell at their employees, they allow favoritism, they wear their managers out and then get angry when they are exhausted from the hours they force them to work."
bad,First job. Friendly and appreciative manager. Taught me very much about customer service. Worked with me and my school schedule. Decent pay. I enjoyed it.
bad,"corrupt, unfair, and non professional. Management is never there, management hires family. Plus the take out time from your pay if you work 8 plus hours because they have no benefits."
bad,Sometime you just have to make the job work for you. Another time the job is just not for you. A job is a job and someone has to do it.
bad,Worse place to work at the management and assist management are all family and friends so if you don't fit their type then your out the first chance you they get someone to replace you.
bad,"Valero was overall an OK company to work for.  The hours were good, and the pay was what I had expected.  The only issue I had while working there was a staff member who did not follow cash handeling policy.  I did not feel that managment handled it in a good fashion."
bad,High worker turnover and poor compensation.  High turnover among supervisors.  Lack of respect from supervisors. Not staffed well during peak hours.
bad,"when i was there i barely saw the manager, we mostly worked by ourselves because not a lot of people worked in our area so we worked all the time. people expected us to be fast paced but we were stretched so thin it was very stressful especially if youre going to school like i was. so if you work there you have to be dedicated to it."
bad,"My job entailed mostly taking incoming calls for deliveries of oil for Domestic and Commercial Customers. My Co workers were very good team players and would help each other if they required assistance. I enjoy working in customer service as it gives me great satisfaction in assisting customer with any help or advice they need and they are happy at the end of the call. The hardest part of the job is in the winter when it is the busiest and there is a lot of deliveries on and the customer is ringing for times of the deliveries, unfortunately due to traffic accidents or delays with trucks breaking down, also the amount of deliveries that are on it takes longer for the driver to get to each customer so it is hard to pin point time of deliveries so we would get the driver to ring customer an hour before so the customer would not have to sit in all day awaiting their delivery. The job was very satisfactory. The team always worked in a relaxed but hard working atmosphere so customer would enjoy the sales experience when they spoke to each sales advisor"
bad,This job was temporary and I didn't care for it much. Never really many repeat customers and the people that worked there weren't really that spectacular either.
bad,"Reasonable pay, good benefits and 401K.  Local and corporate management alike, do everything they can to beat you down. The employees are blamed for managements poor decisions.  VERY HIGH TURNOVER, so you are always working short handed.  Management doesn't listen to the employees, moral is very low.  If you're not a YES MAN, or a PUPPET for management, you have a target on your back.  Management plays favorites!  Employees get in trouble, put on administrative leave and or fired for stupid little things, but management can break life saving rules and get away with it.  Women make less money even though they work just as hard if not harder than the men.  You could work there for years and not have a black mark on your record at all; but people who are hired after you, to do the same job you do, get paid the same or more than you get paid, and you have to train them in!  You have to work a 12 hour shift with barely a 3 minute bathroom break and you never get to eat your lunch away from your work station.  If there is a problem and you have questions on your weekend on shift and you need to call the production manager for assistance, he gets ticked off and hangs up on you.  Like I said Horrible Management!"
bad,"My day at work is fine, there are times when I have my ups and downs, but meeting new people is always good.  I'm looking for a place where I can grow ad make people happy. From my past I have learned if you treat people with respect they will respect you. Learning from this it shows me more responsibilities and how to respect everyone else. My goal is to make myself a better person ad respect my surroundings. To achieve this I must work harder for myself in order to meet my goal."
bad,"The management is no where near where is should be."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to run in and clean, fill cups, bag ice, stock cooler, and unclog a toilet right after clocking in because some of the workers would not do this. I received my Servsafe and TABC certificates. The management, in my opinion, are too lad back. Many of my previous co-workers here have been with this company for years and have stopped working as hard. They would push the work onto the new employees and two were fairly new and stole from the register. No, I didn't fit in. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the intoxicating customers. The most enjoyable part of the day, for me, was clocking out. Really. I have to be honest."
bad,"A typical day at work includes cashiering, stocking and cleaning. Management is great, very supportive and co-workers are easy going and fun. The hardest part of the job is working unconventional hours, especially if you have children. The most rewarding part is interacting with the customers. You get to know the regulars and some become friends, so you get to come to work and socialize, which is a perk."
bad,"i enjoyed working at valero and my ""regulars"" really made my day when they would come in"
bad,"Valero is an ok job, if you just want to get by in life. They promote the wrong people and the system automatically gives you the minimum raise. They don't appreciate the good workers, nor do they acknowledge their hard work; They rather accuse them of stealing, when the person they promoted was the theif. All of the higher positioned employees are all dirty. I would not reccommend this job to anyone."
bad,"I did not like working for this place, because they are clicky, and you can't get any where there."
bad,"Hard and fast-paced, but really enjoyable if you get along with the management. Freezers need to be restocked too often, and costumers can and will be rowdy."
bad,"Better cleanliness, communication, better morals, employees need to be more respectful or mind their own business. Managers and district managers were respectful and professional. But need improvement in how to have a well maintained facility.."
bad,"Although I loved the people I worked with, the management I was under was terrible. The executive director had their favorites and took care of those employees. My position was eliminated and I inquired about being transferred to other departments but was told I needed to apply like everyone else. Unfortunately, positions were not available. I was pretty much on my own. Jobs have been eliminated in the past and those employees were moved into other positions. I feel that I was treated unfairly and would have loved to stay but in another department."
bad,I was paid minimum wage even after working there for ten years because my managers never did their jobs correctly. Too many times I saw people get management position and let the power go to their head and begin mistreating people and abusing their power over others. Generally seemed like a hostile work environment. The customers usually treat you poorly despite the best service possible.
bad,This job was hard for family life due to the swing shifts of every two weeks changing from day to night shift. No family time due to having to sleep after working 12+ hrs a day.
bad,"Working with Valero is very fast paced but also very productive, I've learned how to be more productive with my time at the job. The hardest part about the job was closing the store alone at night because of the duties on just one person"
bad,This place was not great for me. They never had a set schedule. I was working day shifts then work night shifts and had to work holidays with having three kids.
bad,"Management was not manager material."
bad,"There is very little recognition from upper management."
bad,"Going to work knowing that you will end up dealing with difficult customers. Have to be willing to go in on days off. Most of the time work 6/7 days. Must be willing to mop, clean restrooms, and keep store clean."
bad,There is alot of turn over I have worked under 5 different managers in the last 4 and half years. Fast pace with not enough time in a day to get everything done at times. I usually work 4 hours by myself in the store so I stay busy so the day goes by fast. Every company has there own way to do things and every manager does the job different from the one before him.
bad,"I was lucky to work with the same manager my 2 years there. she even got promoted and took me with her. She's an excellent blend of getting the job done with no excuses and listening to the problem at hand. however, the upper management who managed the manager was a complete nightmare to everyone. I understand their job is hard considering they have multiple stores to look after but that's no excuse to set unrealistic standards and make your management team cry after you have left. the hardest part of leaving Valero was the team, we all helped each other out to ensure the store was well stocked and clean but with upper management being the way they were, I wasn't allowed to advance simply based on being a single mom."
bad,"Bad Management, over worked and under paid. Its definitely a place for a college student to work but not for one that has a family. No benefits n no time off with pay"
bad,"Is to stock ,cup,ice,coffee,straws,suga,24 packs of beer ect., to keep my customers happy and satisfied,i learned within a week to use complicated computers,and new equitment,my manager was real understanding about showing me was better then telling me ,co-workers we all worked as a team very dependable, the hardest part of this job was dealing with rude customers who dont belive in taxes, money being thrown at me was tough but i made it, I loved that I was in a part of houston where it was very busy.I had a chance to get to know new people everyday, and sam old customers every day was the best part"
bad,"they hire alot of foreign-staff and under-pay them in wage, compared to all of their comp."
bad,"Typical Information Tech environment, so much work to do, lots going on and many different environments to administrate.  Many different versions of software and databases."
bad,"Just because i'm always prepared I've never had a typical day at work, I kind of learned new things that I've never known before that's how it supposed to be, no? the management is great, basically, I don't really know the place culture if it does have on I know it's a nice one. There is never an hardest part on a job, sometimes is just the way you talk to people and the way they answer you, maybe you just work some different time of way that make you sure there is an hardest part on a job that you're not familiar or you don't like too. Just know it always going to be people or yourself. I have always enjoying work."
bad,They didn’t treat the workers fair at all. They would pick their favorites so where they would get every weekend off and if I wanted time off I would have to ask for someone to switch days with me and a lot of the other cashiers never wanted to do that.
bad,I was a cashier who would interact with each and every customer who walked in our store and also help them find items or help them if they needed assistance in the deli. this job was a friendly environment and great atmosphere
bad,"If you are not from the Texas City / La Marque area you are treated as a second class citizen and no promotion, Lot of office politics."
bad,"co workers are great to work with and management is very forthcoming in helping one learn to advance in the company. The job seems easy enough to someone on the outside, but there is stress with dealing with the public at times. Not any one person is the same and you do have to gauge people's moods. Some are happy some are not and can take their anger out on you. You just have to smile and try to make their experience as good for them as you can. The enjoyable part of the job is also the customers. Even if the angry customers can cause you stress, there is always those customers that can make you smile and have a pleasant work day. The thing I learned most out of working here is observe people closely. It is in my opinion very important. Be aware of what is going on outside as well inside."
bad,"Store I worked at management gave false incentives offering promotion and then gave it to someone else out of favoritism and unprofessional friendship. No lunch breaks, little pay."
bad,a typical day at work very hard  it was hard to learned co workers are hard to work with.
bad,"Prepare cash receipts for bank deposit; prepare daily cash reports and balance the cash drawer; reconcile cash, check, and credit card receipts daily, and investigate and resolve any out-of-balance problems. Lead and guide the work of cashiers; answer questions and resolve problems. Verify daily, cashier cash transfers. Kept periodic balance sheets of amounts and numbers of transactions. Handled high volume sales successfully. Greeted customers entering the store and helped them in finding their choice. Issued receipts, refunds, credits, and change due to customers. Processed merchandise returns and exchanges. Counted money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts were correct and that there was adequate change. Daily closed store properly and secured building."
bad,"Only worked one shutdown here for a few of months. Contractors weren't treated very well, though the pay was good."
bad,I was left to fend for myself when trying to work through low staff and no one else to work. I worked long hours with no overtime and no family time.  I almost missed the deployment of my son.
bad,The manager was a bit OCD with the way in which he wanted you to do things. Thats normally ok with me but this guy was to ocd about things. Really made me dislike the job.
bad,There was little show of a work/ life balance practice that was mentioned numerous times throughout my career.  There were sometimes multiple times a year where we would work 12-13 hour days up from 45 to 65 days with one day off every 14.
bad,Worked the cash register and pretty much was in charge of the entire store. Management was okay. Loved my co workers. Stressful at times but came with the territory.
bad,"Looking for a work place that offers/encourages opportunity to learn and room for growth. Good benefits a must, offers a healthy working environment fair and management. Challenging and a company that is willing to offer a bit of training If need be."
bad,"Over all it was a good experience, I got to interact with people on a daily basis, and I quite enjoyed it since I am a people person. Pretty good company."
bad,The owner of the business had no idea how to run a business. He would refuse to order new products that customers would request on a regular and consistent basis. He would also refuse to order products that we had sold out of making an effort to forcibly manipulate customers into purchasing similar products by not carrying in stock those they desired.
bad,"overall working here was a breeze , I meet alot of new people and made a lot of customers happy. I learned alot about working for a gas station and learning the system ,because it is alot different from a regular cash register job."
bad,My job is to maintain order in the store.
bad,"At this job you would have to be on your feet all day, no breaks, just restroom breaks. Ive learned how to deal with customers, how to assist in a fast paced way. Our manager was an awesome person, would worry and help us as much as possible. Our environment was different everyday due to new customers or frequent customers coming in. The hardest part would be the stealing and stocking heavy supplies, other then that i loved the experience and meeting new people."
good,"O.K. for a part-time job, but chances of advancement and support next to none."
good,"Valero was very stressful, not flexible at all,no chances of advancement,and poor management. It was frequently unorganized and slim chance of getting a raise. I appreciate the experience but for the location i worked at during that time i would not recommend."
good,This company does not pay enough or they do not give benefits to full time employees. This company wants to work you like a slave so the big bosses get there bonus each month.
good,"prep breakfast and lunch, stock,order,recieve merchandise.I have learned to be a good customer service rep. fun place to work.my customers are the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,"i live to meet people, and this jobs was a place of adventure. i learned how to just relaxe and understand society way of thinking."
good,"Just like any gas station you keep the store clean and help the customers. but the company will not appreciate this work, and intsead insist on putting your life on hold for the company."
good,"The location was okay. Had some great conversations with my customers. My goals was to have them smile from the time they walked in and laughing on the way out."
good,"worst job ever. they do not care for their employees, make you work every holiday regardless of seniority...favoritism,etc."
good,place closed due to the owner check kiting workd 16 hrs somedays cause they were to busy gambling out of state to come close store down
good,"The job was fine, but the pay is low and employees and management loved to gossip.  But on a positive note. The customers were fun to interact with and the work load wasn't too bad."
good,"I was a convenience store and gas service manager. the hours are terribly long and there is work that needs to be performed daily...days off are rare. Quality and loss are critical areas that need constant vigilance. Unfortunately, high paced convenience has a terrible attrition rate and it is hard to retain quality trained workers given less than full-time hours and minimum wages."
good,Poor management. Manager was hardly there. It wasnt the safest job. Working at a gas station with little security but a button to push hoping the police shows in time wasnt ideal. It was okay for a temporary job
good,"the job itself wasn't bad, clean the store stock the shelves. tend to customer needs.accounting for cash in drawers and handling monies. keeping  change safe accurate."
good,Not the best. Nothing more to say. Be careful in choosing this particular store to work at.
good,The company is great and the plant manager is a good guy but the production manager has a lot to learn. Staff is not developed properly. Only friends of the production manager will advance. Consistent turnover of employees but it's hard to tell if its management related or about the hours and rotating shifts. Remove the production manager and it might be a good place to work
good,Sometimes very slow paced. A lot of cleaning when slow. Weekends are very busy and you still have to clean on those days as well. Not as easy as expected out of a gas station. Still not hard though.
good,this place is a joke. the customers are so rude. they think they are better than you. think twice because you will be dealing with the general public.
good,"valero was not a friendly place to work when i was there. the manager was bias, but i didnt take offense, i was just quiet and did what i had to do. i learned that everything didnt need a reaction and that people arent always friendly. just remember why youre there and adjust."
good,"Expected to work long hours, overtime without pay. Staff and co-workers are very knowledgeable and helpful towards new employees. Very friendly. Mandatory volunteer (24 hours /year). Good wellness education program, quarterly prizes"
good,"A typical day at work would involve deli work such as wrapping sandwich's, making sure all salads were to date. Stocking which included drinks, groceries, as well as all front counter needs. Customer service, standing at the register and helping customers with what they needed to find or ringing them up. "
good,Not enough hours and does not care about employees. Co-workers where nice.A typical day count cigarettes count register. Assist customers. Stock cooler.
good,"Would be Handling peoples problems, and trying to fix them so the leave with a Smile on there face.  I always offer a word of encourage ment to my peers . and i am willing to listen.  The most enjoyable part of my job was making people happy,"
good,"The day always began by counting lots of counting first your register, then the lotto tickets, cigarettes, and various other things. Then stocking everything from the Icee lids to the candy on the shelf and the cooler . I learned how to balance myself out when faced with a large work load how to pace myself and provided customer service and be productive. Usually was alone accept on second shift .  Dealing with inebriated customers trying to buy alcohol past time was the hardest to deal with so very unpredictable . The best part of the job was seeing repeat customers ."
good,The only reason why I left this store was because they werent able to work with my hours when i was trying to work two jobs
good,Fast paced work environment with opportunity to advance. Pay is not comparable for the tasks they want you to accomplish in one single work day . Micro managed
good,"While the management was amazing, workers below them made the job a constant struggle and hassle filled experience preventing me from being able to complete my tasks and perform my best customer service"
good,Customers are always a plus loved every single one of them management  wasn’t too concerned with store cleanliness   Didn’t make sure employees did their daily duties.
good,"Productive always had something to do. Good coworkers poor management. Always on your feet up and moving. Stocking juices, sodas, waters, beer, etc. very productive. Wanted to get more hours."
good,Supervisor had issues.  She was constantly contradicting herself.  Cannot work for someone who tells you one thing and then denies it the next day. Employees were always tense and never knew how the supervisor was going to act.  Hard to keep harmony under those conditions.  The customer were great.  Daily routines were easy to deal with.
good,"Rude customers "
good,The costumers at the blach spring location will never let you have a dull moment. The costumers are routine costumers and the coworkers are also very chill and easy to get along.
good,Training is not good you are left to figure out how to fix problems with the equipment on your own  property upkeep is a  joke team work is non existent
good,"This company is always short handed, so they're always calling for you to come in and fill a shift. You deal with people all day long for various things and it's mostly regulars. I enjoyed the job but they did not do a checklist so many of the other workers would not do duties and if you asked them to split duties they would get rather upset. I'm one that can not be at my job without making sure all duties are done for next shift and I like communication and checklist from management.  Other than that I enjoyed all the customers. I looked forward to seeing all my regulars every day and those that would come in on a one-time basis."
good,"a lot of mistreatment from management"
good,If you can keep personal life and yourself out of your job your work ethics will reflect a positive shift for the day by day hours put in to the company. Many other employees strive on digging into co-workers personal lives.
good,"My job consisted of keeping the store stocked and organized. This included the hot foods, fridges, and the shelves both inside and outside. I learned cashiering, organization skills, and how to handle customers. I learned how to handle upset customers and cleaning. I also enjoyed meeting new people."
good,Overall this is a learning experience. This is the first time i have worked for someone of a different culture. It is a very challenging work environment.
good,"Well typically you walk in the  store. You say hi to your co-workers. Then you go to the back office and clock in. "
good,Worked register and cleaned and stocked the store. Learned how to do a cash register.
good,"Excellent customer service to meet customer's needs."
good,I did not like how managment let staff be late all the tim ei lost 5 babysitters due to the issue at hand. also some of thier managers are rude and hateful and think they can talk to employees how ever they want
good,Management was very unprofessional. Consistently scheduled full time hours for part time employess. Decent benefits.
good,not enough pay management was lazy and I t risk my life working at night
good,"Supervisiors are great. Production management sucks. Disconnected, self absorbed, totally unaware of operators life and doesn’t care. Be prepared to be under constant threat of losing your job. There is zero opportunity for advancement without obtaining a degree in engineering, business administration, or environmental studies. Company has excellent benefits but don’t expect a balance between work and family, switching from days to nights every two weeks takes a heavy toll on sleep and energy, even on your off days."
good,"Loved working there until the economy turned, they shut down operations then sold it to another company who only brought back  80% of the employees. hard to keep a job for all the jobs leaving."
good,I would stock when I first got in and then I would get my cashier ready for service and open the store and sell several products and talk to customers.
good,"Students like me find it difficult to work full time being enrolled in college. However, my employer at Valero has given me flexible working hours so that I will not have problem going to college even though I work full time."
good,"At times it can get a little stressful, being I am the only one working my shift, but it keeps my mind occupied, and I love to keep moving. Also, it’s fun to interact with new faces and make them feel welcome and ensure that their food is safe to were, and delicious."
good,"The workplace is very quick paced with customers which isn't bad however the management is very poor, lack of communication, harsh, and cruel at times. Overall I like my staff at valero however we are usually understaffed and expected to work the register, have presence in the store, and be in the back at the same time."
good,"It was poorly managed.  High turn over, employees were poorly trained and often left to work alone too soon after hiring.  Working long shifts alone on most days."
good,This Company offers great retirement and health benefits.  You will receive vacation an appropriate amount of vacation time.  It is a  safety oriented company.
good,"It's rough; requiring a special type of human to deal with that day in and day out. All day, you're stocking, merchandise, keeping the lady from letting her 3 year old pump gas, keeping people from dumping gas in the garbage, stopping the drunk guy from smoking at the pump, all the while greeting customers with a smile."
good,"I loved most of the customers and i liked working with the manager. The only thing that i really didn""t like about working there was not enough break time.  We were supposed to get three 10 minute breaks throughout the day, but i would only get two if i was lucky enough."
good,"Good place to work, fast paced, no benefits or opportunity for advamcement.  Came in early to prep and cook breakfast. Received truck deliveries and stocked. Took cash and credit card payments for goods sold. maintained clean work area."
good,Working at Valero was ok not a big job for experience or moving up. I had to wash cars and for each car I only got 2 dollars. Some days would be very slow where we wouldn't get no cars in.
good,"this work place had me to experience on how to handle different customers with different background of culture. satisfying customers was the fun part to do.the management wasn't good, had conflict between the owners.hardest part of this job was communication with customer because of language efficiency since most of the customers were non English speakers.not have that much with co-workers since i was working by myself till the next shift comes and replace me."
good,"A typical day at work was slow."
good,"worked late without any security, and not to mention I was all by my self till 12am."
good,My current coworkers are some of the best people I have ever worked with professionally and morally. The alternative fuel powerplant work has been interesting. The job definitely lacks the proper equipment to do the work safely and properly. Unfortunately the ownership and management does not hesitate to berate and belittle all employees on a regular basis. Chaos and disorganization can be counted on daily.
good,"I love working with the public,being apart of the community and giving back to the community.I wish there was room for advancement in my company but unfortunately it is not."
good,I love my job also the customer was wonderful the job pay very well you do get your hours store was very clean in relaxing the management was alright everybody have bad days
good,"A typical day would consist of putting our planning packages together, then inputting our plans into Primavera. Management was helpful with everyday activities. The hardest part of the job would be acclimating to new work requirements that seemed to change frequently. So overall I would say the most difficult part of the job was lack of communication. The most enjoyable par of the job would be the people that I've gotten to work with over the years."
good,The owners and manager are wonderful people to work for. They are very understanding and do their best to accommodate their employees and are very helpful in a time of need. I couldn’t ask for better people to work for.
good,"There are no lunch breaks, you have to eat standing up between customers, its very hard to change schedule, getting days off was hard, holidays are required"
good,"Well I would get there in the morning and have to start cleaning up the soda,coffee,n Slushy stations. Make sure the floors are cleaned ,dishes are done,and the hot food stand is loaded with hot dogs, hot sausage."
good,They want you to have a flexible schedule so they can use you as needed and they will. You might work several different positions but only get paid for one and they don't acknowledge all the hard work that you have done on their behalf without any extra pay or Training.
good,"I was tossed around between two locations before i relocated and i rarely knew who my actual boss was. One was kind but stern the other i rarely saw but was so mean. I felt that there was zero job security, and i rarely felt safe. all we had to protect us was a camera."
good,"it was a great store to work at and learn more about customer care, price change, inventory, and cleaning a store to good presentation for inspectors and food handling service persons."
good,It's a job that I am grateful for but the scheduling changes every week.  One day your work the night shift then you are asked to open up the store the next day.
good,"Your customers will be the best part of your day. The store manager I had at my particular store, was not that great, The assistant manager however, was great."
good,"This Valero doesn't exist anymore it was sold about five years ago currently a CHASE BANK in the city of El Monte CA,I'm only rating this specific location"
good,"Working in the Valero Corner Store kitchen was a good first job. I was making a decent amount to be able to pay for my education and other expenses, though the management needed work. There were several times where issues and changes were not communicated, which led to problems down the line due to misinformation and lack of communication. The hours were also very rigid and made scheduling difficult, as many shifts would interfere with my school schedule."
good,"this is a very fast paced environment, lots of hard work but you meet all types of people, the work hours are very long at times and late nights and almost every weekend"
good,Great benefits and close community. Seems to be going down hill in terms of quality care for employees. Mostly poor management and little to no growth opportunities.
good,Good place to work.  Management not personable and teamwork was not utilized.  I've had great managers at Valero that were always willing to help you grow in your career path. My last department I was not able to grow and was at the peak of my career path.  Overall a good life/work balance.
good,The job itself was great the management in place was unacceptable. Work distribution was uneven between employees. Unnecessary comments about shifts from manager. Very unprofessional manager who does not know exactly how to run a store or a team.
good,"Handling transactions, maintaining the roller grill, soda dispenser, restock store items, process daily paperwork, and keeping the store clean . How to organize and be quick on my feet. Management only gets worse as a go up as far as giving tasks and making decisions. Most of my co-workers was friendly and outgoing, some blame you on certain tasks not be done or having cash storage's. The hardest part of the job is make sure you don't have over the maximum amount of money in the register. Being able to take a break when your done with your daily tasks and you only dealing with customers."
good,we are just a number.  Able to be replaced at anytime no matter how hard we work.  They cause a lot of stress for the family.g
good,pay rate for graveyard does not meet with problematic customers for the area.
good,It was a good place to work and I liked my job..the problem came from unannounced schedual changes through out the week.the owner and manager where decent to work for and did like the other employees I worked with
good,Love the job just couldn’t keep help the money was good but you work for it some time  so had to open and clothe store but as a manager I Expecting that but I was working 100 to 140 hours sometime
good,"training was poor, ask way to much for not enough pay. no set breaks or lunch time. constantly on your feet. in 1 8 hour shift, which was more like a 10 hour shift because i came in early and didnt clock out until an hour after my shift was supposed to end, i wasnt able to even use that bathroom but 1 time and when i did i was rushed."
good,"but lack of all workers working as a team so one always had to pick up the slack for the rest, always dealing with trying to get good employees who will actually do the work there supposed to do, some get hired and will just stand there most of there shift, generally has alot of gossip and talk about coworkers so theres a type of drama thats present that is very unprofessional hardly any kind of real team work when your working on a team"
good,"Supervisors and Shift Supers are a nightmare to work with and impossible to please. Just a very toxic environment from my experience. My co-workers (other Valero operators) were great for the most part though. "
good,"It got me through, provided what I needed. If You have a family that requires any attention, this is not the job for you. They provide training and advancement opportunities."
good,First company job worked my way from the bottom to the top and ran jobs but worked with a bunch of back stabbing coworkers that were jealous of my achievements and success.
good,"really can't complain. It was a good job, but the benefits were only great if you were in Management.  The pay was based on the size of the store. If you wanted to start at a higher pay go to the bigger stores."
good,Depending on what your life balance is. if you have a family don't apply for you will have to cover each others vacations no real time off and miss a lot of family activities. if your single will be great for you.
good,I help customer's with pumping there gas making sure that outside area was clean stocking selling items changing gas prices.
good,I do the stores deposits and daily reports and upload onto the computer every morning. While running the register I count and stock cigarettes and lottery everyday. Three times a week I do orders and on the delivery days I scan in the products in a handheld and then upload into computer once the invoices are balanced. The hardest part of my job is lifting the heavy cases of drinks we get delivered. I enjoy my co-workers they are like family we all get along (most of the time). When we disagree we discuss our problems and work it out. I enjoy problems solving and ways to improve the business to make it more successful. Most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my regular customers and meeting new people.
good,"Its was okay, but at the same time it had its flaws, but its a Good company to work for if your considering it, they do give good hours and know how to work around your schedule. Its fun working with people of different background rather it be your Co-Workers or your Customers. the Hardest part of the job is keeping safe and it can be scary, especially working at night, by yourself, but for the most part its a good experience, It will make you strong, Believe Me."
good,"Moving up in this company takes forever, if it happens at all.  They will hire new or outside people before considering employees who actually know the store and customers.  The pay is too low for all the work they want you to do.  The customers are really nasty, they act like complete slobs.  The managers play favorites.  You can't disagree with them.  Gas station are high risk for robberies.  It took them forever to get some kind of patrol and it's only Thursday to Saturday.  The hours are some what flexible.  Also, seniority means something to most manager."
good,The managers were unprofessional and there was next to no discipline for the employees
good,"I learned good lessons about maintaining a good attitude/work ethic when the going got tough.  i.e.  2nd shift person would call in sick and no one was available to cover it, so I had to work an 18 hour day."
good,Nothing stood out except the different people you get to meet on a daily basis. Ever-changing environment. Great place to work if you like dead-end jobs that run you ragged for mediocre pay.
good,"A typical work day consists of any tasks, and soething new was always thrown at you. I learned how to deal with different types of conflicts.Managment was very coforting and listened to what you had to say. My co-workers were always helpful and would quickly help resolve a conflict if you could not. The hardest part of the job i would have to say was trying to resolve the conflicts with people from out of state during fair time. "
good,"customer service ,solving proplems, ordering, orgenizing merchandise, inventory control, book keeping,"
good,Everyday dealing with the staff was great. Direct management was not trusting.  Learn new procedures from other staff members. Job was not hard.  Working on projects for Engineers was a good learning tool they were very helpful and explained the scope of work to you.  Working with the Maintenance and Operations groups were also a learning tool teach you processes and facilities management.
good,The store I was in was without a manager for quite a while and when we did get a manager they would be moved to another store. This wouldn't have been a problem if the pay raises were automatic and didn't have to be requested by a manager. I missed out on pay raises due to this issue.
good,It's a ok place to work at but was something for now until I find what I like doing which is taking care of people. Valero just isn't what I enjoy doing
good,"It was an easy job, it required memorization for cooking in the grill and preparations. Hardest part was to interact with customers. The most enjoyable part was the cleaning and preparations."
good,Supervisor Irrespetuoso ya que no tenia muchos conocimientos sobre manejo de personal
good,"I learned everything a store manager could do. As a assistant manager , I would show up when employees couldn't make in to work. I would handle all grocery orders, maintain store clean and make sure the closing balance was good, not over & not short. I would bring employees change, I handled large amounts of money. I would make sure all customers would be satisfied. Hardest part of working there was I had no social life, I had to be there when employees could make in & I had a huge responsibility by having an open schedule. working 60 hours or more a week."
good,management changed very often I had a new manager every few months. The turn over rate is very high and very few people care about the job. It's very hard to get notices for advancement and all managers are outside highers.
good,The store i worked at was not very good we went through cashiers like candy Manager never wanted to help out or never want us to call her for anything
good,"Management it atrocious and I'm glad we were bought out by Circle K since alot of the higher ups got let go or had to reapply for the job. Favouritism is a common aspect of this job but I like how it is. THe customers are mostly nice and my coworkers are great. But the problem lies with manager playing favourites or being petty if you call in but if one of their favourites are a no call no show no harm done. But god forbid you do the same. There are no breaks which I'm sure is probably illegal if you're doing a 10 hour shift. Managers are quick to complain and attempt to write up everyone for their own errors and are even quicker to complain even when you're working as hard as you are. I had five coworkers quit in the span of the month because they were tired of it. So, my job was secure but its clear from the beginning only the favourites move forward. Even my other coworker whom was doing the lotto, overnights, doing doubles, who went above and beyond expectations still got raked over the coals because it's never enough."
good,The turn over rate is very high because there's so much to do and not a lot help. While i was there management was always up and down in my store and it was hard to get any kind of flexibility or stability in our shifts.
good,"Great benefits - Fitness Center, Day Care, Postal Office, and Cafeteria.  "
good,or was done the first few years. end up working with old people that can't get anything done. all manual labor fell on my shoulders
good,"I have been with the company for a year and two months, and I have worked mostly nights. Thats a bad thing but lately I have tried to get other shifts and my manager is completely ignoring my requests. She accommodates everyone else request on the shift they want but when it comes to me I get the short end of the stick."
good,I absolutely hate management. Co-workers run over our boss. The hardest part about this job is doing everything on your own even when it gets busy.
good,"a lot of tasks. clean, fill merchandise and help cashier. small store good area lots of people good place. at times had a chance to go outside to help and clean with with task at hand"
good,On the job training and good benefits.  The hardest part of the job was the physical demands of heavy lifting and standing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was building customer and co-worker relationships.
good,I enjoy working with people and learn something new from them everyday. They make my day go better and faster and smoother.
good,"was always busy, learned how to operate a store, management was positive, I worked alone in store, was not really much that could be hard about job, mist enjoyable part was there always being something to do"
good,"I help customers at register, and bake everything for the bakery stock products also help with safe and closing the day. The hard part was working night shift, i enjoy helping customer."
good,I really enjoyed working here. My manager was a good one. I enjoyed working with the public and they always worked with my schedule.
good,this was a family owned business. Working at a gas station in a bad neighborhood is not an ideal job for anybody.
good,"A typical day at work for me is: working a cash register, closing the business day/opening a new business day, clean the entire store, stock the groceries, and prevent loss of products. I learned how to properly operate a cash register. I had no problem with management, had a decent cooperation with higher ups. My co-workers varied, from hard working to slackers. The hardest part of this job was keeping a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing the day down/opening new business day."
good,I have learned to run all of the 18-wheeler driver's cards and solve issues when problems popped up with the cards. One of the most enjoyable parts of the day was when customers I had become friends with came in and we would have engaging conversations.
good,"I learned about all the different aspects of Environmental, Health and Safety policies as they pertain to the ethanol industry.  I had the opportunity to receive extensive training and numerous federal regulations and apply that knowledge to our specific facility."
good,"I really enjoyed working at valero. It was a very interesting place to work at. It had great energy and you got a lot of help when you needed, the other coworkers were very helpful."
good,"Good for a starter to learn about the cash register, not a place to develop your technique. It is not a job to pay your bills because of the paycheque."
good,Valero would be a  great customer service job if they increased their pay. The overall experience was very fasted paced and the customers made my day. However making ends meet with low pay was challenging. If the pay increased so would the work ethic of your CSR's and the turnover rate would be depleted.
good,There's a lot of down time in between customers so you have to either stock the shelves or fill the ice machine until it's all full. Taking the trash out and turning the lights off were also part if the job.
good,was a fine place to work and learn a lot there was a nice staff the classes for the manger spot was very helpful the hours was good and if you needed off it was easy to do
good,"cashier, I did the register for the guest when they wanted gas or groceries. Stocked items and labeled items on the shelves. Went into coolers lifted boxes and other items."
good,"My role at valero was customer service, mainly i was a cashier. I had to make sure the store was stocked and clean, also make sure each an every custom was taken care of."
good,Valero believes in promoting from within. Most of its senior leadership came in as store associates and worked their way up. A great place to work and belong.
good,"This was just a small temporary job nothing serious."
good,"fast pace corner store, must have excellent customer service skills and enjoy the general public, long work days. usually one or two people per shift."
good,"The store I worked at was very stressful and long hours. The first day on job, the manager walked out and I worked over 12 hours before someone came in."
good,"I worked there part time as a second job for extra income, I couldn't have done it fulltime, not enough money "
good,Can grow with the company. Has been years since I have been there. So I really cannot say much on them. But I do know that yiu had the option to move up.
good,"the job was very stressful, with all the daily paperwork and inventory controls.  Valero mainly purchased Diamond Shamrock for its refineries and pile lines in Texas.  They did not have the knowledge to manage a truck stop.  It is nothing like a c-store self-serving gaslone station.  Very little support from the area manager and corporate office."
good,Valero was my first job when i was in college and the people there were absolutely great. they wanted to help and tech to make sure you understood the way of the working life.
good,"Run the register, do typical maintenance around the store. Stock the shelves and coolers. Cleaned restrooms as needed and unloaded inventory from venders."
good,Good intro job for someone who's never worked before. Typical gas station/convenience store job. Management always seems stressed and unhappy. No real opportunity for advancement unless someone quit or got fired.
good,Valero's was an ok job to hold me over till I found something more secure. The hours were inconsistent and unreliable.The manager was constantly yelling about something in a very unprofessional manner.
good,The management is amazing and super nice. The atmosphere is friendly and eat to work in. I would recommend anyone to work here. Not to mention you meet new people constantly.
good,it was a nice place to work at. nice experience over all. great people. nice customers. i was a cashier it was enjoyable and fun at the same time. dont regret.
good,"Position frequently in conflict with operational personnel"
good,Great company to work for. Managers were fair and always helped when needed. Valery is fast paced environment. It is a company where you can learn and grow With the company
good,Stayed busy with multiple responsibilities. Some coworkers difficult to work with. Customers overall were easy to deal with.Some aspects of the job were physically demanding.
good,"Units come together and work as teams. If you didn't know how to do a job, you were not singled out, the team would come together to help one another. Things were pretty smooth and fast-paced for a refinery."
good,it was an ok job it was easy just boring and on ur feet a lot had a lot of rules that was never explained and the manger was poor at his job I was better fitted to work there
good,"Was a good first job meet alot of different people while working here, was easy to get all the task down cause everyone helped one another with the training."
good,"Review is not a conspiracy, a team-building exercise, a role-playing game, or an experiment in collusion. It is not meant as a resource or training ground for those who would instill fear and misery in others. It does not exist to corrupt, but to expose corruption; it does not exist to tear down institutions, but to expose the ways in which institutions are torn down; it does not exist to hate, but is meant to expose hate in others. To expose these things is not evil. It is not a monolithic entity, nor the sum of its parts. Like-mindedness does not imply singularity of purpose; respect for the rights of one group does not imply disrespect for the rights of another. It is not intended to be predictable, consistent, or dull."
good,"there where time when it was stressful, the job required to much on the job. the days that u worked where flex able and added more stress to the worker and more stress was added by the customers"
good,I worked as a contractor at this Valero location. It was a good customer/supplier relationship. We were very closely integrated with the process engineering team.
good,"My time at Valero was interesting, It was a great job for the time being. For me it wasn't a long term career goal, but it served it's purpose. Pay isn't too good."
good,"The company is good but when you put a person in management that specks to you in an un fair way in"
good,I learned how to load and unload products from the trucks I learned how to also stock and receive products as well I loved the atmosphere of the store and the customers in it.
good,"Valero is a great company but my biggest issue is that they rather keep someone who will do the bare minimum or less just because they will not ask for promotions or pay raises. For the past 3 years, I have felt that my work is getting paid to others that basically just sit there, Not sure why they would protect these toxic individuals. They have not realized it is not cost effective to keep them there. "
good,"taking out the trash, cleaning restrooms, cleaning store, cleaning parking lot, stocking cooler, put out back stock, stocking the floor, checking truck, put up truck"
good,This was a decent job for a starting job.  I liked the people I worked with and my boss was awesome.  I still visit them from time to time.  The customers were interesting to say the least.
good,"I enjoyed the customer service part of this job as it is also a very busy store but very dangerous because of the location. I have had 3 different theft and once a gun was pointed at me to submit all the money in the cash register. Of course, he wasn't successful."
good,Was a great enviourment to work in. Had a good manager and crew. We All worked together to keep the store clean an Up to date. I got many awards for IDing miners and good customer service.  Loved working with the customers and co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed being a manger and working for the company, of course it wasn't always easy opening up the store and finding where the cash went. over all I liked the job but the pay wasn't worth it."
good,Working there was a great experience. I had so much to learn and they really worked with me. they even worked around my health issues. I had no idea there was so much to do.
good,I loved working there.  The people were great and it was a fun atmosphere. I loved the customers you get to know them personally and that was great.  I also had a wonderful boss she was always there when we needed  her.
good,Customer Service Put Up Truck Deliverys Fast Paced Handle Money and count money 8-10 hour shifts roating shift and work as a team
good,"Excellent Job Culture, good compensation and benefits."
good,Advancement is great but some days are ugh! The people are nice but scheduling is bad at times and organization could be alot better. Not really a bad place but things could be better.
good,Atypical day at  work would be me by yourself stocking the drinks and the shelves and taking care of all the customers that stopped by. I learned more responsibilities and how to get things done without the help of others. Management on the other hand was very poor. They liked to go behind your back to the higher up people and lie to them to cover their butts. There really wasn't a hard part to the job because I caught on pretty quickly. The most enjoyable part is that I got to work by myself.
good,I was assistant manager for the store.  I would count the deposit and go to the bank.  I would wait on customers and deal with any issues that might arise.
good,"I enjoyed all of the friendly customers. went at my own pace loved meeting the new people. work place was good and full of laughter. its always nice to make other smile and help the, enjoy the rest of their night."
good,"Pros"
good,"i enjoyed working here, but not everyone is easy to work with.  some of these girls don't want to work, therefore all they do is play on cell phones when they don't have any customers."
good,Learned how to make chicken and pizza. It was in the middle of no where so we had random people come in. I did however enjoy learning how to use the older type computer because at  that store he hasn't updated his system.
good,"I had a wonderful time working with the company, I've learned to deal with different inviduals attitude and personalities on a daily bases in which made me a better person."
good,Learned face to face customer service. Became the overnight regular. Many ups and many downs. Enjoyed the crew and management.
good,"You will have a lot of regular clients, will develop great communication skills. Offers you the opportunity to work in other areas around the city. It is fair if you want to move up to a management position."
good,"En esta empresa los 4 primeros años fueron buenos,pude aprender rapido y sin problemas,los ultimos 4 años fueron muy malos"
good,"Kept busy. Great co-workers. Flexible. Typical management with typical issues. In general, staff is under-paid for the work they provide."
good,"Gas Station attendant a detailed pleasant occupation."
good,"Processed customers to support customer satisfaction and sales growth Assisted in the daily posting of store reports, preparation of daily store deposit, and inventory management Assisted daily surveys and inventory management Provided support in the training and development of store staff"
good,"every thing was ok, the pay could've been better, the boss and the other employees were nice, I learned how to run a cash register"
good,"Multi-tasking is a skill that is required in this kind of job.  Management and the work environment are fair.  If you're the only clerk on the sales floor, the hardest part might be to take a break with all of the incoming customers but the most enjoyable part of the job are the free soda, coffee, slush, and cappuccino refills for employees."
good,"The job is fun, you meet a lot of different people. I learned how to handle customer complaints and people difficult to handle. My co-workers are friendly and we work as a team. The hardest part of my job are watching shoplifters but the enjoyable part is that I assist and serve my customers with a smile."
good,Management makes calculated decisions based on facts. Leadership makes sure funding is spent correctly and is smart on project types.
good,Not much to say here. Graveyard shift at a gas station. A lot of work with only two employees on the clock. The best part of working there was the rare occurrence where a customer needed help and I was able to help them.
good,"a typical day consist of tending to customers needs answering inbound calls and maintaining the stores cleanliness, and stocking and record keeping of products. I learned how to handle different types of people and personalities in a positive way. I learned how to operate a casah register and also count down a safe. My co-workers there were very nice and out going. the hardest part of the job would be cleaning up the really nasty messes. the most enjoyable would be being able to meet different people on a daily basis."
good,"constantly busy ,took customers in fast and took care of them just as fast so that they didn't have to wait."
good,its a place that can be fun but yet interesting at the same time which all depends on the different type of customers but pretty much all of my customers love me because i make their day by remaining the same person with a positive attitude on a day to day basis
good,Communication was open but there were few opportunities to work alongside coworkers or managers. Very small store with no designated area for employees. Staff usually work alone and would probably be safer working with a coworker.
good,I enjoyed working with the public and the steady pace. The people I worked with were nice and we got along well.
good,Great people to work with in operation. Some HR people not very helpful and don't care about people that has been there a lot. If you mistakenly did something wrong they still don't care.
good,Working at valero was not very challenging but was very fast past and kept you on your toes. The job to me didn't have very good management which was my reason for leaving. My co-workers and i would do everything from stocking to handling money to cooking food. I think really enjoyed the location on this job customers were always friendly and very understanding
good,"Everyday is a new day though we may have our same customer,we always need to welcome them with joy so that they still come back because they liked our service.With our co-workers i found them as my second family who help me with our work specially when our first day to work with them.Everyday is a learning when you great and  serve customer and how you handle when they complain your service  and your product either.And you have to understand first what they are complaining after they said everything about the complain it's your tern to do what you need to do as a worker,but still you have to put a smile to their face when they leave so that you know you fixed everything.and you feel happy you know that you served them in every good ways you can."
good,"long hours, did alot of inventory and worked overnight so the store had to be fully stocked"
good,"Working with many different types of customers and employees, makes for an exciting day at work."
good,"Most of the managers were great. Just that toward the end I had a new one that I just couldn't seem to get along with. The Benefits got better the further up in the company you got. They really push customer service and plus selling. Really enjoyed the customers and being able to learn and grow while there. A typical day was on your feet all day as a CSR behind the register or cleaning the drink bar or even stocking the shelf's. As a manager constantly checking everything making sure that it was in good shape and that you had the inventory to sell, along with stocking and doing the paperwork. You are consistently busy even on slow days there are things you can do, from cleaning to stocking."
good,Left for a better carrer oppertunity. I was fired after I gave my months notice
good,"Night Manager, closed store, handled safe drops, ran reports"
good,"i loved it here, but didnt like the way i was being treated. fun enviroment. loved the customers"
good,"I would start my day by doing my daily evening duties. I learned how to handle money and shut down a gas station. My management was hardly there so I was not able to actually get to know them, and same for my co-workers because I worked the night shift by myself. The hardest part of my job was keeping busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had to dip the gas tanks."
good,"I would prep and bake bakery items for store in morning. Close out the day on register and get all cashier paywork organized together. Daily duties where, cleaing bathrooms, changing out the trash inside and out, stocking cups, sodas, beer, put up groceries, sweaping floor inside and out, moping, greeting customers and cleaing windows inside and out. Counting register before and after shift. I had co-workers who were great and liked to help get things done. "
good,"fun place to work with great benefits, everyone gets along,no time to have breaks always taking care of customers "
good,Enjoyed working with the staff & management. Performed daily tasks routinely. 
good,It was nice to work at valero especially when you have great managers to work with
good,Traditional leadership approach and little potential to grow
good,"Start with making sure the coffee, fountain drink and roller grill areas are cleaned and stocked, get on register, clean up and stock store inside and outside help customers through out the day"
good,A lot of work.
good,•Provided customers with fast and friendly service at the sales counter.
good,"running cash register, helping customers, cleaning store, stalking store."
good,Company is no longer in business after being destroyed in Windsor CO. tornado.
good,"busy, cash report resets, stocking,cash, customer service, cleaning.I (have learner,)...... without the customer the doors would be closed ,customers are number 1,.......cash reports,training,audits,resets,controlling labor hours,merchandising,...great co-works,working togehter as a team,,,,,unhappy customers,,,,,,making customers happy,helping them get want they need and want."
good,Advancement within company if interest is shown in everyday duties of manangement
good,The job of ethanol operator is a great learning experience. Things can change day to day and it can really keep you on your toes. I've learned things from thermal dynamics to pump and motor maintenance. I've also gained life long friendships through the great co-workers at the job.
good,"customer service, handling money, manager hard to get along with manager. no breaks, i loved the everyday customers the most"
good,"Muy buen manager , una estacion que se mueve mucho bajo presion mucha vendedores"
good,"I would start my day at 5:30am. Would unlock the door and turn off the alarm and proceed to turn on the pumps to get the gas flowing and ready for customers. Then in would proceed to make a fresh batch of coffee for all the early customers that were heading to work, took daily inventory of cigs, cigars etc after that i would count my drawer and make sure i had the right amount of cash for the day. I learned how to run and open a gas station all by myself. Very friendly and respectful workplace culture. The hardest part of this job was breakaways when people would drive away with the pump hose still in their car. The most enjoyable part was the customers and my regulars that would come in everyday."
good,"Valero is a safety orientated facility. Thus, there is extensive training: both at hire, and continuing. Compensation and benefits package are above average."
good,It was an okay job.I enjoyed it. I made the best of it. I loved the customers..I will discuss all this in person. There is alot to this story. I would much rater talk in person..
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with the customers, you get to know your customers. what i learned was multi tasking, money handling skills, operate a money order machine, operate a lottery machine & operate a cash register. my manager was very professional. what i also loved about my job was the food the breakfast tacos are amazing."
good,Good place to work at in between jobs. Overall i had a great experience working at Valero and the opportunity to advance to an assistant manager is there for those who want to pursue it further.
good,Learned Tabacco and alcohol training and how to sell them responsibly typical day was easy just clean the whole inside of store and wipe down gas pumps change window washer fluid and stock all products
good,"A typical day includes cleaning the store, stocking the cooler, helping vendors with merchandizing their products, checking out customers, doing paperwork, and ordering merchandize.  I have learned a lot about managing people and organizing task for people to be doing during down time."
good,"Valero is a good company to get a job at, but I would not recommend as a career. I found the culture and work environment to be wasteful and sometimes hostile. Many coworkers were focused on their success and not the companies or their fellow co-workers. There were many opportunities to move around and some times move up. There are a lot of experienced employees in the company which proved a lot of learning opportunities for those who are new to the petroleum industry."
good,"Its a simple day to start you just clock in, sign into a register and checkout costumers. One thing I did learn was patients  for other people. Management was a bit lenient  which lead to stricter store policies, coworkers where nice people and easy to get along with since they knew how some people can be frustrating. Which brings me too my next point and its yes, costumers are sometimes lacking in common sense which can make something so simple as pumping gas too it being some kind of quantum conundrum. That the most enjoyable part of the job was restocking the fridge so you wouldn't have to deal with people all the time."
good,"Compensation and benefits are good. Management style is strict and fear-based. The work can be hard and dirty, but you will be proud of a job well done. Weather plays a big part in this type of occupation. The company will provide what you need."
good,"The most important thing I learned at Valero Cornerstore was that the connections you make with your customers will have a more of an impact on your store and your sales as a whole. People are the most vital part of any business, just like any gas station, or shopping center. Every now and then it's no fun dealing with the customers who want to be difficult, but remaining calm and polite is taught to be the appropriate response. The worst thing about working at the Cornerstore in my opinion was the fact its never a clear work day with scheduled breaks, everything you do from the moment you clock in is depended on the flow of customers, weather it be slow and easy or busy with a line reaching the door. Overall its a fair place to work and gain job experience."
good,"Typical day would be to count money for registers order and recieve supplies, itemize, stock shelves, coolers, keep facility clean. customer service."
good,The Company is great with plenty of chances to advance to higher positions such as assistant or manager.
good,typical day at work i have to finish all of the things that the first shift didnt do plus all of the things i have to do before the end of the shift. Management is not to good ive had alot of problems with that . My co workers they work whenever they want to and leave everything else for second shift which is the shift i work. the most enjoyable part of the day is when i get to go home.
good,its an ok place to work but too many hours with no many opportunities to attend school.There were only to cashiers which were a coworker and my slef
good,"Job is very set with guidelines and rules that govern the business well. Many of upper management (field) has no clue of the duties vs demand of customers in stores.... always seem to find and focus on ""attack mode"" with wrong items in the stores when visiting teams vs celebrating wins and outlining opportunities. Medical and general benefits are okay, but pay really doesn't match up. Oh... and forget about lunches or breaks."
good,"the customers are great, the work is mediocre.  It's not hard, but it is repetitive.  I feel lucky to have a job in this economy though."
good,I had only a evening shift work. but some times i have ever work over night.
good,"My typical day at work was a very fast working enviroment, attending with a good share of border patrol agents and military personel. I learned a handful of things from this job, such as, all the types of cigarettes brands, most alcohol that was sold, how to sell all of the Texas Lottery, and most of all how to handle the store when the manager was gone for the day. My manager was excellent, she worked with my schedulae when needed, and was very great at handling customer complaints in a proffessional manner. Most of my co-workers were hands-on, no need to tell them whats needs to be done hind of poeple. We were always alert for the harest part of our job, and that was the beer runners. We all worked together to give police officers the information needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was the regular costomers and others appreciation to how well we all worked and maintained a nice, fast and clean environment."
good,My typical work day is do what I have to do as far as taking care of customers and stocking and cleaning. I learned to be very patient with people and the manager as well. She was very hard on us and never hold back on what she had to say about us doing our job weather it was right or wrong. My co workers where great they where always smiling making you day alot better. The hardest part of the job was working by yourself making sure that the coffee was ready and everything was stocked and cleaned exspecully if you where by yourself you would get into trouble if the store was not looking good. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the angry customer smile by the time they left the store. It make me feel like I was doing something right
good,Everyday I learn something new from one of my superiors. Learning is one of life's joys and should be implemented on a daily basis.
good,"environment was great , hot sunny days just what to expect from south texas , safe environment and always a chance to advance if you like only cons was commuting every day for almost 5 hours"
good,"No raises.  No benefits.  Minimum wage.  No chance for improvement.  Must work Holiday's if it is your day."
good,"i really enjoyed the interaction with my fellow employees, great opportunity to get to meet new people but also build a bond with them as well, pay was descent and i loved the fast passe of the job"
good,I learned more on money handling and how to take care of the customers.I dealt with fuel deliveries and how to clean up spills from said deliveries. The customers are what made the job enjoyable
good,It was fun meeting new people and making customers happy. I enjoyed working with my employees and I made new friends while working here. Overall it was great
good,You would come in to work clock in to your register  & take customers until it was almost time for you to leave then you would have to start your side work
good,"Pulling and picking orders"
good,"I helped organize the scalehouse and other duties as assigned to set up the new plant. "
good,"Typical day of work is when the store is almost going to close, more customers came and buy what they want. I learned more about customer service, store policies, make the store clean. The management was ok. Didn't have problems with the management. My co-workers were really good helping me, they teached me how to handle the cash register, My hardest part of my job was also customer service, even more they want me to open the pump gas for them. What enjoys in Valero's, is that when there is no customer, I can have time to do the clean-up and fronting the store."
good,I was a a nice starting job when i first Moved to Texas in 2014. It help me get settled her in the state. The lack of advancement was my main setback plus the pay was low..
good,"Had to travel on emergency for 2 weeks but they asked me to quit and that i was guaranteed my job when i would return if i reapply. When i came back from my trip, they told me there were no positions available for me anymore."
good,"Hours were set and steady, management was decent, and I had plenty of overtime. The store was clean and kept. It was always cold inside."
good,"working at a gas station was not the best job I ever had, thing could get a little scary while working there and we deal with a lot of people that comes in with a different kind of attitude, I was able to manage everyone and treat everyone equally. It was a fun experience at some part of it."
good,Being able to run a crew and finish a job before it was scheduled to be complete. Guiding new hires through the process of learning about paint and sandblasting using the correct tools and knowledge.
good,"In the job you have to deal with many tasks a day. Working with customers, stocking, orders, money management, teamwork, sales, and cleaning."
good,"Good with scheduling, but not for a long term job. No diversity. Company does not want you to be your own person. This job is sometimes tough because customers are constantly mad because equiptment is always down."
good,"customers on demand, watching over the company, late long nights."
good,good place to work you can move up in the company if you try to. fast pace work place
good,"The people I worked with were amazing, however the project I was working on was a complete mess."
good,I loved working here. Just wish there were more opportunities at refineries.
good,"I would clock in through a very up to date software, than later I would recieve my instructions from the team leader which was different depending on who worked. Most of the time I was on the register which was very fun, You got to meet new people and experience a new environment every time."
good,It was a good experience. A person working here will meet a lot of unique characters also learn to multitask. Typically good for someone attending school or need something part time.
good,I liked the employees I worked with which made a typical day go quickly.
good,I liked this job as well. The running around is what eventually took a tole on me.
good,Overall is a good company to work for. If you are looking for management position this is the job for you. If you are a student this will be good for you also.
good,"is ok not abad place everything depends on the manager . some manager are really nice. Everything depends on the location too, and other than that os ok"
good,"Start with making sure the coffee, fountain drink and roller grill areas are cleaned and stocked, get on register, clean up and stock store inside and outside help customers through out the day"
good,Valero offered opportunities to move up within company. Provided tools to complete the task. Was very flexible.
good,"Clock in, count drawers then prepare to stock what needed to be stocked. help with lottery cards, megamillions, pick3,4,5s Powerball. I learned how to keep a smile and stay calm even when a customer is not happy and to try to calm the situations without getting mad myself. i'd say my manager was quite nice she always checked on me to see if I needed anything before she clocked out always was in a up beat mood. overall great management. the most enjoyable part of my day was seeing regular faces and remembering them having a short brief conversation."
good,"loved working here i got to meet alot of people, store was clean and liked my co workers. i learned alot dealing with people being a cashier."
good,"Great Place to work  Manager pays well and the hours are right, the customers are friendly and the staff is really fun to work with. i think the whole environment is a great."
good,"The job is very fast paced. But keeps you busy. Manager left alot to be desired, had favorites.but if i wouldn't have had a sciatic attack i probably would still be there"
good,"Its not the greatest job. Got replaced before was even fired. Not a place for you if you enjoy being a cashier. Mostly work alone though. Hours are pretty good, set times."
good,It's fine except if you don't do everything they tell you to while doing everything else in the store at the same time.
good,"I dont really have much to say about it. it wasn't that bad of a place to work.i went through two managers while i was there, the first one wan not very plensnt. the second one was okay."
good,I liked it except for managers. I liked working alone and dealing with money. I liked that I didn't have to mess with food and I could relax and be alone most of the time .
good,"Open draw, do lottery, open lottery, start coffee, lights. Then check bathrooms and take locks off outside. i would ring people out i  would stock. I learned how to do lottery, how to balance lottery, and draw. The hardest part of the just was when we were slow. I loved seeing my regulars everyday."
good,"It is a good place to work at. If a person is able to work in an fast paced environment and with good customer service, that is the good place to work."
good,"Its always fast paced."
good,Most days you are on your feet for 6 hours straight and there is a lot of customers to attend so you have to be fast paced and attentive to not make mistakes especially when dealing with money.
good,"My work  experience has been a learning and interesting experience over the years I have worked with the public and learned how to deal with co-workers. I have been assistant manager in the food industry, it is a challenging job to have because you have to make sure that everything gets done right. The hardest part of working in a public place and learn how to be polite and professional with the public, so no one gets offended and will always come back for more service. The most enjoyable part of my jobs have been that I have met a lot of people and made friends."
good,"Ejecutar trabajos muy complicados. Buena organización y buen entendimiento entre trabajadores,muy buen ambiente"
good,The company was not a easy place to work at. I worked overnight and had an overwhelming list of jobs to do. I was afraid working the night shift. Had to call police officers to the store many times. Management refused to move me to day shift. Hardest part of the job was stocking the cooler. I am 5 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. the lifting hurt my back. some cases of alcohol was 50 pounds. However I learned how to count quickly and multitask well.
good,Valero was an okay place to work some of the people were great to get along with management could have been a little better the manager would play favorites a lot and treat the others badly though
good,"Being a CSR is easy and enjoyable, but the pay and benefits are usually at or close to minimum wage, and the benefits are more expensive and less useful. As you get promoted, hourly managers can expect better pay and insurance, but will not not enjoy mandatory overtime or taking the blame for higher management's mistakes. Salaried managers will earn even higher salary and even better insurance, and job insecurity in case of excessive theft."
good,"Valero was a great job, however, the management wasn't very good at listening to complaints about harassment from senior employees. I was harassed by a male coworker on multiple occasions, and the management ignored my complaints. Great pay, great hours, very flexible."
good,The job was ok I just didn't like the fact that I had to stand behind a counter for 8 hours with no break. Also the work days were all mixed up and I had to work on holidays and that's a big issue for me since I have two small children now.
good,The training was fairly easy and I was able to work very effectively. People are generally friendly. There are conflict sometimes but I don't let it get to me.
good,I love to be taught and for my brain to be stimulated at all times so the more there is to learn the more eager I am to produce my all in every aspect.
good,"it was a fun work place  i had the ideal job five days a week 40  hours a week they worked with me while my children was in school . i have learned to do the ordering of what to order and what not to order for the up coming days . i was the head cook my co workers loved workin g with me this job was not hard to learn the hardest part would have been when a costumer that i saw on a daily schedule , they moved out of town or had passed away. the enjoyable part was when the costumers would make it a point to find me or come back to tell me what a wonderful job that i was doing"
good,"there is a store side and a deli side to valeros, i started in the deli, whenever the store side needed help i would come in on my days off and assist, also with the deli. i was quickly promoted to store side assisant manager, there i did paper work and learned to work with outside vendors in gaining new or used products. co-workers not the ones you'd enjoy to be around, i was focused on my work and my duties and that made it more enjoyable. hardest part of the job was keeping patientence whiloe under stree either with customer or a difficult task."
good,"I still work at Valero as a complex maintenance planner, I have been employed since August 31st 2015. Valero has great benifits and great pay for the most part"
good,Working at Valero had learned at great deal about food service. I learned a bunch of lessons.I would have loved to still be there but management wasnt good.But no regrets.Learn from all situations.6
good,I enjoyed the money it was great for the time that I was there.  It allowed me to be able to put gas in my car and pay for insurance which was a great deal to me since I had no other real responsibilities.
good,"The manager for the site I worked at was excellent, the day managers though were trying to change the company culture.  They worked my hours available and allowed movement to different positions in the store."
good,This job  was a contract job worked out of local union 74. The work/home balance is poor since most jobs are contract and thy work 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day.
good,It was an unprofessional workplace with bad management regarding the managers and not the higher up workers/owners. Being a stocker does not get enough pay or hours for the work you have to do in a freezing cold cooler.
good,"I had a great time working here. I met new people, learned how to deal with different people that I wasn't use to. Management was okay for the most part of it."
good,"I like working for Valero. They offer me a decent pay and my coworkers make day to day very enjoyable. My regular customers have become like family to me, and that is something special."
good,Cashier managed the schedules.learned a lot with paper work and how to work alone at a store. Had a great experience  taught myself to have a lot of great customer service skills and different ones as well.
good,"i grew up in this neighborhoos so i know almost everyone i see everyday. i have an extreme amount of high traffic volume everyday, its very fast paced. I work alone mostly and its presents a lot of obstacles and challenges for me. The hardest part of the job is that you cannot please everyone all the time. You just smile and keep going."
good,This is a great place to work. Very close group everyone treats you like your family. Endless opportunities to grow and expand your knowledge.
good,"Help customer with checkouts and questions, able to work alone and get what was needed done without other distractions"
good,Good work environment overall.Easy work just requires a lot of housekeeping and alertness. Down side is that you have to rely so heavily on coworkers to show up and do their part.
good,"a typical day at work is non-stop and very busy. I have learned a little of management and food production, cashier, depositing money. Management can be a little stressed and sometimes think that no one needs a break. My co-workers are great to work with and makes me like going to work everyday. The hardest part is being on my feet. The enjoyable part of my work is working with my co-worker."
good,"Working the cash register, stocking, communicating with the customers, and closing the store at night on my own."
good,meeting new people everyday and getting to know the regulars and making a customers day when giving them extra care on how they are doing and going the extra mile to smile makes a big difference with some people.
good,i have to say to much drama but it was a OK employment. the management could have been a little better but other then that i enjoyed working there. The customer service experience was great!
good,Valero set a platform for how costumer service should be done. Valero allowed me to work in my element when it came to costumer service. When i went to college they allowed me to transfer to a store that was close by my school and were very flexible.
good,"typical day at work is busy from open til close . from gas pumps to check out counter and waiting area for customers waiting on there cars to be washed and called out to have them retrieved."
good,"Not very difficult to work at, usually you just take care of customers, clean shelves, stock shelves, sweep and mop, and clean the restrooms, all basic tasks."
good,Valero is an excellent place to start your career and determine what you want in the future. The culture allows you to get exposure to many different topics in a short amount to time.
good,I would say the hardest part of my job was making sure every individual vendor deposit was recorded accurately. You didn't have any room for mistakes.
good,I would recommend working here as a pat-time job. However it is a bit difficult to work there full-time. Friendly people would love to work here.
good,"I learned that you must be able to adapt to whatever situation comes up in an over-night shift. "
good,"Management on the ball making sure employees are always working, and always have something to do. Excellent, focused co-workers, who are lively and cheerful. I learned that even when the work day is slow, there is always something that can be done, instead of standing around doing nothing. The hardest part of the job is having a line of 10+ customers alone."
good,i worked the cash register. They were cutting hours after only being opened for a month
good,"my day started at 10:00 p. m. i would come take over shift .  i wouldstart out checking inventory on supplies.  like refreshments in cooler and check the soda fountain area supply cups , lids, and straws.  i check grill out for food to be thrown away and put new stuff to cook. i also help customers what they needed and run cash register and make money drops into safe.  i at the end ofshift clean bathroom, store,  count cigarette packs and boxes.  i also go out and get stick readings from tanks on drive. occasionally we would get supply truck in."
good,Not a lot opportunity to grow and Any achievements made are quickly watered down
good,Valero are a highly successful U.S based manufacturer and marketer of petrochemical products. The corporation has grown extensively over last 12 years through acquisition. The management style is process light and dynamic with a focus for getting things done using the 80/20 rule. Very focused on community projects in U.S and are looking to shape same culture in UK. Flat organisation structure and use matrix management. Less bureaucratic than other Oil companies. Hard working workers rewarded through combination of salary and bonus. 
good,I loved the job in the beginning but then my hours got cut short.
good,What I have learned from working here is to take things as they come and not to rush anything. The people I have worked with here are very helpful and caring about all of their coworkers.
good,Mostly helping customers cleaning running register sometimes had to prepare food. Can be very busy by rush hour  but keep a cool head never usually had a manager on night shift.
good,it is a good place to work but sometimes schedule is a problem do to the dact i attend to school and sometimes job demands for the workers to work extra time.
good,"The work environment provided an easy introduction into the field of industrial experience. Typical workdays varied in intensity, but were overall manageable, and provided a decent starting point to build off."
good,"Nothing really hard, must be a people person, had a great time. Pay could have been better. Advancing with the company is fairly easy also. Was able to work at different store to pick hours up"
good,"I worked at a gas station and I had a good group of people to work with.  The store I was at was a fast paced store. There was a large amount of traffic going through there. There was also a Subway so it was always busy. My main job was the register. I had to keep my money straight and make sure everything stayed organized. When it wasn't busy I was stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors and bathrooms and making sure the pumps were clean and stocked. It was a fun place to work but I knew I needed something better than this job. I needed a higher paying job and something that challenges me. I think the hardest part of the job was just the amount of people that were going through there at any given time."
good,Good place to work with lots of challenges. Each day provides a new challenge ensuring no two days are the same. Strong safety culture which is comforting.
good,I enjoyed allocating the timesheets and working through any issues with and correcting the reconciliations.  My contractors were a joy to work with on a daily basis.
good,"Working at Valero varies from area to area. Ive worked at locations near schools, and locations near bars. Each very different in what is being asked of you as a worker. In one store, you may have enjoyable customers whom you may develop healthy relationships with. In another store you may encounter belligerent customers on substances, and may have to actively keep them from the store or from harming customers. The Benefits are incredible though. You are able to set up a 401k and there is room for advancement. It may take some time, but you are able to headway in this company."
good,Just come and do your best. Work hard and you will be noticed. Not much benefits from company but overall decent place to work. Not too stressful. Customer based workplace.
good,Not a bad a place to work for at all as long as you show initiative and the willingness to learn new things advancement happens quite quickly it all just depends on the individual.
good,Loved everyone that I worked with.  Work hard and show commitment to your team and to the store and you'll advance. Flexible hours that can work with your lifestyle.
good,"Very small store. It has an easy going pace and regular customers that act like friends. Typical workload: cashed out orders, cleaned the store, stocked groceries, and maintained pumps."
good,Management  that cares about company success and growth is important. At this location that does not occur; which has caused a loss in sales and customers within the 3 years I have been employed here. Many customers have stated to me if employees like myself were hired at this location than sales would increase also customers. It's important to always put customers first and suggestive sale that increases all benefits for everyone in sales in wages and profit for company. If I was management  my first priority would be educate employees the importance of good customer service and I would be available for customer complaints n suggestive comments they have .
good,"talk with fellow workers and see what was achieved on their shift. Log onto register and get yourself started for the day, start accessing what tasks need to be completed by end of shift. In between cashing out customers making sure coolers are stocked trash is taken out and accounts were balanced for the next shift to take over."
good,"Daily rounds keeping products hot and on spec making critical line ups loading trucks, off loading overweight trucks un loading rail cars after heating to 300 degres etc etc"
good,"Over the past eight years, the Port Arthur Refinery has allowed me to try different career paths.  I was able to get a lot of experience early on due to older engineers leaving the company."
good,"Valero is an all American company. American oil, collected and refined here in America. it is retail, so if you have worked retail before you know how it is. but I loved working with the customers, helping everyone from people who have never filled up with gas to those who are disable and need a little help."
good,"Good old boys club, management plays favorites and promotes who they favor. The work was challenging but i've noticed management allows the lazy employees to get away with not working and pile the work on the workers."
good,I enjoyed working for this company the management staff was very friendly and very helpfully with my training and I really enjoyed the fact that I was always paid on time.
good,Not a bad place to work just takes a very long time to get hired. Once hired you now get better training than when I was there. Some company policies are interpreted differently than what they actually say sometimes. Otherwise was not a bad place to work at.
good,"Cornerstore is a great company to work for depending on your location. Most managers and employees that I've worked with are extremely nice. The hourly rate is low, but you will make up for it with the hours youre working. Even if your home location cant give you 30-40 hours on a given week, other managers in the area will let you work at their store to make up for it. Free life insurance when you're hired, and you can sign up for health insurance after a year. Full time employees get a week of vacation time at the beginning of every calendar year, bonuses for winning area competitions to sell products, it's a great company to work for."
good,"There is a big difference between what they say they do and actually what they do. The rules apply to everyone else, except leadership. Leadership will not hesitate to selectively apply policy to impress and pass the buck to avoid corporate wrath."
good,A typical day at Valero includes a variety of things including selling gas stocking shelves taking invetory and reconciling accounts
good,"its a nice job for a student and its not hard to be honest, all you gotta do is stack the products and keep everything clean, management is very nice."

good,"It is easy to have work life balance at Valero because it has everything you need: Daycare, Gym, Cafeteria..."
good,go in at 4am make sandwiches. How to appreciate all types of different people. My manager was nice. Co-workers were all different.  When someone didnt have enough money for something they really needed. Best time was when someone else was nice enough to help.
good,Valero is a great company with great benefits.  It's a good environment that provides plenty of opportunity for growth and development.
good,This store was a great place to work at because you gained a lot of skills and met a lot of new people. I learned great communication skills. My coworkers were kind of slow so i picked up the slack. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers.
good,"Customer service , was a cashier, loved the manager and assistant manager that were there at the time, my co workers were an interesting group with various age differences that all got along great!"
good,"my truthful review is company offered great medical insurance and educational benefits, I wish the upper management that never worked in a store s setting would understand what managers go threw with sales and employees."
good,"A typical day for me started at nights. I worked third shift, my job was to clean and maintain the store while also helping, and checking out customers. Then later on in the night I would start preparation of breakfast and continue that till my shift ended."
good,i learned alot about great customer service and organizing. They taught me alot of leadership skills. i enjoyed meeting new contacts and learning the business side of running a gas station.

good,"steady customer flow"
good,"I love the customers more than anything, The coworkers had their days"

good,"My typical day of work was to make sure coolers were stocked at all times, making sure place was clean and pleasant for the customers. greeting customers with a smile and making sure that they got everything they came in for. The management there were pleasant to work with as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was stocking the top part of the coolers, most enjoyable part of the job was to make sure the customers were always satisfied."
good,"•                     Professionally assist every customer in a courteous and friendly manner"
good,"Very diverse project requirements with a consistent workload."
good,There's great teamwork and great management. Versatility.

good,"No time to fool around."
good,enjoyed working there for almost 20 years a great learning experience
good,assist customers with their needs. overachieve goals set on charity such as MDA and CMN by over 300% the first year at that store. Many kids benefit from these charities and my employees attain a free lunch or other items offered by company for exceeding goals.
good,"I worked full time 40 hrs per week. Getting up to go to work at Valero was exciting and I loved the experience. A typical day included just answering the phone and assisting customer with their needs. I met some very interesting people while employed there and some friendly. I learned how to be patient while the customer complained, knowing that the customer is always right. We always had an opportunity to help those less fortunate than we were. The hardest part of the job was working knowing there were not much opportunity for promotions and trying to stay fit because there were always something to eat."
good,A typical work day consisted of getting assigned a work area and monitoring your radio's for incoming trucks that needed to be loaded or off-loaded. If you worked nights you were assigned an area and here is where you loaded railcars from specific tanks.
good,"The pace was always changing. We had to keep busy even when there weren't any customers. We usually had a list, but when there wasn't anything left on the list we would try to come up with things to keep us busy. "
good,"Typical day at work would be assist the costumers, clean areas of the store, make sure everything was in order and where it was supposed to be. I learned great costumer service skills, handling money and train new cashiers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just working. Hardest part of the job was at the beginning when I had no idea what I was doing, but I learned very quick how to handle everything and so it became an awesome experience."
good,Management wasn't the greatest but other than that it was a fun job to have.
good,"Since I have a work ethic that is heavily based on the mantra, ""If I don't do it, no one else is going to"", and my co-workers (and even a manager) often found no problem abusing that, I was often forced to do a heavy load when stocking or cleaning, running back and forth as customers arrived and juggling several tasks at once to get it all done. It was a drain of my spirit, but I certainly enjoyed the challenge aspect of it, and it shaped my will quite a bit. However, since I was one of the very few with the willingness to work nights, there weren't any opportunities for sick days, and the way the schedule stressed me out, I just didn't feel like I could handle that kind of stress anymore. The experience certainly varies by store, but I was simply at the short end of the stick at an inopportune time and had to sever my relationship with the company."
good,This company was great for me to work for it took care of its employees
good,Thankless days in a foreign environment. Ownership had no concern for employees
good,"Assisted store managers through warehouse inventory, customer service, and cash-count distributions and responsible for product orders of Valero stock & inventory within the store. Directly collated product orders and updated kiosk computerized inventory. Maintained allocation of placement orders through kiosk system, call orders, and interoffice communication between several district stores and warehousing distributors."
good,"A typical day at work starts with verifying that I have the correct funds in the register and TACC. I am responsible for completing audits throughout the week, while being a team leader and helping out with whatever the manager is unable to complete during the business day. While being employeed with Valero I have learned many new things, from sticking the gas tanks to daily paper work and placing large grocery orders. The most rewarding part of my job is the interaction with our customers."
good,"When I first started with valero everyone was very nice, including the management. After working exceedingly hard I was promoted to Assistant Manager after only 7 months. I would have thought that with the promotion I would get a significant raise but was left wanting. While trying to pursue a management position I keep being looked over and my efforts un-noticed."
good,"Buen hambiente de trabajo, buenos encargados y buenos compañeros. Salario un poco bajo pero por lo demás todo bien."
good,"Working there wasn't stressful, days seemed short most of the time. Pay wasn't bad. Flexible hours made it easy considering I had just become a mom the month before."
good,"Working 3rd shift and being the only employee there while being a female as well  at a place that has robberies more than often I think that security should have been hired by the company, but other than that the employees treated you as family and it was a great experience."
good,"I really enjoyed this company, the management and team I worked with were absolutely amazing. Definitely a very busy, high paced job but that is the way I like to work!"

What have I learned while working at this job?  I have learned how important it is to provide customer service to everyone that walks into the store. What is my view on the management? The management has it's days. One day they are on top of there game and the next they could be running around really unorganized not knowing what to do or whats going on. What is the workplace culture like? The workplace culture is actually really diverse and it teaches me new things every now and then. What do I think the hardest part of the job is? I think the hardest part of the job would be checking in the inventory that gets delivered because they need everything to be accurate and done in such a little amount of time. What is the most enjoyable part of the job? The most enjoyable part of the job to me is being able to work with some pretty amazing people.
good,"My only observation is that career advancement is not very structured.  Once new vice president took over in 2014, job openings and advancement opportunities are now non-existent."
good,"Valero was a well managed, progressive company to work for. They were very forward looking and upgraded many units and plant systems. They were also good at logistics and employee support."
good,Starting at Valero was great considering this was my first step into retail customer service. The atmosphere is fast paced and friendly. Management was a struggle at first but adaptable. Physical labor is definitely a big part of the job.
good,It was a great company until it turned into Circle K so I am not entirely sure if I would work there again but if you want an easy job its nice to apply yo
good,I really enjoyed working at Valero for my team was always making work a better environment. If you are a happy and good worker then this is the job for you.
good,"this is a great place to enjoy time, or buy your snacks for the road. i would recommend it to anyone! the service is great, its a well paced, working business. thank you."
good,"the co-workers are nice down to earth people and i enjoy working here."
good,its ok i guess now im just typing stuff cause i really dont care to give much of an opinion. I liked the people i worked with and it was a chill job but was only temporary.
good,"In my short experience with this company i learn two things, you have to be so responsible, and the enviroment is decide to the kind of customers that visit the place."
good,"Production Opportunist, Geared to Promote Operations Management, Difficult Environment to Specialize in an Engineering  Skillset, Diverse Assignments Leads to Contractor Facilitation Role for Run and Maintain goal."
good,"Very old, set in its ways place of work."
good,I enjoyed working here very much. The downfall is we did not get any benefits. The owner seemed to do for others but not everyone. Overall this is a good business and the owner is a good person.
good,It was very nice experience to work in Valero. Valero is a big chain in America. I worked in Sacramento the capital of California state of USA. The staff of this organization was helping and co-operative.
good,Great place to get customer service experience. It is easy to promote from within the company but has a high turn over rate. Would recommend to anyone looking for a full time job while in school.
good,"The store was always well kept, cleaned and stocked, the employees were very helpful and worked good together. Mainly behind the store register for the most of the shift, frequently back and forth maintaining the store floor, while also tending to the stores customers coming and out of the store, greeting and assisting those who may of needed help finding something, or had questions."
good,"Day to day choirs were simple; cleaning, stocking, counting."
good,"Valero was a great company as well. Lots of upper management changes."
good,"not bad at all honestly, liked working there besides what happened right before i left, i learned how to work the register and stock merchandise. management was great, my co workers were very nice people. the hardest part was proboly when someone (a customer) came in messed up and i had to deal with that or say no i cant serve you. most enjoyable part was that i loved interacting with all the people and talking to them while i was doing my job."
good,"I will normal get to work around 4:30 in the morning, I find the quite time of the morning aloud me time to get my paper work and computer work done with out co-worker walking in and talking to me, ones the day start it doesn't take long before3:30 gets here to go home. I enjoy work with SAP and working in a refinery is still exciting and fast pace. The Management at Valero are about some of the best I ever worked with they seem to want to do thing correct the first time and don't mind spending the money to get it done right. I have learn that everyone has something good in them, so I try to find it and work towards their strength, which makes out day fun and we get more work done when everyone is having a good time. The hardest part of this job is learning all of the regulation you have with a refinery and all of the security that is in place, (what it takes for a contractor to do work inside the plant site). I enjoy the fast pace of this job and they aloud me to use my experience to get the project planned and executed in a timely manner"
good,"do provide great bonuses.  Great location,  building, lots of perks.  Advancement is tough to come by sometimes.  Very large company culture."
good,Busy day with customers. Learned a lot about gas pumps and bussiness market. Its fun to train the new employees. Lottery selling becomes hard when the power ball or mega is high. Seeing people winning is the best part of this place.
good,Fast food is usually always busy and keeps the time going by fast. It is exciting seeing new people and interacting with customers. My only complaint would have to be the lack of team work. you may be left to pick up someone else's slack. Management may get lazy as well sometimes.
good,"A typical day at work would be seeing at least 3 stores and working with the Store Manager and team on merchandising, audits, shrink goals, signage, etc."
good,My job is part time to full time and involves stocking all products which arrive and it is my responsibility to clean and maintain premises during and after the work day. The management and co-workers are polite and enjoyable to be around.
good,i learn with customer satisfaction plus how to handle business.
good,"I enjoyed my brief stay with Valero, the people were nice and thorough. My employment was unfortunately terminated before I could progress, but the indiscretion was my fault and I take responsibility. Typical day at work consisted of coming in, counting cigarettes, and conducting transactions. With the occasional break to clean or stock something. Management was kind and willing to work around everybody's schedule. Very easy job, just have to remember the little rules. My most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with. Long shifts without any breaks can be strenuous, but in my experience you will find that at any gas station/convenience store."
good,"Poor wages, too much responsibility and time for the compensation."
good,"Routinely began and end in a professional structured settlement where as co-workers and management met the demands of treasured customers. Was partaken to cash revenue, customer relations, Enjoyed the relationship built on friendly interactions to accomplish set demand. Adjust exports to demand of sales creating a valued profit to a successful goal. "
good,"Great job , close to home .but can barely pay Bill's after over ten years employment. I HAVE ONLY MOVED UP IN PAY THREE DOLLARS . I can't hardly pay my electric bill and keep food on the table."
good,"I left this job only because the family hated the location.  Otherwise, there was a lot of opportunity as they have problems keeping qualified people (most probably due to remote location).  The refinery is independent for small projects, but large projects are driven by headquarters.  There is a lot of scope for small improvement projects which can have a big impact."
good,Not enough pay for a family man but for a single man or female it is a good start in jobs. Good environment & fast paced job. Easy money. Fair management.
good,"just like in everything a work place is what you make it this one is a lot of fun most days "
good,"I enjoyed working at Valero. I loved my co-workers and for the most part, got along ith my boss. I established good relationships with my regular customers."
good,Can be very challenging at time but daily customers can make your days a lot better by just sharing a smile or a thank you with you very time you conversate
good,"it was a cool environment and my coworkers were nice to me."
good,"I was working swing shift- 2 days on, 2 days off, and worked every other weekend. Weekends off would swing to days/nights. 12 hour days. One person opposite of you. If they were sick or quit, you would cover their position. I did learn many things in the time I worked there. There wasn't vacation relief. Very hard to use vacation time. Training was excellent. Working was always good, because everyone knew their job expectations. There was always help available if needed. Very safety oriented. By the book. Classroom training, floor training. Wonderful learning experiences."
good,Being an operator pays out really well. Full benefits with extra choices. Terrible hours if you mind shift work. Missing out on a lot of personal stuff is normal. Job can be really demanding at times i.e turnarounds.
good,I recommend this job because you learn customer service skills daily and the pace of work is great. Being able to help and tend to customers needs is a great feeling of accomplishment. The company alone is a positive environment.
good,This was my first job and honestly it had a good staff and management. It was an amazing experience and I am glad to have gained it. Why not? Try it out.
good,From stocking to being  the cashier everyday time went by fast cause we were productive. Loved seeing the kids from school come in and see them get there slurpees
good,Valero is a alright job to work nice hours nice pay rate the managers and employees are kind and respectful easy job if you don't mind standing up all day and if you are a people's person most stores maintain a clean environment
good,It was a good job that taught me the in's and out of customer service and marketing. You can grow with the company if you choose to the staff was great.
good,"A typical work day would begin with me clocking in, counting my drawer to make sure the amount was correct. And on certain days of the week we would have ""grocery"" trucks come in. So on those days we would spend the majority of our free time stocking and organizing the new merchandise. Other days we made sure the inside and outside of our store was clean and maintained. And besides exchanging money for food and services from patrons I also answered and guided any customer questions/inquiries. At the end of my shift I would not only count down my cash drawer but also our safe and log that down for our management to review the following day. I would say my favorite part of my job at Valero was getting to know my customers on a personal basis and already knowing what they wanted."
good,"The customers were interesting to interact with, plus the environment was casual. The job itself was easy, with the only downfall being the turnover of management."
good,"When I first started working there, everyone welcomed me as family. They taught me what I needed to know, helped me when I asked for help. I got very attached to the customers, never had a problem with my co-workers until the old ones quit and the manager hired new ones. The new girls didn't help me with anything especially when it got very busy. They would sit in the back office and make me do everything by myself. Overall pretty fun, friendly, calm place to work. I would definitely work there again."
good,"Busy days almost every one, lots of stress. Learned all about the oil refining business. Management was okay. Co-workers were great for the most part. Hardest part of the job were the hours, 12 hour rotating shifts every week. Most enjoyable part of the job was realizing what we were accomplishing every day."
good,"fast pace workplace and team players."
good,Wonderful co-workers always there to help when needed. The hardest part of the job wasnt really anything except working in the freezer for long periods of time. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting my work done before my shift ended so i could just clean the outside and enjoy the customers company.
good,I enjoyed helping my fellow employees create a work schedule that will work around there own schedule and still fit times that support the store.  I also liked talking to a verity of people from different walks of life.
good,I got to learn a lot of things I've never knew before. I looked at it in a different perspective. Customers can be rude and straight ignorant sometimes but working at a gas station has taught me patience
good,"A typical day was selling merchandise with quality, along with becoming friends with a lot of the costumers. Was a pretty cool job."
good,A typical day at Valero is ringing up customers and making sure that the store is clean and product is stocked. The hardest part of the job is making sure you watch the people who steal.
good,This company was fun to work for. The management team was great. There just wasn't a lot of room for advancement. I loved interacting with customers face to face on a daily basis you get to know a lot of good people.
good,"Ideal location near major highways, UTSA, La Cantera shopping mall, and other major attractions. Right balance of country and city accessibility. Leon Creek trailway provides running, cycling, and walking trails."
good,It was really a lot of fun i worked with some really cool people and overall if I could do it again I would. I didn't so much like the 10-6 in the morning shift cause then i slept all day but it was okay. And also didn't like the management to much they weren't professional in certain situations.
good,"Loved Being a Cashier there,Worked Over Night was by myself,loved the customers,I Stocked the Selves,Cleaned and took care of Customers!! Management was less than stellar,employees late all the time,I Missed one day of Work in the 5 and Half Months I was There!!!"
good,Cashiering all day and stocking shelves with some cleaning. Not much to this position but pays the bills. Worked mostly by myself. I loved dealing with the customers and making them happy.
good,"Job started with the receiving of invoices in the mail and assigning a voucher number to each.  I also handled the entry of several labor time sheets for several of my vendors on a daily basis.  I handled every part of preparing invoices for payment.  This included the gathering of timesheets that had been entered for each invoice; getting all necessary approvals, having PO's increased if need be and the final payment of the invoice.  When finished all invoices would be logged into a storage box log that I created to where if need be we could always find that invoice if need during audits etc. then they would be sent to storage at our corporate office."
good,"-Head of the store while assistant/manager not present"
good,Came to work and had my process of what I had to do each day. I learned the steps of a cashier and the training process. My manager was very helpful and nice to work for. Lots of turn overs as far as co-workers. The hardest part was finding good people. My customers were the light of my shift.
good,Very friendly co-workers and management and customers. The most enjoyable part was getting to know all the regular customers.
good,Good company to work with but has  become to slow. I woud like tp texas were i am from.
good,"Working here I have met an abundance of diverse people. No break time given, but they were usually anytime between customers. Great for a first job I suppose."
good,working to give every customer a pleasant visit at the store. maintaining a clean well stocked store. what I have learned is how to trust other people to help maintain a productive environment. Management was very careful of our work/life balance and was very assisting with flexible scheduling. 
good,"A typical day working at Valero was mostly running the register and dealing with customers. I worked 8 to 10 hours a day, I learn how to deal with my different personalities and handle upset customers. I was also responsible for the stores appearance and keeping the product well organized so it was easier to take inventory. The management was understanding with my college schedule and gave me flexible hours to work due to school, but other then that there wasnt much management. We all had to know what needed to be done and did so. My co-workers were assertive like myself due to our independantness from the manager well developed a shift by shift communication to like the next employee know what and wasnt completed. The hardest part about the job was dealing with customer, I say that because people are mean at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was also the customers, I had many of customers come in a share stories and actually become regulars because of our stores excellent customer service."
good,Realitively a nice job the upper management lacks though. It is nice to have a monday through friday job with most weekends off. Never had a convenience store job that actually did that for the store managers.
good,A typical day at work included maintaining current customers and attracting new ones. I learned how to develop effective skills that assisted in meeting the demands of customer service. I developed a firm understanding of the company's products & services. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with a diverse group of individuals. I developed a good rapport with management and co-workers.
good,"Good environment, great customers, bad management. Needs more training."
good,The work environment was good all the guys in the shop worked together and the company had good benefits the company would furnished all the tools that you need to complete your job
good,"Not good for contractors as they do not give respect to IT contractors especially in BW area. Probably, this is the way the workforce have been groomed there."
good,The hardest part of my job is the lack of communication between units during troubleshooting situations. This also presented opportunities to explore the unit to gather better understandings of products and/or unit
good,It was a great learning experience. They taught me so much. Gave me great skills for the future and how to advance my career further then ever before.
good,A typical day consisted of figuring out problems from gas pumps and keeping customers happy. The thing i learned most with this job was not ot judge a book by its cover. The hardest part of the job was knowing how to react to people when they confront you in front of the whole store.
good,Having a regular schedule and being punctual was a must. Best Management ever. Enjoyed working there as a cashier and stocking beverages and other items in the freezers and coolers.
good,"Overall Valero is a good company to work for but they need to work some things out if they are to keep top talent. "
good,Customers were very rude but overall all our co-workers and management got along very well. We deal with a lot of stuff that's not dealing with our job
good,"vriendelijke mensen , leuke baan, vriendelijke cliënten, management was behulpzaam en gericht om te helpen."
good,load trucks railcars. Lots of dot paper work run heavy equipment .have rotating shifts we have set work load requirements load semi trailers primarily thru day via front end loader.
good,"I like my job here. It's a pretty easy-going job. I'd say it's much less demanding than racetrac and still pays okay. I do work at a bigger and newer store though if that makes a difference. If you're looking for an easy $9-10 an hour job full time or part time, give this place a try. FYI they are soon becoming Circle K."
good,"They have a great gym for employees and encourage employees working out and staying fit. Good culture, company believes in contributing to the city and support organizations."
good,"High paced and stressful work environment. All in all, the company does very well to compensate their employees with salary and benefits. Plenty of room to climb within company, and great work experience."
good,Good place to relax and have something to do while getting paid for going to school or having spare time. I enjoyed my time working for Valero. It was laid back and very enjoyable for the time I was there.
good,"12 hr day ,, 4 days on 4 days off,, 2000 miles from my family, work all holidays and after 22 years away from my family i am still away. people are good but a lot are cut throat for overtime. Work outside in the weather, bonus is offered each year."
good,"Amazing benefits and work/life balance is decent. CEO is great and there are many departments to work in. Workplace culture at Valero is interesting, you have a big group of millennials and baby boomers working together."
good,The culture at Valero was great. There was a lot of community involvement and I enjoyed that. I liked the people I worked with and my manager. But no advancement opportunities is why I left.
good,"This was a good part time job for me to make it through college. The management was good, nice, and helpful. Good place to work. Good owners that often visit the store."
good,"drove company car to daily job site(store), counted inventory, determinded store profit or loss with corporate figures, did the same with store monies and gas then reported to corporate office daily to turn in audit paperwork"
good,"I""ve gotten the privileged of working with the best process operators in my unit. Very knowledgeable group of people. There were always willing to help train newcomers. They treated fellow coworkers like family. I have learned that these operators run this units with pride."
good,Compensation is great as well as advancement opportunities. Management is lacking making the work environment rough at times. Should make no less than a 100k.
good,I enjoyed working at Valero only because of my customers. The owners of the gas station were bossy and hard to handle. I would have liked to have been taken seriously while working there instead of treated like a child.
good,Liked it but didn't cause I was in back by myself and no management came to make sure things were good. Just enjoyed it cause had regular customers.
good,a good company to learn the oil and gas operations field as someone new to the industry. they have a great 12 week basic operations program for new hires
good,the job itself was funny. interacting with people on the rides and most of my coworkers were cool. i didn't like the fact that we had to be stuck outside in the sun all day.
good,"I had an internship position that lasted a year, and I was able to learn a great deal in a such a short time period. It was a great experience, but my only qualm is that the salaries for full-time employees is not competitive versus other companies in the area."
good,"Should opportunity be presented do not hesitate, wonderful people to work with."
good,"The work environment has an overall professional atmosphere.  I've worked in the same department under the same management for fourteen years.  Although the overall job function has been the same, my roles have changed and expanded over time.  The focus has always remained consistent with supporting your customer from the office and hands on in the field.  I've worked in the Retail environment which has been dynamic in it's role.  Unfortunately Valero decided to spin off it's retail chain stores and focus on refining.  Since the spin, CST Brands was born and three years later, dissolved or merged with Couche-Tard, aka Circle K brand.  We'll see what lies ahead for its employees..."
good,over all good place to work is fast paste not good place if you have kids very time consuming job good when you need overtime cause if next shift doesn't show up guess what you have to work it that was the only thing I didn't like and that you have to work every holiday
good,"Open store, clean, handle cashiering.  Store busy 24 /7"
good,"You are in an environment where you have to multitask. You must have good communication skills, and patience. The work can be physically demanding. You must be able to handle all types of customers, including those that are angry.      This job requires you to clean, stock, handle cash, cook, and help customers all at the same time."
good,"I enjoyed working at Valero. I was a hard worker, and loved being a part of a team. I enjoyed meeting new customers, as well as keeping up with the regular customers. Unfortately, the Store I worked in kept having Managers transferring in and out which made it a little difficult. I Area Manager was a bit prejudiced, but she was strict with Company polices."
good,"Store manager was demoted and relocated after about a year of me working there. We were consistently short staffed and my work weeks were generally 60 hours+. Was promoted to Lead Cashier, on my way to assistant manager within 5 months. I voluntarily stepped down from the position after the store manager went on vacation for a week, leaving me in charge without proper training, and scheduled by myself the entire week. The assistant manager was constantly getting the ""slap on the wrist"" for showing up 1-3 hours late several times a week, and not working while on the clock. Things have since gotten 100% better with new management."
good,Got experience as a Key carrier and gained knowledge of being a supervisor. The hours were good and it was a nice environment to work in.
good,My days at work was never typical because it was always something to learn. My day or night usually consisting of me checking my oil levels on pumps and walking through the unit familiarizing myself with the sounds of the unit also checking for leaks. Taking pumps and exchangers out of service and tracing process lines was normal.
good,"I'd clock in get on my draw, made sure theirs enough money in my draw. Open my draw. Customer Service. Handled money from the customers. Answered any questions they had, got their products they asked for that was behind the counter, rang them up, told them thank you for coming have a good day/night. Cleaned behind the counter, cleaned the whole store, cleaned the products, dusted. Stocked the products, made sure the products were neat and in order, stocked the cooler, filled products. Made sure the store was up to date and safe for everybody who worked there and the customers. Close down the draw after counting the draw."
good,"My days were productive from when I clocked in until I left, the employees were always helpful. My manager at the time was understanding and found ways to finish all of our duties together as a group"
good,"a great place to work, had fun most of the time, had great co-workers. I learned a lot of patience,  hardest part of the job was mopping!!!!"
good,Good company to work for with great salary and benefits but a very dangerous environment and sometimes terribly long work hours.
good,"Nice and fun place, easy once you get to know how to do everything. I received my TABC through this company and my food handler as well. Managers are easy going and understand if you have any questions or concerns. Co-workers are easy to get along with. You keep and account for all monies collected. Its very nice to help people and get them the appliances they need. The hardest part to deal with is when there is a upset customer and when customers begin to fight/argue and it disrupts co-workers and customers."
good,"I learned how to accommodate many types of people working in the customer service field and retail. Managment was ok but not very kind to employees and or customers. My co-workers were great we worked as a team to do what Managment delegated. The hardest part of the job was being the work horse, but the best part of the job were my customers and the fact that my job would always be there as long as I was."
good,"This organization allowed for my independence and structure in completing tasks and assignments.  I learned how disseminate CAD file plans to the designated project engineer in order of importance.  Time-management skills allowed me to effectively retain, research, and update the company database to maintain an effective company library.  My co-workers praised me for my work efforts in getting the job done in a timey manner.  The hardest part was when my contract ended and the company had to down-size which is the reason for my separation,  The most enjoyable part of the job was the support that I received from permanent employees who supported my efforts in pursing college career advancement."
good,"Typical day at work is Busy all the time,  always on my feet, enjoyed working with my coworkers and enjoyed the benefits of working for an oil and gas company."
good,"good solid company, good benafits for manamet.. not so good for the CSR.."
good,A typical day i would clean the store restock all the items that are need and decide if we need more products for the store. My boss was my cousin but he still made work rough for me. the hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting but the most enjoyable part was getting free meals/lunch and spend time with my cousin.
good,It not a job I would personally make anyone work in. You just realize how much you want to better your life.
good,"Usually, this company has problems that are managable, but the big influence would be how so many people from different cultures actually work for this corporation. There are also many other people who are customers who also come from different cultures. The usual orders are kept on a log with shipment that comes in every other day during the week. And the managers are very knowledgable to what goals need to be accomplished."
good,My boss was a great person unfortunately employees tend to not show up on time for others to clock out. Miami is not much a a good place to find good responsible workers
good,"The hours can be rough, but the training and compensation you receive can make up for it.  Don't expect to just skate by, you will be required to learn and certify."
good,"The manager was a pleasant person to work with/for. I worked at several stores, to help when/where needed. Worked graveyard, 2 nights  a week, at home store."
good,company and owners were very good to me over the 6.5 years I worked there. Compensation was reviewed annually and raises were given accordingly. Fun team of employees to work with and manage.
good,"This is the refinery in 'Urban Cowboy'. It is an old refinery with regular incidents, know all your alarms and routes in any refinery but expect to see them all used here. From a scheduling standpoint you need to put a safety circumference on many operations. A great experience but not an easy one."
good,"Great company to work for but it has only recently begun to outline a career development program for full-time employees, especially for those who did not start as interns or co-ops."
good,I worked here because I needed a job I lasted because it was an adequate job at the time I was working there and I made good hours. It’s a really fast pace environment.
good,"Responsible for engineering, procurement, construction, turnaround planning & execution in an operating refinery environment. Provided technical support to refinery daily operations & maintenance. Prepared and executed the refinery capital budget plan and planned & executed refinery turnarounds. Workplace culture was safety & quality. The hardest part of the job was to provide technical support for daily operations and at the same time execute capital projects as part of the refinery capital budget, with limited resources. The most enjoyable part was knowledge & experience gained on all processing units in a modern & sophisticated fuels refinery."
good,Great company to work for.  Good Supervisory and working conditions.  Great benefits and high paced environment.  Would go back to work for them anytime.
good,"Good people to work with, good management, but for the size of this refinery they need a lot more people. One thing I don't like is they do not have a 9/80 schedule or a 4/10 schedule. Everyone has asked and a lot of people have left just for that."
good,they were a good stable employment   there was always opportunities to work more than your scheduled hours  They looked for csr s that wanted to move up with in the company
good,El ambiente de trabajo es agradable y adecuado para el buen funcionamiento de la oficina
good,Safety was and is job one at Valero. Each day began with a brief meeting plans and jobs discussed and communicated.  Learned a lot about DCS systems.  Hardest part of the job was trying to implement changes to improve plant productivity. This was largely due to a cumbersome management of change system.  Most enjoyable part of the job was learning the Distributive Control System(DCS) which is computer and program controlled.
good,"Nice starting point for unexperienced peopleto gain a foothold in the industry or customer service, and also retail services.................... Not much else other then be ready to work"
good,easy to advance with this company definitely a good company to get managerial experience with it is fast paced but can also be a very tiresome job for little pay
good,"A typical day at work was laid back, co-workers east to get along with. Management would pretty much leave you alone and let you do your job. excellent training in various refinery operations."
good,"Get to meet a lot new people such as regulars and a lot of locals.Keeps me busy and productive on the regular, MY co-workers and mangers are very nice and good people."
good,"clock in and count draw"
good,A typical day at Valero is pretty busy. Everyone is either getting off of work or just going in. Most people think that since we work at a gas station that its so easy but it takes a lot of hard work to keep it up and running as well as clean.
good,I used to work as a customer service representative. I also had to take care whole store by my self. I had to face and clean the store to keep it nice.
good,loved my crew and store. great benefits for mgmt. but not for employees.
good,"People focused culture with great benefits - gym, cafeteria, basketball courts, running trail. Ability to take on greater responsibility given initiative and proven work ethic."
good,"This is a type of job where if you are utilizing as your career it's not because you want to but that you got stuck and need to. There is no other initiative to work other than getting paid. I like my manager but the higher you get after that, the less they care about the employees. I started out working days and went onto management but was told I needed to step down since I had to call in due to not having a baby sitter one time. They then put me on the graveyard shift in order to full fill my full time status since a new member of management would be taking my previous schedule. There was no discussion of maybe a transfer to a different store or other schedule options, just one week was scheduled and stayed. Being able to schedule you where ever and whenever they want is really my only big issue, other than that its an ok place to work but I do get bored VERY easily. Working night shift, there isnt much to do, especially at a store that basically runs itself. Which, dont get me wrong, is very but very boring. They do have good health benefits and while youre in management, you get bonuses. Nothing much for the regular employees other than a paycheck and starting off, isnt much since they begin at minimum wage."
good,"A day's work consisted of mainly running the cash register and assisting guests at check-out. It was sometimes difficult when working alone to keep up with stocking products in the store and keeping things fresh when the store became busy. Valero offers plenty of training and teaches employees the importance of time-management and balancing work duties. All in all, you get to see a lot of people each day, which can make for a great experience."
good,"It is a fun friendly environment, however not enough room for advancement."
good,There was always something to do and the customers were friendly and polite. The manager was always concern about us and helping us if we needed anything. The hardest part of this job was being by yourself a night having to close up the store by yourself. I was happy to be closing the store at the end of the day because i got to go home to my family.
good,"I really enjoy the customers that I deal with everyday, I have made some great friends while working here. My boss is very nice and easy to talk too regarding personal issues and life in general. My co-workers are a blast we all have fun laughing and getting the job done. We all back each other up when needed or when someone needs to cover someone else's shift."
good,"Had a good time there. The people you meet are nice. Most of the co-workers was alright a few of them though seemed to be somewhat stuck up. You would stock the cooler, inventory, and clean up the store when no one was there. Change the trash out by the gas pumps"
good,It had descent pay and nice management and workers it was hard and descent work.
good,"Operate process equipment, Apply troubleshooting techniques to process problems. Exciting career but very little family time with shiftwork hours"
good,Buenas áreas buen ambiente laboral remuneración unnpoco alta
good,Just didn't feel safe anymore.  A customer came into the store without any ants or underwear on and walked behind the corner were I worked at it mafe me feel uvery uncomfortable being a employee there.
good,"Valero has grown since I left. I enjoyed my time at Valero. A great management team, as well as my co-workers, it was a fun & exciting experience. I would not trade working for Valero for anything."
good,"Pay and benefits are amazing, not many places provide a pension and 401k match up to 7 percent dollar for dollar.  In addition, depending on your selections, healthcare is free.  Manage tends to pick favorites over abilities.  My department superintendent sucks and is unqualified."
good,"No matter what i was doing at work, i always stayed busy. Their was always work to do even when their wasn't any customers. I really enjoyed working at Valero and would recommend the job to anyone who actually enjoys a fast past work environment."

good,"It is fun to work here sadly sometimes management cut a lot of hours. It is mostly consists of cleaning, stocking and sales. sometimes is challenging to prevent people from stealing depending on how busy the store is and if your coworkers are team players."
good,Overall the office culture was very accepting and helpful with any questions. I would recommend Valero to students looking to obtain an internship in the agriculture & energy industry.
good,Manager was great. Loved my coworkers. Friendly town I worked in. Hours were reasonable but pay could be better. Nice part time job. Great starter type job.
good,"Very good company with a lot of demand in the work very impeccable demand in the work very impeccable"
good,Management was reasonable with hours. Room for advancement is offered to all employees that want it. Multiple store locations were offered as opitons for extra hours if you wanted it.
good,"A job with multiple learning opportunities. Challenging, but very productive and educative. A  place where customer service is of paramount importance."
good,I enjoyed the job because I was around people. I enjoy customer service. I did not enjoy the pay that I was working for. What I have learned from working here is the more you give and do with out being asked the more people take and don't really appreciate it.
good,Valero is an aggressive company with high standards. My colleagues were skilled and knowledgeable as well as was the management. The work was interesting ad the atmosphere was serious and professional.
good,"Typical day catering to the customers needs.

good,great work environment with people that work together to ensure the proper refining and storage of petroleum products. A great mixture of hands on and administrative work.
good,Valero a good job to have when you just staring out. I will tell my young friends to work there. There is just not much room to grow for people. still a good company.
good,Great costumers and great work environment in all. Some managers where mean and should have been retrained. Not enough advancement opportunities.I do have to say I loved my Assistant manager Shannon Frazier. She was so helpful and i learned alot since she was the only one who loved her job enough to take the time to show proper training.
good,I would love to work again with valero there greeting friendly many things to do and know get to meet area manager costumers and etc . I cant explain more than what u want Im sorry
good,"Very friendly and outgoing people and customers."
good,"i loved my job,  work hard at it, i was dependable, i left for company policies, things happen not in my control,store busy, work fast pace, always something to do, customers great,"
good,"If you are looking for a long term career withastable company who provides great benefits, then this one is for you. It is a highly competitive company so if you are looking to advance your career then make sure you shine every day. They appreciate and reward hard work but won't tolerate much Bullcrap. All in all its one of the better all around jobs/employers I have had."
good,Good company works with your hours. You are able to let them know what shifts you can work and they would put it in schedule. Nice and friendly company able to grow fast.
good,"I would love to be able to work at a Valero Corner Store again in my future or even if my children would work there or want to work there, I would be happy with that."
good,"It is a small gas station however, it is busy. Time moves fast. With different customers coming in and out, an attendant has to see to it that the needs of every customer is assisted and with the inclusion of selling propane tank, assisting disabled customers, and also selling lotto tickets, the cashier should be able to multi task. In addition, during peak hours when people are about to go to work, cashiers should see to it that they quickly assist each and every customer. It is a fun job however, in some situations some customers/none customers try to get into the nerves specially with those who have attitude problems. This becomes a challenge and has to be faced with the proper way of handling stressful situation."
good,"Place is decent. I didn't agree with all of their policies. The facial hair one stands out as one. It was for safety for respirator, I wore one once in the 3 years I worked there. They adhere to more stringent policies than osha requires. This makes part of the job harder than needs to be."
good,"I worked 8 hour shifts here. I did was a cashier and I also did all of the cooking. I learned to check expiration dates, to write temps down,and  doing orders for the week. I liked that it was very routine and I knew what to expect for the day. The hardest part about this job was not being able to get over time and my hours changing frequently. I loved meeting new people and the fast pace environment. I also loved being able to learn more and move up in the company."
good,as a c store it is a good place to work. had to follow p gram and flow chart. keep store clean. keep every thing stock.count smoke 3 time a day work 8 to 10 a day
good,This is actually a pretty decent place to work. They start your pay out based on experience but they stay above minimum wage. It's easy to move up in the company as long as you just do your job and mind yourself.
good,"I enjoyed working there because of certain customers making you feel excited about work, but the hours they have you working are terrible. That's all I have to say about that place of business."
good,"The job is simple but you have multiple tasks. In my specific Valero we work one employee at a time and you are responsible for all the customers, cleaning, and stocking the store and smaller tasks like making coffee and refilling paper towels and toilet paper. It is a great place to work wonderful management and staff and a fun job. The only thing I've been dissatisfied with is the hours it's hard to balance work and social life."

Management was willing to teach what you want you wanted to know."
good,A very good company to work for. The Valero Management gave me a great opportunity as an Army Veteran. I was able to utilize a lot of my skills from the Army as well as from my previous job working in a petrochemical laboratory. I learned a lot of new skills as well as passed on my knowledge to those I interacted with. Safety was always on the forefront. There are a lot of good people I had the fortunate opportunity to work with.

good,"My job at Valero is great. I go to work five days per week and it feels like I'm hanging out with friends. I see the fruit of my labor every day. I don't have to deal with office politics, I just have to do my job. It is great. My coworkers are always helpful. The hardest part of my job is the long ride to and from work. That is my only complaint, but that is no fault of my job. I chose to live were I do."
good,"Everyday i would spend most of my time at the register, and every time i would get a chance i would have to clean the store, restock and re shelf. The hardest part would be doing all those jobs and tending to the costumer.."

good,"hard working "
good,I worked alone most days and if I closed I had a co-worker most times. I learned there how to deal with more then one person and problem at a time. I had to be my own management at times and deal with things on the stop knowing I would be the one to answer to them if I was wrong. Thankfuly I never was. It was hard knowing that anything could happen and that your life could be put on the line at anytime but for the most part people were very nice and not wanting trouble.

good,Working for Valero Cornerstore I have learn a lot about managing a retail store. The manager has a strong belief in me that motivates me to keep working hard so I can move forward. I enjoy working with my co-workers cause they are fun and hard working. Plus who said you can't have fun and work at the same time. I would say the hardest thing is leaving my job when the store is full of customers and I can't stay to help because I will be on overtime.

Co-workers are some of the best people i've ever worked with. The hardest part of my job is the changes in the industry,and keeping up to date with those changes. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure everyone goes home in the same shape they came in. SAFE"

It was a learning experience, I learned how to process A/R and A/P accounts, I learned on how to generate reports for daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly.

good,the day would start with having to complete back office reports. opening the store and making sure all equipment is working properly for the day. I learned a different style of management how far technology can get used. Management is always on there toes doing something to better the company and there employees. Team members learn to work together to get the job done and make it a fun and safe environment. I would say the hardest part is keeping up with the audits and making sure that your customers are satisfied with the services you provided. I enjoyed making the customers smile and seeing them come back.

good,Great international company with advanced learning potential. Overtime was a must with 12 hour shifts.  Volatile atmosphere with probability of emergency situation daily.  .
good,"I miss working there so much, I had a wonderful boss who appreciated me and the work I did. She was always good with delegating tasks so that no one person was left to do everything. I had friendly customers that came in on a regular basis. I received raises within a timely manner, without any problems. After seven years i had gotten very comfortable with my job and had planned on working there forever."
good,"Working with the economics of the retail stores is more of a day in day out process and pretty typical every time. ATM's keep my job a little more interesting on a day to day basis. There are more things that are unexpected and things you have to react to immediately. My co-works are all upper management for both positions. I would say the hardest part of my job currently is the lack of movement in the company. I am very goal orientated, and it's hard to work towards something if there is nothing there to work towards. Right now I'm keeping my focused on getting the goals just what I am working at on the time. With the ATM's I've be able to work much more with contracts and negotiations and i have really enjoyed that."

My managers and store owner were great people they gave me a lot of responsibility and many opportunities to get management positions. I learned how to handle angry customers and what fast paced is all about here. If I could go back I would in a second."
good,"a typical day at work can be exciting, you never know what to expect from customers. Since I work the graveyard shift. I have quickly learned what customers need or my regulars what they always get. My manager is probably one of the best managers I have ever worked with. He knows what to do to get the job done. My co-workers are fun people. I don't think I have had a hard day on my job yet. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know my customers are satisfied with the service they received from me."
good,"I would come in around 3pm, close the morning shift and then start the nightly shift. I learned how to be a manager and manage employees on my own. The co-workers I worked with were okay but there almost every day. The hardest part of the job was not being able to be offered benefits cause it was a small company. The most enjoyable part was the daily interaction with new and regular customers everyday."

good,"A long days work of standing at the cash register with a smile on my face waiting to greet people as they walk in would be a typical day at work. This job was a store to socialize with all the customers, which I found quite fun. This would also bring in more customers, the more the mingle with them and talk about the products would make a customer more interested in the items in the store. I learned how to manage a deal with money, how to raise and lower prices on the merchandise. I also learned how to manage a restaurant, store and gas station all in one. I had many co-workers, Many that were either great workers and just wanted to step up in a better job so they'd quit or just bad workers that would try and steal or just didn't understand how to work a register and they would be relieved from their position. Management was great, always work closely with me and showed me many thngs about the company. The hardest part about the job was working many hours with know days off. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting good pay. Hard work would pay off."
good,The time I spent here was fun there was small disagreements but it was okay nothing too impactful management was also helpful in many ways when it was needed

good,It's a good work place I have learned alot of thing there like being a cook dealing with Customers.the hardest part of working there is that we don't have brakes at all.

good,The hardest part of the job is the amount of hours.  But working in this environment teaches you a lot about time management.

good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo y he aprendido muchas cosas que no sabia.
good,"Workdays started with staff meetings to set the direction for the days work, then phone calls to update plant operating conditions, and finally computer analysis of various products and blending of products. Phone calls were made throughout the day to keep marketing representatives up to date on production schedules."
good,Loved working here. Nice people. Family owned and operated. They still get my business.
good,Fun company to work for. No benefits. Dealt with lots of different customers.
good,I would go in and help manager with safety and security awareness and daily reports. I learned how to do inventory and order merchandise.
good,This company is small but very family oriented. A great place to start off or for students who are looking for experience and extra money
good,Valero was a great place to work until you settles in. then they stared changing up the store managers and the areas managers. who all ran things differently and made it hard for anyone to advance or want to stay
good,"Working at Valero became a great learning experience. I enjoyed getting to know regular customers and helping them in any way possible. It’s a great business experience, and social experience as we’ll . I recommend Valero to others because Valero takes care of all employees."
good,The crew was friendly and very helpful. If I had a question there was always someone there to help.and pay was OK for being a casher. It always was very clean and welcoming.
good,It's was alright working there and too fast paced and partying in the dining room and functioning  going on each week. And standing on your feet get hurt once in a while. The break is short  and  the employees I like them at Valero . They were respectful.
good,Loved working there. You get to see new faces and common faces. Had very kind customers! Slow time was your break time and it did get real slow in the evening hours. Got to work by myself there so no manager in sight telling you this and that.
good,"Usually consists of stocking shelves, cleaning, maintaining fountain drink fountains, running cash registers and keeping customers happy. I learned about the soft drink fountains, the basics of using a cash register, and a good work ethic. My manager when I was there was paul and he was a great guy, awesome to work for. In my opinion The worst part of the job was cleaning the restroom, but the best part was being up front, running the cash register, talking to everyone and seeing everything going on"
good,"Great work life balance, great pay, great benefits. Safety is held as a top priority. Lengthy employment process but worth the time. Overall I would refer anyone to Valero Refinery."
good,I would locate missing check that were from a Valero location that has not been cashed and either have it voided and reissued or posted as cashed. Locate customers checks that have been cashed and either not applied or applied to incorrect accounts

good,"Well everyday as i headed of to work i would never worry about any negative occurrence to happen at my job. The reason why is because i would work specifically handle everything. As for the requirements, the owner would give me the instructions of what he needed. As long sat the job was done by the time he needed  and the job was done he would not have a  reason to instruct me other wise."
good,"great place to work. safety programs are great. tank farm areas must be restructured, if not most operators will be in danger of losing their jobs or being responsible for loss of lives and or equipment. there are too many job descriptive duties that are weigh in on an operator's performance."
good,Best Operations Training program in the industry.   Enjoy watching the new operators come into the refinery and achieve upper management status and growth that takes place quickly.

good,Loved to work here. A typical day was managing the store and helping customers throughout the day.
good,"Having gained employement there a few years after being in the military it was a hudge adjustment. People not showing up for work and not fulfilling their responsibilites wasn't something I was used to. I enjoyed the interactions with my customers and felt the feeling of accomplishment everytime we did well on our audits. The hardest part of that job, for me, was feeling limited on improving things and the fact that it would sometimes take a while to get rid of bad help."
good,"great place to work, fun environment to be in, can be demanding at times. can be very boring at times. but some of the people that work there are not very motivated."
good,"A day at Valero consists of scanning goods and cashing out customers. I also deal with tobacco and lottery. We make food and clean the inside/outside of the store when needed. I learned a lot about some of the different tobacco products and how to cook certain items. I also learned my customers as they became regulars whom i saw often. Management has its ups and downs. I feel like they are great people to work with but they also become easily aggravated. The workplace is very open but in constant need of attention at all times: cleaning the store, making food, keeping items stocked, watching for people who steal, Etc. Hardest part of the job to me was the Teamwork. Some of the employees and managers greatly slack Teamwork which i did not appreciate. Most enjoyable was making friends with the workers and customers. It helped grow more friendships and bonding. I felt like making a relationship with the customers and with coworkers makes for a growing and enjoyable job experience."
good,"A typical day at work was serving customers, using lottery machine, setting up pumps, selling in store products, restocking products and ordering products. Management was helping. Workplace culture was quick paced. The hardest part of the job was dealing with vendors while serving customers at the same time. The enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,"My experience overall was great, until I transferred to working for an insecure manager. I realized at that point that I'd been protected from the overriding culture of the company, which was to offer very little guidance, but a great deal of criticism of mistakes."
good,Good culture good working environment .Good management is there just going to leave this job because want to take more experience in other place so can get more experience ad improve my skills

good,Very nice and friendly atmosphere. Food always hot. Cashiers and Deli associates always greeting customers when they walk into store. When there's a problem always willing to fix it. Employees get along great with each other.
good,"During my time in Valero I was positioned in the long term optimisation and project department, covering the black and white oil units."
good,"The day would start with the morning rush of coffee drinkers.  I would run the register while helping other customers with locating what needed in the store.  I would send and receive products orders, and stock and face the stores inventory.  I would maintain the stores appearance, to draw in new customers."
good,Valero is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees very well.
good,The only bad thing I have to say about this place is of course the security. I complained for years about a security window being placed and finally one was placed after I left because they knew the threat was real.
good,"This place was great for me, because i loved working at gas stations. Its the busy life and to say hi and be there for people in the morning who just need a smile with their coffee."
good,very long term job
good,"It was a great experience to be there and help customers most of them coming in the store several times a day and making them feel at home, others were in and out but faithful customers, having employees that sometimes made you feel like a babysitter or a mom on an ongoing routine but at the same time made you feel like a second home."
good,"I loved working for this company however was laid off, Store closure. The customers loved me and I kept the store really clean.I feel like this particular store closed too early at 9pm"
good,"This was my first job in customer service/retail and it really taught me a lot. I was hired in the middle of an oil boom so we were busy all day everyday. The management at the time I was hired was horrible due to some scandals but we eventually ended up with a wonderful manager. There was nothing too hard about the job other then dealing with difficult customers. I loved everyone I worked with, it too was almost like a family."
good,Easy place to work and your day goes by fast. Always busy. Before you know it your shift is over . always has tasks that take up time and never find yourself bored woth nothing to do.
good,"Valero store #552 on Oltorf is not the safest location for a 24 hour corner-store, but the management more than makes up for the dreaded location. They are really nice, very funny, and have no trouble working around your schedule, got any problems just don't forget to bring it up."
good,Project Manager in an operating refinery environment. Executed major project in house with limited refinery resources. Managed major EPC contractors. Responsibilities similar to the Valero Wilmington Refinery.
good,Great coworkers. Good opportunities within operations. Given some great opportunities to work within safety department. Experience with grass roots startup opportuinty
good,After being sold to Circle K I want to find a better less stressful environment. I lost my mutual fund due to the company sell and no longer have the long term security i had worked so many years to compile.

good,"OMG, I so love this work place all the managers and co-workers from all the stores are awesome very outgoing talkative and very very friendly good atmosphere... working at the store you have to be energetic be able to multi-task and be able to sale, the good part of it is that you'll get to meet lots of different kind of people and attitudes."
good,Working with this company is a challenge to learn how to handle customers and other co-workers.  Also on the job you can learn more as you go by with all of your customers and learn more on the job to promote new career.
good,Management inconsistent in practices and policies. Practices that were approved changed with management and not guidance or notice of changes provided.

good,"Journée avec du changement continuel"
good,"A typical day at work consists of cleaning the store, sweeping and mopping floors, cleaning the bathrooms hourly, and replacing the food in the deli regularly. I learned how to effectively run the register, and the basics of customer service. The management was great, she made sure to address any issues you may have in a timely matter. My co-workers were great as well, and they were so patient with my training. The hardest part of the job was probably getting to the bathrooms to clean them sometimes because the store got rather busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that my co-workers were a lot like family. All-in-all, it was a great place to work."
good,I liked working here for the most part because of the friendly people and the challenge to complete tasks before the end of my shift.
good,"If you know how to handle money, are capable of lifting up to 50 pounds, and can work a computer you are capable of working here. It is not hard at all. I enjoyed it very much."

good,the job was pretty good experience the typical day was attending customers filling up the roller grill. co-workers were really cool the only hard part of the job was trying to unload the merchandise truck attending the customers and putting everything where it supposed to be
good,I love the family like atmosphere and the level at which we give back to the community. I love what I do at Valero and I love the people I work with..
good,"Typical days at work confide in all year round duties for cleaning such as for the gas pumps, trash bins, coolers, and price board change. Rainy days can make it a tad bit mucky and problematic, but what makes it better is that your inside and not out. Inventory counts is the best part of the job because only the control count (Stockade)can limit the orders. The manager at times can be a tad bit frustrated depending on the problems and causes for the company but everything still is coper-static . Over the years business and growth of business as well as the employees have sought out more to my eyes than what I have expected."
good,Started the day by reviewing the workload that was organized the previous day. The team was empowered to conduct and process the assignments without direct supervision. Utilized my background and skill-set to complete workload in an expedited manner. Management trusted the team and was professional. Culture was mission driven and was very aware of the objective and the importance of completing it on a timely basis. The hardest part of the job included having to complete the assignments with a short window. Enjoyable part of the job was being flexible and being allowed to be creative to complete the workload.

good,"A typical day at work consists of cashing out customers and cleaning or stocking what is needed. All employees are very helpful and nice. The hardest part of the job would be getting rushes, but they don't last too long. The most enjoyable part of work is how fun the co-workers are."
good,"started in 2000, Valero purchased the company in 2004. Valero has a great work to employee culture and the CEO was very hands on. The work schedule for my position changed from 8 to 12 hours shifts. After a few years i was burned out and went looking for the 9-5 Mon-Fri position."
good,"Challenging job that requires you to think on you feet and trouble shoot. Must have knowledge about the workings of a refinery and units that you are working in. You work in pairs which help alleviate any second guessing. Any tool or material needed to get a job done will be provided. There is no rushing jobs, this keeps all jobs preformed safe. Safety is a key component at Valero."
good,I was kept busy but the constant call ins were horrible I had no family life but I enjoyed the time I shared the customers made it very worth wild for my time
good,"You basically do the same thing everyday however, I am learning a lot from this company. CST has the best training and benefits you can imagine."

good,"Like and store you're gonna have thieves but police would always come by and have coffee and joke with us. The neighborhood knew everyone.

good,I would've stayed with the job for years if I hadn't had to move. Local management left a little to be desired but Regional management was easy to approach and discuss concerns. The job is simple and easy.
good,At work its mostly cash handling and customer service. Valero is a gas station/corner store. I work for a corporate location. At this job i have learned how to problem solve much more effectively. I learned how to provide the best customer service I know how. Valero takes pride in their extensive training programs for their employees. Store managers have issues with delegation and some times honesty.
good,Everyday going into work I knew what was expected of me and had all the tools to do so. I learned how to work individually efficiently yet still contribute to the entire team and how customers satisfaction come first.
good,working for Valero i enjoyed very much very good people to work for... and if i move back to delaware i have my job back.
good,The job was fairly easy. The tasks weren't hard or unfair. The employees all work as a family to make the other shifts easy. Customers are really friendly and not demanding.

good,I loved working here and would come back if I could. I had the best manager ever and she help me work to change my job title. Lots of training and good hours.
good,Valero's is just like any other gas station. There is the daily tasks of making sure that the customer is happy with every aspect of there visit. Bathrooms and gas pumps need to be clean. As well as have the lot free of litter.
good,Great company to work for.  Excellent compensation and benefits package.  Great management systems for operating high performing refineries with a strong culture for Safety and Environmental performance and Operational Reliability.
good,"First greeting customers daily, getting to know new people, learning new things that might help me in the future, and that's all i have learn and love."
good,Valero gave me my first job opportunity after College. My first six months was a little challenging but with the training I was able to excel. Valero was a good company to work for. Management provided all the necessary tools to get job done. Employees welfare was a priority to the upper management.
good,My manager really kept me informed and on top of all my training. All my customers were great loved the area. Everyday was a challenge with its own tweaks.
good,I learned quite a bit working for Valero....my working in the public skills are MUCH stronger now & I am a pro!! Management wasn't all that great but it was ok.
good,Great company. I worked with a great group of people. Left because there was no growth within. Site management/department was not as pro-active as they could of been
good,"My manager was a very experienced and understanding person. My working hours were always as much as I could handle without pressure and discomfort. Due to valero' safety regulations and practices, I never feared nor experienced a dangerous encounter."
good,"wonderful people, understanding managers, flexible hours worked in the kitchen cooked and helped customers. we made some of the best Kolaches and tacos."
good,As an intern the pay was great and the learning opportunities were endless. Very friendly people in the work environment were incredibly knowledgeable about refineries.
good,"Valero is a great place to work. The management is great, hard working and understanding. The employees are great as well and work well together. The hardest part of the job is definitely dealing with irate customers, but they are few in number."
good,"Valero Corner Store is probably the best job I've had so far in my life. Most of my coworkers are awesome, and the managers are great. The only thing I have an issue with from time to time is that I live in a pretty stuck up town, so I would have customers make racial slurs to me about my coworkers' and managers' race (I'm the only white person working there). They'd be like ""it's nice to talk to someone who isn't Muslim or black."" I try to hold back on starting a conflict with them, but it's unacceptable in my opinion. I usually refrain from speaking to that customer when they say that to me. Other than that, almost every customer I've had loves me and would ask my coworkers where I was when I had a day off. My hours are great, the flexibility this company has with my college schedule is awesome, and the pay raises are beyond what I expected. I've been employed for about a year and 2 months now and never thought once about quitting. I know I won't be working for this company forever, but it's getting me by for now; paying my bills and paying for my college necessities. Plus, the holiday pay is the best thing I've received so far, and my boss always lets me call first dibs on working on a holiday (most people want the holidays off, but me and my family never do anything on holidays except work.
