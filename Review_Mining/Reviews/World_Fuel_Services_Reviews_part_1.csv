bad,"They say they are super busy and have a lot of work but they dont. The hourly pay is way below average for the market and now they are changing to a 4 day work week, my income will be about $48k- in the Seattle area. Thats not enough to live on. Lots of drivers about to walk out."
bad,Management has no appreciation and doesn't encourage their employees.  Once you're hired you're own your own. Racist and chauvinistic jokes at workplace. No life work life balance.
bad,"Toxic toxic toxic theyll lie to ur face"
bad,Brought up to management and they said they would look into it and then next thing you know I am a targeted and I started getting written up. A lot of favoritism with friends and family.
bad,"This company left much to be desired in the way of fair pay, career advancement, and upper leadership.  Bogged down by too many middle managers and outdated processes."
bad,"Fun place to work in, but management and leadership were poor, they discriminate women and pay them too low compare to other teammates with same level and title."
bad,"no career development, changes in the reporting line advised only verbally and from one day to the other, never received an official communication by HR. More and more responsibilities to take over on a daily basis, never recognised through review of the job description or position title. Overtime not compensated. Code of conduct applies only to some of the personnel. No equal treatment of staff. Complete lack of communication top to bottom."
bad,"forget about any career development"
bad,Since the merger with Colt they are going downhill.  They have several dangerous situations that are possible since they have flaws in the their software.
bad,Toxic work environment. Very little to no communication between management. Extremely high employee turnover due incompetent management & chaotic atmosphere.
bad,"Keeps hiring more and more drivers in Pueblo, Co but doesn't have the work. Before at meetings told us should not have to live off the 50 hour minimum pay, but the last couple months lots of drivers been struggling to get 40-45 a week, while a few others get 55-70 for being the bosses pets. Rumors have it boss only wants drivers to work 50 hours a week now but won't pay us more to compensate. Rumors have it he is bitter and upset that he didn't get the position he applied for so is taking it out on drivers. Sad state of affairs this place is in right now."
bad,A empresa não possui estratégia corporativa e trabalha de forma improvisada. Não há governança e as decisões de negócio são completemente equivocadas.
bad,"That you are free to give new ideas and input, sure!!! Nothing that you are promised will happen. The culture is terrible. People are constantly looking for other opportunities"
bad,"By far, the worst company I have ever worked for.  There is no leadership.  Management is out for themselves and really have no clue what we do.  But don’t worry, if you don’t like the management, wait six months and they will be gone and some other clueless individual will be there to make your life miserable.  You ask them questions and they look like a deer in the headlights because none of them have any real petroleum experience.  Management are all figure heads who try to rule with an iron fist.  Long hours, zero family life, constantly lied to by management.  Didn’t used to be this way until World fuel bought us our. Stay clear!"
bad,"The company is good and safe."
bad,The company cares nothing about people and they are only concerned with making the bottom line. They are ruthless people and the managers are extremely ill- equipped to manage complex issues.
bad,"Chemical toilet for the first 4 weeks."
bad,"The upper management commands and demands on a daily basis."
bad,"There's a lot to dislike about WFS. For instance, there's no real teamwork despite their emphasis on teams and the overwhelming majority of the work can actually be done from home (only a few are granted this option). The biggest problem stems from compensation. It's not uncommon to hear other employees complain about being under paid. WFS does have good benefits, but the trade off is reflected in your paycheck. Also the executives aren't the smartest people resulting in declining profits year over year, which impacts raises and bonuses."
bad,"Micromanagement is the way of life there, no processes in place, most people in management do not have a degree, highoverturn people do not last past 2 years. They overpay on your salary because they can’t retain talent. Lack of leadership across all departments"
bad,"racist coworkers and managers play favoritism "
bad,They get rid of people with experience to hire people for half of the money which results in lost time and effort by those that are left behind.  They have 3 people doing my job now.
bad,"WFS has been a challenging env. always but since the new management came in, it is a disaster, they are clueless. They just care about how things look.  Zero interest for real results. They look sales people instead leaders. If you want to make a career in politics come here, else go to other place.  Here you are not going to learn anything."
bad,"Not a good place to work."
bad,"This location in Denver, CO didn't provide the best opportunities for advancement. I excelled in my position and was continuously turned down for new job placements.  Management decisions come from corporate office in Miami and not of the higher level people have ever been to Denver."
bad,WFS is a good company Unfortunately there is no advancement if you don't know someone. Management is not all fair and will only help those they have preference with despite your hard work and dedication. It is very unfortunate. Otherwise it is a good company overall.
bad,"We were extremely busy, trying to make sure all payments were applied in a timely fashion."
bad,"En términos generales es una buena empresa, pero les falta mejorar el ambiente laboral dentro de la oficina"
bad,"Too many chiefs and too little indians. Stuck in the past with outdated systems, procedures and not willing to do anything new or innovative."
bad,"Unfortunately the division I currently work for lost the contract I work on. This was due to situations at World level. "
bad,"Good company, terrible leadership and management.  Upper management doesn't have a clue.  Nepotism is throughout the office.  Very stressful work environment"
bad,"The pay is magnificent, certainly above class versus competitors. To add to this a heavy benefits package, which makes employees stick. Apart from these, everything else is dismal."
bad,"Hated the culture, everybody is out for themselves and it's far too cliquey"
bad,Taking consideration it cost money to train drivers learn how to listen to the drivers about the routes. that you guys in  management does not know ..
good,"I liked working there but the ever changing management styles and the new Agile culture led to alot of stress."
good,"the work culture is not good and you have to be part of the ""boys club"" in order to keep your job. tons of people who don't do anything all day."
good,Not a lot of room for advancement and they change the requirements for salary advancement making it nearly impossible to receive a livable wage over time.  Very top heavy with too many executives and directors who do not perform any real function to the day to day management of the businss
good,"Good place to work, challenging at times environment. Great people. Culture and company structure is challenging, fast paced and at times hectic. Company has growing pains as it moves from smaller energy company to larger footprint in the energy industry."
good,Poor pay.  Politics.  Poor senior management.  Low Integrity.  Job security is fine.  Culture is horrible.  Doral location is horrible.
good,"WFS is a successful company.  Every year there the company expanded and it was an exciting place to work. The folks there are friendly.  However during my time there, I saw a decline in work/life balance, and in the culture with regards to treatment of employees. Also, new leadership was unstable and direction was poor."
good,Communication is terrible at the highest levels creating chaos for everyone else.  Decisions are made in silos without thinking through the implications at the business level.
good,One of the things that I love about working at World Fuel Services is the wide range of work that I have to do. Thee is never a boring day at the office.
good,"Someone said great place to retire from, but who has retired from world fuel services pueblo? Not a single person! Automatic trucks great for in town? Ha! They are just as worthless in town as on the highway, they have no get up and go, no rpm range to pull a gear and get through lights or intersections in a timely fashion. Dangerously slow acceleration especially when trying to get onto the interstate."
good,"WFS is a solid corporation with solid financial numbers.  The work environment is pleasant, employees are civil and relatively nice to each other, management effectiveness depends on the manager you have."
good,Disappointing and hard working at night with low pay and very physically demanding with no help from dispatch or management does not feel like a work environment more like a sinking ship.
good,The working environment at World Fuel Services was a bit aggressive.  There minimal collaboration between team members to reach a common goal but instead everyone worked independently
good,Staff motivated to exceed for the good of the company and their own. Hardest part of the job is no security; company offers temporary jobs without benefits and security.
good,"To be able to fit in the organizational culture, from day one the employee must to be self started and fast learner."
good,Great company to work at. I learned a lot from this company. Job culture is amazing! Everybody is very helpful and respectful. Interview process was tough besides that great company.
good,it was good at first but like any corporate company it started to go down hill.we were solo down here in dfw then we got a guy who knew nothing of the business and went down from there
good,Company has a lack of direction. Will hire and then release employees less than a year later due to the company going into a different direction that initially wanted to go. This is a lack of leadership at the Sr Management level.
good,"Productive company, offers good pay and an excellent benefits package. Good work/life balance. Would benefit from better training program. Co-workers make it enjoyable to work. Company provides activities year round to boost morale."
good,"Good start times with regards to shifts,although to many saturdays"
good,Entire company and rolls are very compartmentalized. You only see your part of the picture. There is lots of micro-managing that goes on here and people breathing down your neck.
good,The company is always growing and changing.  Data is very important and IT plays a critical role in how well the business can leverage their data to make fast and accurate decisions.
good,The average tenure at the organization is very close to 5 x years.  People tend to stay in the organization due to a fair culture/management.  This organization value loyalty and work performance.
good,"World Fuel Services pays great, compared to the market. But the work in progress is very dense for everyone there, so they get what they pay for. "
good,"entrepreneurial "
good,"Good equipment"
good,"Could benefit from better internal controls and management strategy."
good,"The atmosphere was formal, busy, and strict.  Turnarounds were short, and tempers flared easily.  "
good,"Hard to make an impact. Too many acquisitions and poor integration of systems and processes. Too many silos and duplication of work. Management wants quick results without considering what real, lasting changes will take."
good,World Fuel Services was a great experience and a great company to work for. Its big but small enough to know names. Had a really good time interning that summer.
good,"Currently undergoing agile transformation. Workload is heavy, compensation is currently minimal, but company has started to head in the right direction."
good,"the company grew by acquiring smaller companies. Integration process still painful. Company still struggles with reporting, and management wants to see."
good,As with most companies it all depends on who your manager is and fortunately I had a very good one so my experience went well. ………………………………………………………..
good,"Learned data analysis skills on the job.  Supervisor was lazy, unfortunately became a slave.  But learned a lot of new skills, made good money and great benefits (lots of vacation time and awesome health package) and was promoted a couple of times before leaving."
good,Headquarters are in Florida difficult to communicate from different locations. Interesting topics a lot of hard working managers.
good,"Like the place, no room for growth in dept. Ive learned more customer service."
good,"New domain to work on and great to learn new technologies.     "
good,Been in the company since i graduated from FIU. Looking to go beyond
good,"Very high paced work environment. Assisting in the development and review of deal analysis, examining transaction terms and recommending the most profitable options to superiors. Researching seaports all over the world to initiate future customer relationship for providing fuel."
good,"Normally my working days are hard at work with logistics and barge operations, are very dynamic operations and work all the time by email and phone even when I'm not in the office. Learn all the time to have many customers and many different boats this results in a different every day, each one has its own special operations. It's great working environment I have, my co-workers are great fun and this makes the work happen in a nice and easy way."
good,I worked as a contractor for little over a year and was offered a permanent position but the pay wasn't that good so i left. Fun place to work. Management is good. Would recommend to a friend.
good,"In South Florida, this is a number one company to work for. Though the work is stressful, the sense of accomplishment is fantastic. The corporation is very nimble and dynamic, lending to quick organizational changes and adaptation."
good,Company is located a convenient location. And the office provides a comfortable working environment with great colleagues. The day mostly started with greetings n laughter among the colleagues. And there were plenty of interaction between departments on daily operations.
good,Great company to work for.  Good opportunity for advancement.  Invaluable learning experience.  Would definitely recommend as a great employer.  excellent location and facilities.
good,Busy workplace with opportunities for those who were active in their pursuit of excellence. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers who shared a strong work ethic and were dedicated to the success of the company. I enjoyed the industry and the people I had the chance to work with. I hope the team and product I was in charge of selling made a positive impact on their businesses.
good,"My day to day is varied between field sales work and office work, I am constantly learning as the industry changes and adapts to legislation and customer needs, so in constant touch with my manager and have a team I can wholly rely on behind me in support."
good,"Manage price risk exposure on the sale and purchase of petroleum products in order to maximize profits"
good,"The daily interaction with World's customers is an exciting challenge and never boring.  This industry very dynamic.  Working with our major oil partners, bringing deals to the table and closing those deals was the most enjoyable part.  The hardest part was getting these deals approved through World's management."
good,"Whilst this work environment is not for everyone, it is ideal for younger, ambitious people with an eye on a career with a major company. "
good,"The generous compensation package is what made working there bearable. The daily environment was very stressful and my manager was harsh. Thankfully, yoga and a gym were available to promote wellness."
good,Under utilized in the position.  The heirarchy limits the efficieny of the segmented trading groups within the firm.  They need to take a better approach at managing younger employees and builing a culture of training.
good,"Working culture in the last couple of years has improved a lot. f you have the skills and talent, it is not very hard to get an opportunity to work in projects that you would want to be part of."
good,"Good place to work. Have had a corporate re-structuring lately that seems to turn things to looking upward. There were layoffs which was stressful, but I think it helped in the end."
good,"WFS could be an amazing company to work for. However they are currently going through a serious period of change which is leaving their general workforce, across all sectors very demoralised and unsure of the future."
good,"World Fuel is a fast pace environment, long hours, good benefits and an overall good work environment.Due to World Fuel's continued path of fast pace growth, there are constant projects to be tackled and at times can be very challenging when they overlap."
good,"Great company to work for. Supportive colleagues."
good,"A very professional company with top-notch employees. They excel at not micro-managing the staff and allow innovation and ideas. Salary is great, healthcare is good, but no other extra benefits like tuition reimbursement. Annual bonuses are far-fetched as executive management like to set lofty annual goals--very stock-price driven. They focus too much on accquisitons and mergers. Company has a serious identity crisis and keeps many of their subsidiaries as separate companies.. which makes cross-functional team work very difficult."
good,Nice place to work and all the people where very friendly and helpful. I would like to go back and work for the company as soon as there is any opening.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time working with this company. They provided good training and excellent personal development programs. The culture was one of growth and development, and always looking forward."

There are many career opportunities throughout the company, as well as great benefits.  I've enjoyed collaborating and helping the business grow during my time here."
good,There was no micro management you did your job and went on with your day. One hour lunch and not a set schedule. Great work place. Excellent parking space and  security guard 24/7.
good,"I work remotely from home and was a part of the acquisition of Ascent Aviation.  I have an extensive sales background and have migrated to the Client Coordinator position.  I support a team of sales executives to on board new business, including creating contracts, and maintaining existing business.  I update our customer management systems and keep all information current."
good,"Each day brings new challenges with initiatives that have high expectations.  With that, I feel that I am maximizing my learning curve about the business as I am given opportunities to work with different departments within my company.  I get a taste of everything, and that allows me to leverage my relationships across different divisions which, at the end of the day, adds value back to the company.  Being a part of management has given me a holistic view of what goes on in the front- and back-end of the office.  Also, getting my MBA while in management has allowed me to apply what I have learned to everyday business."
good,A dynamic corporate structure with quality leadership and fun teams to work with.  Management teams are supportive and forgiving.  Workplace is respectful.
good,Fast paced and challenging. Great environment . Nice swimming pool inside the office and great support from various departments or branch office worldwide. Truly a MNC / Fortune 100 company.
good,I am not the one to ask about this. Being there since the age of 14 and spending most of my life with the company you can make your own assumptions. Hope it's gotten better in the years since I left.
good,The World Fuel common stock price has fell from $ 60 per share to $ 20 per share - so they're really not the same company the used to be. They have fallen from the Fortune 50 list to the below the Fortune 1000 list. I understand the Board of Directors is in the process of replacing Michael Kasbar as CEO.
good,"It was really nice working there"
good,"A rotina de trabalho consiste em:"
good,"gained Domain knowledge"
good,World Fuel Services is a great company to experience the full corporate culture. A great place to learn (and do what you’ve learned). Many functions year round to feel appreciated as well as secure in jobs. They invest in you.
good,"Great place to work for employees that don’t want to make the absolute minimum. Management gets involved only when  necessary. Over the last two years  Manny  improvements (new equipment) and pay increase. There is to much  unprofessionalism  With in the driver ranks throughout Denver, Pueblo and Alamosa."
good,"Hard work; the rule of thumb is there’s an exception to every exception and that exception has an exception. The company departments are siloed but there are some great people to work with, if you are lucky enough to hold a role that works with other departments."
good,"Worldwide company with more than 4,000 employees, you only get to know the people you work close with (your department) unless your position allows you to interact with other departments. Co workers are fun because of diversity in cultures. Volume of work was always so high that days go faster, and never enough time to do all I needed to do, and for this reason all employees in genereal worked extra hours. The hardest part in this job was to keep up with all the constant changes."
good,Great place to work to build your career and great workplace culture! You learn new things everyday and a a lot of opportunities for growth. Very relaxed atmosphere!
good,Great place to work! Good people and great opportunities for career advancements. WFS is not your typical company. No corporate penguins here and relaxed environment.
good,"I have been working at World Fuel Services (Less than a year). This is a very high-paced and growing environment.Very professional, international and dynamic environment. Successful consolidator in a consolidating industry. Company knows how to adjust quickly and successfully to changes and opportunities in an industry dominated by changes in oil prices, geo-politics and government regulation. I came here because of the opportunity to create and grow and WFS has not failed to deliver that and more. The people are genuine, hardworking and have a collaborative spirit. I truly do enjoy coming to work everyday and feel I have grown more as a professional and person."
good,"It's very informal, office etiquette is kept to a minimum. People are nice and fun, they are a work hard, play hard type of company. It you're not performing, they'll let you know."
good,"When i was hired by the company, it was my first time being a scrum master practically and it was nerve wracking. However, they had some great people who were very welcoming, and  i felt very comfortable in the environment. I had the opportunity of getting trained and i learned a lot. I had enough room to improve my skills which was of great value to the company. A typical day at work involved facilitating meetings such as the daily scrum, resolving team impediments, tracking the scrum metrics such as the burn down chart and more. The environment was very interesting which made work much more interesting and not intense."
good,Daily work organize in order to process customer billing cycle. The work culture was very friendly and easy too work with on a daily basics. Management very easy to understand in order to finish daily projects and work load.
good,"World Fuel Services is a growing company with enormous potential.  The company culture is supportive and energetic, with an orientation toward the future and clear vision to be the best at what they do on the global stage.  Tremendous support from senior leadership to all levels of the company, with Driver Appreciation events, seasonal activities, bonus programs, and lots of rewards for good work.  The work culture is diverse and respectful, even as it is driving forward to shape the future of the industry.  Great place to work and grow!"
good,"Great management,"
good,"Receiving orders and replying and processing them timeously."
good,"When I arrive at the office, I usually, reply to customers e-mails and address all concerns. I then continue my workday by retrieving duty drawback information in order to correctly refund customers. The most difficult task lies in the accurate transfer of information from one spreadsheet to another. I do however, enjoy completing assignments with great detail."
