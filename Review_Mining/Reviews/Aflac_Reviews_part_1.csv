rating,review
bad,Working hard to reach set goals will not get you far in sales office as long as Aflac continues to allow management to place their spouses or children in position to win awards they do not work for at all . Managers put business into family members names so they bonus and win trips . Contest manipulation is huge in the office it’s really hard to see everyone working so hard for something they will never have
bad,"Avoid this.  It is MLM and effectively a scam.  Full commission, no actual training, no territories, cult like organization. "
bad,"The only thing that is good about this company: is that I was able to take my license to another job and make reliable income. The pay is commission based. After sealing a deal, you only get pennies because you have to split the commission with the team. I would not recommend anyone to work for them."
bad,"It is a good starting job for first time employees.  If you plan a carreer path of at least 10 years, and many hours of pavement canvassing, this may work for you.  But it is lots of networking, many competitors, hard work and long hours.  A large sacrifice of family time.  If you have a pension or Military income, this could be a good fit for extra income.  They make you buy a personal policy, as part of your employment, from AFLAC so that you can ""experience"" the process. (IMO, that is a rip off)"
bad,The other teams will use your name to get into companies that your familiar with. The pay is horrible its straight commission you don't get paid unless you sign a business and sell policies. The distric managers in our area are absolutely untrustworthy. The sales force is completely egotistical. The best thing they could do is completely can the district managers and entire sales force. They are just dirty.
bad,company has gone down hill.  products are antiquated and over prices.  marketing is shifting to online and most of the sales force winds up in a losing battle to compete
bad,I wish I never ever tried it. I lost everything the moment I decided to become an insurance producer with aflac. I was lied to and mislead. Wish never did it!
bad,"Worst company and people ever, do not trust anyone in company. All liars comparable to used car salesmen. They are salesmen, they con you into a job that sounds amazing. Far from it."
bad,Only Managers make real commission from your hard work . No money to be made as Benefits Specialist . Cut Throat from the top to the Bottom . Headquarters does not support their field agents .
bad,"There is a complete lack of competent, efficient leadership. What your told in the interview process is far from what reality is. And, if you 'tough' it out, you are not recognized or rewarded. It's all about signing new accounts and not about servicing the ones you have."
bad,"This office is very crowded, people are nice but some of the managers sucks. Work can be good but it gets annoying petering people for business. You definitely have to cold call and canvass for any business here ."
bad,"Communication between district managers was very poor.  Hours were bad, no clear training of how to work the system.  Lucky for me I am technology savvy."
bad,I tried as hard as I could and put over 12 hours a day to generate sales but I found that in the long run I was at a financial loss.  It's very stressful to not want to give up but you end up with more financial stress than just staying at home.  I suggest you keep your job and try this opportunity part-time.
bad,"Total racism for sure. Company offered severance package because I discovered unethical behavior that could have got the company shut down.  The department was not downsizing. Went through a EEOC situation and the HR Director, Legal Attorney, and one person from the department showed up for a meeting with their guns blazing with dishonest information. Long story short, they agreed to settle out of court while I had to sign a non-disclosure document that stated that I or anyone from my family could bring a lawsuit against them ever. Discovered there are hundreds of other former employees that were released the same way. AFLAC is not an EQUAL EMPLOYEE Company.  Prior to leaving, I was performing the load of 3 different positions, but only one very small salary. An employee left so I assumed their responsibilities for 5 months alone. They hired someone of the different race and paid them a salary 2x the one they were paying me. Guess who trained the new employee??? I did.  That's what prompted me to contact Employee Relations in the first place."
bad,"Job is commission based only. If you don't sign accounts, you don't get paid. You have to use your own vehicle, gas, and time to prospect. I actually lost money in the 6 months I worked for AFLAC."
bad,"I started with the initial Aflac Insurance Agent roll. Opening new accounts by talking to businesses."
bad,"Contest manipulation, poor training,  poor management,  I really would prefer not to go into detail. I tried talking with upper management about issues and it didn't matter."
bad,"No real chance to make money, having to split commissions with established salespersons and no chance in this market to establish new clients. Ran contests 2 or 3 times a year to encourage 70 Associates they hired every 3 months to squeeze their friends and relatives to buy Insurance policies that you had to split the commissions with established sales persons to keep their older employees fed."
bad,"Be careful when they promise you leads, they are not really leads.  Its a list of registered business owners from SunBiz, not a scrubbed list.  They will not get your through training to be making those commissions the second week as they promise."
bad,"This is a cold calling only sales position. This is business sales only, no individual direct policies.  If you get the opportunity, sales presentations must be given to businesses, for their decision to offer aflac. Promotions only given based on sales."
bad,"Facts matter and here are some facts. "
bad,"A recruiter will reach out to you to tell you how they are interested in your skillset and experience, and how the hiring manager would love to interview you. What they don't tell you is that you’d be walking into an interview with 10-15 other random people, and that the job you are being recruited for may not be available. But rather, it is a scam to get you into a commission-based salary only sales position."
bad,Horrible company. Con artists. Fake. Spend more than you make no matter how hard you work. They want to put accounts in your name then make you pay back money because clients figure out it’s a joke. Nothing good to say about this company.
bad,I gained some sales experience selling insurance policies. Unfortunately it was set up we you got a small percentage of what you sold and the main part went to the higher ups in the company.
bad,I worked here for about 4 months and quit as soon as I saw it was going no where. It is full commission job. You are given bonuses if you meet a certain amount of sales in a given period but it is very difficult because most want you to rely on your managers to close sales. You are basically not an agent but a telephone marketer. I put in may hours and when I would get a meet with a business it was sometimes canceled or little effort was put into the meetings. They will put others before you. I did not have the support to even start and waited. AND there was a meeting almost everyday! They are pretty careless with your time.
bad,"There is no guaranteed income, you have""teams"" but everyone is out for them selves "
bad,I worked in a small town on the east coast and a management team husband and wife took  my sales the very week my husband ended his life after not getting paid for nearly 2 months. cold calling managers would fall  behind you and rewrite the policies under their name. shady and completely unprofessional and corporate did nothing.
bad,"Aflac has decent programs, but the training and support is waaaay less than they say.  Those climbing up are only worried about you as how fast and great it can help their own income. You are given such lean supports in the beginning that unless you are an amazing or ruthless worker, you will fail, lose your car, your house and no one really cares."
bad,This job is a joke. More people come and go than a Mcdonalds drive thru. They will hire anyone. Pay is less than min wage. Good luck if you want to make money
bad,This is an absolutely terrible work environment. I think Aflac as a company isn’t terrible but the people who have been there long enough to build their business are not willing to help you succeed. You open a couple accounts and all of the sudden you’re just not ‘working out’ anymore. Your accounts get handed off to veteran agents and you’re left wondering where it all went wrong. You’re basically just a new face and to open accounts with warm leads and when you have exhausted your resources you’re labeled ‘not good enough’. Don’t waste your time. Find work and management that care about you and not just what their bonuses are looking like.
bad,"Worst place I ever worked at all there care about is money."
bad,"Not helpful at all. That's one reason I left this business, this company was a learning curve for me, I acquired my insurance license for Delaware and Maryland, but I had to help the girl training, me so I did not trust her or that organization. She would not show up to meetings and would not tell me and I'm out of town with no information on where the client was.  It just was not a good fit for me."
bad,"I was really excited for a change of pace..however this job was not what they said it would be.  In order to do good at this business you have to be in good with the boss.. so they can send business your way. The area is so flooded with Aflac agents, that no busy is happy to see you .. and immediately shut you down. It is commissioned based so unless you have another income, I do not recommend this job."
bad,"One of the worst companies I've ever worked for."
bad,"The job position that i was in was consisted on selling supplemental insurance packages to businesses. once sold you would receive a portion upfront and then get paid the rest over a time frame. If the policy were to cancel during that first year of selling you would be then set to reimburse AFLAC for that cancellation. This business practice is not one that I am particular fond of but if you sell to the correct businesses and are able to continue to have that residual income, this job can be promising."
bad,Management seems ti encourage breaking the rules and I come first attitude. Management will have cattle calls and Everyone is hired but not paid . Only commission so you have to get license but while studying for exam they ask you to cold call 300 people a day . Then let other agents run your appointment . You get no money for any cold calling . Older agent take advantage of newer agents . Just not a good company to work for.
bad,"Training sucked, left to fend for myself, no support. was setup to fail from the beginning. worked 50 hours each week and had nothing to show for it. zero pay."
bad,"Absolutely terrible terrible place. Don’t even apply or go to the interviews here. Poor management, poor support, commission based but set up for failure. All around poor office."
bad,"will not work unless licensed, if i am not licensed i will not get paid but they will hold your work for you but i dont know how true this is but the company from different areas wished to hire me until today and its 2018 that was back in 2012-2014 be licensed or you wont get paid and you pick how many hours you want to work...and the pay is decent ....good for the most part and benefits"
bad,The training was quite awful and the market didn't prove to be amenable to the product...particularly the Richmond market. I will say that my trainer tried but it was not eventful.
bad,"While many people did succeed as an independent sales agent, I was not one of them. The amount of work required to put in for potential reward was not worth it for a purely commission based position. I felt very uncomfortable with the way the company taught how to deal with potential clients, and seeing other agents interact first hand verified it was not for me."
bad,"Would not recommend this employer to my worst enemy. No training to do your job of selling policies and no one in management knew what was going on.  Compensation was a joke. If you want benefits,  you have to buy from them and they could be your sales. God forbid you have a issue with your deposit of any commissions. That will 2 weeks to fix."
bad,Go along with person training you helps start up your business.  Takes hundreds of door to door visits to get one sale.  Plus is dealing with business management and usually decision makers.
bad,"Canvassed industrial parks, business offices. Met with owners in order to offer their employees benefits. No assigned territories. Other agents stole sales because of there being no assigned territories."
bad,Hated Sales. Cold calling is hard in all sales jobs. I worked with a friend to help out but I hated the whole thing. Money is good if you can make the sales.
bad,"With a good leader who invests in your success when you start, you have a chance to succeed. You are making up to 40 cold calls everyday. No warm leads are provided. This is something I asked about in my interview. You're a scout for agents to come behind you and cultivate your accounts. You're also told the state looks at your productivity, which is measured by the number of cold calls per week and the money your accounts generate, to maintain your license. It may or may not be true."
bad,"I wasn't there very long don't feel comfortable leaving a review. I was only with Aflac for a few months, and honestly I am a terrible salesman. I hated the job but I was the wrong fit for it."
bad,cold calls all day in person and on phone.  market totally saturated by other aflac sales reps. some places said they are visited weekly 5 or more times a week by aflac reps.
bad,I was promised training and they told me I didn’t need any experience to start a great career. However if you can go for months without a check then you will be fine but until you book an appointment and sell insurance you don’t make anything. It will eat through your savings. No training so if you have experience you will be fine but if you don’t look somewhere else.
bad,"Now you must really be knowledgeable of sales. And for people who are considering taking this Career with them watch out, You must have LIFE & Health License and not to mention is all commission base. I wish they had told us that through our interview email instead of wasting our time and gas. SO ALL COMMISSION BASE PLUS YOU NEED YOUR LICENSE I think is a waste a TIME. Either start your own insurance company or work for a standard company this place is a waste of time."
bad,"If you are a new recruit soon to become an agent, the overall quality of your field training will depend on the cooperation of your manager. If your manager is focused and efficient, your possibility of thriving will be high, but if not, expect the exact opposite."
bad,Nothing good to talk about Aflac since it was a bad experience waste of money to get my license and waste of time. I regretted working there  overall.
bad,"I've seen first hand people can succeed at Aflac. However, it is extremely unlikely. Like most sales jobs, Aflac depends on convincing its new agents that they will be the exception, not the rule when it comes to success."
bad,"not a good place to be, if i didn't hit my numbers my job was always on the line, I didn't have the support and training that would help me be successful."
bad,"total waste of time and energy. I didn't get any guidance from anyone and I will not recommend anyone to work at this company. I wasn't happy wasting time, fuel and energy."
bad,The people were nice to work with but it was commission based pay and you didn't really have any insight or training to be able to make enough money as an intern.
bad,"Not a lot of people want Aflac these days. Sure, some do. However, it is not enough for someone on a commission only basis. Most companies offer sufficient health insurance plans to their employees as is."
bad,They made promises that were not kept pay was not what was promised. The manager was all about him self. And was not helpful at all. YOu worked from the office and at home where on call all hours even in the middle of the night. You were unable to make personnal plans due to the fact you would have to drop them to attend meeting five or more times aweek.
bad,this position didnt live up to its hype which was contingent upon me taking this job. the training was non existent and the person whom i reported to showed little interest or sincerity in working alongside me as i learned the business and started generating a book of business.
bad,"Horrible management, district manager found chosen favorite and stuck with him, everybody quit. No pay unless you landed deal and agents were constantly tripping over each other because no zone or territory. Other districts even allowed to call on our prospects. District manager was even poaching my strong possible customers."
bad,"AFLAC can be a great place if you have money to self-start.  You need about a year's worth of money saved to get this business going, otherwise you will be poorer than when you start."
bad,"No actual sales training is provided, but if you don't perform to unattainable expectations, you are vilified. Travel is done at your expense with absolutely no compensation for distance or vehicle wear. Pay is purely commission with a decreasing commission per customer per pay period (a year old customer will provide no pay though you MUST keep their records and payment information current in a separate business account).  Field Supervisors conveniently find places where cellphone reception is limited so any problems are left for the inexperienced agent to resolve."
bad,"Horrible environment.  If you want to work in a boiler room, this place would be perfect for you.  My direct Manager was very nice and helpful, but the overall management was horrendous."
bad,"Too much training on how to annoy people, not any product knowledge. No job security. Even if you make a sale people never pay their premiums, by the time you get the next sale your previous customer is lost."
bad,This company is a joke! The training is awful. You are pretty much thrown to the wolves. You sale enrollments and get paid upfront commission. If they don't pay for services you pay it back out of your pocket. Not impressed.
bad,They do not pay very well at all. They do not allow for proper training. Their idea of training: spend 1 day training. Not enough time to training anyone on policies and etc.
bad,"This is a commission only job with no start up options.  I do not recommend it unless someone has a secondary source of income."
bad,There is no integrity in this company! I had been working a client for a while and a new agent went in with the marketing manager and closed the deal for herself!
bad,I don't recommend working for this company unless you have a lot of contacts and know the territory you are working in.  You will never have solid pay unless you know a lot of people.
bad,"unless you have someone to support you while you build your base there is now way to support yourself.    if you dont have business owners you are pretty much done"
bad,"When starting AFLAC, you are told if you make appointments you can take your manager out with you and they will help you close deals. Well, my manager couldn't close a deal for the life of her so I spent months getting appointment after appointment only to have meeting after meeting wasted. I've been working at Aflac for almost  8 months and I have made a total of about 1,200 dollars, and I was working everyday and constantly being praised for my commitment and work ethic."
bad,Sounds better than what it is. The pay is awful. Very little training provided and takes a lot of time before work itself begins. It's incredibly hard to do anything
bad,It was not what it was sold to be. I had trouble with my commissions and benefits. Money would be taken from me without proper explanation as to why. When you are commission only that matters.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend , to difficult to sell, getting through the gate keeper to present to employees is literally impossible. AFLAC is a good product.  It takes at least 5 up to 12 approaches to the same customer until you can get an appointment. The mgrs at AFLAC tell you that.  They hire new agents to warm up the market then not making any $$$, you quit, then the veterans come in and get the sails"
bad,fine if you dont mind working for commision then splitting that commision with three other people. after three months i only made 400 dollars it was terrible
bad,"This is an insurance sales position.  There is no salary, only commissions.  You will be asked to give senior account representatives leads from your own family."
bad,"Waste of time, working for this company. They use you so much and don't pay a dime. cheater in insurance business? They use you for all  time and no help provided. Aflac name business hate you so bad."
bad,Selling for Aflac was a learning experience and that is the most complementary thing I can say about them. People supporting loved ones should not sell for Aflac as there is no base salary to support incoming agents.
bad,"I enjoyed working here initially ... however, as time progressed, and I could not make it financially because business owners could not -- or would not-- make a decision on whether to work with our company,  I had a family to think about and not just myself!"
bad,"they stage this place as "" you are your own boss"" and that the ""opportunities are endless"" what they mean by that is that you will be required to go essentially door to door to businesses and try to talk business owners into this coverage that they do not need. Also when you do get business ( which is a rarity) you will receive 80% of the policy upfront and if the person cancels their policy you are then required to pay that money back to the company. When I decided to leave the company I actually owed them $500!"
bad,"- Fast pace and constantly on the phone giving customer service "
bad,"Indeed is requiring a second review of AFLAC.  I was too kind in my original.  This is a poorly organized sales environment.  They are able to continue in the practice because they are not invested in the success of their reps, which are ""hired"" into a position that is 100% commission with no benefits.  They do not lose money if their reps fail, and they provide little or no organized training."
bad,Company is big on referrals and new hires because whoever bring them in gets a bonus plus a cut of their commissions. No support or training. Market is very overly saturated. They promise that you can build your own schedule but then make you come in for constant meetings during times you could be talking to people making sales. Just felt like a pyramid scheme like Herbalife or anything of that nature.
bad,"This is a hard-core sales job, no matter how much they tout it as ""account manager"" or ""benefits consultant."""
bad,"Constantly stepping on other salesperson's feet.  Consistently encountered situations where another salesman had been there the same week.  No territory, no real management."
bad,Commission only job.  I needed a more steady income.  Not a lot of support from management. A lot of time put in with little compensation in return.  Nice people to work with and give help when needed.
bad,"If your dm wasnt willing to go out and show you things, and actually prospect, you are essentially on your own and EVERYTHING YOU WORKED TO SELL,THEY GOT A % OF. Do Not Do It unless you have insurance skills and know the nonsense you are getting into."
bad,This was a 100%  commission job. You need to know the right people or be extremely outgoing and sales oriented. The whole training process was totally unorganized and felt like a pyramid scheme. I lost money to begin with.
bad,"Unless you are a seasoned sales person and can sell a ice to an Eskimo, i would not recommend this job.  I put way too many miles on my vehicle for the compensation."
bad,"This was a temp position that they lied and made you feel as if you were going to be permanent. They need more on the job training, with more experience."
bad,"If you're greedy and have no soul then it's a great place for you. The income potential is high but you must be willing to lie, cheat and steal from the working class to earn it."
bad,"I was assigned a ""mentor"" who had no interest in me succeeding.  I watched as other ""mentors"" took their ""mentees"" and gave them all the tools and support to b e successful."
bad,If you have commission experience this is not new. The market is saturated. Getting is front of the paying client is rare and typically not profitable.
bad,"market wasnt in the right place to start an income in this business. they will promise you alot, and deliver nothing. dont waste your time here, choose something else."
bad,AFLAC is strictly independent earnings and there isn't a weekly paycheck.  This created a lot of stress with my family at the time as I would be out making calls daily but there were weeks that I didn't receive a paycheck and ultimately cost me my marriage.
bad,"The office culture was quite toxic.  There were many nice people but they had to keep under radar.  "
bad,"People are reeled in by promises of making good commissions, being able to have a good work/life balance, and being able to help people.  Unfortunately, these things don't happen.  Management and long-term salespersons advocate using pressure tactics to sell the product, which does not go over well with prospective customers.  Any complaints about the difficulty of making sales are met with accusations that salespersons are not trying hard enough.  Training is done in a rush and is not detailed enough.  There is no base pay and those who do not make sales are shown the door after several months.  Salespersons go broke digging in their wallets for gas, bus fare, buying donuts, candy, etc., to lure clients, most of whom want nothing to do with supplemental insurance."
bad,Learn on your own.  Giant amount of information to learn and you get to do it by yourself.  No one Really believes that the large turnover is because of the great training.  Management just hires a lot and hope some stick
bad,No support and poor compensation plan.  This company expects you to make the larger investment in their company while you continue to make them rich with your depleting wallet.
bad,"I should have known it was a bad fit when drinking was encouraged in training. There were many promises made that were never fulfilled, mainly after traveling across the country to sell policies funding my travel from my own money and selling six figures of products the Rockwell's decided they should get 40% of my commission."
bad,"You will get screwed, you will get taken advantage of. No body will help you and also there retention rate is like 2 percent. I do not recommend......"
bad,"very hard to make money make 300 + phone calls a day and it takes forever to close the deal on a sale.  hard to focus and stay positive due to no money coming in, you don't feel like your actually working and doing something. very boring job."
bad,"This place boasts that it is a fortune 100 company but do not believe the hype. Most everyone who works there makes very little money and has to have a second, sometimes third, job."
bad,"this is a job that is straight up commission, no help, and there are times that you will not earn anything for the work you do. you only earn if you sell policies."
bad,There was little to no involvement with sales managers while prospecting or learning how to prospect new clients.  Management spent 90% of its time working with established reps rather than developing new hires.
bad,Some say it's all about hard work but it's really about how much you can take. They have you cold call endlessly and use your connections for their own benefits without you getting any sort of reward for it.
bad,"Constant unpaid work"
bad,"This is all commission based, you drive everyday wasting your time and gas with nothing in return. They tell you that you would be a manager in training but really all they want you to do is be a sales agent and promise you anything to get you on. You spend 1000s of dollars to work there with nothing in return and the people you work with are stuck up and act like they are better than you. The team lead doesn't do anything for you, all they do is tell you to go with another agent and learn. They don't have any time to train you, they just send you out with no way of knowing what you are doing not give you any info about the product. Worst place I have ever worked and would not recommend anyone to try it unless you have a ton of money and time to waste. I would rather work in a factory then to work with an agency that doesn't appreciate you and expects you to waste your money for them. They will tell you that you will become a manager for the Galax area but really all you will be is a sales agent and travel from Roanoke to West Virginia to Tennessee to North Carolina and waste all your time and money to just go from business to business and not make a single sale."
bad,"Worst job ever, pay is precarious. a typical day is being sent out to an area (not being reimbursed for gas) trying to get small business to buy insurance even though they cant afford it."
bad,This was the slowest paced work place i have ever  been involved with. If you enjoy sittig in front of a phone all day and cold calling then this place is for you.
bad,"DO NOT fall for Aflac's ""internship."" It will do nothing to prepare you for any career other than in sales.  I don't know anyone I worked with who made any money over the entire summer.  You have to use your own gas money to canvass and basically harass and lie to businesses.  My ""boss"" lied to me and told me I would be compensated for the $70 insurance license that I was required to get before starting the job, but I never was.  Waste of time, waste of money.  Aflac agents are slimy people."
bad,Growing your book of business was a challenge. Self supportive when traveling to various locations to meet potential clients.
bad,Does not care about their Sales Agents.  Puts a hundred out in the field and only cares about the Company getting paid. Not enough training and you feel like you are being thrown out to the wolves.
bad,"Aflac was a great place to work. Hired too many people over the years, too many departments doing the same thing. Leadership shouldn't be in the roles they play. No room for growth. Promotions are given based on the buddy system."
bad,"This company is nothing short of a pyramid scheme.  "
bad,"Overall this company sucks. No structure.Their training is cold call as many people as you can and sell something.If this doesn't work- repeat first step."
bad,Don't waste your time. They never mention during the interview process that all you make is commission. NO BASE SALARY!!!
bad,"I worked at an Aflac regional office located in Centennial, CO. For your sake, DO NOT accept an interview there. They will lure you in with ""flexibility"" and ""make as much as you want"". "
bad,"This wasn't a great experience. Training was rushed. Not much support was offered from management. They hire too many people at once, and, they soon quit because they're not making it. There is no base pay, you work on commissions only."
bad,"This was a terrible experience for me, paid for my licencing and was promised a large salary. Ended up chasing leads so others could make money off my leads. This left a bad taste for insurance sales."
bad,"cold calling is a dieing or dead form of advertisement and thats what AFLAC preaches. there is very little training and the promise of ""unlimited upward movement"" and no pay ceiling. The reality is unless you get very lucky with a large company very early, you wont make money for 6 months. you work largely on your own with no help from your superiors. no health benefits and no salary, its strictly commission based. the office itself was a mess with customers personal information all over the place and no organization."
bad,"We (5 other interns) made cold calls all day. First we had to go through training so we could pass state insurance exams that we didn't get compensated for by are ""mentors."" If you're good at making cold calls then you might do well depending on what area you are selling aflac benefits to."
bad,"It's amazing this company has gotten away with this BS for so long. First, they prey on unemployed, down-on-their luck people. They bring you in, make all these promises, fill your head with ideas, and then... nothing."
bad,"This is commission only, they offer you the world, but you are broke, driving to far locations to talk to people who aren't interested in buying what you sell. Go sell health or life insurance instead."
bad,"This is the worst company I've ever worked for.  I was super excited as this was my first insurance job and hoping it'd be a career.  The training was what really killed it for me.  The training was super weak and most of the time I felt severely pressured to make a sale with no knowledge of what I am selling.  Given sales requires some improv and is basically making connections with people that like you and want to do business with you.  That part was not so difficult, the difficult part was competing with other Aflac agents NOT other insurance companies, the lack of training, and no sort of pay to help get started other than make a commission."
bad,"Don't fall for the brainwashing highp they feed you you will not make money in commissions management steals it from you initially and then it reduces to 2% or so. Slave labor they expect you to make 500 phone calls even though it doesn't generste any business and even though you don't get paid so in short you are working for free. "
bad,There are some people who succeed and make a ton of money there but 95% of the people who start there never make any money after they sell everything they can to their relatives. My manager took all the good call-in leads and left me to wander the streets looking for income seven days a week until I had to quit and get a real job.
bad,Company makes you pay to get your license and does not assist for expenses.
bad,"Sold products including accident plans, sickness plans, life insurance and hospital indemnity plans."
bad,A typical day at work with AFLAC is awesome.  I learned so much in the sales academy.  Management was a little bias.   I love my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was going cold calling.   The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the people.
bad,"As a company, I would recommend their products to everyone. The office that I work at is another thing. The supervisor that hired me trained me for three days and then stopped to train a new agent. My supervisor told me that she would make sure that one of the other senior agents continued my training. That was mid-March of this year and I have yet to be contacted by any of the other agents to continue my training."
bad,"Don't waste your time"
bad,"The main aspect of Alfac is generating business. Lots of business to business marketing. They talk about great training, and that they won't put you out there in the field on your own without gaining some experience and success with a mentor.  However, it's still commission only, and while they make a lot of talk about the desire to help get that first sale, and that such mentoring is encouraged, there is a sense where they also know that they get a cut in their returns if they help you.  Not to mention, while they brag about how companies flock to them, the experience in door to door with the businesses and their experience with the company is quite a different story from the one they tell you."
bad,"Aflac may be for some people, but I did not like the total lack of structure and straight commission compensation."
bad,"It's a scam, cattle call or revolving door. The top 2% make it and the rest either struggle or fail. Hardcore sales. They only give you 2 months then cancel your contract. In the time I was there I had 2 small groups and some other big ones in my sales pipeline. Guess it wasn't enough. They dissed me and will probably get themselves some paydays from my work. They also expect you to recruit people. It was unprofessional. My so called district manager didn't have a clue about what he was doing. They thought it was cool to bad mouth other people that came and went before me at meetings in front of everyone. My manager also insulted me with strange comments I'd rather not repeat. He was an unqualified and disrespectful person. The general public and most businesses don't like Aflac. Go ask them if you don't believe me. Constant cold calling and door knocking hitting the same people over and over again. It's not an easy sell right now with everything up in the air over insurance. All they offer is ancillary supplemental polices. I would stay away from this opportunity and company unless you already have businesses lined up and know the management at the office where you applied, otherwise you're going to get screwed."
bad,i did not enjoy working for this company. I felt as if there was not enough help or training provided.
bad,"you are on your own with training, and finding colleagues to help without first seeking payment for themselves"
bad,"The product is great.  Working for this company is a disaster!  Financial investment large.  Experienced agents want all of your leads.  My district manager was more interested in talking about what trips and parties you can win, than helping you.  Drunk at every function. Unprofessional in every aspect.  I tried to start business with a friend of mine who owned a company with several hundred employees.  I was not allowed to work with them because I was not ""experienced"".  Delayed in every way possible.  They have a revolving door for new agents.  Overall, a horrible, horrible experience.  Run away as fast as you can!!!"
bad,"Did not enjoy working since I did not get paid"
bad,A typical day at work is cold calling and door to door sales.  I've learned a lot about the benefits of insurance.  Management with this company is on a call basis.  The hardest part of the job is the cold calls.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working without supervision.
bad,"Setting appointments, meeting with decision maker, meet with workers to discuss options with Aflac, the management staff is always available and very helpful, co-workers are fun to work with, keep my job enjoyable, the hardest part of my job is setting appointments and making enough money, the most enjoyable part is working with people,"
bad,All they care about is themselves and making them money they don't help you
bad,"Attend meetings, seminars and programs to learn about new products and services, learn new skills, and receive technical assistance in developing new accounts.  Calculate premiums and establish payment method.  Call on policyholders to deliver and explain policy, to analyze insurance program and suggest additions or changes, or to change beneficiaries.  Confer with clients to obtain and provide information when claims are made on a policy.  Contact underwriter and submit forms to obtain binder coverage.  Customize insurance programs to suit individual customers, often covering a variety of risks.  Develop marketing strategies to compete with other individuals or companies who sell insurance. Ensure that policy requirements are fulfilled, including any necessary medical examinations and the completion of appropriate forms.  Explain features, advantages and disadvantages of various policies to promote sale of insurance plans.  Explain necessary bookkeeping requirements for customer to implement and provide group insurance program. Inspect property, examining its general condition, type of construction, age, and other characteristics, to decide if it is a good insurance risk. Install bookkeeping systems and resolve system problems. Interview prospective clients to obtain data about their financial resources and needs, the physical condition of the person or property to be insured, and to discuss any existing coverage."
bad,"Commission based, No guidance, No training. This was a difficult anf cut-throat working atmosphere."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of numerous contracts being faxed and emailed for processing. We receive contracts and licenses from all 50 state offices on any given day. There is a lot to learn in my position the biggest thing is the different way that each state office handles business in relation to their agents. My management and coworkers make my job easier because everyone does their job utilizing traning given by company. The hardest part of the job is the limitations of advancement within department. However, the bottom line is to assist agents in the field, This happens to be the most enjoyable part of my job. The understanding that we are essential components of the fullfilment of business."
bad,No support from manager had to learn on own. travel for training and no reimbursement
bad,"There is nothing scummier than what AFLAC does. They hire anyone and everyone and hope to use them as assets in order to find some sort of networking connections to big companies. The product should sell itself, and instead employees are left to cold-call lists of people who have been cold-called by AFLAC for the past 5 years."
bad,"I would go out and try to build a customer base and when I would get a customer, I had to let my field supervisor know. She would then go out and see them herself and take the customer as her own and get the commission. I learned that you cannot trust some of your supervisors. Management was not supportive. I had little to no interaction with co-workers due to being out in the field all day. The hardest part of the job was working all those hours and not getting paid. There was no enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"there was no training, was told to read this now walk down this street cause I dont think anyones been down there and go door to door and talk about what you just read."
bad,alfacs lack of training led to my resignation
bad,This job isn't for everyone! A typical day coul be frustrating. I learned to be toughskin. Management coul be better. Co-workers hustle to make a buck or two. the hardest part of the job is getting customers. There is no enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Schedule appointment and meeting with business owner to offer product to their employees
bad,Door-to-door......one rejection after another. Sucked big time.
bad,uneducated people that want to make a fast buck
bad,They provided the training and then it is all you. You have to be a go getter and very social. A typical day was cold calling and calling warm leads. To try and set appointments to go over the products with potential clients. It could have been a great job if I was not an at home mom with 2 toddlers.
bad,G & K Services is no longer located in Columbus due to downsizing.
bad,It all sounds good but after the interview and the work started it was not too great. I ended up spending a lot of money travelling on commission base only - the company did not provide a single lead. At night I had to do research for the next day of travel and leads.
bad,At Aflack their only concern was that you make money so they could make money. Nobody was willing to help you. You were left to learned everything on your own. This was the worse job ever.
bad,"Do not be fooled by what they tell you and how much money you can make here. Once you get hired you have to take your license exam and YOU DO NOT GET THAT MONEY BACK as promised. If you pass the exam then you are expected to go prospecting to different companies trying to get people to enroll in policies. Every day you approach a set number of businesses and hear no after no after no. You're lucky if you speak to the owner but most likely the answer is going to be no. There is little money to be made working here unless you are successful in opening accounts and have a good relationship with people in the community already. Little training is given on how to successfully approach a business owner and close the sale. They also do not give you accounts to work that are already accounts; you start from scratch. If you're lucky enough to go on an enrollment for an existing account, even then you won't make a lot of money because it's not your account and the commission is being split between 5 different people. Plus every day you are driving around wasting gas and most likely eating out. You will go broke working at this job before you actually earn a commission. Management is okay but too busy worrying about their accounts to be much help with new agents. I would definitely not recommend working for this company unless you have a ton of money saved and can waste your time all day chasing leads that may or may not turn into accounts. It takes about 3-4 months before you see any money come your way."
bad,"Do not recommend this organization to work for. Poor management, no pay.  These people wanted you to work for free.  I was going broke.  There was no financial support while looking for clients.  The individual above me didn't have any right to train me because he was hired about a month prior to me being hired."
bad,"Time after time i was lied to by the Regional Manager about goals, support, bonuses and underwriting guidlines.  A few times i found out he was telling other managers about my prospects."
bad,"All they ever talk about is how they want you to sign more people up to sell insurance so you get 5% of what they make. Its a pyramid scheme. They act accepting at first but that quickly changes to them expecting you to conform to their ""look"". Dont plan on making money here for a few months. Two months and all we ended up doing was spending approximately $200. And then they expect you to constantly go to workshops and classes, which are ""mandatory""....wait but you havent paid me a dime. Its likely a job that pays off in the long run, but if you want a roof over your head in the meantime, tthe overspass looks nice. Smh."
bad,100% commission with NO protected territories.  Found myself starving and stumbling over other Aflac sales reps within my area.  Outstanding insurance plans but too cutthroat to work for with companies knowing that most sales reps don't last a year so they don't have a strong desire to do business with them.
bad,"The recruiter lied about what kind of job it was and how the pay is structured. You’ll need a part time job to compensate for your time with Aflac. You get small (maybe) $20 deposits randomly from policies your supervisor helped you sell. No way enough to pay for a bill though. I barely was able to afford gas in my car for all the PROSPECTING I was told to do. You are left on your own with barely any training and be hopeful you don’t have to share your commissions with another fellow new agent. This is a SALES, DOOR TO DOOR, 100% COMMISSION job! You won’t have a solid income until MAYBE after 4 months of employment depending on how much you sell. I was there 2 months and couldn’t afford my bills, WITH all the “bonuses” they claim you have opportunities to earn."
bad,"Unless you are willing to dedicate your whole life to Aflac, meaning at least 50 hours a week you will not really succeed and although it is good for some people they promise you that in your first year you'll make so much money and by the end of 2 years you'll be making 6 figures. In reality you'll go broke spending your own money to try to fund yourself to do all of this that in reality they didn't warn you about and you'll most likely end up owing Aflac if one of your clients decides to stop paying their bill. Do not recommend working there unless you already make good money and can afford to lose money for a while and are willing to put everything else aside to strictly commit your life to Aflac."
bad,"joined in 2008, had lot of opportunity to grow as most leaders did not know what to and how to do, every one just doing busy job with out a vision, lot of politics every one trying to others down rather than working as a team, lot of show-off, everyone is related to other as some kind ex relation ... great marketing though. long story short, i was told multiple times by leaders in 8 years i was there, that, I make other people look bad, as i work hard, seriously, and, that, we don't have to speak our mind when the leader on the table thinks otherwise, well, i a fact based person, so left the company, to work where i can work hard and speak my mind with facts."
bad,Position is not what I was trained to do. The management team was supportive but the guidance is non existent. Typical sales environment with sink or swim attitude. Realized that this is not the career for me.
bad,"It's a door to door sales job.  They don't pay any benefits, they don'r give you refferals, there are no territories, there is no support. You just get sent out to knock on random doors. Sometimes I was given a list of places to go and found many of the businesses were closed sometimes the buildings weren't even standing anymore. "
bad,"Long hours, low pay, no training, cold calls , terrible leads, terrible management. The market is already saturated. Very hard to land and keep new accounts"
bad,"Let me start by saying that the Aflac products are awesome.  I have them myself and would not let them go for anything.  The Aflac in my area hired as many people as were willing to take and pass the state license testing.  The idea is to get a few small business opportunities that the new agent may know then turn these over to the long time agents for renewal purposes.  New agents do not get to share in the existing customer pool to at least make some money to survive while prospecting.  Long time agents, that are already receiving renewals and didn't want to go out pulling doors, serviced the few companies that were brought in by new agents that had to leave due to not making an income.  So if interested in working at Aflac have at least 12 months reserves to be able to get your book of business working."
bad,"No Compensation for hard work. No matter how much you sell, you are not paid for any of it. That includes clients who re-up their insurance or even add other products for added protection. They do take care of their clients and pay out accordingly."
bad,"This by far has been the worst company that I have worked for. Minimum pay, no room to advance and favoritism is showed, throughout the company. Education and experience will not get you anywhere in this company."
bad,A lot of driving around to places to make sales which in the most part potential clients were already clients under other sales associates. Sales leads were poorly kept track of.
bad,I tried this for 10 months.  Upline likes to take your commision but at same time says they want you to succeed.  Big joke in my opinion.  Ill never do it again nor would I ever recommend anyone I care about.
bad,"Spent a lot of money traveling, Doing bus to bus door knocking. Just not for me. Drive 100 miles before starting to drive from bus. to bus."
bad,"No warm leads. No support. No pay. "
bad,"Working at Aflac would be a little bit more enjoyable if my department had supervisors and team leads who actually wanted to help you; instead of saying think outside the box, how about you try assisting your employees and helping us understand what needs to be done. We are supposed to get 2 walk arounds everyday from a team lead who sometimes never shows up or if the person doing the walk around is off, none of the other team leads will come around and check on you. They always have their Instant Message statuses on Busy or Do Not Disturb, you can walk over to see them and they give you this look or say they are so busy.....its ridiculous. We have a heavy workload with not enough employees to manage. They harp so much on production but its hard to meet production when you have to go through a middle person (account manager) to get information and they are backed up. I am a temp employee right now through Randstad and I would not recommend Randstad or applying at Aflac for Accounting Specialist positions to anyone."
bad,Aflac is great if you want to have a relationship with a company that doesn't owe you anything except some commissions.
bad,They hire as many people as possible to sell their products. Work areas are way over populated with sales associates. Sales are very hard to come by however if you sign up accounts often you can make great money.
bad,"AFLAC expects everyone to use up all their personal contacts then if you can survive, great if not you leave behind all the accounts that you opened!"
bad,"First off, you pay for your license. From the start I should have know to not work here. You are basically a sales person that goes door to door begging for an appointment. They tell you to go back to get the appointment, but guess what Managers....gas is not cheap to be going back and forth and driving all over the city. There are no assigned territories so local businesses get tired of agents coming in each week. "
bad,"This position turns you into no less than a door to door salesman. Other than your training course, you get no help other than constant nagging from management. Not only are you now a coldcaller, but you get little to no compensation. The only pay you receive is at least a month in when you finally manage to sign a new business, but if they don't pay their account you owe that money back."
bad,Communication is non-existent! Management doesn't provide any feedback & as a Contractor you'll be excluded from a majority of EVERYTHING; even the ability to do your job successfully. Just be careful working as a Contractor because there is an 18 month rule where you'll get let go vs achieving a permanent position for all the hard work done!
bad,"The internal company legal team's biased relationship with HR engages in unethical illegal behaviors resulting in lawsuits being settled, high employee turn over and abuse of power."
bad,This was a horrible decision I made to work for this company. The interview is where they sell you the dream of being successful and the need for these products in the area you work in.  In the interview I was told that they would pay for everything needed to work for them including your license. I fell for this and it didn't work. the whole job is call calling without leads and you also have other people working in the area calling the same people which by the time you call they're angry. the training is pointless because the system always have bugs and the people who hired you are never able to help unless they will make money off of you. You have to attend meeting that you aren't paid for which I did for an entire month. so after  that month I quit and now they say I have to pay for the stuff they said they would pay for which is a joke. so if you come across this job in the Mississippi area just say no because its completely not worth it. But most importantly if something sounds to good to be true it usually is.
bad,Started out good but only as long as you were bringing new business. Training was not very good and not a good support system from the District Manager I had
bad,"If you have a lot of business connections you may be able to make it.  They don’t teach you how to build connections, they just tell you to “ get out and go to 25 business/day that have not been persued by any other agents.”  During my time with the company the Regional Manager got ousted for stealing the district managers rent money and the not paying the rent on the regionals office.  The New Manager came in and fired the lowest selling agent in each district."
bad,"Aflac does not have good policies and processes in place.  If people"
bad,Horrible company to work for.  Strictly commission based.  Market is flooded already and no one wants the product so you are stuck driving around for nothing wasting time.
bad,"No real chance to make money, having to split commissions with established salespersons and no chance in this market to establish new clients. The Region runs contests 2 or 3 times a year to encourage 70+ Associates they hire every 3 months to squeeze their friends and relatives to buy Insurance policies... Then you had to split those commissions with your District Sales Coordinator to keep them fed.  A terrible company who should be ashamed that they provide NO benefits to their sales staff!!!  You don't even get a discount on rates or merchandise you are REQUIRED to purchase!!!"
bad,"Agism, promotions based on who you know.  Become friends with management  and you can advance. If you are over 50 and want to advance, then forget it."
bad,They hook you in with all the.beneifits but fail to explain to you the job is work on commission and the manager you are assigned to if they are not good with communication then you will fail at your job and not get paid
bad,"This one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. The management lies, telling you your gonna make 65,000.00 the first year. I saw agents setting up accounts taking employees from another business and getting a new account. I worked my butt off the first year getting my fast start and other goals on my own..."
bad,"Setting up cold calls, data entry, presenting new offerings for current clients, filing claims for current clients, attending meetings, speaking with other insurance sales people about effective selling."
bad,"The product was a very good investment, just a little over priced."
bad,"Seriously the job itself SOUNDS great but trust me. It’s a lot of wear and tear on your vehicle, 1099 tax form so you’re paying a chunk of taxes. You could be the best sales person but still not be good enough. People today really aren’t looking to purchase insurance and if they don’t purchase you don’t get paid. They make you believe you’ll bring home $4,500 your first month. No you do not! Like I said you can pitch the greatest sale to a group of 30 people and then only 2 buy it. That’s not good enough. Please. Don’t waste your time. It’s like a pyramid scheme.  It to mention in the beginning your trainer gets majority of the commission 90/10 is how they split it even though you are doing all of the work."
bad,"- Talking with business owners. Explaining how Aflac policies help or hurt small businesses. "
bad,"Insurance Sales is a cut-throat business and competitors did not treat new comers fairly.  Sales were hard to come by and there was no base salary.  Therefore if there was no sale, there was no income."
bad,"The group in Boise hyped an excellent training program, but I found myself out in the field by myself, and without my DSC. Don't waste time with them."
bad,"I loved working for Aflac. It was a self drive enviroment. I enjoyed helping people with their policies from selling the policies to the policies helping families in need. I would get up every morning and go door to door business selling. In between calls I would help customers with their claims from poison ivy to cancer. My favorite part was watching the relief on customers faces when their claim was paid. Unfortunately when a claim took all day, that was a day lost for pay."
bad,"Very disappointed, it is like a fraternity , you have to know someone to get any help. Cold calling I see some DSC’s helping the new people mine didn’t at all never prospected  with me , half of the time didn’t even answer text messages. I could have done the job if I had  a better DSC , but when you get absolutely no support and no interaction from your new supervisor it’s very disturbing , the few times I met with him all he did was look at his watch waiting to go to lunch with his boys in the office.  Very unprofessional, he has such a poor personality,  I wonder how he sold anything.  I think you can do well at AFLAC if you have proper support and someone wants to mentor you and develop you.  The DSC’s should have previous management experience so they know how to train and develop people. At least I did get my life and health license out of them will put it to use elsewhere I where there is training and developement."
bad,"This is a 1099 position, market was inundated with aflac agents who would market and area and be gone in 2 weeks.  Consumers were not happy to talk to us and conditions to market were unfavorable."
bad,They have you sit in this mandatory training class that you are not getting paid for and guarantee that you will succeed but how do you survive at the beginning with no money
bad,"Management is not very good, hard to sell voluntary supplemental benefits to businesses only, not on the open market."
bad,"I felt as though the amount of support given was completely misrepresented, particularly for a new agent. During the initial recruitment presentation, I asked if they helped with leads, training, planning a path to success for new agents and the response was yes to all of my questions.  Approximately 6 weeks after starting, they finally sent me to ""Sales Training"" and the whole week was focused on getting appointments in scripted, role play sessions. They only want appointment setters. When I directly asked for help by giving me advice on how to successfully plan my career with Aflac, knowing that the person empowered to help me had a significant amount of experience & success, my request was treated as an objection that needed to be overcome rather than giving me useful guidance?  Also, when I tried to share some feedback on what would be helpful, the reply I received was, ""This is how we do things, we are not open to changing the way we work!"" Needless to say, the majority of new agents end up leaving after working for a few months without pay or support. There is a lack of organization, there is an overt amount of favoritism shown/given to certain cliques within the office and a poor overall culture."
bad,"I was sold the dream for Aflac but wound up finding it to be quite the opposite. The targets laid out for me and the return guaranteed by hitting those targets was shockingly disappointing. After hitting and exceeding targets for six months, I was left with nothing but debt from having worked at Aflac! Unless you know someone in the business who will deal you into their piece of the pie, I would discourage you from taking a sales position here. Look for greener pastures."
bad,"This was not a good working environment because the company had so many agents in the field already hounding companies to purchase the products that there was no room for growth. The companies were hostile towards new agents coming in and it was stressful to find enough interested companies to even make a profit. I had to pay back my salary because people jumped on their contracts. Basically, I didn't get paid for my work and dedication. "
bad,wouldn't advise it you would need two jobs to avoid losesConduct outbound lead follow-up calls to potential and existing customers via telephone and e-mail to qualify leads and to sell products and services.
bad,"They start by making the interview process seem very serious and selective. "
bad,"AFLAC isn't all it is ""quacked"" up to be!"
bad,It is a basic sales job. Meetings are very cult like with lots of hype to try to get new agents to drink the kool-aid. Not a place to work if you are in immediate need of money. Purely commision based.
bad,"I had such high expectations for this commission only field position with AFLAC.  I had their supplemental benefits and still maintain them to this day. I love and will never get rid of them.  Working for them was another matter entirely.  I nearly starved because of the long drive (when i requested a position near my house) and they continued to have me drive more than an hour and half each way.  They never provided the training and mentoring that they touted during my interview.  I was there everyday for 6 weeks before my supervisor trainer even took me on my first ride along.  I struggled without experience in field, or supplemental sales experience.  I would not recommend this position for anyone just getting there insurance credential and not having an existing book of business prior to going into a commission only position.  I have found in recent jobs that I am more suited to a more business casual call center type position, where i can take my time getting to know my customer's instead of appointments in the hot weather in suits and ties going to field appointments, which cancel without notice and unpredicatible variables of field sales."
bad,"Aflac recruits independent consultants so they can use them as cheap labor. You foot all the bills, they do not have to offer you health insurance, workmans comp, savings plan, etc since you are a 1099 employee. Saves them a ton of money at your expense!  During the interview and the so called training they keep telling you about building ""your"" business. Not true! It will never be your own business. You are just marketing THEIR product to businesses who generally can't stand Aflac. Most business owners cringe when they find out your an Aflac agent because you are probably the 5th one that has came in their doors that week. The market is saturated with Aflac agents even though your DSC swears you are the only agent within the area. Complete lies! Please do yourself a favor and ignore any job listings for Aflac agents."
bad,"I was a cold calling pawn.  You are paid nothing unless you can manage to set up a meeting with your supervisor and a company you called.  These are from a cold call list who 99.999% do not wish to hear from you, at all.  If you enjoy being cussed out, hung up on, or just generally wasting time then this is the internship for you."
bad,recruiters will paint you a pretty picture but none is what its set out to be. Management does not know what they are doing and very disrespectful to their employees. it is really all a waste of time. all the businesses are already taken and only the scraps are left for the new agents and those are the hardest clients to enroll in the program. So not worth your time.
bad,"made decent money, but your superiors only care if you produce. terrible training methods. new boss every week it seemed like. and you spend so much of your own money running all over the place."
bad,"I worked for Aflac for 6 months out of Lawrenceville,GA.  Ron Kirkland's district.  Like everyone that starts this job, I was very eager to get out and get to selling. There were some red light signals but, I am from the world of sales and I understand that you have to really work hard.  Here is my review:"
bad,"My most common objection, ""You are the third AFLAC rep we have seen this week!"""
bad,"All management care about is there wallets don’t fall into the trap "
bad,"The hardest part of the job was going out every day and trying to find businesses that had at least three people who were interested in a policy.  Also, business owners that would make appointments, then cancel/ reschedule.  I had a business owner say that they wanted to cancel all the policies in effect. My supervisor said she didn't know what to do about that"
bad,"So many things that are not told or explained up front, no training on that truly affect your ability to be your best and can cause you to end up owing them in the end. I don't mind hard work but not being told the reality of the job and only the good things makes me feel lied to. So many things that you can't control that play a part on how you are paid"
bad,"Just stay away unless you want to be in a cult or enjoy being preached to, serious they have ministers roaming the halls all day everyday, crazy crazy place."
bad,"Unless you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone...then you aren't going to make it in this ""business"". You'll be promised 90 days of training and receive less than a weeks worth. Some aren't even trained yet and told to ""go market"" without knowing what to say or do. These people above you are ruthless and unless you're directly making them immediate money then you're worthless to them and not worth their time to train - this is straight from the hiring boss to two agents reaching out to him for help. Lovely, right? Unless you just want to go waste a ton of gas money for little to no pay, then have at it. If you're in dire need of money to pay bills...do NOT waste your time here. They'll sell you a dream but you'll drown in your bills trying to achieve it."
bad,Aflac is strictly commission. You put in a hard days work and not get paid.Commissions are not great either.All the large accounts are already taken. In the beginning all the managers arenreal nice to yiou in the beginnining and when they decide they've gotten out of you all the accounts you brought with you and are not producing anymore then all the niceness is over!
bad,"The presentation  of the positions available was in no shape or way what the reality of what working for this company was like. I suggest anyone that wants to lose 50 lbs, go to work here."
bad,the opportunity wasn't there. they hired too many people without support people building their business. veterans undercut new people consistently. no benefits.
bad,No salary or benefits - Paid commission only. Lots of phone work to get appointments. Selling is to benefit managers at companies - many are tired of hearing from Aflac and aren't interested in adding it to their benefits package.
bad,"There are over 1,000 Aflac Agents in the State of Oklahoma and I also hear in Arkansas. Over saturated markets."
bad,"This job is commission based only. Training needs to be improved. I got trained for one week and was put on my own to find business, and close deals. If you ask for help the management team will not help you. The work standards and services provided are not clear."
bad,"The position came with a lot of promises, that fell short of training.  Still no income after 30days but often promises to achieve them.  Many internal conflicts of resentment of middle management putting associates in the middle."
bad,"High turnover, training in sales unpaid and kept changing.  No financial support from company.  Many of companies in area are either current clients or have been clients."
bad,"Friends promote friends regardless of work abilities, education or experience. Leadership is horrible. No organization, policies change daily. No desk procedures to follow or adequate training."
bad,Great job if you want to start your own business in insurance field.
bad,There was no direction or leadership within this company.  It was hard to make a decent living and worrisome not knowing when you might get paid again.
bad,"The initial sales training was good, but once I was turned over to my DSC (District Sales Coordinator), there was very little support or assistance. When I asked my RSC (Regional Sales Coordinator), to place me with someone more willing to train me, he refused. After this, when I attended meetings and training, I was ignored and treated as an outsider. Nevertheless, Aflac has great products."
bad,"Stay away from position. Nepotism, racism and over aggressive sales first not service culture. Districts are always competing against others instead of working together."
bad,I left a job in a stable career for the hope of a new advancement. I fought hard and got a lot of meetings but the management was unable to seal the deal. Working on commission only i starved and was unable to make it.  I had the opportunity to close a large account but after other benefit advisors rushed in the account fell apart and so did any chance of me making any commission.
bad,Unless you are in the inner circle of the district you get overlooked. Be prepared to work tirelessly and spend tons of money cold calling. Work here if you enjoy being in the poor house. It’s a constant push to bring in more agents. There are no defined areas for agents be prepared to be undercut by others even after you do all the footwork and the company does nothing about it. Not the company that they claim to be.
bad,"Poor management is the primary reason why employees leave an organization. This position is 100% commission, I am not the primary bread winner in the family and was looking for a better work life balance. Well, the entire experience as a whole was OK. There are corrupt individuals in Aflac, selling plans to those who don’t need it and when they do face a traumatic event, these seasoned account managers are less likely to assist clients. Policy holders aren’t the priority, it’s always about new accounts, new policies and hitting quotas. I joined this company because it’s a good product to educate employees, those who need it could benefit from it. Due to poor management, corrupt team (the manager for this region has her husband, daughter and her best friend works for her) she moved all of them from Fresno. Absolutely no regard for “doing what’s right even when no ones looking”. No One wants to work for free and when your leaders are only there to take advantage of others, you leave. You run away."
bad,"Be prepared to work with no base salary.  This is strictly commission.  You are hired full time, they'll send you to training but first you will need to come up or provide names of prospects.  You are going door to door, introduce yourself from one business to business.  As long as you collected at least 40 contacts or names you are good but what good is it when you're not able to talk to the business owner who makes decision of signing up its employees for supplemental insurance. If you don't have other source of income this is not the job for you.  The management is all about sign ups.  As I said you will be going door to door.  If you're lucky out of those 40 businesses you may be able to sign up one, two or three or no sign up at all.  The management expect you to collect 40 contacts everyday."
bad,Not a good place to work if you actually want to make a decent living. Commission only and way too many agents in the same area. They want you to go into businesses and try to talk the owner into a meeting to discuss and sell insurance. Most of the places had already seen or spoken to an agent. Management was not much help either they send you to try and get accounts that they have bugged and bugged and the owners still aren’t interested. I wouldn’t recommend this job as a main source of income. Hours of cold calling as well. You will work hours and hours trying to get an appointment and hear a lot of No’s. And get no pay no matter how hard you work unless you’re able to get an owner to let you speak with their employees and they enroll
bad,"I was actually referred into Aflac and giving an interview. At the interview which was a bit short and only one interview (two if you count the one I had at a Panera Bread) bit weird but the main point is I was offered 2,000 a month plus commission. The 2,000 a month was supposed to be a guarantee for up to 6 months. So my first day at Aflac I was made to give a presentation which I shared no commission in and honestly I was fine with it but my issue during that time was that I knew absolutely nothing and they wanted to me give a presentation just because I was bilingual. And during training when I was then told I would be going business to business cold calling which is what I did not sign up for I still gave it 100% because I'm not the type to do anything with a half hearted effort. Anyways I had no contact with any team members when I would reach out everyone was to busy, and would we would have meetings everyone preached about how team oriented everyone was but when you called or texted everyone was to good to help out in the slightest bit. And when I did help out I was payed as a non employee. And not to mention they did not even follow their own procedures. I could have contacted home office but would it be worth it probably not, and at the office where I was at it was one top Aflac player who incorporated his family into the business with a very few others involved. not to mention they don't even give competitive insurance for their employees."
bad,"Making lots of cold calls on the phone ONLY. No pay until you are licensed and have CLOSED/ completed deals. You are your own IT, Administrative Assistant, Sales and Marketing Manager. You start off working in an office utilizing it's resources (i.e. lead lists, phones, office supplies, etc.) only to find out that you are required to pay for all those things eventually."
bad,"A typical day at work is hundreds of phone calls.  I learned how to be a cold-caller specialist, run my own business, manage an office, take on many roles, market myself in person."
bad,feast or famine. Get ready for the revolving door. Employee turn over is high to say the least. One in every 15 employees make it. Due to unreliable income.
bad,A typical day involved cold calling businesses in person or on the phone. Upon hiring you were led to believe that you in essence had a loosely defined territory without knowing there were already numerous agents in that exact same territory calling on the same businesses selling the same product.
bad,"Everyone that works there are related are sleeping together. If you aren’t in that circle, don’t waste your time.   The environment is very passive aggressive and racist."
bad,"I was terminated from my position, due to severe allergies. I was told Aflac could not do anything to improve the environment, in which they could have. Cleaning the work areas & shampooing the carpets is not unreasonable to ask. I felt discrimated against because of my health condition."
bad,"Great flexibility with work and life.  However, it's over populated and they only want people who can bring money in by knowing a lot of people.  It is over saturated with people who sell it and it a stressful job as far as you can't have a part-time job and do this  It is an all day full dedicated and lots and lots of cold calling and people saying NO!"
bad,"Aflac is a great insurance company, and they have great customer service skills, only one con,support services management could be better with there employees."
bad,"First 'end of quarter"" I was there, my manager asked if I wanted to ""learn"" how to write policy... Well that ""learning"" was writing myself TWO BEEFED UP policies.   He gets 5% of that AND made his Quota and got an bonus.  I'm stuck paying the bill."
bad,"Standard sales position.  The meetings are over inflated to make it appear that people are selling more than they are due to their point system.   After working as an agent for 5 years I  can say that they do not care about their agents.   During my first 2 years things went great.  3rd year they started THE BROKER INITIATIVE which cost me 6 accounts that year that I setup.    Because of this my partner quit and I backed off of cold calling and focused on managing my accounts.  now the brokers are able to walk in to your accounts and take them over simply by saying they are a broker.   After they do this you can't even talk to your account to find out if it was done legit or just a blind robbery."
bad,"When I started with Aflac, I was told by the regional director that I would receive 60% of what I sold, since it is 100% commission based.  Once I was in training, I was told this wasn't the case.  If fact, as an agent you only make about 20% of what you sell.  You end up spending a lot more on gas, food, materials then you make.  Most first year agents work for a loss the first year.  You do get to make your own schedule, which is the only plus.  If you live in the Iowa City area, the market is HORRIBLE with agents who got accounts and then didn't take care of them, so they don't want Aflac.  Working for Aflac was a waste of my time and money!  "
bad,This may have been a great opportunity 15 years ago but I found out the hard way that everyone that's been in business for over 3 months has been hounded by an Aflac agent. Unless you personally know a lot of small business owners you will have a hard time writing any business. They sign up agents in droves promising great things and watch 95% of them fail without much support.
bad,"I spent more money trying to work than I actually made. I spent money on gas, food and testing and never received compensation"
bad,They really didn't assign territories so the market is heavily saturated
bad,"Lots of Promises, no follow through. Training is great gives lots of experience to draw on. However, if you need a salaried job or an income in three months, they tell you its a business of your own but the dscs find ways to try and manage you even though they do not give you benefits or salary. Sales school is great and this is good to think of as an internship to move on to something else, recent grads with no experience, this helps but not in the way of cash unless your a cold call genius or know a lot of business owners. So if you wanna do this have some money saved 239$ discounted rate for insurance class plus 80$ per time to take the exam to get license and also 40$ for sales school. The 239$ is for insurance school, that however is an awesome school the teacher is amazing, but honestly make sure the company is gonna give you a base and benefits, that own your own business be your own boss stuff isn't really the case."
bad,"AFLAC is good for someone that would like to work by themselves for extended periods. My manager was really nice and helpful for the first week, and then sent me out on my own; which I did not mind. The commission work was not for me though."
bad,"aflac's basic business model is to bring in as many new recruits as it can throw them all against the wall and see who sticks. when I was hired I wasn't even signed up to take both of my insurance test at the same time, upper management did not tell lower management and I slipped through the cracks. Very disappointed with how I was treated"
bad,A typical work day included contacting potential businesses to set appointments with HR or the company owner to come share the option of adding Aflac polices to their benefit packages.
bad,"It is 100% commission, which is not made clear in the interview processes.  Their benefits start after being there for at least two years, and that is stock in the company."
bad,This is not the type of work for me. I am looking for something that pays by the hour. I am sure this is a good company for some but it is not for me.
bad,"Overall experience was mediocre. AFLAC would help train you, and did their best to benefit you on any basis. However, many of the things required by the company in order to actually be profitable, one must come out their pocket to pay for training, licensure costs, etc. Training does take quite some time, and the expenses are not reimbursed. Beginning to work under this company, it requires an extensive amount of time, dedication, and effort to actually make money."
bad,"training was minimal and unhelpful."
bad,"Commission only. Cold calls and door-to-door soliciting constantly. You have to ignore the incentives, fast-pace, and intensity to really build at your own pace, if you want to build your book by just networking. Managers are funny and motivating, and product is decent. But you are only as good as your last hot streak. And there will be plenty of cold streaks. Managers promised book of business in interview, but won't give any to you until you produce a lot. Until you do, you starve. Not a fit if you value work-life balance and do not have any other income!"
bad,"Worst Maintenance manager I ever worked for, no morrall, not trust worthy. If you ever witness any wrongdoing within this department, you are to look the other way- if you dont, you will be the black sheep and will be retaliated against until they find any small reason to fire you! Enjoyed my co workers,  although the management team is driven only through the so called good ole boy system. HR will not back you up either, you will be labeled as a troublemaker and soon they will fire you. "
bad,"I signed on here in July 2016 and left in April 2018, propelled by the ending of a relationship, and the sudden tripling of my bills.  This job requires active, almost religious-like devotion in order to have even moderate success in a small and mid town environment. "
bad,Aflac is about Aflac and not it's people. They offer no benefits for the outside sales team and hire people to complete contests. They do not train properly and are all about the top earners until they use them up.
bad,Terrible management unrealistic goals they don't help you they don't train you they just sent you out people in the area are not receptive product is good wood by it companies sucks
bad,"A typical day starts with looking at career/job websites trying to find applicants that are suited for working for insurance companies like AFLAC - you then contact them either via phone or by e-mail with a standard letterhead. The more interviews you can secure as a human resource intern you are paid a salary. I learned as a human resource intern what goes into deciding who would be a good candidate for insurance sales, I was allowed the freedom to create a new template for job hiring inquiry. I did have an excellent manager who did take a chance on hiring me as an intern and I did have flexible hours in so far as I could call as many people as I wanted and stay as long as I wanted since I was an intern. The hardest part of the job was trying to secure potential interview candidates because getting paid depended on it. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the different job experience other than working sales"
bad,"Street walker clothes, tattoos, playing on cell phones or standing around talking for 2+ hrs. a day. Stealing your lunch from the refrigerator."
bad,"I was excited to start this journey with Aflac but once i was assigned a District Coordinator things took a turn; she was unprofessional, had no team members, and was not a good leader i was done before i got started. I requested another District and was denied and was told we could work things out. At that point i was disappointed because i was never properly trained nor informed about the roadmap that is already in place for new associates. The biggest issue was that i paid for this experience to gain suppprt and all that Afpac had to offer to new Associates. Eventhough, i truly believe in Aflacs mission they have to do a better job with recognizing real and competent leadership. The unforunate reality is that most Associate will only be as good as their District and you would need to connect with someone that is confident in their abilities and not threatened by ones potential."
bad,"I worked with the location in colorado springs for over a year. I had the perspective of being new to the industry so i did not know what to expect. The contracting and liscencing was very easy, the liscencing was the most beneficial thing i got out of my expirence. I was paired with an awesome District manager who had a very good understaning of how to run his business, as independant agents we are able to diversify our expertise in many situations. During aflac trainning you are not being paid. The only time you get paid is when you write business. This wouldnt be an issue for many people, but the problem lies in the required activity by regional managers. I found that not one piece of business was wrote with the training. I was spending well over 20 hours a week commuting, and participating in training that was un paid. The last month i worked with the company i had a week long tranning course scheduled, again unpaid and no gas being paid for. Corporate did offer to pay for hotels but my dm conviced me to drive everyone else. This trainning was 2 hours from my home in my states major city. That week i woke up at 5 am to meet everyone else 1 hour from my home by 7 and then take another 2hour ride, and every day not being home until 830 pm, again not being paid the whole time. During this class i had another required class that had a expiration date. Because of my training situation that week i was unable to complete that course, at which point i recieve a notifcation that my contract has been terminated. The next week i am frantically in communication with corporate trying"
bad,"This is not a real job. They will hire anybody willing to try and sell their products. You must start with cold-called or walking in to places cold. Then you try to sell the products to employees of various business. If they don't sign up, you don't make money. Worst yet, there is no benefits, and you must pay the company to rent space in their office."
bad,"Business of Cold Calls. No territories, you are the 4th or 5th person at a business in a month."
bad,"My experience with Aflac (approximately one year) started out good with training provided as member of a sales team and further training through corporate office (including graduation at headquarters in Columbus, GA); HOWVER, after a little time creating future leads becomes increasingly difficult, and if you don't produce you don't get paid. The managers and team leaders make success look easier and take about money opportunities such as getting new employees which benefits you since you get a percentage of employees that you've recommended (pyramid scheme, ?, probably)."
bad,"I wasted my time and gas with this company. I commuted daily to another city, sold policies, and was not paid for them. Almost everything good that was initially written about working for this company was fabricated."
bad,"there isnt much to say about aflac beyond the fact I enjoyed the job until a coworker stole a massive account from me that cost me a ton of money, my manager hid the fact this happened as well."
bad,"This company sell health supplement policies to small businesses.  A typical day for me was to visit many, many businesses to find out that I was maybe the 100th agent to visit that company, so I quit."
bad,Cold calling in an environment where hundreds of other agents are knocking on the same doors you are is a frustrating experience to say the least.
bad,It was hard cold calling for new clients. There is alot of competition from other Aflac agents as well as other companies.
bad,Aflac was a productive environment.  I was just not wanting to sell secondary insurance.  With Prime America I am more comfortable selling life insurance.  Something I feel very strong about so a family can continue to cover their bills incase some kind of bad accidents happens to the main provider of the family.
bad,Tried working for this company for over 6 months. Couldn't make enough money to buy gas. When I left and started a new job they said I owed them money.
bad,The fact they want YOU to go out and get leads for THEM to make money proves this place is a scam.  DO NOT APPLY.  They hassled me for MONTHS for leads until I told them they have to pay me for them.  Everyone is a scum bag there.
bad,I expected to have a more traditional intern experience with a company with such a reputation like Aflac but I found the company saturating it's program with as many interns to have them sell to their family members. Most of the training and work was completely online and there was not as much guidance as expected.
bad,"Was told they would pay for training time, they did not. Work day varies. Respectfully decline to answer anything further. They were not very transparent from the beginning."
bad,"If you land a big account it will be taken from you!! If you're happy making $40,000 and working long hours it may be good for you."
bad,Nearly impossible to find business since they put so many agents in the field that you are all following all over each other. Rates are very high and this is a cold call / door-to-door sales company.  Give them a pass unless you have a large book of prospects to bring with you.
bad,"As a regional administrator, you work directly for the regional manager.  It's essentially an assistant position so take that for what it is.  As a representative for Aflac it is 100% sales and commission.  I would not recommend it if you need money right away or if you don't have a book of clients built up.  It costs money to get a license and it takes time to build a clientele.  You will be doing lots of cold calling and grinding to get appointments."
bad,"Be prepared for poverty.  AFLAC expects you to build from scratch. You will have to hustle all the time.  The commissions are very small.  I had to buy my own computer, which cost $3,000."
bad,This was a nightmare!  There is no base salary and you are driving around all day wasting gas and not making any money.  I would never recommend this company.
bad,"comission based job hard to find and close new accounts even with following their sales tactics, with zero help from your co workers or boss wasnt making as much money as was promised"
bad,I was giving cards and a phone book.   Told to make cold calls.  Not a realistic way to start a career. I'm not build to walk door to door selling.  Pulling someone random out of the phone book seems non productive.
bad,"I put in long hours.  It was extremely difficult to get a signed contract with small businesses.  They talked the talk and made appointments but hard to get a signed group contract with them."
bad,there was no guidance or trainging for the job. you were just thrown to the wolves and were expected to rock it.  if you don't know what you're doing and have never done this type of work before you will fail
bad,"To sum up what this company does, they will hire just about anybody (no experience or education needed) as long as the new hire is willing to create a list of 100 possible leads.  Since the company does not offer any salary, base pay, benefits, etc, there is absolutely no reason not to ""hire"" any person willing to give it a shot since most new hires will provide their list of 100 ""leads"" to the ""District Manager"" responsible for bringing this person on board.  The only positive experience I gained from this role was learning how to cold-call and rely on myself for generating leads at an early age.  This skill still helps me every work day.  This job also taught me what to avoid when seeking employment in the sales field."
bad,"I actually have done very well and wrote 50k in my first 6 months. However, I am the only one out of my whole class thats still here and they literally don't pay for anything. You even have to pay the regional manager rent!!"
bad,I felt this was sort of a scam.  The people over me didnt follow up on their clients and I felt like they just wanted the money and didnt care about the buisness
bad,"Prospected Winimac, IN. Of the 22 companies visited 20 already have AFLAC in place. The other 2 had no interest do to their high turn over of employees. This tells the tail of the rest of our area."
bad,You run into companies that have seen 15 reps in 10 days. Good luck
bad,working with insurance can be frustrating and can make you lose interest.
bad,"The atmosphere and Multicultural background are excellent motivations to take on the job with enthusiasm. The company paid for my license training course. However, once i acquired my license and was ready to begin enrollments, the supervisor was more than unhelpful. This led to me not knowing exactly what to do. The supervisor admitted to rushing the new recruits to get their licenses, therefore leaving us with barely any knowledge."
bad,this company is a scam. they make you pay to get your license and then make money off what you sell. Only succesful reps got in early and a lot of people below them. 
bad,"If you have no other source of income, this is not the job for you. This is a great second job."
bad,"Had little direction, be careful of your mentor they might try to pull a fast one on you."
bad,Plays favorites. If you need a steady income not the job for you. Only supplemental benefits. Have to split deals with many agents and agents will snake you in the end.
bad,"Aflac is a great company, the benefits & pay are good. But working at the call center was horrible . I’m usually a happy person it this job has cost me so much stress that I had to find another job. You start off your day by checking emails and then getting on the phone with upset customers and rude agents."
bad,Due to the extensive hours for my job description I became very ill and had to leave the job by doctors orders.  I loved my job but the hours were excessive.
bad,"With my current job, my day begins at 8:00 sharp. I work in a very busy environment where I deal with customers on the phone all day. I also deal with different Brokers, Account Managers, and Claims as well. And I respond to emails, request duplicate policies, discuss claims process and denials. I deal with researching issues and try my best at resolving issues that may dissatisfy the customer. Yes, my work day is very busy, but I love it because it gives me a chance to learn new skills and broaden my horizon."
bad,Driving or going to meetings. I learned a lot of great things about Aflac and how important having plans like Aflac can help. I just had a bad experience because they didn't pay me for almost three months after making my first company sale.
bad,The only goo thing is that your making your own hours and the managers are laid back and could care less when you come and go.
bad,"While I was employed with Aflac I witness bullying, people got terminated for no reason without notice. I felt the same was about to happen to me. My fellow employee and myself felt replaceable."
bad,I did not adequate enough training.  I was the only one in Farmington while my team was in Albuquerque.  I felt like I was stranded and left all alone and so cofused
bad,"Good product, but they lack vision. They hire way too many employees with the intention of washout instead of just hiring the right ones. Then, the ones like me with educations actually leave for something better. You need to pull your head out of your rear. There are better companies out there selling better products. They are going to overtake you."
bad,"Spend more in gas and time than you make. You put in all the time and effort and your trainer gets half. They want you to eat, sleep and breathe Aflac."
bad,"AFLAC is a great company and with real good products that I believe in. The problem is the people that sell the products. This is a real cut throat business and if you don't like making cold calls and getting constantly hung up on or you don't like walking door to door asking to speak to people, then this is not the job for you. The people that make great Aflac employees are people who have a lot of connections with businesses and also have a lot of money to spend. You have to spend a lot of money to make money in the insurance business."
bad,"You are expected to lie, cheat, and darn near steal to sell products to people that don't want or have the money to purchase them in the first place!  Terrible!"
bad,"Required meetings"
bad,Great people and great products. Just make sure you have enough savings to pay bills for at least 6 months. The hardest part of the job is getting started. Once you get a few accounts under your belt you should be ok.
bad,"Cold calling from 25 - 100 businesses a day is grueling and tiresome and expensive to say the least with no money for gas or any other types of compensation other than the commission you received from writing business to a group of 3 or more per business. Most found that after starting the policies, they were too expensive to afford and dropped them leaving you hanging with the bad apples. The only laptops provided were received after you wrote enough business to earn one, otherwise you shared with other agents. More driving and gas to get a laptop that barely worked and could not be kept for very long and then returned to your DSC."
bad,"Commissioned-only income. Lots of driving expense, long hours, low commissions, high charge backs from cancelled policies when employers won't pay monthly bills."
bad,"It seemed like a good fit since I like meeting new people everyday and sales, in general.  The products protect people from serious financial stress for injury or illness.  But the company, overall, is poorly managed."
bad,First this is a 100% commission job. When I first started it was fun and I was able to meet new people. Then the Regional Coordinator started getting on everyone and telling us we were not doing enough and to stop bullshitting. Then many people stated to quit. There is a high turnover rate of contracted self employed agents with Aflac.  There is little training or guidance. The coordinators just tell you to go out and prospect for new groups and get appointments with the owner/decision maker.
bad,Had to pay for your own training.  High stress cold call sales. No defined territory the person next to you in class was a direct competitor for your custimers
bad,"You are a 1099 employee without any benefits, representing a benefits company.  You will invest thousands of dollars and hours into your business to hopefully see it grow.  You choose your work hours which is nice, and bring in business however you want (cold-calling, in-person, etc).  The Rochester leadership at the top is great, the middle managers are buffoons. The scary thing:  you don't have a salary, you only get the commission from your sales.  They pay you upfront, but if something happens (ie somebody cancels, an account fails to pay invoices, etc) Aflac charges you that money back.  You can be indebted to the company, and they put an interest rate on that debt.  They charge you a certain percentage of your new commissions to pay it down, plus any monthly commission is pushed over to pay down that balance."
bad,"Got a welcome letter with info on how to train online. After studying for months with no income, I got nothing but a sorry because they ""dropped the ball"" with assigning me to a trainer in order to actually sell and make money, seems to be the trend in this industry."
bad,"I started my job at Aflac as an Independent Insurance Agent because I liked the concept of working for myself and thought if I worked hard I would be rewarded. I found out quickly that the managers did not provide the sales support  that they promised and only looked out for their best interests. Aflac's sales school was not helpful and offered techniques that seemed to trick the customers into doing business with them. Overall, I would not recommend with company to anyone."
bad,I would observe resumes and schedule interviews with potential candidates.On rare moments I would use Microsoft Office to create and analyze fiscal reports.
bad,"disfunctional leadership, 100% commission, door to door sales, if you need financial security this is not the job for you."
bad,"commission base salary no real training basically your given leads to follow with very little guidance, at least  that was my experience"
bad,"if you don't get the right trainer, you will flounder. it's straight commission so without proper training you cannot succeed."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job:  The ability to have control of my time"
bad,Selling air to someone is quite challenging. This is a very shady job
bad,Working at Aflac has been a very interesting and learning experience.
bad,A typical day consisted of going to different companies or cold calling  to set appointments.
bad,"Aflac is great insurance, however, I didn't receive the best field training and when I asked for help, I was made to feel like I was going to steal all of co-workers moves. Which was not the case, I just wanted to watch them and learn from the elders of the company. I just sank in the water. I did love the job and wish I had proper guidence."
bad,"Sold insurance to workers through their employers. I learned that this product is sold by many other insurance companies, and at a lower rate. The management competes with the agent, often taking a part of the agent's hard earned commission. The turn-over rate in this field is huge, more than 50%. The hardest thing about this job is that it is 100% commission and 0% benefits without support from superiors. The best thing about it is leaving. That's why so many do."
bad,"This was commission only, which sucked, hard work output for little pay. The management sucked also. What job security??"
bad,Your first year is the hardest to make any money. If you don't have bills or anything you could make it. The local management tries to wear new people out so they can take over any new accounts they may get.
bad,They churn agents out knowing that most will fail in the first year.  No support staff to help with issues.  District Coordinators don't have time to spend with agents nor answer questions; help; or train.
bad,"All commission, no leads given, manager would not let me write contracts after working there for five months because I was “too new” despite everyone else in the office being able to make money."
bad,Great place to work to make your own schedule.  100% commission.  Not sustainable income.  I felt like I was set up for failure by the person over seeing me.  It felt like she wanted me to fail so she could take over my groups when I was no longer there.
bad,"10-99, but treated like employee with no benefits. 100 doors a week and cold calls all day. Mandatory meetings... best part was the yearly bash! High pressure gig!"
bad,"The company and the atmosphere was pleasant. Since the position was in sales, there was quite a bit of cold-calling which was my least favorite activity and the uncertainty of being commission-based was a problem with my current situation."
bad,out of college was a great experience of getting cold calls and door slammed in your face. definitely needs a go getter attitude but can see it working part time also
bad,"If you are an experienced outside sales person with no family and no need for immediate income this is the job for you. There is no base pay. It is strictly commission only. "
bad,"Only apply if you have thousands of leads to give to your coworkers so they can cash in on you!! It takes three people to get a ""group"" going so keep in mind if you think this is a easy thing to do your crazy. Expect commission only and make sure that you work your butt of and make cold calls all day."
bad,"Looking back, there was so much agent turnover that the leadership prepared for that by pushing new agents to open new accounts but did not support them afterwards, as if preparing to give these to their veteran agents to keep them happy, who were not opening accounts."
bad,Some co workers are bad persons.  There are envy and favoritism.  No good comissions.  Not good supervisión. And other things that isn't well for nobody..
bad,"Aflac required copious driving. I enjoyed the engagement with customer's but, the products that I had to offer didn't really fit well  into the California market, so the return on time invested was poor."
bad,"Takes a certain type of person. Don't get caught up in the sales pitch during the introduction to the business. Yes there is a lot of money to be had, but not many people actually hit the goals"
bad,"You find out what you need to know AFTER you need it."
bad,job misrepresented during interview process.  treat seasoned employees like children.  Management not aware of how to control vendors for software implementation
bad,"I have worked there for a year. It ebbs and flows. You only get paid if you sign someone up. If that person you sign up gets fired before they have paid in for the year. Aflac will take money away from you. You do not get paid for time and effort, nor do you get reimbursed for gas mileage. You have more money going out then coming in."
bad,"Just a year ago this time in April I was miserable as miserable a human being could be. Scared. Hopeless. Making cold calls without even knowing how to do them right."
bad,"So if you are ok with working with no base pay, no benefits, and spending money upfront for licensing, background checks, and for a computer that only works to sign up customers, this job is for you."
bad,No room for advancement. Very monotonous and no day to day job variation. The management was not supportive. A lot of corporate red tape. I did gain valuable experience in database management.
bad,I was with AFLAC for just over a year and a couple of months.  In my time there I saw what they offered and how it could be such a positive to its clients and their families in a time of need.  I also saw how cutthroat it can be.  Having meetings and deals set up and having other AFLAC Representatives go behind your back and attempt to take/steal the sale away from you.  Not alot of support from your mentor or corporate.
bad,The training is not all that bad but management stinks. there is a lot of upfront money they don't tell you at the interview about
bad,"Your a 1099. No benefits. Other companies with similar benefits with less coverage were cheaper than AFLAC. Many, Many prospects did not want to up their cost/s, due to the economy. "
bad,"Working Monday thru Friday is the best schedule, I have my own desk, computer, and direct phone line."
bad,"I sold aflac for 2.5 years and lets just say I'm overjoyed to have a different job. I saw many people come into the organization and leave actually owing money back to aflac. You are working in a horribly saturated market and are constantly encouraged to recruit more competition. Why? Because the structure is similar to a multi-level marketing scheme. No one in the sales force (associate, district coord, regional coord, state coord, territory, and national) are employees of Aflac. 75% of all new business is written by associates with less then a year experience. This is evident in the 95% turnover. I come from a small metro area of about 120,000 and there are 2 district managers with around 20 associates each at any one time. Out of those groups only about 10 have been working for over a year. The reason for this is you hit your friends and family up and make some pretty good money but when you've used your network up you're staring at a market where you're directly competing with many others for a limited number of businesses. Then when you can't find any businesses to sell and aren't making money you quit. When you quit your friends and family drop the coverage they bought from you and you're left paying back the unearned advance. It sucks!"
bad,I work hard and diligently everyday and every hour at any job I ever.
bad,Felt as if it was a pyramid type business where agents were constantly being hired. All agents were covering the same area to the point of over saturating an area making it very difficult to
bad,"I worked for them for a year. I associated brokers and prospected on my own to develop clients. Most clients I sold into found that they could not afford the premiums after a few months and dropped the policies. Management also has a hands off process on accounts that were previously sold into but unserviced for 4 years or more. Once I uncovered the opportunity and told my manager, I was not allowed to proceed with the account. The district manager took it for about $75K in premium. It angered my broker so much he quit the program and I quit shortly thereafter."
bad,"This job might be a great opportunity for someone who has a few thousand dollars stashed back and is prepared to go a few months without making anything. The flexibility is great especially if you have a lot going on at home, but it can take advantage of you as well. All the time you spend driving around, spending your gas money....and not getting jack in return for a long time?"
bad,"I was told that I was going to get one pay rate and get a lower pay rate once I got started I also got a lot of no pays and coundnt benefit from the products I was offering,  I was sold on a promise and was so let down offern on my on to learn thing for myself.  still a daily process."
bad,Make sure you have another line of income because you will go broke working for them.  You don't know when you will make any money.  The management is useless and wants its agents to be cat fighting over accounts.  Don't go for the bate... Unless your handed a book of business its not worth starving for years.
bad,Management does not encourage mentors to teach product knowledge or sales techniques. Management not involved in employees journey to succeed. Supervisors too bust selling for themselves to help new employees.
bad,"I took this job because they made it sound like there were very few agents in Omaha, only to find out there were a ton of agents.  Everywhere I went, someone had been there a few days or weeks before."
bad,did not feel a part of this company as a sales representative i wanted to feel more a part of this company but did not achieve this so the motivation was not their.
bad,"You are sold on being your own boss, fancy trips, and good money. If you have someone who can support you then you may have a chance You will spend tons of gas and countless time to get somewhat decent pay days, but they are few and far between."
bad,i worked fro aflac for 1 1/2 years and had a great time until i noticed they started giving my clients to new people and when i confronted them they brushed me off so don't fall or the trap
bad,Pure commission. They don't train you on the computer system. Your expected to pay for everything except sales materials. Nice people but they are not very professional.
bad,"The training was not long enough.  As an independent,  I had to put too many hours in a day to sell one application. I had to pay for leads that led to no business."
bad,"This job is taxing on the mind and can be the most stressful thing ever. The uncertainty of a paycheck is the most crucial aspect and the reason why I can't recommend it to anyone. Unless you go into this job knowing of multiple companies that want to make supplemental healthcare available to their employees, than I can't advise doing it."
bad,Much time was spent soliciting companies. Once a company was signed up you had little control over how long people would keep policies. Income negatively affected by dropped policies.
bad,old school $0 base pay job contracting job. Must have entrepreneurial spirit. You must hustle and hope a little luck is on your side to be on a team that owns a territory that is not saturated
bad,"Commission only when starting out is very difficult. Gas prices are very significant in your bring home pay. There are no strict territories, therefore if you live in a border state; you could potentially call on a business that was seen by another representative 30 minutes earlier."
bad,No significant sales while at Aflac.  I wasn't successful doing Business to Business Sales for this company due to the economic down turn of the economy in 2008-2009.
bad,"Do not waist your time with Aflac please don't. Once you open a few account and your productivity goes down they will fire you and they get to keep the accounts that you opened. That's the way they get to make all this money that they claim to have work so hard to make. Using people and get raid of them. Their training is very simple, it only one phrase, GO KNOCK ON DOORS and you will be successful."
bad,"Big company"
bad,"Very long hours, with cold calling to get any participation to listen to benefits offered by Aflac.I left because  I was offered a full time position with benefits with another company."
bad,"If offered the assembler or package position or any low level position through Randstad to work for Aflac/Communicorp run for dear life! The pay is bottom of the barrel and you will work 50 hrs if lucky (or not) and it is a very boring, tedious, and unrewarding job."
bad,"I had recently sold my restaurant at the time, and was looking for entrepreneurial work advancement.  I met some hiring managers at a job conference and actually went in for an 'Interview' thinking I was going to get a job!  LOL!"
bad,"Well I moved into a different office, in hopes of better direction and management, they give you just enough information to not make you deadly then they fall off the coaching planet. This office closed due to lack of sales due to horrible coaching. I felt like the way its set up was designed for Agents to fail. and make the Districts and the Regional managers rich. Poor coaching. This set up is allot like multi -level marketing plots"
bad,"Poor management, shadey practices, felt like I was a con artist.  How can you sell suplimental insurance to people who don't even have basic coverage? Very unethical practices."
bad,too much yelling and cursing by the boss. my experience was not a good one
bad,They give you a misrepresentation of the training given for the job and don't have much support in getting business aside from 100% cold calling. No benefits and sales expectations are ballistic compared to support given
bad,"Don’t expect any money right away, pay is unstable and you travel a lot. No benefits and don't expect a lot of training. They show you a few things and then just throw you out there. Very competitive. Very cut throat."
bad,Company culture is immovable.  Company wants and needs to transform IT but will not make changes needed.  Peter Principle is in force and very visible here.
bad,"Working with employers to meet their needs and their employees needs , helping with claims and benefits for employees. Doing presentations to companies on aflac products and how it will benefit them and their employees."
bad,I found out the being a sales person was not in my make up.  I did not like canvasing building to building or doors and cold calls. Incoming  Call Centers have clients calls that are prime to have the request met.
bad,"Stay away, more cons than pros. False representation regarding position and compensation. Most managers look at candidates as ""lead generators"", who will leave after brief period and no direction. The managers will then receive those leads, residuals."
bad,"Love to walk, know on doors, then this is for you. Speak to business owners on the benefit of Aflac products. More rejections than confirmed appointments."
bad,It was an ok company to work for however they do not do enough training for how highly competitive the market for insurance has become in recent years.
bad,Aflac is not the same company I went to work for in 2007. The Company actually cared about their employees. Now it is all about numbers. My district supervisor would stab you in the back. I loved the job I did just couldn't handle the management team.
bad,"Do not know who to trust in a cutthroat atmosphere.  Continously looking over the shoulder, except when canvassing; and not given too much opportunity to canvass.  Constantly being told what I should not be doing and no mentoring on what I should be doing.  Very frustrating."
bad,"Its two sides to every coin, the interview went well, and things they sell you with the great bonuses, the exotic vacation spots. The truth to that is sales are really hard to meet and also little on training from an uninterested coordinator that just did not care with a negative attitude."
bad,Achieve results at all cost s is not a way that i believe my training and licenses should be used in a way to produce results ...management constantly telling you one minute your great the next day when your sales are off your horrible......strange
bad,"I got burned out driving all over northern and central Vermont and New Hampshire.  There was lots more paperwork and computer work that had to be done in the evenings and on weekends that was not explained to me when I was hired.  "
bad,"It does offer flexible hours, but the more you work the more you get paid. "
bad,"I don't mean to give this a bad review, AFLAC itself isn't a bad company to work for I unfortunately didn't  have a  very good Manager. My friend who was a field agent at the time referred me to the position, she stayed with the company for 10 years so  I guess that says something about AFLAC for itself."
bad,"commission only sales is way too tough to last long unless you continually get big breaks. long hours, wasted time, over saturated. management will use new recruits to build their accounts and then happily let them go"
bad,"A typical day was a motivational meeting and outdoor sales."
bad,"I loved AFLAC, and wait to be apart. However, the experience left me highly disappointed. I learned that where the customers are well taken care of the agents were not."
bad,Aflac was the first job offer I received after graduating.  The current manager helped me get my silence and was very supportive.  My direct supivisor was very good at helping her people out but the team rarely assisted one another and there was more of a 'me first' mentality.  The manager left not long after I joined and the resulting power vaccume made the work environment stressful.  Her replacement came in and began laying people off without ever meeting them.
bad,"dont do it unless you like raman noodles. They talk a great game about pay, trips and such but none of its true , I am still waiting for a $100 bonus for a contest i won 4 wks ago"
bad,"The job was B2B which I found to be fun, however the market for Aflac was saturated and I found many unreceptive perspective clients.  The on ly advantage was I was able to setr my own hours."
bad,"this was a 100% commission job,  We would work all day making cold calls and knocking on door educating business owners on supplemental benefits.  It was very hard to close a deal and hard to talk to the managers."
bad,Someone who is good at commission sales will find this review the opposite of their experience.  I do not have the killer instinct that you need to pressure someone into buying a product.  I spent more money on car maintenance than salary in one month.
bad,"Don't waist your time.  You get assigned to a used beat up manager, with no formal education or training.  How can you respect someone who clearly has no respect for themselves?"
bad,"Dont buy into the ""typical amount of earnings"" because your ""trainer"" will basically have to hand you part of their business to make anything within 5 weeks. There are multiple offices with multiple teams per office with no territories so you will be the 5th to 12th aflac sales person to walm into the office per week. If you want to do it dont quit your day job until you have a lot of annual renewal money coming in."
bad,"100% commission "
bad,"I started working as an ""Aflac associate"" at a time when I had no other option available to me. Maybe one out of 50 people, those with unusually good networking, can make better than a minimum wage in this position. The ""leads"" provided are basically the entire business registry of the United States. In other words, you are given no leads. Good luck wasting your time."
bad,"Aflac US is two companies: the sales force and operations.  Very different cultures.  Sales is dynamic and sink or swim and those that succeed generally love Aflac."
bad,Compensation for this job is good for insurance sales. Problem is limited training. They are more worried about how to cold call then if you know their product
bad,Aflac Sales. 100% commission based. Competing with other Aflac sales associates for same buiness. Management did not support sales associates
bad,"very stressed while trying to build your ""book of business"".  This is the type of job where you can do well long-term but it takes at least a year or two before you can even begin to live off the income."
bad,Went from business to business to set up new insurance accounts and servicing existing accounts.  It was very difficult to get appointments in a small market.
bad,After two sales I was left on my own. I had not yet learned enough to continue to make sales.
bad,"Working with Aflac, I have come to understand that they thrive on the entrepreneurial spirit in the sense that you are able to validate your work / life schedule according to those personal financial goals you've set for yourself. This can be very rewarding at times; however, there are also many times when this can be more than challenging. You're success is truly determined by that experienced 'team member' you've partnered with. This is determined by that area for which you reside. With that said, should you be 'new' to the insurance industry, and you possess the outside sales qualities desired to be successful, you will succeed in time given the entry level position is paid on 'commission' only terms. However, you're career is determined upon that selling style developed in line with the training and tools provided by Aflac University and your local 'management' teams. Due to the fact that Aflac sales positions are paid on a commission only basis, with no true sales directives & salary per year, there tends to be a high turnover rate for independent sales agents. "
bad,A typical day involves calling random businesses or visiting them in schedule a meeting with the boss to discuss letting us come in to the company and sell policies to their employees. If given permission you then schedule times to be on location to talk with employees about the various policies and enroll them if they wish.
bad,"resigned after a couple of months. Aflac wants you to record in writing 100 companies per week. I felt like this was stealing leads from others that are just starting out. Aflac claimed that you can work with all size companies but after signing on, in training we were told to go to mom and pop shops to get paid so that is contradicting. I was supposed to go over how much I wanted to earn per year with AFLAC with the manager but she did not want to discuss because she knew I was not going to what I had written down. A lot of confusion. Every time you finish one thing and think you are going to be writing business. something else is required to complete. AFLAC does not provide leads and when my family members tried to help, they were denied due to age. I was totally disappointed and quickly withdrew because I got too miserable. It's going to be al long while before you make any money here. Only do this if you have money sitting around to blow."
bad,Way too many agents! Poor business model leads to agents competing more against one another than other companies. Sales goals are obtainable but the length of time to secure a new account often extend beyond the time a new agent can survive.  You probably won't see a paycheck for at least two months after starting.
bad,"If you are single, have no mortgage or others depending on you to provide, Aflac offers great potential. This position is 100% commission salary structure with no guarantee of income. The product is amazing, but the position requires more than some are able to sacrifice."
bad,It's a pyramid situation where someone is above you and makes money off of your success whether they contribute or not. You have the ability to advance and make good money but it is comission only pay. It is very hard beginning your career here without a back up income source for the first year. Do not start this job without a pretty big safety net.
bad,If you're looking for a job where it just pays on commission this is the right job for you. But be prepared to do a lot of cold calling and B2B sales pitches. Didn't really enjoy my time here not a very professional environment
bad,Loved loved loved my DSC and other agents just didn’t feel accepted within territory. Lots of driving and few meetings hours away that took away time from making sales and prospecting.
bad,"This is not a 9 - 5 job.  First you have to go to insurance school and then pass exams for your license.  Then there is a lot of training.  You have to find your own leads to work and hopefully set appointments to talk to the owner or the HR person.  If you are able to talk to the employees about the policies AFLAC has, they have to sign up and then you get paid.  You have to put a certain amount of money upfront before you start making any money.  No benefits.  Stock after you make sales."
bad,"Was hired as an HR intern and I was put into sales. Had to do cold calls, canvasing, and other sale functions. Did little to no HR work wish the opportunity stuck true to the job posting."
bad,"Till you get a good book of business, Aflac is only part time.  Cannot sustain your living if you do not have a back up plan.  Once you have a strong book of business Aflac can be full time .  But be patient."
bad,"I worked for Aflac for a little over a year. The flexible hours were great. But  it is commission only. So you are going door to door, business to business rain or shine or snow. Very stressful when trying to make sure my family is taken care of."
bad,"Did not enjoy working for Aflac.  Didn't feel that I had the support needed to be successful here at this Company.  However, Aflac has a good product."
bad,I personally did not like working for AFLAC. The company itself was great but I had a difficult time meeting the standard sales goals. The training was helpful to the other employees that I worked with.
bad,I do not discuss prior employment as it relates to experience.  Everyone has there own experience at a job.  Every circumstance and result are unique.
bad,"company is great as long as no manager disappears or dies, then the company is not prepared for unexpected changes in training situations. the company is not structured for change its set to stay the same"
bad,"got paid on sales only "
bad,"I love meeting and talking to new people but I found the job stressful. Didn't love it. When it comes to 9 to 5 job I always prefer sitting at my desk all day. "
bad,"You would have to place calls daily asking people to come in and apply, as being a recruiter. if people agreed you would schedule them if they didnt' you would simply take them off your list. Also being a assistant to a insurance agent. we would bring in people for out insurance agent but if we didn't have anyone come in for a meeting it was very very stressful because  a lot of people don't want to work with sales."
bad,This is a 100% commission based career. You must build your book of business from the ground up and be in a financial position to go a few weeks without any income. There are ZERO benefits as you are a 1099.
bad,"I worked at Aflac for almost year. I really enjoyed what I did, but when I had my interview with them they weren’t very honest. What I mean by that is they say the first year you will make a certain amount. Well what they don’t share is how that breaks down. I did everything they told me to do, I really busted my butt. I have a family to provide for. In order for anyone to succeed and get thru the hard times in the first year is you have to have one of two things either have a separate income to where what you get paid from Aflac doesn’t matter or be prepared to go into debt."
bad,Must be happy with total commission and ready for cold calling.  It is a dog eat dog business and not my cup of tea.  Can be very financially rewarding
bad,It was ok. Was there a year. Didn't stay long. Took different job. People were ok. Job was ok. Days were ok. Didn't like sitting in the office. It was boring
bad,"You must have an adequate cash flow to become an agent due to low returns on any sales. You spend a lot of time in meetings, "
bad,"This is a commission based job.  It can be lucrative if you are motivated and have the right backing on your side.  Although it is an independent role, the right guidance is necessary to succeed."
bad,"Worked there for three months. Worked my tail off to get new accounts for the company, got my manager in front of numerous business owners and did all I could do on my part to build a book of business. For some reason,  no one there has any closing skills; wasn't able to get a single stable account. The account I did mange to secure, my manager let fail (couldn't keep up with his own workload, which showed in his clients 'dissatisfaction). As a result I'm now nearly $3,000  in debt due to advanced commissions.  You work your butt off for loans and then your managers rob you and put you in debt when you leave. If you have half a brain and some people skills, Aflac will hire you. Most of the people I saw Aflac hiring for new associates were totally incompetent and had no idea what they signed up for. Aflac's products are valuable for small businesses, but working there? I would have made more money working at McDonalds."
bad,"At SETO, hourly pay without financial support for 100% travel.  "
bad,"It is a job that requires a lot of hours, long days into eve at times, but your told it is the opposite and the time it takes to build a career there is definitely years but if you invest your time one day you will be successful I am sure. Best of luck if your willing to go hungry for a couple of years."
bad,The position is 100 percent commission based.  Entering into sales with no sales experience earning 100 percent on commissions is not ideal for someone entering into sales.
bad,"Aflac was a good company at one time and they indeed have great products that saved people's financial lives.  However, a culture of backstabbing, cutthroating, dishonesty, rewarding immoral and illegal business transactions and not remembering that their agents was the thing that made them #1 have made them one of the last places I would recommend."
bad,"Days often began at home on the phone and computer.  I'd be up in the morning making cold calls and searching for ""prospects"" (clients). I mainly dealt with commercial accounts but did the occasional residential/individual.  There was no real management or workplace culture as we're often left on our own.  The early stages did however, feel like a type of inception or boot camp.  We were taught some very ""interesting"" sales practices."
bad,if you are motivated you can do this job i wanted something else and wish aflac and anyone there the best of luck in the future. great product but comishion only.
bad,did not like working here. crazy amount of work from little result. would not suggest working here or becoming a part of this team. Look for other employment
bad,I like the environment but the job just isn't for me. I thought I would like it the more I start to work there but that isn't the case. I am looking for a job that I have a lot of experience in.
bad,"i was extremely difficult to open any accounts when 6-10 persons within the company were trying to open the same accounts."
bad,The position I held at Aflac required a lot of long hours and the pay did not reflect that. Management was not appreciative of my efforts to make the customer happy. The department I worked in was very cut-throat and stressful.
bad,No base pay. Greedy dsc. Starve to death. clients have no respect. pyramid scheme. not doable. expensive. secrets. dont tell you things they should from the beginning
bad,"This company would be great if they cared more about their agents in the field.  The compensation is way to low for all the hours you have to put in, if they were to pay their agents more their turn over wouldn't be so high."
bad,100 % commission. This is scary for most as it was for myself. Must get new clients in order to make income. Good if you have a side job or just retired.
bad,"Love this job when youre able to get in front of the business owner.  "
bad,"A typical day would start out by going through all your own leads that you generated and trying to set appointments with the employer of a small independent company. Typically the employer was aggrevated because you were taking time out of his day to help you make a sale. By the end of the day, all i could remember was the people i bothered and ran all the gas out of my car for $0. Hated it"
bad,"100% commission job.  Pickup the phone book, buy some Sales Genie leads, get ready to pound the phones and pavement.  You definitely learn what it takes to be a salesman here.  If you don't have any upper management contacts in 25 employee companies, very hard to survive."
bad,"A typical day start with me working my prospect list that I prepared the end of the previous day.  I would end the day processing my paperwork for the policies written."
bad,"DECEPTION by the higher ups!! Corruption and good old boy system! Not favorable atmosphere if your not thin, and blond!"
bad,"If you plan on being in leadership, plan on doing so somewhere else.  The recruiters will promise whatever it takes to get you to sign on, but it is doubtful the company will ever deliver.  Company is heavily tenured and stagnant with both promotions and processes.  Workload is not evenly distributed amongst leadership.  Tasks will be doled out to whomever has the necessary skillset, which in most cases will be a small handful of cornerstone individuals.  The other leadership is generally allowed to subsist and do what they are capable of doing while remaining in the same pay band as the workhorses.  Promotions will come and go as long as you are part of the ""good ol boy"" club.  Having conducted a number of interviews myself, I can safely say that a hiring decision has typically already been made before the first resume gets submitted."
bad,"Good company and product, but they have a high turnover in associates.  Management is not focused on developing long term associates.  They accept high turnovers as part of their business.   Their success measurements are on the volume of accounts you cold call and the number of new associates they bring in.  If you are great at cold calling(30-50/day) it may be a great place for you."
bad,The AFLAC sales force is made up of good people but I met all of my goals and didn't make enough money to survive. The company is very top heavy and the head office goes to excessive lengths to get out of paying claims. Not a very good selling point.
bad,"Stuck it out for a year after a hyped-up group interview.  My manager  consistently threw brick walls up in front of me and wanted brown nosing and unwarranted commision splits with other agents who wouldn't do their jobs.  You have to be very self-reliant and put out a lot of your own money for traveling, dedicated computers & software and licensing and be politically inclined to get anywhere.  Although I met some great people along the way, the hostile & political environment was not for me."
bad,"I was called about this job and was hesitant at first. I thought for sure it would be cold calling and driving to business after business (when I didn't have a car). I told the person that I shared a car with my wife and that could be an issue but he told me to come in anyways."
bad,All commission with long days to keep steady pay and no one is there to help train when you need it.  You are teamed with someone that is training with you and yall are expected to learn from each other.
bad,You had to go door to door in order to find potential customers.  I have nothing else to say about this company.  This company doesn't do enough to set up to succeed.
bad,"Other than Cold Calling, everything is great about this company. I really enjoy talking to new people and helping them out."
bad,Go to the office on monday make sales calls all day. Tuesday through Friday soliciting door to door. Training was Average. Managers were motivating.
bad,Cold calling all day unless you have a extensive business network. Management gives little support. Coworkers change everyday. Turnover is incredibly high. Every day is struggle.
bad,This place is not really a good IT shop and I think mainly because the allow the Insurance part of the business dictate the IT road map. Backwards old systems.
bad,"Work day is Busy, busy..... A lot of Cold Calling that you will invest a lot of phone time and gas..  It is your job to get in 100 calls a wk. along with your follow up calls."
bad,I learned how to actually sell insurance and handle group benefits. This helped me gain my licenses and learn about products like disability and life insurance.
bad,AFLAC is great at helping many businesses in need. The commercials show a little more of how talented the are. Working at that location helped me to have a conversation with others and never have bad feelings after getting hung up on.
bad,"Hard to make money, especially after Obama Care. Lots of cold calling and door to door to generate business. Plenty have hard work for potentially no gain."
bad,"This was a strictly commission position. Everything I was told when I started turned out to be wrong. It is enjoyable meeting new people during the enrollment, corporate tell you people are in the programs they sign up with for a year. However, when they get their first check and see the deduction they call corporate to cancel and they allow it. by the corporate office allowing this they take money back from the associate."
bad,It was a great entry job for insurance. They helped me get my license and do minimal training. The way you make money is the worst part however. Cold Calling Cold Calling Cold Calling!!! I hate those words. If you like to go pressure someone to talk to you who has no interest in what you are doing... This might be a job better for you than me.
bad,"Was an ok Job, would have liked to have had a little more experience before going out on my own."
bad,Too many hands in too small a space.  Potential customers often lament an agent's approach and the agents have no security at all.
bad,Insurance sales are for some people but they were not for me.
bad,"Its  really a lot of work. Have to pay a lot into the company. Management kind of trains. "
bad,Aflac floods the pond with newly appointed insurance agents that they give little to no support to before they throw them out onto the pavement of their local town to call upon the same business owners who have already seen at least two agents that week. Before they are done with sales school most have dropped out.
bad,Company is a well known company with great products. Their training though is lacking. Every DSC trains to their individual standards and their is no unity. Plus they say they will take you on their accounts but they do not. And it takes a while to get going. This is a good job if you already have another one.
bad,New agents spend most of efforts in the field prospecting and opening new accounts through meetings with C level executives.  Long sales cycle and continuous management of account to include invoice and claims support.  Typically encouraged to advance toward management positions and build a sales team to support new business.
bad,"I was led to believe that there was much more support at the entry-level than there really was. "
bad,Tough environment to work in. Everyone for themselves mentality. Dozens of agents working the same area after they did away with assigned zones.
bad,"Shut up and sit in the corner while I sell your people. Was not given instruction nor did my ""mentor"" do cold calling or canvassing with me but would chastise me for not getting it done. So if you don't show me how then how can you expect me to do it effectively."
bad,"I started the interview process so excited to finally start something new, and different. I met the boss and immediately knew he was who I wanted to work for. I started so full of life even though my personal life was wearing thin. I went to sales school, and learned so much, but kept finding myself feeling out of element with the whole process. The company prides itself in culture but it came off as cliquey, with management styles differing varying by the person teaching the training class. "
bad,"Overall, Aflac is a good company. However, the culture is a bit archaic. The c-suite is completely isolated from the rest of the organization. It’s very hierarchal. Lots of gate keepers. It’s also not very transparent. They celebrate the good stuff and keep the challenges very close hold. They are challenged to make difficult decisions. The CEO claims they don’t fire people. Completely false. Would not recommend going to work for this company."
bad,"This is not a very stable job for someone looking for a long term career. Unless you get numbers in your sales, your pay check will be non-existent since you're commissioned(You don't get a base wage). Your target clients could be nice and easy to work with and you'll land a sale but sometimes they'll string you along for awhile without one. It's not worth the stress on your car and self due to a never stable pay check or one at all!"
bad,"Alot of testing and practiceing in order to be the best i can be , I take pride in my work and really enjoy working with people and learning new skills"
bad,"You have to have a certain kind of personality to do well with Aflac. I am not that type so I struggle and am looking for a new career path. The people who do well are the outgoing extroverts who never stop talking. Introverts like myself do not want to try talking to business owner after business owner and always being told no, it demoralizes you very quickly. Some people can do this but most people can't handle it and struggle to make any money. Going out and prospecting is 99% of this job. If you don't want to do that, don't work here. I enjoy actually sitting down and enrolling employees but that happens a lot less than I would like."
bad,"I was offered a promotion, reached all weekly, monthly and quarterly quotas. Also reached all other markers needed to earn all the quarterly bonuses but was not going to be given the district manager title to receive the bonuses. They want to give me the title the start of the next quarter. That ment my manager would get all the bonus money on the work I did. When I said that wasn't acceptable they chose not to promote  me. So i quit."
bad,"Long hard work with very little return, poor management, lack of training and mentoring.  Worst of all, they lie to you about the numbers needed to make a decent living."
bad,"You need to travel everyday and are responsible for paying all gas expenses with no compensation. 100% commission, would be a good job for people who want to work around their own schedule and don't want to work under a boss."
bad,I sold in an area that has income average 25000/ yr.. manager and wife had inherited most of area from father .. hard to make money... ask to come back part time.. they never would set a meeting to discuss it.. be careful
bad,"Essentially the job was door to door sales. I learned time management, customer retention, building customer rapport. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment, people were fun and interesting. The worst part was the actual job, with no hourly compensation and no leads, you are essentially expected to learn on the job and are left to your own devices. For beginners this is not a track for success as it costs you money from the start."
bad,"Not good for an older person who needs income. It is a commission only position with no benefits. You for the most part have to find your own customers. "
bad,Good place to start learning about the insurance business as a young college graduate if you don't mind working on commission.  Was not a fan of making the suggested 500 cold calls a day.
bad,"There is an initial period that can be a month or longer between when you are first interviewed to your first day working. There are also fees to register at Aflac and also to take the licensing exam (up to 160$ usually). The management is friendly and encouraging, and your fellow agents are usually nice, but everyone is competing with each other, so it can be stressful. The hardest part of the job is not knowing where to look for leads outside the SalesGenie and getting rejected 300 times all day without one person agreeing to meet with you."
bad,"Aflac does not invest in their employees. There is no base pay, no health benefits, and no assistance with leads. All costs are out of pocket to the employee and can only be reimbursed with a tax write-off."
bad,you have to work very hard to earn enough to survive the first years. This is a job for someone who already has an income or does not need the money right away. If you are aggressive busines oriented this is the place for you.
bad,"If you do not have another job or someone to help supplement your income, this position is not for you. It takes quite some time to begin generating income unless you are taking over someone else's book of business. The business cycle typically takes 10 weeks before you finally produce an income but the percentages force you to work three times as hard just to break even. This is the reason the company has such a high turn over rate. They promise to help you build your business by pairing you with district sales coordinators to help you, but because everyone is a commissioned worker, each person is focused on their own business and income to sustain themselves. This makes it difficult for anyone to truly help you out in the field. Although the trainers are great people, its just not enough to help someone sustain a decent income. For those who do make it, it has literally taken them three years. The company has a great insurance model but it doesn't work for many of those who are hired to bring in the business."
bad,"Aflac is an insurance sales agency that internally functions as a pyramid business.  Notice I did not say scam, since it is a beneficial, legitimate agency,  The pyramid comes in the recruitment and compensation of the company."
bad,"eh, no patients! They dont work with you! they want you to sell sell sell!!!! It was difficult working for them because they wanted you to work more than you could."
bad,Great product. Too many independent agents. Company does not want to committ to employing agents so they have a commision based pay scale. Its possible to work all day and not make any money. Thats not practicle for most people.
bad,"The flexible hours allowed me to spend plenty of time with my dying father and doing things in my personal life  that needed to be done.   The job itself, working with people, exposing them to programs that would greatly benefit them - was extremely enjoyable."
bad,"When you start out new you come out excited thinking that thinking outside the box will help you generate new accounts. Be careful not to share your ideas, even your trainer will steal them.  If you are lucky you will get the one good District Coordinator that actually understands that the better you are trained the better it is for the entire team as well.  Don't be fooled on those top producers either. The key is being the right arm of the DC and you will be spoon fed groups that belonged to others that left open groups before you."
bad,Great product concept.  Need management help.  Good people.  High turn over.
bad,"your to your own devices, your not given any direction and am constantly told to hit your marks. You do not make a dime before selling something. business have been hit so hard by Aflac you'll be lucky to be able to continue talking to a business owner after you tell them who you represent. no co-workers , your on your own."
bad,"It was a door to door sales environment, met a lot of interesting people. AFLAC has wonderful and helpful products. The job is pure commission, though, so you must have a wide social network to be successful. It is also pure commission, so if you are not successful quickly or have anything to fall back on while you are building your clientele, would not recommend."
bad,"I would arrive at work around 7am and we would have morning meetings. I learned a lot about the insurance business. I felt mislead by management, I was told that the agents worked in teams, but I was expected to work alone. My co-workers were overly competative. The hardest part of the job was being turned down by cold-calls. The most enjoyable part was being able to provide affordable insurance to those with limited means."
bad,Chaos and Confusion ruled! Very few have made it. For the most part you had to learn the business by grabbing here and there. The information was great when you could get it.
bad,It's a great job if you already have lots of business contacts that you feel good about approaching.
bad,"Though I enjoyed working with my personal office DSC's the company as a whole isn't that great....no health benefits for the employees, no job security, no advancement....need I go on."
bad,"To be fair, you can make a lot of money working here if you have connections and are willing to put in 60+ hours a week (some agents make six figures a year, and I once made $4000 in a single week.)  You can meet a lot of interesting people, learn valuable skills that can help further your career, and learn how the insurance industry works.  Plus, you can get bonuses for hitting sales goals, and if you get a good district sales manager they can really help you out a lot."
bad,"I loved the products and most of the people I worked with. I just wish that they had given me an idea of approximately how much money I needed to invest. Strictly commission based and every dime I made went right back into investing. Unfortunately, I went broke quickly!!!"
bad,It's the new jobs of today where you only get paid if you make a sale.  It is a commission job.  You do get to choose your hours but its only because they are not paying you anyways.  I did see some people who made money but its tough.  They are helpful when it comes to training.
bad,"The business is well run, but they were not fully honest with the setup.  There were too many Reps and there was no real organization on where you could and could not go, as well as no listings of set clients, so you were expected to cold call with no real direction.  There was a market saturation that I asked about during the interview that they weren't honest about."
bad,"I was an agent for AFLAC 25 years in E. Texas.  I made alot of money and was paid quickly. However, management in this area of Texas was horrible. They hired their family and best friends and gave them accounts. Many of them had never even opened an account!! I love the company as far as paying claims!  I was very successful for about 10 years, then realized that its AFLAC that makes all the money because half of everything you are paid goes for car expenses, buying over priced laptops and wear and tear on your vehicle. AFLAC just sits back and gets all the money ...  I was told I would be able to retire after working 10 years and now my renewals are getting smaller and smaller the older I get. People do not keep their policies forever!  They drop them when they change jobs and your renewal check just gets smaller and smaller."
bad,"Working at AFLAC has been one of the most difficult jobs I’ve ever done. It is near impossible to make a living wage supporting your family and your first three years of working in AFLAC. The job has lots of frustrations, lots of unnecessary hurdles and unless you have a great district manager you will not be successful. Although I enjoyed helping people in the work to be done. The compensation Package is weak at best. There are lots of other supplemental benefit companies who is compensation packages are much better than AFLAC’s. Unless you have a great second job or a lot of savings built up I would not work for AFLAC."
bad,"Can be a worthwhile career for anyone who has the ethical flexibility to end up having to lie to close the sale. Once you've worked for Aflac long enough you come to the conclusion that the product simply doesn't have value. At that point you come to a crossroads, you either look elsewhere for employment or you resign yourself to the fact that you're selling empty hypotheticals to regular people. Management is cutthroat, but that comes with the territory, no major complaints there. Expect a new Market Director every couple of years, they clean house regularly. Other employees are ruthless as well, but once again it's sales so it's to be expected as business as usual. Personally the hardest part of the job for me was trying to force myself to sell something that I knew had little to no value or practical application to the general public. For most other people it'll be the discipline required to maintain a regular cash flow. The most enjoyable part of the job is also linked to the most difficult part of the job, the flexibility that comes with a 100% commission based sales job can't be matched."
bad,Fun to work with the contest. Need to be out and knocking on doors to achieve your goals.  Marketing training and awards for achieving goals and lots of contest to get bonuses.
bad,"Despite the quality of the product, it is a tough sell to business owners.  Commission only makes it harder on the agent.  Although there were weekly meetings it was short on training.  Needed more one on one and more assistance with getting meetings with business owners."
bad,"100% commission position so it is extremely time consuming and expensive to get started. "
bad,could be a good opportunity if you enjoy cold calling.  The geographic area I called on had no structure and many companies had been called numerous times by Aflac agents.  The lack of organization was very frustrating.
bad,"I was told going into the job that I would service a book of business to give me income while I sought to open new groups to grow my client base and income.  It's been over 6 months and I have no groups to service, the area market is saturated with Aflac reps, significant travel is expected, and I've spent 3x what I've earned trying to make this a viable career.  Bust!  Moving on..."
bad,"If you don't have children and have the drive to always be looking for new business then this is a company for you.  They have a great marketing strategy with the DUCK which everyone knows.  You can make some crazy good money and have a lot of fun, but be prepared to work hard.  It will be worth it.  Don't forget to bring your integrity with you.  In this business agents have a tendency to lose what is most important sometimes."
bad,The team worked well for a bit but the constant turnover of the employees gets to be wearing on a person's soul. Great job for a self motivated individual who doesn't care much about team work.
bad,"Started off motivated to learn a new industry but quickly realized the position may not be for me.I had to generate my own leads by cold calling, stopping by businesses to introduce myself, or through people that I knew. Generating leads in a business to business sales job was harder than I thought it would be."
bad,"Give yourself a couple years to make start making good money. Maybe longer."
bad,"when I was interviewed, It as during a transition time. shortly after I was hired, the management left. I didn't receive proper training, and it made my job hard to perform. people were nice though."
bad,"The longer you work there the more the commission structure benefits you, but the fact is that you will probably have to work 6 months with no pay which is absolutely ludicrous."
bad,"The benefits consultant job was very fast paced, and would not recommend if you are new to sales.  They do not give you much practice on what to say, and really want you to sell insurance to people you know."
bad,"Aflac is a great program.  However, it wan't for me.  My supervisor pumped me up so much about how much money I was going to earn, then didn't even bother to help me set up accounts.  You mostly get rejected within 1 to 2 sentences because most business owners have already been contacted by Aflac."
bad,Working with this company I have learned that you will get something and have it taken away. VERY focused on contests that do not promote the company.
bad,"The benefits are average. "
bad,"Not that great of a company to work. They could give much better benefits and compensation to their employees, maybe even a base pay to help them get started."
bad,"It is a great company with a great philosophy behind it. However, it is a commission-based job, and it was hard for me since I am not from the area where I worked. Lots of cold calling was certainly not a fun part of the job. The time flexibility was nice. At times I had to work 16 hours a day but I was able to do anything I needed to do throughout the week if it was necessary."
bad,"Workload is unreal, Leadership promotes disjointed processes that in turn makes simple jobs difficult.  The company is operating like it's the back of someone's kitchen."
bad,"Good company to work for, being independent and being new to the business has been quite hard to get started and stay productive."
bad,"A typical day at Aflac as an independent insurance agent involves Monday morning meetings - talking about goals, quotas, and how much money was made the previous week, prospecting - going door to door trying to get individuals and businesses on board with Aflac, and repeat. Although this doesn't seem bad, your pay is 100% commission, meaning no matter how much time you put into your work it doesn't mean you will always get paid. Sometimes you pay to work.  They tell you to keep hitting doors  and drilling the concept of the law of large numbers , but even if you hit those doors and put countless hours in, you get nothing out of it because some people don't want Aflac or just don't have the time to listen or get their employees together. More or less your just planting the seed for them and there is no reciprocity for you as an individual. Although I have seen success with some individuals, I would say one out of many will be successful. That said there employee retention rate is not very high. I would only recommend this job if you are financially stable or as a part time one. The co-workers are great and friendly but when it comes to getting commissions it becomes cut throat as you are all competing for the same businesses and areas, and the team leaders create favorites among their team members. The most enjoyable part of the job is hitting doors because you get to meet all kinds of people and see many different businesses. If a received any thing from this job is sales skills and social skills as well as how employee benefits work. So in conclusion there concept of paying"
bad,"I started off doing cold calls, then eventually acquired a few clients."
bad,Medical Insurance for under insured. Medical Eligibility for workers without insurance and preventative benefits specialist.
bad,"Decent product and a great name recognition. Aflac really not wanting long time agents or they would offer benefits ( Aflac plans are available at a high rating and disability is not even offered), they really focus a lot on new hires and then after a year they don't care."
bad,"Used a cutter to cut metal to length for the making of truck bed covers, took daily inventory of stock."
bad,You really have to be a hard go-getter who is into sales and doesn't mind going to door to door to make a sale.
bad,I didn’t trust my leadership which was a slippery slope. There was blatant favoritism and it was not based on work experience or one’s ability to do their job.
bad,"If you're in sales, your pay is entirely commission. Get ready to do a LOT of cold calls and walk-ins to get started, and don't expect to make any money until you're well-established. People at Aflac will tell you how great it feels to be on top and ""winning"", but neglect to mention how difficult it is to get there."
bad,"I started Aflac, unemployed. I spent $2000 from my savings account, driving to businesses, buying suits and ties, business cards, etc. and made about 100 phone calls every morning for 6 months. "
bad,"I enjoyed our weekly meetings, but this is not an entry level job. it is very hard to make the cost of living, due to the fact that it is commission only."
bad,"Landing clients is tough"
bad,"Simply put, if you can handle 100% commission then it is the job for you. However in Denver, working for free is not possible. That being said, the management is more than supportive in trying to keep you motivated through the grind."
bad,Great people to work for and are willing to help you. 100% commission is extremely difficult to make a living wage on until you are established which takes over a year
bad,"You're a door to door insurance salesman. There is no paid training. And they assume that you're going to use your existing friends and family to sign them up to generate an initial income. But if, like me, your not from the area you live in and you don't have a close network, then you're work is even harder. You have to drive around every day going from business to business just trying to get an appointment to talk to a decision maker in order to get a meeting to explain the benefits and then a subsequent meeting to present to the employees. "
bad,"The job that I was told I was applying for in the interview was absolutely not the job I was hired for. They twist their words in order for you to come and work for them. Since I basically work for myself and just have a contract with Aflac I don't get benefits. Which was definitely not made clear to me in the interview. I had to drive two hours one way for pointless training. In this area of North Carolina they hired way to many ""new associates"" because you can't walk into a business where Aflac hadn't been offered before. If you stick with it long enough and they think you're good enough you can get promoted pretty fast for a district sales coordinator. I put four stars for life/work balance because the amount of money you make depends on how much you work. So you can pick and choose when you work, aside from the ridiculous training. Needless to say I'm not too impressed after spending a few hundred dollars obtaining my insurance license for them. They do a lot of contests and you can win corporate trips. By a lot I mean it's an annoyance almost when you go to work and that's all you hear about. You now have to start nominating people for interviews with the company in order to qualify for the prizes and trips. The potential in this job is infinite if you have people to guide you along the way, which is lacking for me at this point. There are so many things I was told about this job that aren't true. So listen carefully to what they tell you/read in the job description."
bad,Commission Only.  Not my preference.  Great Management.  Great incentives.  Easy Commute.  Great training.  Great Mentor.  Trips annually.  Very professional.
bad,I recently applied for a customer service position at Aflac. I was really looking forward to my interview n hearing about the opportunities. However I was disappointed during the interview to find out how low the rate of pay is for a customer service position. I was completely disappointed n thought what a waste of time. Then he brought up another position as sales and it was 100% commissions!
bad,It is unpaid and I learned nothing.  There is no management during the day.  Management has strong favoritism.  I regret taking this internship.  There were no polices or rules.  It was like going to daycare.
bad,"Exc. Managment does not want to hear about what may be the right thing to do or what may be required of the company, they simply want to hear yes, even when yes is not the right answer."
bad,"I agree that it is great company based on how they take care of the employee who obtain a certain level within the structure,  The rewards are great for meeting certain goal financial goals."
bad,"The last year has been a constant implementation of inconsistent, unclear and unstable processes and procedures that cause excessive stress and failure to perform productively in the production environment.  Insufficient training & inability of Management to assist with the countless problems."
bad,"When initially recruited for the position, it seemed idyllic; nights and weekends off, no holiday hours, and its just statistics that you would get appointments based on the number of calls you were willing to make. The reality was not at all what they described.  No base pay, so unless you can live off of your savings for about 6 months, or you can stand working 80hrs a week because you have to work a second job because you can't afford to live off your savings then this is for you.  I could not deal with the amount of hours it took to actually get any appointments.  This was a very frustrating position for me."
bad,cold calling by telephone and in person to launch a sales pitch to management. Was mentored by experienced sales agent. Meet often with entire sales team for encouragement and tips.
bad,making sales calls  and going to business and talking to the owners
bad,"Prospecting and networking is a typical day at Aflac.  I gained a vast amount of knowledge in health and life insurance policies. Also how to sell to customers with no pressure techniques.  Also cross selling insurance policies to fully cover an individual.  Management was fair, they pushed a little hard but only to benefit you.  The hardest part of my job was prospecting, cold calling, and trying to secure new clients.  The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely helping people everyday and making them feel worry free knowing that they have the right insurance in place."
bad,people will only help you if you are capable making a sale.
bad,They do not want to help their management. Many of the managers are leaving because of the State Office. Try to work under another STATE! You do have your choice.
bad,I need to work to pay my bills. Lots of training and legwork with no compensation. Made very little in 4 months. At the mercy of your mentor!  I was supposed to be full time and she would take me out MAYBE 10 hours/week. Also agents all talked about each other. Very toxic culture.
bad,"If you do happen to be successful, you may earn quite a bit of money. In my experience, I did get some help from management but I was almost completely on my own. I've done a ridiculous amount of work for no pay and very little work for good pay."
bad,I like how you can work whenever you’d like to. It sucks how it’s commission based only. You pretty much start earning money until a month after your training is finished with.
bad,"They hire as many sales people as they can, don't pay them for training and don't pay their licensing, don't give them territories, and essentially flood the market with salespeople. Business becomes irritated because so many Aflac agents pester them per day. It's incredibly difficult to make money there unless you are a manager. I did, however, like my coworkers, and found it to be a fun, relaxed environment."
bad,"Very difficult to earn money and it takes a long time to get any. If you can go about six months with out money, then it might be worth taking a shot at it."
bad,"must make 20-50 cold calls at businesses per day, if you don't sell your quota, you don't make any money. If a client cancels a policy or is late to pay, it comes out of your paycheck."
bad,"very stressful job to work, because of non stop calls from customers about paid, denied or filed claims. On the phone for the full 8 hours except break and lunch. Most enjoyable part of the job was being off the phone for meeting."
bad,Temping at this place is like not existing. They overlook you if you are not a permanent employee there and there are a lot that we were not able to participate in when the company held functions. Also payrate sucks if you are a temp as well. Seems as if they make anyone a manager because my manager was very petty and unprofessional. It's all about who you know at this place if you wish to get ahead. They even tell you when you had to take your lunch and be back.
bad,Not all Mgmt. is good.  Be resourceful and learn to swim fast. Keep another job until you have a book of business. Focus on bringing money in for the company then you earn respect. Some people are more helpful than others. You have No real friends until you've been there a long time.
bad,"Being an Aflac associate, I needed to use my car, phone, and purchase promotional items and food for clients. This is a 100% commission compensation job. If you are fortunate enough to land a client with over ten employees to participate, and do that every two weeks, you may be able to do this as a career. The regional manager is very friendly and goal oriented. The most difficult part of the job is driving around and walking in random business to find clients because they have all already had other Aflac agents call on them numerous times. I enjoyed the flexibility to work a short day when necessary."
bad,"Yes you can choose your schedule, but really you can't.  You will have a district manager that will micromanage even through they say they won't.  There is very little teaching/training and it is all about getting appointments.  If you don't have a problem walking into peoples businesses and interrupting their day, you can be successful and make good money.  If you respect peoples boundaries and right to not be bothered by sales people everyday I would suggest you find a different career.  Plus you don't get paid unless you set up an account.  Probably why they don't care if they teach/train you at all.  Also, they don't offer benefits, which is funny considering what you are selling."
bad,"I began this job clueless about insurance and working as agent. However, I quickly embraced the new opportunity and clung to every word I was told. I was cold calling at least 25-30 businesses a day and setting appointments like crazy, but I was getting nowhere and nothing. 3 months in I still had not signed on any accounts and the lady that was assigned to train me had begun getting new trainees and was becoming less accessible to me. I was sent on my own before I even got started. And to make matters worse I was beginning to find out that Aflac does tons of hiring in a market that's already saturated with their foot soldiers. All I can say is have a fat savings and a plan b or c before you sign on to this company."
bad,Working with a company that helped others in adverse times was rewarding. Getting to meet the public and travel throughout the city was awesome. 
bad,Solicatation of potential clients. Cold calls and set appointments. Presenting the program to companies and/or individuals. I learned it wasn't as easy as was told. Good training program. I had no experience in sales and found it to be very frustrating. Actually enjoyed the training aspect of it all.
bad,I was under the assumption that after paying for my state exams and being liscenced that this position would be a full time job in an office setting. Unfortunately you have to drive all over to find clients that will meet with you to inform them of what AFLAC is. This takes a lot of gas that they don't pay for.
bad,This was a great place to work. Once you get to management the pay is good (although I never did).
bad,"I have not been working here at Aflac long but the time that I have been here I can say they set their employee standards way too high. Since I have been here its been nothing but issues. They have good benefits as a company but that's nothing if they don't make their employees feel appreciated. They don't want you to take too long on a call with the customers and expect you to meet  a average handle time of under 7 minutes which is highly impossible to me considering the fact that this is a insurance company and most of the customers that call in will have on going questions and concerns about their claim or about Aflac services , elderly people who call in that may know nothing about their policies or how to get online, etc. These are examples of what most people may call in and so many different scenarios that may put the handle time over 7 minutes. Sounds like they want us to rush the customer off the phone to get to the next caller and that's not the type of background I came from in my previous call center experience. I felt like this is a constant issue which I do not like."
bad,"good work/life balance, is strictly commission-based, however, need to get your Life and Health license to start, no benefits, no expense reimbursement"
bad,"I absolutely loved working at Aflac at first, but the money comes in fairly slow at times to the point I became behind on bills, and this job you have to use your own money and personal transportation to get work done. It’s not worth the headache if you can’t wait for pay or go WEEKS broke or low."
bad,"In order to make a livable wage in this company you must make around 200 cold calls a day (roughly 1,000 a week). They did not tell me this beforehand and implied I would be receiving ""warm leads"" which was 100% not true. There is no base salary and no benefits, and enrolling yourself in Aflac benefits is actually more expensive than what your clients pay. The best part of the job is that you can make your own schedule and do the work wherever you want, and I found the people who worked at the office were very kind and helpful."
bad,Scam! They lie to you to get you in there then tell you its 100 percent commission. They try to sell you a dream. You go weeks/months without any money in your pocket. Upper management only cares about what is going in their bank account. Please avoid. Great work life balance but they have favorites.! Trust me. You make calls all day long. Cold Calls. and door to door sales to businesses.  You drive a lot and make no money. There's always something they don't tell you to try to keep you from leaving
bad,Job is fully commission based and you will become a 10-99 employee. This means that they will hire anyone willing to work which also means that they are overflowing with current and Ex-employees who flood the market and tarnish the name of Aflac Salesperson
bad,"This was a good learning experience for me, and is probably a fine place to work if you're really a sales person at heart, which I am not. Fun, collaborative but competitive culture in the office."
bad,I enjoyed the work and had an amazing supervisor who motivated on a daily basis. I enjoyed meeting and speaking with new people everyday. They offered rewards regularly for goals met.
bad,"The company overall was good, however, the territories were never balanced.I could walk into a company that had seen a number of Aflac reps and there was nothing I could say since the territory was not protected"
bad,"It was a typical insurance scenario.  It was mostly to sell to your existing contacts.  The atmosphere was very competitive."
bad,"Lots of cold calling so if you are into that then this is a good job for you. Pay is off of commission, so there were days I worked 8 hours and never made money."
bad,"NA - I didn't really like it - but I also wasn't successful at selling so my bias is skewed of course. I think it would have been beneficial to provide some hourly compensation to new employees while they work up their sales pipeline. Another issue was that sales people were often not staying in their own territory, which is a double edged sword because it of course makes those in lower income territories suffer in sales if they had to tread it non-stop, but it also hurts other sales people in other territories in regard to their planning/coordinating where to go to target prospects."
bad,I was not a fan of going door to door and doing drop ins.  I preferred to get the referrals and work for my leads.  It wasn't a great place to really get a good idea of the insurance business.  I think it was more of the bad side of the business.
bad,"Executed the sale of custom insurance plans to businesses."
bad,it was amazing  I really loved it made great money great people and amazing leadership organizations and workshops. would give it a try if I had the chance again
bad,"I started working for Aflac in July of 2015. My boss was great and very encouraging and i felt like I received great training. After i was ready to go i launched myself into this business and got an account right off the bat."
bad,Hard work. Rewarding pay. Opportunities to achieve if keep mind sharp and watch both front and back. Commission based sales in a shark tank. Those who are worthy are well supported.
bad,"was not the internship i was expecting. thought i would be shadowing underwriting or auditing, was actually out pedaling sales in the streets. would not recommend."
bad,Tough entry level job that establishes solid work habits throughout life. Learned a great deal about the sales process and working with other. Being an effective communicator and setting next steps.
bad,"if you're in a small area, there is not a lot of support and the commissions are harder to get. If you're going to work as an account rep you need to go to a larger area"
bad,Most insurance jobs if your an agent are commission only therefore this is not an ideal job for a mature person to start with.  You have to have a good book of business that can take years to accomplish. I wish someone would have been more upfront on how hard it is to get clients.
bad,"I 100% believe in the value of Aflac; however, working for Aflac is a commission only job.  I enjoy the people, the work and the lifestyle but a commission only job does not provide stability for my family."
bad,"Fast pace, high energy, sales postion. New people everyday was the most enjoyable and the most difficult. I enjoyed working with a team as well as by myself on my own tasks."
bad,"The people I worked with I really enjoyed. The biggest downfall, its all commission and coming out of grad school, I need a constant paycheck."
bad,"B2B and personal sales in life, health and variable annuities - licensed in FL, OH, KY, and WV.  I learned about selling insurance as previous jobs were on the other end of the business in insurance administration"
bad,"Hired almost anyone who was willing to give sales a try and very unstructured depending on which sales leader you were assigned to.  Helped structure me into importance of controlling an planning my day, being you didn't clock in or out it was all about results."
bad,"Answering emails and phone calls,making sales"
bad,Aflac is a great company with great benefits but it's necessary to keep business flowing or you won't make any money
bad,"insurance job is very excited when you aggressive. it an independent job where you can make a tone of money, but you have to pay the price day in and day out."
bad,"Not exactly what they promise when they sign you up, you learn as you go which cost you money,"
bad,This job didn't work for me.  It's not my expertise area.  But good experience and understanding insurance sales representative.
bad,"In my position as independent agent, it was my responsibility to prospect and contact leads in order to educate/counsel them on the products AFLAC had to offer.  It is basically insurance sales."
bad,"This place expects you to do everything. Here you do your own marketing from a network that you create. You meet with business owners to get them to approve you bringing in Aflac benefits to their employees. From here, if they say yes you can talk to the employees you must then enroll them in the products. Once they are signed up you then hopefully get paid from the policies you submit. Once the policies are active you also become their claims specialist and process any claims that the customers have. Also, you are expecting to recruit new agents daily."
bad,typical day is to vist different business and talk to potential clients
bad,"Waste time and money cold calling hoping to land the next big account. It won't happen. You may get a few small accounts (less than 10 employees) and if you can talk them out of their of the beer and taco money, you'll make some commission until they quit or cancel. Then you spend that money driving around cold calling, 4 corner marketing, networking and maybe you don't get a stapler thrown at you first for being the 7th Aflac rep this week (and it's only Monday). Too many agents. It ruined a good brand. They start, get a couple of accounts and maybe win a fast start award, then quit. Cost too much in gas and rubber. Training is second rate, all cold calling scripts very little product. Most DSC's in Houston have quit or are gone. Churn um and burn em! Fake it until you make it! Aflac must own gas stations, they are the only ones making money from starving Aflac agents."
bad,A pleasant place to work but very routine. Big expectations. Can be rewarding for agents.
bad,You need reserve income at least to cover one year's living expenses while trying to build your businesses. The market is flooded with AFLAC agents to the point where businesses are irritated when contected again and again. Unless you already have an extensive business network of potential clients you will not earn very much.
bad,"Tough gig.  It sounded great when they recruited me, but every business I contacted had already been contacted by at least one Aflac rep.  There must be a bazillion of them running around out there.  Finding businesses that hadn't been contacted and were actually interested was like finding a needle in a haystack."
bad,Find a place that will actually educate you in the insurance field. Have at least 6 months of salary saved up to make it. Challenging market selling Aflac products
bad,"This career is not for me. It is not a job that I feel is truly rewarding in the ways I would like for it to be. I am looking to get started in a career will allow me to work with children. A career that I know will be rewarding, yet challenging."
bad,"very good and loving team, directors r very cooperative , decent encouraging.. u feel all is one big family"
bad,"I called on and set my own appointments. I learned valuable insurance information. My management were also in sales, so their availability was limited. I found my management and co-workers professional and hard-driven. The most difficult part of this job was it was cold call sales with straight commission. If I didn't sell, I made nothing. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people constantly and learning their life stories."
bad,"A typical day would start with prospecting for new accounts or maintaining/servicing existing accounts (yearly open enrollment). An appointment with a new prospect would mean to meet an employer to discuss the possibility of offering Aflac products to employees of the company. Once this is established, I presented programs to employees and enrolled them in voluntary supplemental policies. The company's headquarters is in Columbus, GA. The state office is in Trumbull, with the Regional Office in Rocky Hill. My district office is in Bristol, CT. The management is there to support with individual sales goals. The job's challenges are the administrative duties which include billing issues, and helping policyholder with claims while continuing to promote new business. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving gratitude from policyholders after they've received their claim checks."
bad,If you are good at selling this should be easy for you. Try to learn quickly on your own. Closing accounts by yourself will give you the best pay. Good luck.
bad,"Was recruited as an intern during university. Not worth my time, very few of my fellow interns did anything substantial, and it was difficult to make any money. It did not really build up any skills despite basically being an unpaid internship. As a job it sounds great, (but not for me) however as an internship it was a poor choice."
bad,"I quickly got a feeling of the high turnover rate of the business. They did give us training, but after a couple of training classes, you were put on the street by yourself. They had promised other training and helpful leads, which were not given."
bad,Always driving to try and get appointment with owner of business. Work long hours and may not get one appointment so no pay check. The most enjoyable part of this career is when owners understand how you really can help their employees and they let you meet with them. Commission only.
bad,Sales school and getting my insurance license was fun but there area was just too saturated with AFLAC agents to make any money at it. Had I found businesses that hadn't already been contacted by AFLAC agents I could have made money at it and I enjoyed being out and about.
bad,"If need to earn money and have no back up Aflac is not the place to be. It takes time to get any sort of residual income and the constant daily prospecting. Supplemental Benifits are a tough market, now days almost all companies offer some form of supplemental voluntary benefits. Years ago AFLAC was one of the only companies around that is no longer true. I do have to say they are one of the most ethical companies I’ve seen. Long hours no benefits no  base pay is hard. If you have at back up or want to earn extra money it’s good. If need money from day one avoid all  commission only jobs."
good,This is a commission only job. They send you to training and pay for your hotel and food while there but you pay to drive or fly there. A typical day is stopping at 10-20 businesses to set appointments. You also spend many hours prospecting. This means going through many books and libraries. You also must organize it. This job is tough worth. Aflac does NOT provide you leads. Your mgr does NOT help you. It is so I or swim. I swam and it wasn’t for me.
good,Horrible management and very back stabbing and unethical people who work there.  Very bad work environment.  Constant turnover.  No support from management. No benefits.
good,"I represented AFLAC for several years. I would say that this is not a job that is for everyone. There is a lot of self discipline necessary to be successful. You really need to make a lot of personal and professional sacrifices to be above average in this business.  This is NOT a part-time job either. It is getting up early and going to bed late. It's about not seeing family and friends until you have met the needs of the job. And even at that, have you done enough to sustain enough time to and money to get you to where you want to be? It will not always pay off in commissions, sometimes it is just the satisfaction that what you do and the product that you sell and service could someday save someone from losing their home or their family. That is the true sacrifice that you make as an agent. NOT a DSC/RSC or beyond.  It ALL starts with you the agent."
good,it was commission based so it just wasn't for me.   You have to get your own leads and get good training but if you cant find businesses that want there insurance you wont get any money coming your way.
good,"I think Aflac is an awesome company but as with any job, it always depends on who is training you. I started aflac while being employed some where else because as we know insurance for the most part is a commission based job/career. I was let go after a month for not knowing the product well enough, not having enough time to spend with my district coordinator (trainer) & not knowing the area well enough. All things I think that could have been worked on. I mainly think my trainer was embarrassed of me because everyone else & their teams were advancing with their new trainees & I wasnt making any progress, but day by day I was making small wins ( which I am dang proud of myself till this day). I didn't feel any kind of way, because I am fairly new to the area, new to being an insurance agent & aflac has alot of information that needs to be known & known throughly, to be able to provide to the potential clients. I say take the chance you might be amazing at it, but dont put yourself in a sticky situation financially with nothing in return, if they see your potential they should be willing to work around YOU. Because technically their business is already running & has been for a few years, that's why they're in a position to train you to do the same."
good,"My start with Aflac was very shady.  My DSC was more interested in taking business from me rather than teaching me how to build my business.  As I was transitioned from one district to another, my new DSC would assume the previous one taught me how to do the most basic of procedures.  Not only would I not know how to do them, I didn't even know what help to ask for."
good,"I love the product as it helps people's lives very much.  I wanted to help others and feel like I was doing something that made the world a better place. Unfortunately, as a new President was elected, business owners have become very cautious about bringing on new programs or make changes.  Most saw value in the product but were not willing to implement Aflac, as I've been told to come back in 6-9 months.  Business owners repeatedly said they are cautious as they do not know what changes the President is going to make that may affect their businesses.  I'm wanting to return to my Administrative roots because working for Aflac is a commission only salary model.  I find it difficult to make a salary that I can generate a solid financial foundation."
good,"While some throuroughly strive in this type of setting, don't let them fool you! They work 80 hours a week (including weekends) to build up their ""book of business"" all for very little pay! You need to Hustle Hustle Hustle in this business if you want to be able to eat! While the rewards seem great (trips, $$$, Prizes), you have to hit some seriously strenuous goals. Be wary of the ""Benefit Consultant"" title they claim to use... you are merely a low on the totem pole sales person! And depending on how often you need to eat is how greasy you're going to get!"
good,"100% commission based. "
good,Most areas are already saturated with Aflac agents and companies are sick of seeing Aflac come through the door. Getting past the gate keeper is a huge issue especially when you need to get to the decision-maker.
good,Poor pay/compensation for work; not enough income to continue to pursue.  Too many individuals saturate the field and step on each others toes: frustrating to make money.
good,"My leader never had time to actually train, he did not set us up for success, rather taught us by telling us to go out and try different things ""say this"" ""make it seem like that"". Was not good at explaining things. He recruited me with false hopes and didn't give realistic expectations. With the lack of training and the lack of leadership and support I would never recommend anyone to work for AFLAC unless you are a person who likes to work off of strictly commission and work more than what you should."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, but as you progress up the corporate ladder, there is a middle management glut that can lead to the inability to promote up.  Current employees are not afforded a cost of living increase, however new incoming employees are compensated based on the current cost of living, which often means that they will make more coming in the door than someone at the same level with more years of experience within the company."
good,Unless you have family in the business you'll never make it. This is a fun job but you'll never pay your bills on hopes and dreams. I wish I had people to help me make it until I get on my feet but....
good,They say they are team like atmosphere whereas they are not and agents steal from one another.  You are expected to come with a book of business and are not told that at the begining.
good,"The initial interview was very misleading from the actual demands of the job.  Pay was not clearly stated, and turned out that you only get paid if you sell policies after training.  No pay for training.  Businesses do not enjoy Aflac sales associates coming into their stores and asking about their benefits.  The effort put into the job is not worth the money."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of going business to business to solicit AFLAC and network. I have learned that I am not good in sales and if you do not have a supportive management team, you will go nowhere. Management was not professional. In my opinion they need more professional management in place for this company. The hardest part of my job was the sales pitch. I had a hard time introducing a product that I did not know much about. Also, the rejection part of the job was hard too. Majority of the time, when you set up an appointment, businesses will cancel because they are not interested in the product. You are only paid what you sell, so there are months I went without money. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people. Gaining close relationships."
good,I would check in with the office then go out to make contacts to sell insurance. I learned that i enjoyed meeting people and that insurance sales is a tough business.
good,At this time I really need a job with benefits and a steady check.
good,Fast track training and cold called to close business.  Weekly meeting to team up with other new sales representatives but there were no specific verticals and no assigned territories.
good,My job consists gathering requirements from multiple business units and leading the design and development teams through the build.
good,Typical day is knocking on business doors to set appointments to offer Aflac products. Management was not that great and no leadership. Co workers were great to work with and easy to get along with. The hardest part is finding clients or business owners to commit to Aflac.
good,"Excellent for a single parent looking for something to fit in your busy schedule PT or FT. Down side it is COMMISSION ONLY.. "
good,You do will not have a steady income! They drop you off with no training. Then they didn’t pay me for jobs I actually completed. Good for a student or someone with a second job.
good,Expect to not make a living for 3-5 years.  If you have a partner  / spouse that makes a good living then go for it.  Long term potential good.  Very high agent turnover since it is a 100% commission job.  You will spend a lot of your own money.  Aflac is a great product but has a bad reputation due to agent turnover.  They really should give agents a small yearly salary that slowly goes down to help them survive until they build enough business.  It would also improve the brand and build trust amongst businesses.  Most hr heads and business owners are hesitant because they had aflac at one time but never saw their agent again due to turnover.
good,Had difficulty getting on-on-one assistance to be successful.  Too much time spent on independent computer-based training.  Made no money first 3 months and barely any remaining time there.  You have to be a true salesperson to be successful.
good,This is a great company but depends on the economy of the area your living . If the economy is heathly your sales would be good and your motivation to go ahead. It will give you a guaranty to cover your personal responsibility to go ahead in this industry.
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with, unfortunately they don't pay ypu. It is hard cold calling for hours without pay. You need a good financial cushion in order to sell insurance."
good,"Excellent Sales Training , but my regional and overall company management is not supportive in the field. It was a great opportunity for a new inexperienced agent ."
good,Maybe its not like this in all Aflac markets but the one here is stressful and lacks structure and organizational. While you are supposed to be independent are are also asked to work with others but not able to rely regularly on anyone.
good,"too much power given to local managers"
good,job is only commission. no base salary. you have to go out every single day to earn very little money. you have to go through a licensing program in order to begin selling. very hard to pass
good,"I enjoyed working for Aflac. The only thing is that it is all commission, so with the economy being the way it is right now it was really hard to get people to sign up. even though most of the plans that they sell are no more then 15 dollars but it is per pay check. Over all it was great to work there it got me out of my shell. So if you don't need income  asap then this would be a great fit for you, but if you need an income then my advice this job wouldn't not be a good fit."
good,"Insurance like lawyers get a bad rep, yes they are necessary and helpful but because of all the opportunity and the loopholes that allow you to make so much money many agents give the rest a bad name."
good,"This was a full commission position and commission is not paid unless the account is opened and the first invoice is paid, which means about 3-6 months before you receive your first pay check. This was not a good fit for me but that does not mean it wouldn't be great for some one else. Training was paid for but you are not compensated for travel to training which takes about a week to complete in another location other than where you are hired. A typical day at work included driving around the city going door to door ( required to make at least 50 approaches a day) introducing yourself to various Office Managers, Business Owners ( if you were not rudely ushered away and accused of soliciting)  and ""gate keepers"". Your trainer is there with you but even before you are ready to go it alone they disappear with little to no follow up. Management was practically non existent and any efforts to seek assistance was meet by silence. Though the ability to work my own schedule suited me very well, the office was nice and the school/training location is located across from the new stadium and the view of the city from the office floor would leave you breathless."
good,Great atmosphere. Great Districts and Boss. The only con is that you work commission solely. You do a lot of cold calling and there is a lot of meeting to attend.
good,I didn't have a good support system inside the company. I was never taught what products and services I could offer my clients. The little training I did get wasn't useful.
good,I feel that the company needs serious revision with management.
good,"Need a licensing in order to get paid, as an international intern it is hard to get a license to be able to sell insurance policies."
good,"I learned many things regarding processing claims, dealing with recruiting, and interviews."
good,"My district was too busy to assist me, the company is great just did not cater to employees getting them started..."
good,"Qualifying leads, going out to businesses trying to sell the need for Aflac"
good,"Being an insurance agent with Aflac is only a job for self motivated people who can go without a paycheck, or have a part time job while doing this. This job runs from 8-5. "
good,"mixed feelings be AFLAC has great products, but very little support as an independent contractor and biggest competition in the market are other AFLAC agents stealing business away from you."
good,"I went into this job with very little knowledge of what I was meant to do. Once I did get a grasp of what that was, I got zero help. I would set appointments with potential clients for upper management to present to and the upper management wouldn't show up. This is a good career if you already have a good bit of money and can afford to wait for something good to happen. Otherwise, you need to look elsewhere."
good,"Commission based company, have to start your own groups, outside sales, be agressive, some training, no health insurance, does have investment account for employees"
good,"Cold calls, prospecting, product knowledge, high pace high energy culture, hardest part of the job rejection of product, most enjoyable part was going out prospecting with other agents"
good,Just what the title says. You might make a go of this if you join up with about $20000 in the bank to keep you going while they use you to generate leads. You will not be given a break with this company until you are there (survive) for 1 full year.
good,"Good product portfolio, great amenity for employers to offer to employees and claims are paid quickly to policy holders.Truly the downside is that areas have been worked through so many times that the companies you can make money with are either existing clients or have been thoroughly turned off by previous encounters. 100% commission independent agent which is great, however if your pipeline is not constantly full with viable prospects, it is difficult to stay profitable."
good,They need to make improvements on all fronts. Processes could be entirely revamped. Management does not know any more than the employees but manage to get promoted often.
good,"Required using and marketing to wide variety of friends, family, and connections.  This resulted in a certain degree of mistrust, as family and friends were consistently suspicious that I was using them for marketing purposes only.  I did not like to betray my friends' trust like that."
good,Invested seven months and became #1 in VA for the number of new companies contracted from March - June 2009. Not enough income available. Decided to go back into my fundraising business.
good,"Talk to potential clients"
good,Aflac offers a seemingly great job opportunity if you can handle the high demands for quantity over quality in your performance and customer production.
good,Not a great place to work for if your wanting to advance. You hear daily about all the drama within each district and how many in positions of power got there through politics and not their own merit.
good,"For newer agents that manage to land a large account early on...be prepared to argue with RSCs and DSCs about how much commission you cut them for going with you to help. "
good,"Because of the economy, clients could not afford to purchase supplemental insurance.  A lot of the clients that did purchase, cancelled within a few months.  These cancellations caused a large amount of chargebacks and as an independent agent, I could not afford to continue to put money in and not make any.  There was not base salary only commission.  "
good,"Cold calling, cold calling, cold calling. You better be young, single and living with someone else, or have a spouse or significant other who has a good job that can pay the bills.. Aflac hires anything that can breathe and have a 96% turnover on new Agents within 3-6 months."
good,"- Present to businesses about the value of different plans that could benefit their companies "
good,"You have to be a go getter, persistent and a people person. If not, this is not for you"
good,"Great company and management, very long days with very little reward."
good,"Aflac is a great company to work for if you want to be your own boss. I also recommend you have a savings in place before you start this job. You can go weeks without getting paid if you do not sell. My CIT was great, he was a great trainer and he was amazing. I enjoyed helping people during times of need."
good,"It was ok, wasn't expecting a lot of sales work but it wasn't bad. Hard to review because of the short time I was there."
good,"AFLAC was a unique job experience that required a lot of work and investment to pay off in the future.  "
good,"Aflac is an awesome environment to develop strong leadership and survival skills.  As with most 1099 positions, some months are incredible and some months were very poor.  I led a team of 180 1099's and thrived with leadership.  Being responsible for the welfare of that many employees was a big responsibility and I loved it.  "
good,"You drive your car. Use your gas. Pay for your maintenance. The manager hires as many people as he/she can. If you leave, they get your accounts so they don't care. They say you can make x amount of $, but it will take years to get there. If you only need part-time income then go for it."
good,"This company is a 1099 for benefit advisor position,  You will have good training with your DC.  More than likely you will learn the ropes of selling this product but a tag-along. When on your own, Its now your own business.  Hence, you're a 1099 person and not part of Alfac with their benefits.  "
good,"I have worked at Aflac for about 3 months with no pay because it’s all based off of commission. What you sell is how you get paid. They have only a handful of actual employees so they get benefits and actual living salaries, but they hire new people as independent contractors to help them do business and make money. They give you a bonus of around 2000 for every sal of which they make about 12k. I left because personally I don’t have time to run around town making sales goals for other people. I don’t live with my parents. I have rent so if I don’t make any sales goals then guess who is a homeless college student..."
good,"The typical day is spent going to multiple businesses and schools to try to set up appointments with potential clients. Once you have an appointment, it is fairly easy to explain products. Training focused on getting through the front door (past the gate keeper), and on overcoming objections to purchases. There is a sense of pride to helping people with a good product, but it often requires you to be a bit pushy and have a thick skin."
good,Driving or walking from business to  business in an effort to make an appointment with a decision maker.  So had to get passed the front lines to find out who.  No leads provided.
good,"AFLAC has a great product that every employer should offer, but the sales side is all cold calling by walking into 30-40 businesses a day. Most want nothing to do with you and all of the large companies already have it."
good,"a lot of work not much appreciation, they loved feeding us and overall the experience was nice. Need to have qualified people in position instead of friends of friends"
good,"Great office/ admin. Experience, learned a lot of clerical, office managerial skills, good learning experience. "
good,The time spent there was very educational. I worked with difficult people and some great people. There were no benefits and I felt I did not receive credit for my work.
good,Day shift usually customer appointment basis and cold calling; passed State insurance licensing; local management adequate; hardest part company training; enjoyed outside sales calling on customers.
good,Insurance sales is not for the faint of heart.  The first year or 2 are the hardest.  Sales is commission only and very hard to keep steady pace. Lack of training and follow-through with management.
good,"Nobody is in charge. Lack of direction and leadership in an administrative role. Lots of repetition of meaningless tasks because staff and management don't pay attention to what matters are being resolved, or what action really needs to be taken. Interesting experience but glad its over."
good,Do it if you can afford to not make any money for the first year unless you are the kind of person that can sell things easily. Aflac did not work out well for me because I’m more inclined to be efficient at helping people when they come to me with a problem. At Aflac you’re job is just to sell.
good,"Flexible work at home hours, very convenient. It was a pleasure to help assist people with their claims process personally. Gives a person a sense of fulfillment, as assisting someone personally, helps them feel like someone cares, and avoid the aggravation of an automated system."
good,This job was very flexible. You had to be on your toes though. Going out much during the week and scouting for businesses. I believed in the business and had past sales experience so it was easier for me. Management wasn't very fair in genesee county on the businesses you got on your own when it came to pay when you were new. You really had to pay attention to details and what was going on around you. It's a 100% commission job.
good,"Commission based with promise of residual income, spent majority of my days cold calling & recruiting new employees through internet job sites without any regard to what each persons background or skills were. The idea was to call everyone & anyway."
good,If they liked you they would help you be successful if they didnt you were going to struggle. They were not fair about spreading good leads to everyone
good,Great company with excellent brand recognition. Must be comfortable with cold calling on the phones and in hitting the streets most days.  100% commission can be stressful so be prepared.
good,Not a position for a shy person. Need to have some ability to connect with small business owners to make this work for you. A great opportunity if you have a lot of contacts.
good,Saturation levels are too high for this to be a lucrative income unless you become a district or above coordinator.  It's not a 9 to 5 job.  Need to persevere for several years to have a good residual income. I recommend if it's additional retirement or secondary income.  Great fun meeting people and helping protect families.
good,Training was good. Support for skills brought in was very poor. Accounts obtained were taken by other agent and management did not rectify the issue. Too many agents working the same region. No sense of respect for others hard work.
good,A career with Aflac is like a rollercoaster. Some months you make the money you feel like you should be making and some months you make nothing at all. You really have to be financially stable throughout the whole process.
good,the manager was hands on with assisting the interns. Working closely with the other interns helped make it seem more like a team. The team building exercises made it easier to open up to one another
good,Being a sales agent for Aflac is difficult in terms of having no base pay and having to produce for yourself as your own individual business entity. A typical day at work consists of making calls to potential clients in hope of scheduling appointments and eventually insurance enrollments. I learned a lot about myself and how my strengths and weaknesses align with selling insurance.
good,Hard to get started with training because the trainers are so busy and are not available very much for the trainees. People don't always show up for meetings on mondays.
good,Famous company to work with and they offer a great product.  Getting in front of a prospective business is extremely difficult and that is where the money can be made.  Salespeople need to be very self motivated in learning the product.  If one can explain the benefits and plans most people want the insurance.  Lots of cold calling.
good,"The local management will either make you or break you. Local management in Modesto/Stockton/Sacramento areas are micro managers. Micro management to the point that they push good smart employees away. You have to play games and jump through hopes in order not to become a target. There are way too many reports to fill out, meetings and conference calls each and every week. Most management in this local area are under educated in general and they definitely do not know or understand how to manage employees. They are completely counter productive in these issues. This company does not pay you to fill out reports and go to meetings. You will not be reimbursed for your gas to go to required meetings. No benefits. "
good,The only positive I can give is that the manager is good to work around you or your families schedules.  You are expected to learn most of the information on your own.  Unless you actually sell the insurance you don't get paid very well but you do most of the work that involves fixing mistakes that the sellers under your DM make.
good,"As an independent Life Insurance agent for Aflac can be rewarding but is hard work not only maintain your clients but keeping them."
good,I have been in insurance for my whole career now. Aflac promises alot but fails to deliver. Even when your making thousands a week there will be someone who isn't satisfied enough and that is truly the only time you hear from them. If you live in a rural area and don't have other agents near by good luck! You better be a fast learner because you will have no support!
good,"This is a very hard job to do especially when the economy is in a slump."
good,"Typical day sell Final Expense to customers.  Learned a lot about the Final Expense issues.  Management was ok.  Co-workers were good, hardest part was the costs for some customers with medical issues.  Most enjoyable was to help someone who really needed the coverage."
good,Really disappointed in the sales techniques. Way oversaturated market. Your boss is yourself so spend all the time going into business. to try to open account
good,"The company overall is a great company to work for; however, some of the leaders roles should be reviewed. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on and a lot of people are treated unfairly."
good,Enjoyed the people and the product was good. I am just not a salesperson and needed a secure income. If you are good at sales and can work on commission its a great place.
good,I believe AFLAC is a great company. I just don't think there were for me.
good,"Very Competetive sales, with little upper managment involvement."
good,"I liked working at Aflac, but it takes a while to gain potential customers and prospecting takes a lot of time and a lot of wear and tear on my vehicle with no compensation. No benefits."
good,"making 100 door to door call a week, taking to make appointments with new business. meeting on monday . good to work if you having a saving account."
good,"A typical day at work is prospecting possible clients. I learned that sales is very different from accounting, and that sales can be very depressing in the beginning. I also learned that doing what your management requests will help along the way, however, you need support in the beginning stages. Co-workers help is beneficial, and the hardest part is getting established in your first year. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to the conventions."
good,"Supplemental Insurance sales. "
good,The hardest part of the job is that fact that the area is saturated with agents with no tracking system.
good,Having to work on commission only is a hard way to make a living. It is a lot like starting your own company with a little help but very stressful.
good,"Aflac is a very challenging company to work for. Compensation is 100% commission with zero benefits. You have to pay for your own business cards, stuffed promotional ducks, pens, pencils, etc... Some groups have been known to charge for office space. On my team it was ""mandated"" that you be in the office every day and attend weekly meetings. These meetings were conducted as though we were employees, even though we were actually independant reps and by law were not obligated to be there. For one regional meeting we were ordered to attend, there was a very nasty snow storm and management would not listen to reason. One of my fellow team mates was involved in a very serious car accident due to the slippery conditions."
good,Great place to work if you are a self-starter and hard worker. How much you work is indicative of how much you make.
good,Company cared of clients' and their claims. The community requires more education about supplemental insurance as it is NOT formal health insurance.
good,"good company, however hard in this economy to drive up sales on your own. Must go door to door to make a sale."
good,"If your good at sales you will succeed, otherwise you will be cast aside."
good,You are kinda on your own. They want to start by going through every human you know and then lots of cold calling. It's easy to get lost in the effort by management who works with their family. So they take president.
good,I had several enrollments fall through at the last minute and it was difficult to overcome. Then the follow-up on claims and old accounts was not lucrative.
good,Lots of hours with lots of local travel to be turned away by potential customers. There is constant talk of making money but it takes a good 3 months before you get an traction to make money.
good,"At first everything with the company seemed to be great. However, after being hired on it was a manipulative and money-driven team. My time with Aflac was short due to the work culture being toxic."
good,Aflac needs to implement a structure in agents offices. The district is unorganized and regional is busy selling. There is little help for new agents.
good,"If you are looking to join the company, be sure you search all the offices available in the area and find the right office for you. Each office has it's own rules and you may not like the rules that have been set."
good,"i got sales experience working here, and it was good for that."
good,"This is a basic sales job. Door knocking and cold calling is majority of the job. Training is provided, however, the materials and products offered are never quite as transparent as they should be.  Anyone can be hired which makes for an interesting mesh of teammates.  The overall gig is stressful and compensation is poor."
good,There were constant changes within the area that came from our home office in another state. That upper management tried to follow but lead to difficulty with employees to follow.
good,"A typical Days work is from 8-5 pm, meeting new small business owners. I have learned great sales techniques, how to be better organized! management is good, but needs to be more up to date with todays work force. The culture of this work place is fair could use a larger demographic of African American employees! The hardest part of this job is  doing cold calls and getting your first business accounts to get better established. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people, and actually getting to help people with their insurance needs, being able to make a good difference in peoples lives!"
good,Was a great internship to be apart of. Was able to get first real experience in a business setting and began to develop skills in cold calling and sales.
good,it wasn't the best option for me could be different for you . It takes very long for you to start making a living on it . don't expect to make money right away. it takes a lot of money and time to make money
good,"I was unable to sell any products. "
good,The typical day seemed like you were all alone without any support from your lead.  Never received proper training had to do everything on my own with little to no success.
good,"Insurance Sales Agent working in a professional business-to- business sales environment selling supplemental benefits.  "
good,"I worked long hours and drove many miles. The turnover rate, as in any sales environment is very high. "
good,"Hard Market to start in, slow starting will take a while to make any money. products are great but the diversity of the products could be better, great starting point"
good,"Good company, great benefits to offer. Difficult market to work in. Must be fully committed and willing to go without a steady income. On the plus side there are great bonuses if you can reach the goals and a pretty good team to help with anything you need."
good,Has the potential to bring you a great harvest if trained correctly. I really  enjoyed the flexibility and the other agents being so supportive. Opportunity was there but you must fight to keep your hard work intact.
good,"If you are not in the right group, it will be hard to make a living. you have to go outside of your area and travel out to others to get more prospects and accounts. it can be rewarding, but you need help to gt there."
good,This is a difficult type of work to branch into.  You must have a good trainer who is willing to at lease share some of their business at least at first.  You will have to dedicate many many hours in travel time. Initially you are expected to visit about 40 businesses per day to set up appointments with their employees.
good,The staff members were primarily friendly and helpful. They also provided encouragement and motivation to keep going. This position was door to door sales and strictly commission based. The agents relied on themselves for expenses on gas and the wear and tear on their vehicles. There was also a significant amount of agents to compete with making it more difficult to make a sale.
good,Be prepared to make very little $ in the first few months. I worked for Aflac for 2+ years. Opened/serviced 15-20 accounts. Nothing bad to say about the company..just not for a laid back person(in my opinion).
good,This was a commission only job with no benefits and no expenses covered. Very little training was given and success depended on cold calling which had a very low yield.
good,You had to be a real people person to do this kind of job.  It was fun going into local businesses and trying to sell supplemental insurance.  And meeting people and discovering what types of businesses there are out there.
good,Prospecting making cold calls and trying your best to make appointments. It's a commission type job so you gotta sell to make any money. Hardest part was rude people not trying to even hear you out and also working your hardest and not being about to make much money
good,"Aflac has great products and can help individuals and families tremendously, but they have a poor on-boarding/training system.  They have favoritism.  If you want to build a career in this field make sure the first couple years you can put everything else on the side and focus completely on your business and personal development and you will create your own success. Do not start with Aflac if you have any thing else you have committed yourself too in a personal or professional matter."
good,"straight commission sales. people stopped paying the bill, i stopped getting paid. had to redo the same work over ond over again. good schedule, easy product to sell."
good,"Aflac has great products for people.  However, the training and support for new employees is not yet beneficial resulting in high turn over."
good,"I liked working for Aflac.  I also liked the people that I worked with."
good,"AFLAC has great products and offers a great opportunity but to be successful you need to be comfortable with a lot of warm marketing and sphere of influence calls. AFLAC provides zero benefits unless you work for corporate and every expense is out of pocket, including the initial licensing and training. The company is setup as a pyramid scheme so they over-hire as there is no cost to the company and they do not setup territories which makes it very unprofessional by constantly bumping into other agents. To succeed in this environment you need a pre-established book of business to call on and strong networking ability as the managers only look out for themselves."
good,"While working for Aflac I assist potential clients and candidates with questions, comments, and concerns. I bring in new recruits, and provide assistance to the manager, updating her calendar as needed, keep her on track during the day. I also make high volume outbound calls. Over time I have learned how to deal with frustrated customers and how to provide the best customer service to the client. As far as my co-workers, I do enjoy the people I work around, they are apart of what makes my day go well as work. The hardest part of my job I would say is bringing in the new recruits, because people can be quite rude or just don't show up to their appointments and it gets frustrating having people confirm with me and not show up. The part I enjoy most about my job is providing customer service and helping the client."
good,My days were going from door to door to find businesses welling to offer their employees insurance. I learned to present myself and my ideas to others. I loved the people in the lower levels not in management. The hardest part is that it is a commission pay based on sales and it can be months before you could find a business that would let you in. Loved the freedom of making my own schedule.
good,"Typical day was driving anywhere in Arkansas using my own gas and money to cold call prospective clients. I worked extremely hard everyday, yet it led me nowhere. It's based on commission ONLY. Unless you are assigned to a district manager that ""gives"" you dormant accounts, most likely you'll quit within a few months because there isn't any money coming in. I do believe that the supplemental insurance that Aflac provides is amazing. Career wise, they should stop cold calling/soliciting because people despise it. It is A LOT of hard work, with little pay off. I don't mind hard work, but hard work should pay off. I would never recommend working for Aflac. The lead agents mislead you about the position of being an Aflac Independent Agent. First 2 years are NOT independent, you will be required to meet a quota every month. You are required to cold call Mon-Fri."
good,"The training and management was good, I learned a lot. "
good,I did not care for this position at all.  It was a sales position that had me cold-calling individuals and companies in person and via phone to sell supplemental health insurance.
good,"I was a summer sales intern. I was required to pay my way to work (resources, exam material and licensing), and given a sheet with numbers to cold call. Real training was minimal to none, just receiving motivational speeches. Towards the end of my summer I finally shadowed a sales member on a presentation. Not the best place to work at. "
good,100% commissioned based and overlapping sales agents no territory.
good,"Hard to sell products that are supplemental in this economy, management is fair to poor."
good,Every day is a lot of cold calling and prospecting
good,Had too many agiants in my area so I made no money.I did like makeing my own schedule and good pay.
good,Nice place to get business to business sales experience. They flood the market with agents which makes it harder to obtain business without a lot of travel. 100% commission only.
good,Was to much work for one person part time they needed someone full time and I think the job would of being a better experience.
good,"I came to Raleigh, NC, fresh out of college. AFLAC was hiring, which, as it turned out, is not unusual given the company's extremely high turnover. It was a 100% commission job selling supplemental health insurance to businesses. They say ""Walk in the front door of 40 businesses every day and give 'em the sales pitch"", so you drive/walk around town and do just that. You're all alone (my boss came in door with me for the first several businesses I approached), so being self-motivated is half of the battle of an AFLAC Sales Rep. The other half is tenacity. If you do what they say, it pays off. I know this to be true. But the problem is that your job pretty much sucks, unless you like being accosted for barging in the front door of Mr. Stressed-Out Business-Owner. I would recommend this job for a very specific individual: someone who is desperate for a stable long-term career of some kind and is willing and able to trudge through several years of hard-knocks, door-to-door sales for what will become a hefty salary and financial independence after six or seven years. Key words: desperate and willing."
good,The training is great and the District Sales Managers are very helpful. Lots of flexibility
good,Flight school should spend time on policies and computer technology . Possibly better info for decision maker meeting . Better training of new hires . Not much accountability to new hires. New hires should be given prior groups to practice with
good,"If you can avoid the managerial politics you can do well.   Aflac stresses being an ethical company, sometimes you run into on ethical agents and managers."
good,"Not a lot of guidance.  Some people get frustrated because it’s difficult to get started and takes time before you start earning $$.  Good sales school instructor.  Although they tell you your schedule is your own and you are an independent, it requires much of your time to be successful.  There are ongoing training courses which are required.  Income is not steady."
good,"You can set your own hours after training, but the more you work the better you are rewarded. You will not receive a paycheck unless you open accounts. If you are not a good sales person this is not the job for you. Cold call galore and prospecting is a must otherwise no money. You will have to wait about 2-4 months before you receive a nice paycheck. You will not make $10,000 in your first year. They claim you can make $100,000+ in 4 years. Why are you still driving a Chevy Malibu? Don't let them fool you. If you can sell an Icicle to a snow man this is the job for you. You may be better off in a regular day job with a pay check per week."
good,"Aflac is a comission only 1099 position where you go business to business trying to set appointments with a business owner.  The market is over saturated with new and veteran employees and businesses seem sick of seeing us.  They hire anyone with a pulse and ability to pass the insurance exam, my manager was great and the only positive aspect of the job although he exhibited a lot of favoritism.  Your leads and appointments can be stolen as there are no rules when it comes to obtaining them.  Small businesses will be difficult as you need 3 to make a group.  Chargebacks will eat away at your income as employees frequently leave and leave their policies behind.  Must have safety net and not have a crucial income to be able to stick with this for long."
good,Aflac gave me the guts to start my own company and to take control of my own finances. I didn't care for the overall mandatory cold calling on small businesses - it got you out there - however it was too in your face for me. I preferred a more gental sales approach. That is why I started my own Insurance Brokerage.
good,"Your day normally begins with a meeting with your district sales advisor. He/she will practice ""cold-calling"" with you as develop a list of small business that you would approach using a local library database. You will not have an office. The majority of your time will be spent going business to business to set discovery meetings so you can learn more about how you can help those business secure stable employees."
good,"Aflac is a good company, they have wonderful benefits for their customers. They help out a lot of people in their time of need. It made me feel good when someone received their compensation from Aflac. I like to know I helped someone when they had an accident or were diagnosed with Cancer or had a heartache. That was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"it was an ok job.  The whole nature of the job changed alot after I started.  They required more time in reports and meetings, which is not what I wanted since I was contract work."
good,A typical work day was in office calls and then meeting with clients in the field.  This job was 100 % commission based.  I decided to leave Aflac for a job with a more consistent salary.
good,"Aflac is always looking for new people to join them because it takes a certain type of person to be able to do it full time and make a profit enough to want to stay. They will give you the basis for knowing how to sell their product, but you have to learn how to evolve from there. The places you are trying to get have been hit by Aflac for a very long time and most of the people that did it before you were bad and left the potential client with a bad taste so you are immediately asked to leave by pretty much everyone."
good,"A typical day at work involved self marketing, closing meetings, enrollments, and strategic planning. I learned to be self sufficient by having to complete all of my own tasks and being responsible for my own business. Management was very weak and did not try to properly train employees, which created a high turnover. The workplace culture was a very much ""What have you done for me lately"" culture. I was able to learn how to recruit credible employees by using a different structure then what was being trained at the time. The hardest part of my job was penetrating a saturated market. As healthcare has become more expensive, clients do not want to purchase alternative benefits. I enjoyed being able to learn how to operate a difficult field."
good,"I didn't really get a chance to get into that job i can explain if we speak or meet. This position didn't work out the way i expected it to go, so i can't be  to specific."
good,"A typical day at work is a long day. From meetings to actually doing my job. Some of the task are not  being set up to be successful. There is a lack of resources, training and people knowing what should or should not be done. Management is aware of issues that we face but does nothing about it. A lot of people are leaving the company and going somewhere else where they are paid more for doing the same job. A lot of promotions are done and the jobs are not posted on the job site. So people are not notified or given the opportunity to see if they qualify for the position. There is no advancement. In order to advance a person has to get fired, leave the company or move to a different department."
good,"I put 43,000 miles on my vehicle in one year trying to make this job work. I went out every day making cold calls. I got stood up regularly for appointments with business owners. The market is extremely saturated for supplemental insurance and Aflac gives you no help with any book of business. I can confidently say I did everything I could to make this job work, but at the end of the day you have to be able to pay the bills."
good,It was ok but it's all commission based so you have to be able to make sales on your own.  If you aren't naturally good at selling to people then don't dot it.
good,If you are under the right management there is lots of room for you to have a flourishing career potential.  Structure and organization is key without this there is no hope.
good,"Working at HQ isn't too bad. It is like every other place. It is what you put into it. There are some great leaders, and there are some that are lacking."
good,"If you are looking for a place to set your own schedule and work on commission, this is the Company.  For the most part you are able to do what you want, at the end of the day there is still someone to report to."
good,"I was thrown to the wolves, and had very littler training. Self taught most of it, and had no room for advancement due to manager. If I had better management it would have been a more positive experience"
good,"If your self motivated and don't mind spending money to build a business then this is the job for you. Cold calling is a requirement so you have to like the phones and people. You don't make money unless you sell to clients and there are no benefits. The good thing is you make your own hours. If you don't have the discipline to stay focused, then this is not the job for you."
good,"The benefits that come with the position are great, but if you don't fit or conform to be the type of employee they want then it will NOT last. I'm a very good worker and a hard worker at that, but it felt like once I didn't FIT in they wanted to get rid of me and others. My training class lost half of it's roster in the first 6 months."
good,"Extremely competitive. Lack of support and training to new associates without previous sales experience. Saw favoritism given. Some areas of town were over saturated with AFLAC agents. I did learn some new things but overall, I feel like I failed."
good,Very much a challenge for new Agents.  No money until you sell. If can take 6 months to a year to build a book of business and most major accounts are already booked.
good,I was a sales intern for the summer of 2016. The Aflac office I worked at had never had any interns before and it seemed like they didn't know what to do with us. We were given very little help in the beginning. I actually went an entire month on the job before I received an formal training. Great opportunity to make lots of money and advance your career but unless you are a sales pro already its not the best place to start a sales career.
good,This position allowed me to communicate with many business executives and learn how to deal with all types of people.  I was able to significantly improve my personal skills and this educated me on how to explain a situation in a variety of ways to get across the same point.
good,"There were too many agents.  Everywhere I went to call on businesses, there had already been agents there.  It required state licensing with CE studying and testing every 2 years."
good,"AFLAC is hands down one of the best and most ethical companies for which to work.  However, where the brand excels the infrastructure of the weekly operations leaves a great deal to be desired especially in the way of training. As a new employee the expectations were not as clearly conveyed as one might hope also, the compensation structure is explained to the new hires in a way which seems to be most confusing and difficult to comprehend with much of the staff espousing differing opinions on any given topic."
good,"They told me before I moved two states that the job was a commission based gig, but that I'd split commissions with my boss for a time while my boss took me on appointments and introduced me to the community. I show up, and they point me to Google and told me to go and find businesses that might want to offer Aflac. Never did go on any appointments with my boss..."
good,Strong desire to succeed essential. The most difficult part is the amount of time you must invest to make it through your first sale.
good,"Typical day of prospecting. do at least 160 calls a day. "
good,"Management are also heavily involved in sales which make them competitive with those they are assigned to lead.  Made two attempts to establish a productive relationship with trainers, both were unsuccessful.  New agents are required to give trainers a percentage of all sales and are more than likely not equipped with the required laptop and software provided by the company at a monthly cost to agents."
good,"Independant work "
good,"AFLAC is a very stable and exciting work environment to be a part of, but the narrow scope of the product line creates a challenge in creating sincere long-term interest in the necessity for the product. The 100% commission environment can be encouraging and troublesome all at the same time. AFLAC fronts a percentage of earned commission and pays 48 hours after the policy is written. The challenge is that if the client decides to cancel their policy during the first year then AFLAC charges back a percentage of the upfront money and debits it against the additional monthly payments allotted. After a little over two years of running my AFLAC business on high octane I opened 68 new AFLAC accounts, currently there are only 30 accounts still on my book of business and as of December 2014 monthly statement I finished at a negative balance of $728 because of lapsed or cancelled policies. Finally, great company, good products, but the opportunity is definitely a test of endurance and the ability to still pay the bills when businesses are not needing AFLAC for their annual enrollment."
good,"Great people, tough job."
good,"This job is strictly commission, which makes it difficult to have a steady stream of money. Other than that it is a Fun Job."
good,Business to business referral and relationship building. 
good,"Starting a week proved challenging as I do not enjoy telemarketing, preferring cold calling as it presented more face to face opportunities. However, telemarketing was necessary to meet key individuals. "
good,This job was very much a learning experience and a chance to grow. It takes a strong minded person to survive in an industry that is mainly commissioned based with a product that people don't really understand.
good,Was able to enhance customer service and administrative skills and abilities. Learned how to prepare and maintain the district sales manager's schedule and appointments. Prepared conference room for briefings and meetings. Contacted and scheduled appointments for potential outside sales associates.
good,Meet a lot of great people and enjoyed getting involved with the Chamber.
good,The idea of growing a business only sets well with me if I'm growing my own business..
good,I would report to the office in Concord and meet my supervisor there and make a plan for where we were going for the day. Then we would go to that area and cold call on companies to try to get an appointment with a decision maker. Also we would visit companies that were current AFLAC holders and see any policy holders that needed help.
good,"I walked everyday while studying to get my license,so when I was going to sign the bank I worked so hard for,my manager stole it from me instead of waiting to sign them when I got my license, like they were supposed to, then called me daily to come back."
good,"For any 100% sales role, it is important to have other support (money saved, assistance from significant others). Cost is incurred (time, money, resources) in generating income, and consistency is important. Candidates should be advised with full disclosure of opportunity for success or failure."
good,"Amazing commercials, great products, fair customer service. Good opportunity to initiate a career in sales. Lot of cold calling, approaches, presentations, informing and educating customers. Establishing great relationship with new businesses."
good,"It's commissions only so be prepared and it's also a lot more difficult than they make it out to be. "
good,"Lots of meetings, some training, free coffee and good snacks. You must do door-to-door sales, open new accounts and you will get paid. I did not make much because I could not open many accounts. Having sales experience will help! The management is okay but they tend to oversell and micro-manage everything to employee; lots of coaching and motivational stuff. The workplace is very competitive, can have a unhealthy competitive vibe at times. The hardest part of the job is selling but not selling, hitting the numbers required everyday/week/month/quarter, going door-to-door is not always fun. The job is very hard and challenging but I hear it can be very rewarding, just work hard and be consistent with what works. This is not for everyone!!! The leadership works hard at making the job fun, getting everyone involved and wants everyone to be successful and make money."
good,You are thrown on an island and told to survive without anything. Management needs to be more hands on to promote better work environment and improve performance of new recruits.
good,"Salary and benefits are great with flexible work hours. However, the job is highly stressful due to the call volume and unrealistic expectations. The management is poor as well as communication with conflicting information."
good,"The market is flooded with agents and unless you find new businesses starting up, it is difficult to sustain a career.  Lots of turnaround and new agents to the business."
good,They do not provide a pay check. 100% make what you earn. I liked the company as a whole. Issues were with leadership at my level. Could do a better job of working with leadership so they know how to lead.
good,The job is totally commission based and you spend a lot of time prospecting and finding business to present to.  You spend a lot of money on gas and not make a lot of money.
good,"The Companyhas a great product foe indemnity. The problem is tha that the NJ area is saturated with Aflac agents. Every company you call, has been called at least ten times already."
good,Get to choose your own hours. Most of the time you will be like a call person and make hundreds of cold calls a day and go weeks without making clients.
good,Employees all trying to find clients in same areas. Mentors often take leads from new employees and revisit them without any compensation to original point of contact.
good,Productive way to help work on prospecting. The compensation was not great for you spend so much time and personal money prospecting areas the other agents have already prospected.
good,Work is commission based which is a risk within itself because there is a lot of pressure to perform otherwise you will find yourself not getting paid. An absence of base pay means that there is no safety net in case things are slow or you are just in a stretch of bad luck.
good,I was not prepared for it to be strictly sales.  I thought the position would have leads and other opportunities to grow your business.  It is difficult to build your business.
good,"As a Human Resources Intern, I come in dressed business casual with my laptop, find an open desk (which is hard sometimes), and immediately get to work. How long I work depends on how much there is for me to do, but I usually leave before my scheduled time. My job is to basically recruit and screen potential candidates for positions at Aflac and schedule meetings. The hardest part of the job was getting comfortable talking to people on the phone and convincing them to attend a meeting. The most enjoyable part is finally calling someone who is genuinely interested in the job and scheduling them for an interview. The office we work at is a shared office space, so it can be a little crowded at times. Overall, I enjoy coming in to work, but I feel out of place sometimes with all of these professionals around me eyeing me down."
good,"A typical day is going in and out of businesses for approximately 8 hours to attempt to make meetings and sales for benefits."
good,"Not a job for a recent graduate of college or Grad school. Little to know chance for advancement and minimal support after introductory stage."
good,The company has great benefits and good people. They also show how much they value their employees by hosting different events such as Employee Appreciation week.
good,"Great potential, yet it would take over a year to start earning enough to live on. If you were lucky and if you really worked at it for many, many hours, this is not necessarily a negative yet when your on commission, if you'er not being compensated it begins to be  very discouraging & disappointing.  A work day is up to the individual, but of course the more hours you put in the greater your chances for the long term. Basic Life insurance writer, producer, St. of VA licensure, class and test fees paid by individual. "
good,"The work environment is supportive but I recommend having another job while training. It takes a while to get certified to sell the product. If your not certified in their program, you will not be making money. You will also pay office rent and do a lot of driving at times. The staff is supportive but you need to go in with a plan. No sales, no money..."
good,"This was my first commission only job. The product is good. They want you to cold call companies to market to them before you even have product training. For the first few weeks you're with a manager who writes you business but after that you're on your own. The district managers tell you one way of how to sell, the region managers tell you another. Once a newer agent arrives,  your training and development is on the back burner and no longer a priority."
good,"Being 100% commission was very hard to maintain consistent income just starting out. It would have been nice if they had a base salary for the first couple of years rather than going only commission."
good,"It was fun working for Aflac but if you don't become an Agent there is no good future there because of the lack of hours provided, good for starters or students starting."
good,"Aflac is a good Company to work for. In order to make a good living you must work about 10 hours a day. This will include evenings and weekends. Commission pay only so you have to work long days in order to be successful. You are responsible for funding everything yourself including business cards, gas and paperwork. The commissions are strong as long as you sign up enough clients at each establishment. In order to work outside your State you must purchase license for each State. Also you will have to pay for your training hours, exams and License. Aflac is a very ethical company and you must take ethical online classes in order to represent them. Once you sign up clients, you are responsible for claims, payments, paperwork and you are on call for questions and any issues."
good,"My wife couldn't handle it.  It was the greatest job ever when I got a $2,000 check (for about 3 days), then she'd start freaking out I was never going to make any more money and the kids would starve.  I could defend it when money was coming in but as soon as I had a dry spell I had to find an hourly job."
good,Aflac offers a great product that can be so helpful to so many people. Sales is a tough business.  Don't expect anyone to give you anything.  Get everything in writing.  Demand training as they are required to provide such.  You must be a self starter and prepared to talk with a lot of people about touchy subjects - money & insurance
good,"good company/poor manager"
good,"Aflac is as good company, and it offers great products.  The problem is that the clients cancel their insurances at any time, then you are obligated to return the many back to the company."
good,"The job is your typical commission job. They hire a lot of people and basically see who will cut it and who won't. They are more diligent in the hiring process though to try and hire more people that are an actual fit."
good,"In my 30 day notice of termination letter, it stated that in my contract says they can terminate me at any time. And so they did. No reason given. After 5 solid years I gave to the company. I trained 14 people and was a high producing agent."
good,"Freedom to be your own boss, trips, bonuses, renewable income (instead of one time commission), career instead of just a job. FORTUNE 500 and a World's most Ethical Company. "
good,Overall great company and benefits. Good money that came in faithfully. They just need a better leadership and leads program. Cold calling companies is far to much work and companies to get saturated.
good,"Aflac agents are independent and you work your own schedule.  This provides for flexibility in your schedule.  It is a commission only position.  I really enjoyed working with the employees at the companies and helping them find the benefits that fit their life.  My favorite part was when I helped a policy holder with a claim and then hear from them when they received their payment. Knowing that I helped when someone was injured or sick. There are some opportunties for training, but I have been dissapointed in the lack of communitcation between the company and the agents."
good,No comment worth posting at this time. have nothing to share at this time My experience was not what I expected.Under the right circumstances the opportunity could be good for some.
good,Not the best place if you need money right away but still great company. Enjoys family time and also very flexible scheduling. Great for building a long time career.
good,Tough industry to work in.If you are not motivated to sell this will not be the job for you.Small market with lots of agents competing for the same business.
good,"I learn a lot about sales for life products at Aflac. I work on a team to promote and sale Life insurance products to teachers, law enforcement and construction workers..."
good,I have worked for Aflac for almost two years. It has been a fun and exciting time for me. It is difficult to anticipate an income. This can be very stressful.
good,Working for Alfac was a good experience but there was no motivation for a consistent daily routine. It was a great environment with nice people who I enjoyed working with. Management was successful but most of their employees weren't. The area of Pittsburgh is so saturated that it was not easy convincing companies to buy Alfac products.
good,I enjoyed working here right out of college.  It gave me a great place to learn about the corporate life.  As someone who wanted to move up in the company it was a poor time to be there.
good,"In order to make in Aflac you know a lot of people for sample your new best friends should be "
good,"Aflac has a great family culture and if you work hard you will advance quickly. The culture is fact pace and there are frequent changes which makes it hard to adjust. Aflac grew faster than they could keep up as a company so most of the time you will feel like your running in a high speed maze. Leadership is very supportive but inexperienced. "
good,"This is not an easy job. A lot of prospecting, sales calls, and business to business sales. It includes all the tasks of a regular sales job with the perks of making connections with local business in the community. You get all the training you need and if you're lucky you will get a good manager. Family like environment at work so there is always someone to motivate you. Must have thick skin."
good,This company requires you to do a lot of cold calling trying to drum up business as well as  door to door whatever you can do to drum up business. I learned about insurance and how it works.  I have no comments about the management. The co workers I worked with are awesome. We became our own support system. The hardest part was being told while out of state that they will not be paying you do to a mistake on their end.
good,"The work was OK, the problem with the job it was a Commission based salary. the office was fine the people was nice, but the product was difficult to sell."
good,"Working at Aflac is complete based on commission, which requires a high level of aptitude in sales and the ability to manage mutliple business accounts. If you are busy, ambitious individual the job maybe ideal for you."
good,Aflac is a good company to work for. I am seeking a job out of state to be with my family in Boston. If you like to travel and meet new people this is the job for you.
good,I learned a lot about the insurance business and sales but came away from the experience convinced that it wasn't for me.
good,"I've been a full-time Aflac associate for over 12 years.  This is a hard-core sales job, but Aflac is an amazing company that pays it claims in a very short period of time (IF you know how to file a claim properly.)  "
good,"I was hired under faulse pretenses. I was told that there would be tons of training, there was one hour of it each friday. I was told when hired that I would be working with customers when in all reality I was a telamarketer. They recomended that I call 1,000 numbers a week and offer their benifets to employers. In this economy it is near imposable to succeded with no sales experience. I worked 50+ hours a week for 8 months and never made a single dime. It's 100% commission. I still think that the benifits that Aflacs offers are great but selling them is like pulling teath. If you decide to try your hand as an Aflac agent, GOOD LUCK!"
good,"Aflac people are very cooperative and work hard to make sure you succeed. Monday meetings are always positive and there are very nice contest incentives. "
good,Set appointments and promote Aflac policies. Did not like their management because they knew I had a trainer that did not know her job well.
good,"Come in and check up on leads and do some administrative work, then go out and try to sell.  Management is very encouraging and friendly.  Hardest part of the job is selling."
good,"I enjoyed selling the Aflac products and getting to meet a lot of great people, but I needed a more stable income to support my daughter."
good,"If you're in a decent sized market you can probably make a good living. This is mainly outside sales, driving around and cold calling. It's very tough unless you have a good network of people to call on in the beginning."
good,Worked with Credit Unions nationally that wanted to increase membership and increase revenue. Also selected and trained local (to the credit union) Aflac agents for the postion of marketing agent for the credit union. Immediate management was highly motivated and supportive. Upper/senior management had no clue about our operation and how it functioned. Most enjoyable part of job was working with the clients (credit unions) and the Aflac field management and agents. Hardest part was dealing with Aflac HQ issues and individuals.
good,"A typical day was very demanding to go out and prospect future accounts because it was 100% commission based. I learned that business owners don't always have time for insurance salesmen but given a few minutes to talk to him or her and relate to their interests, they will feel more comfortable sitting down with you and doing business with you."
good,"Success in this job is closely tied to the economy and consumers' disposable income. In the current economy, it is very difficult to make it financially feasible. People just don't have the money for much, if any, insurance."
good,"you have to make phone calls to get in contact with potential customers and sometimes you go out and make contact with potential customers. I realized that you have to be very organized to do an efficient job that is the key to success in a business like this. You are an independant agent it's not an office atmosphere everyone comes and go we gather for meetings only. The hardest part of this type of job is it's commission only, i wish it would have been a paying job for at least your first year. The most enjoyable part of the job is you don't punch a clock your time is yours."
good,The great thing about this job is you meet a lot of great people that you probably would not in your regular everyday life. The downfall of this job is once you run out of your warm leads the company does nothing in the sense of getting you leads to help.
good,"It was like having my own business, I liked flexibility&  opportunity to make money. I was responsible for my earned income by selling the products & supporting my clients"
good,Great place to work Company take very good care of employees and customers They are there for both employees and customers when you need them This company allows for bonuses
good,"cold calling is main source of development for your business, they give you tools you need but don't exactly say how to use them. Good benefits and pay if you can figure out how to get business"
good,"Great if you're great at networking, or have a network of people who want to sign up. Unfortunately, there are so many Aflac reps out there, with more experience than you. Most of the successful people have a spouse that can support through benefits, and a solid wage."
good,"Great if you're great at networking, or have a network of people who want to sign up. Unfortunately, there are so many Aflac reps out there, with more experience than you. Most of the successful people have a spouse that can support through benefits, and a solid wage."
good,As a person that worked in the insurance industry for nine years I do not recommend anyone getting involved at this time as the field is bloated with agents making no money due to overall saturation
good,Nice people with great corporate materials and home office support. However compensation largely dependent upon cold calling and management favoritism.
good,If you plan to work here you must have a years worth of salary saved up or have another job to keep an income.  The products and training are amazing it is just hard to get started.  You must stay active 40 hours plus to make it.  If I had a lot of money saved up or a part time job I would have stayed.  But I ended up going broke.
good,"Walking into businesses, speaking to the decision maker, setting appointments and enrolling in group benefits. You HAVE to be self motivated to succeed."
good,I feel.like aflac maybe wasn't  for me it was not my area of expertise I felt a little over worked and not enough pay. I also felt like there was mo chance  for me to move up.
good,"Fine, the products are good, if you are comfortable with called calling great job for you.  Tier pay structure percentage.  Commission only if you can handle that aspect. Expect high and lows with pay."
good,"I learned you have to be there at least 5 yrs to make a living"
good,"I know that this would be an incredible career for some people. I am not that person. As a 100% commission-paying role, the stress of ""how am I going to eat this month"" is real. I was repeatedly told that I'm doing great work and am a natural, but my bank account certainly didn't reflect that. Everyone I worked with was great, but it just isn't for me."
good,"I love working for this company, it's like a family atmosphere for the most part. I can truly say this is a good company to work for. You can grow with this company."
good,"If you are in need of a regular paycheck, where you know  you will get a paycheck, then this is not the job for you.  you are required to travel every day day visiting businesses to make sales."
good,"If you're lucky, you can make good money on cold calls and selling to businesses. It isnt as easy as they make it sound, and you have to really believe in the Aflac products to really sell them. Not for everyone."
good,Not a job/ position I would recommend. Low employee maintenance. Difficult training. Non responsive employers. I would not recommend this position / job title.
good,"Aflac has extensive on and off the job training, and I learned a lot about different sales strategies as well as how to acquire and conduct meeting with potential clients.  A typical day at work is driving usually at least an hour somewhere to cities or areas to prospect small to medium sized businesses in hopes of setting meetings with them to show them the value of Aflac.  Closing these deals and being able to sell the products to employees of these companies was extremely rewarding, however be prepared for long hours due to the driving as well as lots of people telling you no or even saying yes and then dodging you and wasting your time by putting you off for weeks or even months.  Hitting your bonuses that the company offers can also be extremely stressful as they are needed for sustainable income, especially early on, but again very rewarding when you hit them."
good,I really enjoyed learning that I could do public speaking and learned I enjoyed it.  I felt I was helping people with things they needed and a reasonable cost.
good,I can see that this could be a lucrative job if you are able to live on very little for the first year.  The issue is that you won't be getting paid much at all until year two.  You have to put in a lot of work prospecting to get rewarded.  This job is  not for everyone.
good,I loved the whole concept of offering supplemental insurance to everyone.  I learned a lot about various businesses and how they are ran internally.  The culture of the company is very free.  The hardest part of this job was getting a reliable and honest mentor for my initial training.  The most enjoyable part of this position was the salary potential.
good,If it sounds too too to be true it is. Take it form one of the many that have learned that lesson all too well. Nothing is ever that easy or you would ah e considered such a position before now. Remember only 9 out of 10 in then first year stay. Do your research first.
good,The job is 100 percent travel and has flexible working hours and is commission based.  You must be self  motivated in order to make it in the business very high turnover rate.
good,"I really enjoyed working with Aflac.  Of course, after the certification of Accidental, health, and life insurance qualifications, I really got into the culture of working for them.  It's relatively easy but it's brutal going door to door for customers."
good,The benefits they offer for the public and employees are great. They really help people out financially when situations/illness occur in their lives but there is definitely a training deficit that needs to be tackled.
good,"My disappointment with Aflac is that there are 80,000 agents and the company will not rest until there are 800,000 agents.  Everywhere you go you are second or third Aflac Agent to be there that day."
good,needed to goto as many small business as you could during the day to try to schedule appointments to come back and show the product. Took many hours of foot work for little compensation
good,Working as a contract agent can be rewarding with Aflac. Realize that you will be doing cold calling. If you are attractive it helps to get into the decision makers.
good,"selling Aflac is a though market.  It involves a lot of traveling and ""what ifs"" I had fun working for Aflac, but getting paid commissions only is tough living."
good,"While appointed by Aflac, I was assigned to work out of an office located on Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood. The parking for the office is street parking only requiring several block's of walking, at times inconvenient. There is a monthly calendar of companies, leads, authorizing Aflac to offer assurance/insurance product's. Weekly meetings to be held at the main office, down town on Olympic, and parking is again inconvenient. People are respectful and pleasant."
good,One must have money already to pay for gas to ride daily on cold calls without a promise of income. Must have a computer to work effectively. Never rely on others
good,"AFLAC was fast paced and often cut throat. Even though they promised in the beginning they wouldn't go after friends and family, they did.  AFLAC is a great company and does a great deal for children with cancer and my wife and I still have to cancer policies."
good,Lots of cold calls and rejection. Some help from the Management. I was commission only so I had to hustle. The only way to really make any money is to get into management.
good,"There is a lot of cold calling, and it is a hard position. One must have the responsibility to get up and go every day. You come up with almost all of your own leads."
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers, working with different departments.  Enjoyed the nature of my job and enjoyed working for this company.  Lots of variety and diversity."
good,"A productive workplace and it was a busy company. Whether you are celebrating a personal accomplishment or facing unexpected medical expenses, you can count on Aflac and the Aflac Duck to be by your side."
good,Had fun while it last. But my team work was terrible.  My manager was races. And uncomfortable to work with. Ifshe won't have been there maybe I would have stayed.
good,A typical day here is burning your own gas riding around Louisiana praying and hoping someone opens an account with. If you don't open any accounts you don't get paid basically.
good,If you hustle you can do well. You are your own boss. You must be self motivated. It is expensive doing door to door sales. Coldl calling over the phone is hard. Most people don't like insurance agents!
good,good internship for a summer job. they let you do what you want because they dont pay you. you are youre own manager and its up to you to set up meetings if you want to get paid
good,"It was very competitive and the income wasn't consistent enough to pay my bills. However, I stayed with it as long as possible, because I enjoyed the freedom it provided, and when I did get paid it was a big pay day."
good,"My time in Sales in Aflac was characterized by strong pressures to contact as many businesses as possible. Individual performances were evaluated weekly within a group context, and compensation was commission-only. That being said, the experience pushed me to step further out of my comfort zone by allowing me to interact with a wide variety of individuals in an attempt to sell them insurance."
good,For me it was really a bad time to get in this field During the recession. Think if the recession was not around would have been a much better opportunity.
good,"Typical day would be to tour different businesses and try to sell Aflac's products. "
good,To work for Aflac you have to be extremely disciplined and be ready to get up and work your tail off everyday. Can be extremely rewarding for those who have a huge warm lead market.
good,lot of traveling working alone day to day not a bad company at all the support was good but the amount of travel is pretty high the pay is not bad for the work
good,"This job is full commission and it is very hard to make it, very high turnover in the office I work in because it is so hard to make consistent income. A lot of travel and time for very little pay for at least the first 1-2 years"
good,Aflac is a great company.  Selling is done from your own home and not an office.  It is commission selling and would be great for a young single man just starting with no other responsibilities. Since I had a family to support I could not afford to stay long enough to build the business.
good,I was not able to make it at AFLAC because it is too sales base.  The only people who are successful are those who are good at making appointments or work with someone who is.
good,"AFLAC is a good career for someone who only wants to sell insurance.  I am more interested in servicing clients.  Also, it has been many years since I have worked at AFLAC so I could not speak to how if functions now."
good,"If you like the freedom of working for yourself and setting your own hours and schedule, this would be the ideal place for you. It's competitive yet stressless"
good,"Great place to work for, however high sales required in order to make good commission. Training is awesome and informative. Your direct manager will expect you to do lots of cold calling and canvassing"
good,"Enjoyed learning and building a book of business. No health benefits, but good compensation package.  Training was awesome and I had fun while I was there."
good,This was a temporary job to get me back on my feet. It did that and allowed me to network while selling and identify my next career opportunity. Must be motivated to sell if you want to be successful.
good,If youre not a very bubbly person its hard to do well in this job. Everything falls on your shoulders to build and maintain a book of business. a lot of hard work but can be rewarding
good,Aflac had very good products and was a wonderful company to work for. I was able to learn what was needed for the job. The management was driven so were we.
good,"Aflac is a good company to work for - when you first start you will get a lot of support."
good,"Its an OK for a temporary position, best place to start at in This Given Industry.  Good platform to continue on as a Broker or CFP.  Just understand the orientation is all a push, to get you to work harder.  Its like any other 1099 or Sales job it all depends on you and your own goals to make it work."
good,fast paced and fun place to work. I was able to use all of my skills and increase accuracy and efficiency in my work.  I loved my co workers and managment
good,"If you're a natural sales person this is the job for you, but if you're not then this is going to be a difficult job. This is a commission pay job. So if you can handle going a couple of weeks without making money before your first commission check comes in, go for it. If not then do yourself a favor and avoid this line of work."
good,"A new recruit is required to make 300 phone calls a day to small business owners, follow up with companies where presentations have already been made and attend sales training sessions."
good,no benefits what so ever were offered and you did not make any money unless you sold policies.  Over all if you are good in sales you can make a decent living but it was not what I wanted to do the rest of my life.
good,"This was a temporary job for me; I had no real intention of remaining.  its not a bad job, but like all insurance companies, your returns will come in once you have laid the groundwork.  Get well acquainted with cold-calling; regardless of what you are told.  Good job, but if you're looking to make money with limited push, keep looking."
good,The work is all commission based so no steady pay check but the pay is good when you get a check. lots of interaction with the public. Friendly coworkers.
good,"My experience with Aflac was not as great as I expected. It is a good opportunity for marketing personals rather than finance people. Overall , the manager was great and enthusiastic , but the marketing job does not fit me."
good,Working as an Independent Rep taught me just how difficult it can be for a lot of insurance reps. You do have access to a few reps to go through their products and training but for the most part you are on your own for the duration of your career.
good,Would not recommend if you need a steady paycheck. A lot of hours worked with really nothing to show for it. Not a place for a beginning sales job. Just not suited for me.
good,Working here was a challenge because i had to convince people to join the company or convinced them to join the membership. The hardest part was bringing new applicants to join because many knew about the company and didn't want to join.
good,This job is a job you will definitely struggle at in the beginning. It takes years to build up business in be successful in this position. If you are wanting to make decent money right away then this job is definitely not for you. If you stress and worry a lot then this job is not for you. This job however is has flexibility. If you want to spend time with your family more and work from home this is a job where you can do that. If you are a go getter and have energy then you would probably succeed. The main downfall for me is how no benefits are offered to you the employee. This job is just what you make it.
good,Good company with a lot of opportunity for growth.  I learned  a lot about the entire sales call process from prospecting to closing a sale.  Developed great communication skills working at this company.
good,Services are fabtastic but cery saturated market. High turnover. Takes a good 5 years to accumulate enough residual income to start paying off. Limited support in the field.
good,Hard to get started. Loads of support from management to get you going.  The market is highly saturated and the insurance salesman get a very bad rap.
good,Their products speak for themselves. The concept of selling their products are spot on. But training was a bit lack luster. It is a highly competitive position so it takes a highly motivated individual to stay in the game
good,"As far as insurance companies go, Aflac is a decent one to work for.  They still care about people but seem to be starting the lean toward only caring about numbers.  In this, they now aren't as great about resolving claims as they once were."
good,"Working for Aflac in the field is an independent position unless you work at the HQ in Columbus, GA. You write your own paycheck based on how hard you work. There are no benefits offered to the field force. You are an independent businessman and must provide your own benefits."
good,"I like the products AFLAC offers to customers and the prices are affordable, I like the idea of having a company pay and individual when he or she is in the hospital to cover bills such as the lights and buy food."
good,"the products are great. the people are great. Issues can come up because it is 100 percent commission based and chargebacks and no pays can kill profitability. Management tells you you own your own business but has a hand in everything. much more like owning a franchise than owning a business. The career structure makes being in management highly preferable to being an agent. When people quit their accounts go upstream and turnover is very high. There should be much more training. the combination of no training, aggressive sales policies, and high turnover has made the market highly hostile to AFLAC agents making it hard even for the good ones. That all being said if you can make it several years the renewals and options and stock and bonuses and freedom and growth make it worth it. Most people would do better if they do it part time."
good,I did not like it at all. You cant get paid unless you get your certification. If you are a college student like me focusing on college courses do not work here. Plus a str8 sales job. No sales no money.
good,"Good place to work. Your responsible for assisting the district managers in there day to day work. You need to schedule interviews, recruit, and answer any questions that are asked to you."
good,AFLAC has great products that are easy to sell.  Their service and support for the clients are second to none.  The role however is 1099 and can be difficult for some that need to make a steady salary.
good,If your ok with cold calling and door to door buisiness sales then this is the job for you. The training is pretty good.  Co workers were pretty supportive. This job taught me how to speak to strangers and get over feeling uncomfortable
good,I started working for Aflac because I really believed in the products.  It was very hard to get appointments though because in my opinion there was a saturation of agents in the market place
good,"This is not a job for everyone. First off its commission only, which can be difficult if you are the main breadwinner, etc. The worst part about the job was not knowing if you'd get the sale and being on your feet all day. The best part was making a big sale and knowing you were helping others AND getting paid for it!"
good,"You have to put the time and effort into any sales position.  I enjoyed working at AFLAC.  It was my 1st sales position and I learned a lot.  In order to be successful, you have to put the TIME and effort in."
good,"There is no backup or cushion if you have a bad month because it is commission/rewards only, and you need to plan on not making anything for the first 3 months while you train and build up your client base.  That is the major downside."
good,It is a great place to work if you're really great at sales and can afford to live on a salary derived entirely from commission.  It would have been better if there had been some base salary.
good,"I am always up for a challenge.  I have found that in Insurance. The simple fact that there is always something new to learn everyday is what keeps my interest.  I would like to create a career being an Insurance Agent.  I have over 9 years in customer service.  Helping people gives my life meaning. I chose Insurance because my job is to protect people from experiencing financial catastrophe. To me, that is ""giving back""."
good,Difficult business based on individual building a business for themselves. No typical day as travel and interacting with prospective clients is just as common as office hours.
good,Working here was tolerable. I noticed however that despite management offering high wages that most people drove dilapidated vehicle and were constantly scrounging for money.
good,Times have definitely changed. The culture has changed. Advancement is good if your in a management role. Expect to micromanaged.
good,Was a good project to start learning about newer object-oriented source systems. Different kind of data issues to solve.
good,"No training available."
good,"A typical day at work involved working with individuals, children and their families to ensure appropriate services.  I learned to be flexible, work hard and ensure appropriate services for individual needs."
good,"You will only make money here if you are an agent full time. Otherwise, assistants and etc do not make money. But they are all nice people, but keep looking trust me"
good,This is a productive workplace environment which has a great training school opportunity. This is a very flexible career to be in; it allows you so work the hours that best suit you.
good,Aflac is a national company so it can provide endless advancement possibilities. There are several incentives and a team workplace culture.
good,"Working for AFLAC depends on your home life to a huge extent.  If you have children and want to be home by 5 cooking dinner, that's not going to happen and have you being successful too.  It take a lot of self discipline to keep going door to door to get the new leads, however maintaining established accounts is much easier."
good,"Lots of incentives and bonuses. Reaching those all depends on your ability to close accounts. If you don't have outside sales experience, your success is largely dependent on the District Sales Coordinator who trains you. (Could be the case fore those with experience in the field, too) An incompetent DSC= total failure unless you request to change districts. Don't be afraid to do so! I struggled for months until I was assigned to a different team-- I wish I would have been more communicative of how useless my first DSC was. "
good,This would have lasted forever if the company wasn't so saturated with so many agents. Not enough people training the job.
good,"Do not get caught up in the glamour of being a benefits consultant/advisor for Aflac. Yes, there is unlimited earning potential because it is a commission sales job, but there are disadvantages to this. If you are not the sales person type or a strong entrepreneurial go-getter, then take this job with caution. I advise having a part-time job as you do this because you are hardly getting paid for your hard work and efforts. It will take a long time before you see any commission coming your way, but when you do see it, it will be worth it to see your hard work being paid off."
good,This is not an easy job but I have learned a lot working here. It is all commissioned based so their is no base pay to lean on. If you are looking at this job be aware that very few people can be good at this. If you are one of those few you can make a lot of money.
good,Overall the company is good and the training is good. It was my direct hierarchy that did not train and help me the way I needed to be helped. I need something more stable.
good,I enjoyed answering phone calls and helping all the customers with their needs. It was a great place to grow and level up in many aspects. Plus I met all kinds of people.
good,"Aflac is a great company, however a salary based on commission is not for everyone.  Not everyone is cut out for it.  Co-workers and management is very nice and there is support."
good,The days could be long or short depending on my motivation. It was nice to meet new potential customers. I learned that I don't like working for commission only. I don't have anything to say about the management since I was only there a short time. My co-workers seemed nice. I only got to see them once a week. The hardest part of the job for me was approaching people trying to sell them a product and yet the most enjoyable part was also meeting the people.
good,The freedom that you have is amazing. Being an agent gives you the flexibility to schedule appointments around your time.
good,"Work for yourself and by yourself most of the time. "
good,I have had the pleasure of working with some awesome people.  I have learned a lot about personal relationships with clients.
good,great people in the office. some nicer than others. leadership asks a lot & doesn't always give appropriate help. main trainer in the area is awesome.
good,lots of room for earning potential. flexible work schedules. great athmoshphere and opportunities for career advancement
good,Good starter company for new Insurance Agents.  Good instruction on a weekly basis from the District Service Coordinator.  Fast Paced.
good,"A typical day at work involved me coming in, starting my computer, logging on, and taking calls until I logged out at the end of the day.  I learned how to mutlitask.  Management and the company were intensely employee-focused when I began there, but that changed over time. They were more interested in meeting numbers than in making sure the customer experience was the best, although they spoke at length about making sure the customer was taken care of. That was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was in making sure the customer was served and happy."
good,a typical day consist of prospecting for new accounts cold calling businesses following up on leads. i have learn to be persistent to persevere. co-workers were very friendly and helpful. the hardest part was cold calling. the most enjoyable part of the job meeting new people at different businesses.
good,You are there to help people plan and execute the perfect party.  You blow up 100's of balloons on any different occasions.
good,"The individuals I worked with were great, they were knowledgeable and took great pride in their duties and responsibilities."
good,"I am a CSC II and I hate it. Its very unorganized which cause my job hard."
good,Many late nights working on client needs and doing market research.  Spent many additional hours driving and preparing paperwork without compensation.
good,Commission based and time consuming. Great if you have to build your business. Office moved after I got hired and was forced to relocate.
good,"competitive"
good,"I enjoyed working for Aflac because I have a passion for Clerical duties, I wish the company was busy enough otherwise I would be employed through Aflac till this day."
good,I found that the local market was either saturated or that some could not afford supplementary insurance. I had a little luck but could not make a career selling insurance.
good,"A typical day consists of a lot of driving, talking, and rejection.  It's all about the numbers - especially to those above you."
good,"Health and Accident precertification"
good,A typical day at work was calling a co-worker in the morning to set up a time and place to go cold calling. We would spend the day walking from business business. Most of the reactions from the businesses was negative. I found it difficult to do sales that way. I found all of the other sales representatives helpful and easy to work with.
good,A good company to represent but too many sales reps in field. This makes it difficult to gain the needed attention of prospects when they get called upon by so many individual sales reps.
good,"The Sales school was exceptional and the office was very professional and organized.  I learned that I would be creating my own business and Aflac would allow me to sell their product on commission.  Continuing education was taught weekly.  Professional tools (give-a-ways, leads, marketing materials) and leads were available for sale.  Rent was paid to use office supplies and machines.  I was expected to meet weekly goals and participate in telemarketing and cold calls at the office weekly."
good,"Perform corporate drops to businesses based on location and employee count to schedule appointments with the person that handles employee benefits. Cold Call in volume to schedule appointments. Teach businesses about why Aflac can help them and their employees. The main problem with the methods are that most businesses have a preconceived idea about sales over the phone and think you are soliciting when you walk through their offices to directly introduce yourself. There are many hurdles to jump over and expenses for driving, obtaining the necessary courses to obtain your state license and additional costs for business cards, laptop, proper attire, etc."
good,100% commission is overrated with promises of high lifestyle living and prizes only for the top selling who have been with the company a long time. They only want you to sell by using scripts.
good,It is commission only so have some money saved to cover your expenses.  My District Sales Coordinator was awesome and my whole team was very helpful.  I was not committed to the amount of hours and did not have adequate savings for expenses so it didn't work out for me.
good,you get to help people with life changing things everyday and it feels good. you get a chance to change someones life. This company has a lot to offer a bright and shining person willing to help people achive financial security.
good,Moved into selling the products with a lot of pride.  The manager of the office was a very likable man and he easily convinced me that Aflac was the place to be.  I was able to win a $1200 prize for opening 5 new accounts within 90 days as a new agent.  I was the top new account producer that quarter for our Dallas Regional Office.
good,Good training. But too many meetings and emails are sent by management. Which boggs down your email correspondence with clients.
good,Life insurance sales is a hard business due to the fact that people don't have the extra for more expenses that they don't think they will use.
good,"	Assisted with recruitment of volunteers"
good,"Processing claims, whether paying or denying claims.  Sometimes pend claims if there is need for additional information.  Great co-workers.  Hardest part of my job is a lot of stress.  Enjoyable part of the job is being able to help policyholders/"
good,Wake up making cold calls and trying to make sales the company as a whole was great the office I was hired at wasn't all that great which led to me leaving the company itself during a transfer that was suppose to go through but did not
good,Its fun to work with the coworkers. the hardest thing working for this organization is compensation. It was a commission based career.
good,"A typical day at here started with a cup of coffee, checking emails,"
good,"As an agent, you will spend most of your time looking for leads, knocking on doors and seeking new business relationships.  It is a very difficult position to do if you do not have a lot of business contacts."
good,This job consisted of going to different business to sell them aflac insurance to them and there employees.  I was considered my own boss. I had the regional associate to help with difficult accounts and they were nice and helpful when needed.  The hardest part of the job was the close.  It was really difficult to get the employer to listen to the proposal then accept the insurance for there employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and going to different places every day.
good,have only been with company for 5 weeks. its a sales position
good,Must pace your income. Be able to be available at all times for your clients.
good,"I didn't agree with the way the company broke out their compensation. In addition, I had deeper aspirations in trying to find another analyst position."
good,"AFLAC is a very good company, I have no complaints. Aflac is the type of job were it is what you make it."
good,"OK place to work, need a steady income.  Enjoyed helping to get individuals and their families protected."
good,company that does not live up to what it promises to new agents
good,If you are a good salesman this is a good position.  If you are not a good salesman this is not a good postition as it is 100% commission.
good,"My job was to communicate information to customers and company personnel regarding personal policies as well as account level issues. I personally made it my responsibility to provide accurate responses to customer requests/inquiries via internet or telephone."
good,"Job was independent with freedom to work in local area which was great. However, the job was based on commission only pay which made making a living difficult and not for everyone."
good,"The job offers little advancement opportunities, and you take non-stop phone calls. Good job security and benefits, but very low raises."
good,this job was new to me as i have never did sales before. My district manager didn't help me out that much so i was doing everything by my self.
good,"Great product to be affiliated with however, the management forgets about the little guys."
good,"A typical day included making cold calls for the entire day, by either driving to random businesses or calling on numbers from phone book. "
good,Cold call on businesses to create a desire to offer employees supplemental insurance products.This position was an Independent Contractor position therefore you set your own hours and worked when you wanted. No supervision was the most enjoyable part of the job but was also the hardest part of the position. Cold calling can be challenging and when you were having a rough day there was no management to keep you motivated.
good,The position was nothing exciting. However; the job does allow some flexibility.
good,Could be a great company to work for if you work for a good district sales coordinator that wasn't out to only get accounts for herself. Does not train agents appropriately
good,"Weekly Training and motivational meetings"
good,Long Hrs and management is iffy if you get great leadership make the job better.  Don't believe all their numbers on income potential.
good,"I was responsible for maintaining my own schedule and sticking to it. I would only see other people on our ""team"" about once a week, so I also had to be self motivated."
good,"Overall, It's a great company to work for, have room for advancement"
good,Make sales calls trying to set appointments with business owners.  Hardest part of the job calling on places that already have spoken with Aflac agents of the past and transforming their opinions and opportunities for risk management.
good,Typical day at work is repetitive. I have learned detailed experiences per resume. Managment makes sure the job is done but need more push towards advancement. Coworkers are nice. Hardest part of job is not being able to switch up daily. Most enjoyable part is when we are allowed free time: luncheons etc
good,"Great place to work, independent contractor.  Need to be extremely driven."
good,"The company is excellent and management is pretty good, however they do not pay for agents to be licensed (comes out of your own pocket and who can afford this on their own??) which is expensive, and they do not pay you for training. This means your gas, licensing, and time are all uncompensated for. For those who are counting pennies like me, this all just added up to be too costly. The training was scattered as my trainer was an agent still trying to make a living and doing his normal daily routine. "
good,"Commission only. Dwindling market, needed to travel too far to makle money."
good,"A lot of training, they over sell the job when you are at the interview. Pure commissions If you don't know any inffluential people or buisness owners you will just be running in circles."
good,"At Aflac New York, you are your own business owner. You generate your own clients through cold calls and corporate drops. Management will help you in the beginning and then let you go on from there."
good,"I loved the job, I just did not have the support from the DSC.  She tried to take a big account from me.  This is not what I believe Aflac stands for."
good,They are not as concerned about the retention of renewal business. 
good,"great work environment"
good,"The company itself has great values and really helps people. My direct manager was not a great leader so my experience was not great, however in different circumstances I would have loved the job and the company. I did learn a lot about myself and I was pushed outside my comfort zone more often than not which forced my weaknesses to continually grow stronger."
good,Nobody said sales were easy. This is especially true for insurance sales. You are expected to make your own leads and cold call all day long. The plus side is that Aflac does provide a great product that can greatly benefit policy holders and business owners.
good,"Not enough support for new employees, management is not very helpful unless their is a huge financial benefit for them"
good,"Some people might strive in this environment, but it was not for me. A person has to believe in what they are selling to sell it. Poor guidance at regional office."
good,Talk about better ways to market to prospective clients.
good,"A typical workday consists of new prospecting, conducting employer presentations, and follow up on new and warm leads."
good,Responsibilities include making outbound calls to set up appointments or sell them different benefit packages.
good,I learned to speak to employers about their benefit package and how Aflac would be able to enhance it.
good,You can make as much as you want and work as much as you want. You can work alone or with a partner and split commission which is what I recommend. The pay is 100% commission.
good,Increased companies’ benefits by implementing AFLAC while on a straight commission basis
good,Cold/Warm calling
good,This is a very hard job to make a constant and continuous living due to being 100% commission.
good,"Good entry level employer, management is great but the hardest part of the job is no adequate training structure."
good,"Excellent setup, career focused, Fantastic training set up and career builder"
good,Awesome company until you have to oppose them. THey are very much unethical in dealing with former employees.
good,I worked there for 5 years and they had 100% turn over with their sales team. No territories so its like the wild wild west and people will step on each others feet to close a deal.
good,This job is strictly on commissions and you do not get paid unless you sale something.  It doesn't matter  how much training you do if you don't sale or bring in business you do not make money.
good,"Stress is different for everyone. However, from what I understood there was an ambulance outside of Aflac about once everyday. Anxiety is very common there. I found myself crying everyday and afraid to be on the phone. I had to take pills for the first time. It was a very rough job for me. "
good,"Working with Aflac can be tedious, but also very schedule friendly and fun if you are good at your job.  The amount of business in your area determines the level of success, so it can be rewarding or harmful to your commission."
good,Great option if you have another income or are just out of college but to get your foot in the door and make sustainable salary you have to hustle hard for a few years before you see success
good,"Aflac is a great job IF you are self-motivated and have a drive for money! If you are not the above type of person, get another job. Supervisors in Visalia area are amazing people!"
good,"All the agents I work with agree, there is no training here. The job for new people is to get valid appointments for seasoned agents at the cost of 30% - 50% of YOUR commission. They tout training but even the official trainer says nothing of value is on the website for learning. There is atrong incentive to keep new agents ignorant - their bossed get more $ if you can't close a deal without them."
good,Tough job to make a living at. Only the top ten percent make livable the money in sales. To many working parts when trying to set up a new group with a business.
good,"Although in a competitive sales environment, everyone works well together for the most part and is really helpful. The management and the culture is what makes you want to stay."
good,Aflac was a fun place to work but you are commission based. You create your own work schedule. You can either work as a team or by yourself. There are a lot of opportunities to advance.
good,"I did not like working here at all.  Supplementary health insurance is just not a field that interests me.  I was appreciative of the opportunity, but it just wasn't for me."
good,"Aflac is great, i believe in the products offered and i like the company.  HOWEVER, it is a 100% commission-based pay structure.  You don't sell you don't eat.  i don' know how people do this for a living."
good,"If you're looking for self-driven independent work, this is the place for you. Weekly team meetings provided a recap of the prior week and recognition of team and individual success. They also give an overview of upcoming events and goals for the week. The hours you work are completely up to you, but the more you work the more opportunity you have to make money!"
good,"Working at Aflac is ok at first, but your career will become at a stand still if you don't know the right people. I will say that the company overall does more for their employees than any other company I have worked for."
good,"A typical day at work is good because of the people, environment, and the overall employee culture was great! In 2016, Aflac had a layoff that put many people, including myself, in bad situations. A month later they hired me back after giving me an option in a small amount of time for a small selection of jobs that I wouldn't have applied for if I was not under the pressure having income to pay bills. I was hired in a fast-paced production department, made it through a very difficult, unorganized, training that would have me working under a supervisor and lead that would not be on site. This made working even more difficult not having leadership available when needed."
good,AFLAC is selling supplemental Insurance. very difficult if you have regular insurance. It cold calling all day . You develop your leads by cold calling by telephone. Then follow up if their is a interest. For every 100 phone calls you might get 5 people who might an interest.
good,Looking to work with my passion of Football. Aflac is great product especaily our Cancer Plan. I have flexible hours but no health benefits are offered.
good,The workplace was fun to work. The supervisor I had was not very good at her job.  They had employee week there and that was fun.  Everyday was busy there.
good,You must generate leads inside your area and outside your area.  The market is that saturated.  You can see it in a prospect's eyes - you must be the 15 AFLAC agent I've seen.
good,Good if you are a go getter and big picture person.  the first 3 years you are starving trying to get big jobs.  Once you have them money is good.  Have to be in it for years to get pay.
good,"Fun and challenging, prospecting, closing deal. Commission. you should have a client / prospecting base set up."
good,You make this career your own by hard work and dedication to your business. Most successful career for me to date. Corporate culture taking over the once Freedom Culture that I loved about it. Now it's too easy for someone to remove you from what you built and give it to someone that is undeserving of it. Becoming socialized by favoritism instead of earning it like it should always be. I loved earning the trips and do miss that especially now with more time to spend with my wife now that my kids are all moved out.
good,"Good culture, lots of positive people but it is strait sales with no base. Be prepared to do a lot of cold calling. You also will be driving your own vehicle all over the planet chasing prospects and trying to develop business."
good,"Set your own schedule, rely on sales to make a living. Work hard, work smart. Supportive managers. All work is on an individual basis."
good,You are your own boss so you have to get your own clients. It is best to start off as part- time because it may take a while before you land your first client.
good,Did not like it at all. I have nothing else to say.... This is silly. I don't want to wright this review.  I am just trying to find another job.  forcing people to do this is silly.
good,"Aflac can be a gateway to a new career with unlimited growth potential. The down side is it will take time; as in you won't really see the fruits of your labor until after a year in. So if you have a sustainable income source for the first year, you will do alright."
good,"Aflac is a great product and wonderful commissions the first 2 years.  But only if you like the cold call numbers game.  If you make enough calls and ignore the no's and hang ups, then you will go on to make appointments and then sales.  BUT it is a tough grind and remember: commission ONLY.  No salaries or reimbursements here."
good,"The review I m providing has a snapshot of having been an Aflac Agent for only 8 months."
good,"Aflac is a great company overall. It has a strong quality product and business structure. With that being said, you will do a lot of cold calling in the beginning unless you know a lot of people. The training is great but you are not compensated for the travel and such. You are building your business in the first year so unless you land a large account, you may not make much. And then if you do not have any support from your team leader, then it is can be difficult for you to get ahead. Management is where the income is."
good,"Sold and educated customers about all AFLAC policies."
good,"My manager was a selfless person and we became family to each other. I learned so much from her regarding insurance and always getting back to people when they call.  When I moved to GA and my customers were transferred to other agents, they called me to inquire about the new agents.  My manager was asked to transfer to another district because she stood up for an agent who was getting railroaded by her boss, that left a negative feeling about the management in Arizona to me."
good,"-I work 8:30-5:30 answering inquiries for customers & providers in regards to claims, policies, eligibility, etc... "
good,"Any sales job provides the opportunity to make limitless amounts of money however, when a client stops paying premiums before a year, you end up owing what you got in commission.  I still owe over $700 because of this fact.  When you don't have much money and you can end up returning what you made, it is a scary situation. The managers provide great training and the people are mostly professional."
good,"Started the day by driving all over the place and stopping at every small businesses that I thought might be interested in my product. I could only offer the product to businesses with three or more employees. That alone was quite the challenge. A lot of small businesses do not have multiple employees. I learned that thorough knowledge of product is very important and doing a presentation for the first time is very hard, but fear will keep you from ever getting through it. Management was busy trying to open new accounts and not very accessible. Everybody was busy trying to make a living, I couldn't blame them because we were all commission only employees. Everything was hard about the job but the most enjoyable was when you would get an account on your own and you got to sign up all of the employees."
good,Ability to make your own work schedule. Never a dull moment of being out in the community meeting friendly business owners.
good,"-busy and drive around a lot"
good,"A lot of freedom, and opportunity to be extremely successful, however the market is oversaturated with licensed agents."
good,"I worked with an honest, quality company selling their products, opening and service accounts, and winning numerous awards."
good,"There is either a call clinic or a training meeting to attend. Most of your day will include setting appointments, cold calling, following up with warm leads and driving to appointments. The main frustration is that most people tend to forget your appointment due to life being ever-changing. That is the nature of the beast, though. Management helps you as much as they can but most have at least 8 other agents and will not be available sometimes."
good,"You are completely on your own with Aflac. All success or failure is totally up to you. You are an independent agent. I'd recommend adding other policies under other brokers to your offerings such as Life insurance through Genworth, etc."
good,Good atmosphere with plenty of motivation to succeed. Learned a great deal about insurance policy and employee/owner needs for coverage. To much turn over with agents/management to get consistant leadership and information with company policy. I really like to work with positive people with a goal in mind.
good,the only hardest part is you work on production. the pay could be increased for the amount you have to output on a daily basis. Aflac offer alot of great benefits that compensates for the low pay. there is always events to enjoy. overall a great place to work.
good,". A typical day at work would be on the phones all day for the first half of the week. The second half of the week would be metings I set over the phone."
good,The company treats employees good but they have a hard time in getting management that is qulified to do the job.
good,"Admin, Hiring, Customer Service, Management and Sales OH area"
good,"Difficult to get started, but there is a lot of support. High earning potential for a motivated, adept salespeople. "
good,I enjoyed all the wonderful clients I met while at Aflac. It was certainly a nice experience.
good,A very good & interesting product.
good,Working independently is good for a self-motivated person. Compensation is good but competition for accounts is fierce. Management is good and supplemental employee benefits being sold at a fair price. I have always been on the corporate side buying employee benefits products from vendors. Now I'm on the other side and have seen the other side.
good,Flexible work schedule
good,"A typical day at work includes, making calls, conducting meetings, and working out plans off attack to achieve the best enrollments you can."
good,"I used to make 200-400 outbound sales calls a day and make over 5-10 appointments per week. I loved working there and the people I worked with, especially my boss who I became good friends with. But what it came down to was that nobody wanted to buy anything. A lot of people left at the time I did, even my boss who was with the company for over three years. It is very difficult just working on commission online."
good,"This is another insurance sales position, 100%. You get out, find your accounts, and beat the streets/businesses to write premium in. Depending on where you are applying, management strengths can vary, but they have annually increasing production numbers to meet as well."
good,"This company was a motivating employer that believed in recognizing staff through company sponsored activities like picnics, conventions, and holiday celebrations. There was an atmosphere of productivity and this was expected of all staff. Teamwork was promoted and practiced. The hardest part of the job was working with the family that began the company. Sometimes the family atmosphere was intimidating. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I completed my day at work, I didn't have to worry about it until I came back to it the next day. The work/life balance was promoted and practiced by employees of the company."
good,"AFLAC is a great place to start your career but most people do not make it a whole year. It is very tough to make it, but work-life balance is great. They promote from within and based on your numbers so it is a fair culture. Would work there again if they had benefits."
good,Sound Company and structured hierarchy with commitment to enhanced technology tools; excellent Customer Service and second to none Claims processing and payment system.
good,"Commission only and being completely self driven is difficult. You got the training, then it was done. You could make 50 calls a day and all of them have been in contact with an AFLAC agent in the past two weeks, or you could make 2 calls and land 2 huge sales."
good,"Selling insurance should not be pushed on to people, but something they see benefit in.  I prefer the warm selling vs cold calling which is what Aflac pushed every day of the week."
good,"You get paid based on the work you put in. It’s not easy being successful with this company. It’s 100% commission only with zero benefits. You must have reserve funds in order to get started, you may not get paid for the first 5-6 months in the business, but again, this depends on you."
good,Typical day is to make 100 cold calls to try and book appointment with business owners to share the value of offering Aflac products to their empoyees
good,Working for AFLAC requires being licensed in insurance sales.  The cost to become licensed may be large at first.  Door to door sales with very few leads.  Too many agents to truly be successful unless you get great referrals.
good,"The Job in and of itself was easy, but you needed to be very motivated for what you were doing and be an adequate sales person. The people I worked with were amazing and very helpful. Opportunities to travel and visit ever day - You have to be in your car every day and search out new opportunities all over town."
good,"Great potential upside, but be prepared to put the work in! In order to be successful you have to build your network of accounts. If you Lack accounts it can be very difficult, but the people around you want to see you succeed which is a plus"
good,"Need to have strong self motivation and drive to succeed."
good,I got hired on a commission only rate and was trained or several months. The downside for me was learning in a group setting and working without understanding the needs of the customer which a provider needs to express in cold sales.
good,"In all honesty it could be me, but it was just to slow to get going with the licensing and the introduction and training to start getting paid if you do get anything in the first month working. I’m not overly aggressive when it comes to sales. I poke and ask questions but I’m not in people’s face like “buy my stuff it’s great!” Again it could be me but its  definitely not a job for everyone and have some money saved up before starting this job."
good,"You are selling life insurance and other variable annuities that protect the insured against financial loss and damages in which their major health insurance provider does not cover. "
good,"As a Benefits Consultant with Aflac, I loved being able to help people and I 100% believe in Aflac and their products. The reason I left was because at the time I had no car so it made it very difficult to get around everywhere to be be as productive as I should have been;and with it being only commission based, I couldn't live off it."
good,"Very stressful, output of work expectation is too high for one person to complete within an 8 hour/40 hours work week. Constantly changing management."
good,Typical Day at work revolves mostly around prospecting it can be on the phone or in person. Some time during the day is also committed to assisting current policy holders with filing claims. I've learned a sales system and how to become a trusted adviser. The hardest part of the job is the prospecting. Ninety-Nine percent of what we do is cold calling. I have learned how to market myself and seek referrals as this makes this process much easier. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my policy holder's receive their claims checks and what it means to them and what a help it is to them.
good,"I retired with AFLAC 18 years ago...I would like to now work for another insurance company...."
good,"as an intro sales associate, getting in is hard enough since u cant write any business without an insurance license, and once u do your job is basically a glorified telemarketer. aside from actually meeting with clients the job feels like soul sucking work"
good,"My current position is a lot of fun. I enjoy working with clients and helping them find affordable health benefits. However the lack of help from management at start up is frustrating. There are no leads given and you start completely from blank. I love the people I work with and my district manager, however it is very hard to start from scratch. I wish they would just help a little in leads at start up. The compensation and rewards for meeting sales goals are great .I do like that they try to take care of their employees in that sense. However, the goals and expectation are hard to meet when you are new to the field and are not given anything to begin your search."
good,"Main criticism is the fact that you have no idea what you're doing or what's expected. Not very clairvoyant instructions on the job description or the steps are for the day to day. The main description of this job in one word is Entrepreneur, which means you have to know what you want to do. Only problem is, no one tells you how to do so; as such it's easy to get stuck and confused."
good,Cold calling to small business to open new groups for business.  You can work from home.  You get to work and meet a lot of great people.  It is a fun and you a pair up and work with other agents.
good,This would be a great job for someone who is great with talking to new people and selling them on allowing you to see their employees.  Some people are better than others at this.  The AFLAC products are good and really make a difference in people's lives.  It's not a hard sell as long as you can get the proper enrollment conditions.
good,"Review pending policies to be completed, cross-selling and attention to details. Supportive management group. cooperative co-workers. ignorant clients. Knowledgeable clients"
good,"I started out early. Got dressed up and drove to the area I was prospecting for the day. I went from business to business trying to meet with employers to discuss how we could benefit their business. I set appointments throughout the day and met with business owners when they were available. After meeting with the business owner, if they allowed us, we met with employees. We gave presentations on the products we were offering and gave them time to make a decision. We then came back and signed on individuals that wanted the products. "
good,"B2B SALES, cold calls, appointment setting, commission only"
good,"Great Company, Great People, Very good training.  Commission-based selling requires agents to 'door knock' many businesses, and use referrals and recommendations to grow your business.  Able to help many individuals who don't have proper health care coverage to get supplemental insurance for catastrophic events such as accidents, disabilities, etc."
good,"Aflac is a great company, I have no bad experiences with the company, the staff or the products."
good,Management was really nice but residual started to slow and so did our leads.
good,As a marketing rep you have to grow a tough skin & learn to tolerate the aggressiveness that comes with marketing.
good,"Most boring job, great benefits and great pay. I need a more fast paced job."
good,"Full accountability for developing new business, recruiting sales representatives, and ensuring attainment of targeted sales goals."
good,As an independent sales associate at Aflac you have a lot of independence. The day begins by making phone calls to potential clients to find out what their benefit needs are. I schedule time to meet with business owners and their employers to educate them about Aflac and why they would benefit from our programs. The best part of the job is helping people protect their families. The hardest part of the job is working with an income which is not steady.
good,"-I spend almost all of my time in the field. If I'm not out prospecting, I am making phone calls, sending emails, or attending networking meetings."
good,"Can make unlimited amounts of money"
good,Aflac is great as long as you have a good district manager to properly train you. I unfortunately did not and that is why I chose to leave. But it can be a great company if you know how to work there.
good,You have to Be hands on with people training but it’s easy for them to give up on you when your trying to learn the business. There are a lot of competition in this business and it makes your job really hard
good,"Very nice place to work. Definitely  all about the employee. On site Cafetiere,always doing team building and moral boosting exercises. Everyone is friendly."
good,You must be a hustler willing to grind and be self motivated. That is the only way to make it. The culture is great. Fun events and contests throughout the year and many opportunities.
good,Processed all claims for the Northwest region of  New Mexico and Arizona for approximately 3000 Clients. Obtained medical records from different entities submitted claims and followed up with client on layout for claim
good,This was a commission based job.  The company itself is very good.  It was hard to get a good customer base. The training was good and my manager was very good.
good,if you don't mind getting an unpredictable paycheck and have so much connections then it is the place for you. As a mother it wasn't the place for me.
good,Very friendly atmosphere. I only worked there 2 days a week unpaid for an internship in HR. It was a lot of fun and I was able to learn a lot about the insurance side of a company and what Aflac actually provided to their customers.
good,My job was pretty good in terms of work/life balance. They had the usual work politics but as the Corporate Receptionist I was kinda away from all of that
good,"Go out to businesses to offer AFLAC.  Set up enrollments for business.  Assist policy holders with claims."
good,"The training program is a bit on the lengthier side but it's thorough in preparing trainees for the floor. They have good benefits and provide free supplemental vision, accident, and cancer insurance. The managers are all very knowlegeable and helpful. Very fast-pased and stressful work most if not all of the time, which you might like or dislike. They treat their employees really well (food, competitions, raffle tickets, optional overtime) and it seems to be a rather ethical company, so if that's important to you, it's worth considering."
good,"After working for Aflac for over a year, I would say its a good place to work. It can be stressful at times and demanding but worth it. There are tons of room for growth as well as a number of people to help."
good,"I would spend 90% of my day on the phones and online. "
good,Didnt care for the lack of structure in the workplace.  Leads were garbage as well.  Wonderful people to work with and the work life balance was as good as you wanted it to be.
good,"If you need 3,000 dollars per month every month, this might not be the job for you. But if you're patient, easy to talk to, and can be supported financially by someone other than yourself for the first 6 months to a year, this could be a great opportunity. Those who hold out for a year or two will certainly reap the rewards as long they continue working."
good,Residual income is great and continues to pour in even when you leave.  You have to work hard in the first few years. Then you can service your existing accounts and receive income off of those.
good,"AFLAC is a unique opportunity for the right person.  It helps tremendously if you know a lot of people.  Although you can make it working with smaller companies, you really need to 'land a big one' to give yourself the cash flow needed to maintain."
good,The hardest part of this job is finding good leads.  Agent spend too much money on trying to find leads.  Excellent management and products.
good,"nothing negative about the people. they offer a lot of benefits that you can only achieve if you sell... takes 5-6 months to sell and then they terminate you... it isn't their fault, its how the company is set up."
good,Time is spent prospecting for new clients and maintaining current accounts. Lots of data entry and traveling from office to accounts.
good,"If you're a ""get in there and get it done"" type, you will succeed."
good,"A typical day at work is cold calling and setting appointments. I've seen multiple agents come and go. The reason being is that there is a rumor about Aflac: The veteran agents take new agents in. They have them present to their friends, families and other acquaintances, at the new agent's financial expense...no company reimbursement. They then have the new agent take a 17 chapter online exam, which the exam itself says, ""You only need 9 chapters of this knowledge to pass and you can't skip the unneeded ones."" The veteran agents don’t tell the newer ones how they got their licenses in a class. The reason behind this is that once the new agents temp licenses expire, their accounts divert to their superior. It's the way the veteran agents get easy money. They don't have to drive, pay for the lunches at meetings or attend enrollments and they still get paid. A direct quote from the State Sales Coordinator is ""I like the job too much, but I love recruiting"" For the above aforementioned reasons."
good,"Typical day  - cold calls in morning and sales calls in the afternoon"
good,Great job. You must be highly motivated and a self learner its not all what they say it will be
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, training is not that great but ok support from management. Very flexible.."
good,Very busy and high call volume...My co-workers were great team workers...The atmosphere was very professional
good,"Maintains working relationship with Union officials and adheres to terms of labor contract by monitoring day-to-day implementation of policies concerning wages, hours and working conditions"
good,I learned how to manage my days and use my resources. My co workers were very great and positive. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping out customers get claims back.
good,"I like working for AFLAC, it is just hard working straight commission and trying to get a business going. If you make it past a couple years it is a great opportunity."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers, Enjoyed the hours of operation."
good,"Great culture, job security and investment in people are the top pros for working with Aflac. Depending on the department, like any company, it makes or breaks the place for you. HR and Management have too much power and this should be more balance. If anyone is intereseted in working for them, I recommend it."
good,great place to work but sometimes commission is a very scary thing
good,Work from home if you want or commute to the office! Meet other professionals like yourself and assist them with their employee benefits.
good,"My work day consists of making phone calls and answering and resolving issues that customers may have.  Prospecting by phone and by walk"
good,"I worked at Aflac for about three months. I did like it quite a bit. The feeling of having my own business was incredibly exciting. Difficult, yes, but exciting. However, I had to leave due to the fact that the job is commission only. It ended up being a heavy burden on my personal life. The lack of stability was not conducive for my situation at the time, not being able to justify working for weeks without seeing a cent. I recommend having an hourly job on the side. Initially, you may not see income for a few months following your hiring. Had I known how long it would take, I would have deliberated more prior to going to the interview. This job is for someone who has the means to work the first few months without seeing any income, but if you are persistent and patient, you will be rewarded rather nicely. It is a fun, and challenging work environment where you are always learning. I enjoyed my time, but decided that the lack of stability was not something I could facilitate at that time."
good,"Aflac is not what I expected, the call center is highly stressful, the benefits are great, there is no work life balance. When I interviewed for the position, I was told I will work one schedule and then once I finish training I was put on a flex schedule working from open to close Monday- Wednesday and 5 hours a day on Thursday and Friday, by the end of week your too tired to enjoy your personal life"
good,"It's a commission only, hard to get off the ground BUT IF YOU DO by god would it sound amazing. I maybe got it to about 30% but wasn't good enough of a salesman to get it going."
good,"It wasn't what I originally thought it would be. This is a sales position that will require you to make cold calls daily and you will be out in the city going into every business you can find. You will encounter many types of people, but don't expect a lot of them to be friendly. There is good compensation if you manage to land a group, but wow it can be difficult. Your starting job is to set an appointment with a decision maker regarding benefits. After that, you go with your District to see if they want to move forward with Aflac. The people at my office were fantastic and it's a fun place to be, but this was much harder than I imagined."
good,"Sales can be very stressful regardless. However, workimg in a rural area where there aren't many companies and yet many people competing to make sells means your chances and actually making a survivable living is very small. Comission based pay ad have to use your own resources from day one. If you're not making money but on the hunt daily and having to drive far places your resources tend to run out quickly."
good,All commission no salary Very relaxed working place  You are your own pace  training in very little after the sales school   All the large accounts are taken
good,You have to drive everyday in order to make money. If you have a good DSC you can do really well. if you have a bad one you will fail. It is hard to be successful unless you already have funds saved in order to make money .  a lot of people quite their first year.
good,going to business to offer our products and selling individual insurance. Supervisor is very professional and takes time out to try to help you succeed.
good,"Very competitive, fast paced environment selling a wonderful product, to those who can afford supplemental insurance. Very challenging and rewarding for those who apply themselves."
good,Commission job. Hard to make good money with so many agents competing for business. No benefits and travel to get to training and meetings was at your expense.
good,"Aflac is an amazing company with wonderful products. However, if you are not good at sales and closing deals, you will not make a dollar. Working at Aflac was fun, but I wasn't good at it."
good,"I think Aflac is a fantastic company for someone who is able to work a 1099, 100% commission sales job.  The brand recognition is top of the class, the commission structure is fantastic, and you really do get out what you put in.  However, if you need a base salary for financial security, a job of this nature is not for you."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Aflac and definitely saw the potential for unlimited income. However, I just fell victim to Murphy's law and ran out time before I had to pay bills."
good,"My title says it all. You must love prospecting at least 40 businesses a day, and like being paid full commission. Aflac is a great company, has great training, and great people. Just do not get involved if you're not willing to prospect at least 40 businesses a day."
good,"Selling supplementary insurance to businesses requires a certain type of personality. Although the company is great and I had a lot of fun, I just couldn't earn enough commission to get by."
good,"If you are independently motivated, it's a good fit. "
good,A health work environment to start with. It was great working with my co-workers. My day started of with the meetings with scrum masters and then documenting and creating story boards. It was fun to work and learn at the same time
good,"Fun place to work, but very unorganized. I wish Aflac had a better computer system.  Eveything is manual and the employees are very young. Great place to start your career."
good,"Aflac is a great company but it is not for everyone. Learning insurance and aflac policies fast is a must! There is daily cold calling in order to get clients. It is also 100 percent commission based work, NO SALARY! This is good some months and very bad others, especially starting out.  You do for the most part get to make your own work schedule so taking time off when needed is very very easy."
good,"A typical day would be spent at the phone bank trying to scare up a sales appointment.  At a sales appointment, you talk to business owners or financial officers or human resources to convince them to offer Aflac to their employees at no cost to them but a few minutes each month at a computer."
good,Must love cold-call sales and commission-only pay. Not for everyone but the potential for excellent compensation and travel is there for the taking.
good,A typical day being Producer for Aflac consists of lots of driving and lots of going door to door and trying to set up appointments with the owner of each business. I've come to realize that being a door to door sales person is a lot of work and persistence. It's pretty difficult if you're a person who can not take rejection well because you will hear a lot of it. This job is pretty much a manage yourself environment which is nice because you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the time and your success depends on you.
good,"There are many rewards for top performers however, getting started is not easy.  The policies are quality but my issue was with selling to hourly employees that were not making enough to take another $20 out of their paycheck.  Just a morale issue that I wasn't able to get around."
good,Position title somewhat conflicted with the true responsibilities of the position. Primarily was used to cold-call potential clients and set up appointments.
good,-Performed B2B marketing to expand Aflac’s penetration in the Delaware area.
good,Prospecting for new customers included retrieving data from a dedicated internet source and physically walking door to door calling on business owners. The task was difficult at times because of the availability yet rewarding when appointments were set. Educating customers about health benefits were both rewarding and challenging at times. Once confirmed with the appointment clients saw the value of the products sold.
good,"If you are into sales you will like this job, the company culture is great although they don't offer benefits like health or dental. The Regional Sales Coordinator at Boca Raton is a great person and great employer and role model."
good,"Very interactive; the absolute most important skill is interacting with people to leave good impressions "
good,The money is there to be made.  I feel I only had a bad experience because my direct manager was inexperienced and just not a good trainer.  I feel you should be able to be on the team that best suits your needs and personality.
good,"Awesome people, compensation, and training. The market, at least in my territory was way too saturated for new associate growth. Other than that, awesome."
good,"The company is great, agents from across Michigan meet up every few months and get rewarded for our success. I just didn't like getting commission only, and them being able to take money back from you if someone didn't pay their invoice."
good,This is the perfect job for someone with plenty of money to start off. It was a sales position for a product many people felt that they didn't need. The market I was a part of had been over saturated that cause a lack of income to new agents.
good,It was a good place to work if you are able to have good networking skills. Its all on you which makes it a great place.Not bad if have a solid bankroll to start with.
good,"A typical day at Alfac involved primarily cold calling. Sometimes, I would make over 100 calls a day without making a appointment. Other times I could make a few calls and make three appointments"
good,This position consisted of multiple hours of cold calling and hard sales.  Hard sales being defined as walking into a business or up to a residence that you knew barely anything about and attempting to sell them on a future appointment with which you would try to sell them any supplemental insurance that you thought that they as the individual or they as the company needed.
good,"A typical work day for me includes interacting with customers. What I have learned from this job that you have to pick and choose your battles , you going to have customers that you disagree with but you still have to make the customer happy. This was a small business so there was not many coworkers I could interact with. The hardest part of the job was getting threw the day because it was so slow. The most enjoyable part about the job is that my hard work was noticed everyday."
good,I went into the job not knowing pay is fully commaion based yet on the application it said $15/hour! I had to find a second job quickly especially with all the tests you have to pay for and the commuting.
good,Aflac is a good company where you get to be your own boss and work when you want to work because it is strictly commission based. This can be a blessing or a curse. It gets very frustrating when the potential clients very rarely cooperate with you.
good,"- A typical day consisted of going to 20-30 business locations per day to schedule meetings with business owners."
good,You get out what you put in. With some luck also involved. Hard to build your own book of business. Aflac provides great products. I just found it hard to convince business owners to offer to their employees.
good,could of been better with more direction and leadership. but overall experience was an eye opener for anyone wanting to door knock all day long and look for the hidden pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
good,Was not for me area I'm in is saturated with other sales people. Business owners are very rude. The ones who are nice are already taken care of. Great support from the managers and coworkers.
good,"This job is very rewarding if you enjoy lots of small talk and have tremendous patience. Note: It will take about 3 months before you actually start making the money. When the money comes in, it comes by the loads.  Be prepared to talk to people and door knock at local businesses around you. There is a lot of introducing yourself to strangers and being able to hear ""no"" repeatedly."
good,"Locating new  clients to sale insurance"
good,Provided life insurance and supplemental health care plans to employers for their employees
good,They will have you believing that you will be making hundreds to thousands of dollars a month. They fail to tell you that it takes multiple appointments and the other company has to purchase and pay for you to get paid. Over saturated with Agents. Can't afford their services in our area. I spent way more in a week than I made the whole year working there. week than
good,I am not sure if the people i was working with were the best to deal with right out of the military. they seemed to be willing to help but then they fell through. it was a really good but painful working experience.
good,"Being an independent for AFLAC was very upfront and the available resources were plenty. "
good,The people were great. It just needs to be more structured and organized. The company itself is great. This office was run by a DSC who was never there and would be irregular with decisions.
good,"You often feel like you're working for free.  UNPAID training is REQUIRED, and is 60+ hours.  Some managers seem really helpful, but some are only interested in who can make them money.  They get commission from your sales too... You're told sales experience isn't necessary but it's completely, 100% a sales job.  Leads are NOT given, as you're lead to believe in the initial interviews.  Once you're trained, you're very much on your own, or sometimes paired up with another sales person with just as little experience as you."
good,Aflac was a hard sell in the area was impossible to make a living and the training was very low and far away.
good,"The people over me training would take some of my commission"
good,"Very Challenging, you must be able to work independently, self motivated. Good feeling knowing that you was offering a product that the Company stands behind."
good,"This is a great company if you want to be on the road all of the time."
good,"Although AFlac advertize great benefits, but the independent agencies behave otherwise. Their intents were to make as much profit from anyone as they could."
good,Aflac isnt a great place to work unless you are a self starter or you get placed on a team that does enough business to send you on enrollments every week
good,"It is a great place to work if you enjoy helping people. You constantly see the life changing benefits of Aflac products. The only downfall is it is solely commission based so if you don't go out and set meetings, you don't set yourself up for success. It's a hard job but rewarding. It's not recommended for introverts but you can still make it work if you have the drive to make something of yourself."
good,"Was great for first 10 years. Field contracting mgmt staff are awful as well as employee relations, etc...………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………...Hopefully this was enough"
good,"The company itself has wonderful products. As a sales rep, culture is very intense and demanding."
good,"Aflac is overall a good company, but has poor leadership and managers not highly skilled in leadership nor managing.  I experienced at least two organizational changes per year, which I thought was strange.  Reputable company for sure, but my time was up.  Pay was decent, could've always been better, but at least you knew you'd get paid.  Vacation time was given appropriately, so that wasn't too bad.  Personal time off can sometimes be frowned upon given the circumstance and who you're under.  Benefits was lofty, expensive, but covered a good deal of medical."
good,I thought I would be able to do the position and realized that I don't have the personality for it.  Also the area where I lived had too many associates so was hard to get new accounts.
good,Once in the field pretty much left alone - support and collateral information did not match up with promises that were made in the beginning. Company does not follow thru on all
good,"Not Management friendly, Overbearing not willing to teach new employees, Very cut throat."
good,I would spend 8 hours a day making cold calls or door knocking for prospective clients. I would set up appointments and enrollments for businesses.
good,"Work was very interesting and rewarding. Pay was inadequate, but the opportunity was a wonderful opportunity, I became experienced with claims resolution and performed fairly independently, made the position mine, and tweaked it to fit my standards and to correctly represent the agent and company with the customer. Other admin employees were great, office was comfortable and accommodating. The hardest part of the job was having to find out things for myself. I am a resourceful person and I was able to ask the questions and learn (the hard way)"
good,100% independant you can make as much money as you want. Compnay stand behind their policies and pays their claims with in a week.
good,The job has great opportunities if youre assisted and lifted up from the start of the job until youre able to take it from there. A good work ethic is very important.
good,"Pay is solely based on commissions, which isn't bad unless you don't have a bit of currency saved up in advance. It's a nice community, cold calling can be a pain at times, but once you get in the swing of things it get's easier and more enjoyable."
good,"Overall, my experience was decent. Their compensation for a comission based company was fair as they provided a base salary. Unfortunately, at the time I worked there they didn't offer health benefits. That being said if you're a good sales person and don't have to worry about health benefits I would recommend working for. Their products are amazing and easy to sell"
good,"Aflac does not value it's veteran agents. The hardest part of the job - time management, lack of support. Love my policyholders. Great job for a select few - those that management decides are worth favoring."
good,the sales force consist of a bunch of mid aged women and there friends. They all look out for each other and provide no help to new recruits. Your told just to go out door to door and sell insurance
good,"Working for aflac is great except for the management piece.  You always have someone over you telling you that you need to open more groups or write more business.  They try to incentivise things so that you will work harder but with health insurance such as it is right now, it is just making this job more difficult.  The duck is awesome but it does not always open doors due to the over saturation of agents."
good,"It's a mix culture and working environment at Aflac."
good,Aflac is a great place to work. I just found it to be hard to work for commission only.. Aflac has great incentives and cash prizes to encourage you to work hard and meet your goal.
good,"The overall view of the company was one of a ""robotic"" nature.  The system they have in place (although it does provide results!) is one of step1, then do this, then do this, and end with this.  No use for ""thinking out of the box"" type personalities."
good,"Afac is a wonderful company to be a full-time employee. It's a dream company to work for. Their employees are appreciated and they are very much shown. It's really not a company that you would want to be a temp for. I have been a temp for Aflac, on and off for almost 3 full years and have not been taken on as a full-time employee. Temps do not receive any of the benefits that are offered to their  employees."
good,"I truly loved my job at Aflac. Every day there was something new. I probably would have done a million times better if I would have had better management, My supervisor was very unsure of his job position and could delegate or help with questions, He would always refer people to other supervisors or leads."
good,I took a year in trying to sell insurance products for Aflac.  Found out this was not for me.
good,"Good company with national advertising"
good,"I really liked the products available from AFLAC, and I thought the value to the customer was very good"
good,"This is a great place to work if you prefer a job that you can make your own schedule, ie, what time to start each day, when to stop, need time for personal appointments and such. "
good,"I only worked part time and did not like the travel and it is very competitive   New managers coming in will ""steal"" from you in a heartbeat...all Aflac products are excellent and sell themselves"
good,"While I enjoyed the aspect of my job, I was thrown to the wolves and left to fend for myself for the first 2 months. My sales manager was young and new to his position, I don't think he really knew how to run a functioning, striving group. He was all about numbers but not about teaching, and boy did he NOT like the fact that we had little clue what we were doing. Kind of hard to enjoy your job when your teacher doesn't teach and gets mad when you need to be taught. Also, there is no base pay, strictly commission. If you don't learn how to make a sale, you can't make a sale. If you can't make a sale, you can't pay your bills."
good,"Working at Aflac helped me learn that not every person is cut out to sell Insurance, but that you can become a top selling agent if you apply yourself. It was a hard lesson and transition to work for myself, and I realized I prefer a more structured job environment."
good,"AFLAC is overall a great place to work and had many perks involved.  "
good,"pleasant working environment, a place for advancement, busy place of business, relaxed working space, learned how to deal with claims and insurance questions"
good,"Aflac allows you to choose. Many can not handle the freedom Aflac provides, but those that can will be every successful. Chances to travel and many rewards including trips."
good,I enjoyed the clients and I believe in the polcies that this companys offer. There is a termendous turn over in the management and over time the management is only concerned about their numbers.
good,It can be very rewarding if you do not spin your tires cold calling. The team support they offer is excellent. The goals appear to be set at a sensible rate. If you have warm contacts things can go much smoother.
good,"I left Aflac from the Customer Service Center where I was transferred at the request of the VP. I was one of a handful of Specialists who could take problems and actually rectify on the call with the customer/policyholder while following company guidelines. My last Lead and multiple Supervisors in the CSC stated that I was their ""go to"" person for rectification of problems which arose. I averaged around 150 to 200 calls a day while on the phones. When things went right it was a very rewarding position."
good,"Aflac has taught me a lot on how to be a self motivated person. It is much different then what I had done in the past but it is something that I do not regret trying,"
good,Considering all the agents worked as independents their attitudes were always upbeat. Loved the power drives and determination to succeed.
good,This was a fast pace job.. With a whole lot of ups and downs. Always something to do..Very busy and full of surprises.
good,"I answered the phones and directed callers appropriately, Put together proposals, mailed needed information to clients. Kept the office in a clean and orderly manner. "
good,"When you interview for this position they tell you that you will make lots of money, that you work as a team and are not out there by yourself (which you are with no assistance from management), no factoring in that other agents are walking over same territory, charge backs occur in which you receive no monthly residuals, only time you get paid is if you sign up new companies employees, no clear understanding of commission structures. Employers are not interested due to health reform hearing about products which is due to confusion that products are not major medical."
good,"Scan enrollment application, logging batch numbers, indexing enrollment applications, creating index cards for groups, research batches for errors, research logging reports. My co-workers were nice and never had a problem pulling together to meet deadlines. The hardest part of my job was being let go because I really enjoyed the challenge that was put before me daily."
good,I hunt for employers that will allow AFLAC to become one of their employee benefits provider. It is challenging but quite rewarding. You must become relentless and get past the no to go to the yes. When you reach goals set by the company you are greatly rewarded.
good,"I did Business to Business sales, so I was out in the field every day prospecting to businesses to see if I could help them out with their health care benefits. It is a very good to work but it is hard to start without any extra income coming into the household."
good,Must go door to door or phone number to phone number selling Aflac products
good,"Cold calling, referrals, Business to business sales and individual products"
good,"When I started with Aflac in 1999, they were an amazing company. I started 6-months before the introduction of the ""Aflac Duck"" commercials. In 1999, the sales distribution system was through a field force of career agents. I was one of those career agents and loved it! Over the past few years, we have had a high turnover in upper management in Arizona somewhat due to moral/legal failures. The company has been putting a much higher degree of using the broker community instead of career agents."
good,Great income after the first year. You must be self motivated and ready to work. I loved it but had to relocate and did not want to start completely over
good,"It was a 1099 job. They give you a bunch of phone numbers a phone at a desk. You keep calling for 7 or 8 hours, trying to make an appointment to sell insurance."
good,"I was far away from base and never had much opportunity to make sales. The area I work was already a dry market,whenever I went to prospect the companies either had a bad experaince with AFLAC or already enrolled."
good,"Working for the print subsidiary, Communicorp, even though promotion should be a natural occurrence, when asking for promotion, the most common response was, ""it's just not in the budget"". Investing in their employees is not something that is seen as important. A big part of the company's problem."
good,"Strong brand with great reputation.  "
good,"Answer all incoming calls, Review all claims, write letters to policyholders, Order office supplies.  Run various reports and distribute to agents.  Prepare renewal letters.  The most enjoyable  part of the job is dealing with policyholders."
good,Enjoyed every day that I worked for the company. The work environment was a great challenge to me as a young entrepreneur. I had some great mentors and was able to grow one of the largest teams in the company. Advancement opportunities were all around and there for anyone who worked hard to do well. The products we offered were and are a tremendous value to our clients.
good,"Selling insurance was a first for me and Aflac provides some great products.  Unfortunately there is no base salary so you must depend solely upon commission in order to pay your bills and handle financial responsibilities.  This was a very strong con."
good,No salary unless you sell and even then it is unpredictable 
good,I loved working for Aflac. the only problem was we live in a small town with several agents. I was sometimes hard to fin a company that did not already have it.
good,The sales team in Terre Haute was in competition but you would not know it.  The veterans in the company were more than willing to work with new salesmen.
good,All Aflac Agents are provided the same leads making it difficult to cold call because receptionists are getting calls from all over.  I thought Aflac would sell itself because I love everything about it including the coverage.
good,"I was a road warrior calling on businesses to help them offer supplemental benefits to their employees.  There was cold-calling and prospecting involved but, it was a very rewarding position."
good,"Training was all done by salesmen so they were always selling."
good,"Great work environment, great people. There's so much to learn, everyone is willing to help one another. The regional office always consist of event for the everyone to work closely together. It's definitely always a team effort."
good,"Typical day is figuring out which part of town you need to go to and research the target business.  Go and talk with the gate keeper and try and set an appoint to go over what the insurance is all about."
good,"Aflac is a Fortune 120 company that still has a family feel.  They do a tremendous job of giving back to the community.  They have approximately 3500 employees in the Columbus, GA area with other operations locations in Columbia, SC, New York, NY, Upstate NY and Omaha, NE."
good,"This place has great people to work with.  That is my most enjoyable part of the job.  "
good,"It's a challenging sales position. The support that you are given is excellent and they are there to help you to succeed, but at the end of the day you need to be able sell to make commissions to earn a living."
good,"Typical day at work...you must be self driven to got out there and make the contacts you need.  I enjoy working here, but my passion lies in other realms of customer service.  I would encourage anyone who has a desire for variety to join the AFLAC team."
good,"I was and independent agent paid on a commission bases."
good,Typical work day requires the wearing of many hats and juggling between various departments and job descriptions.
good,"You are usually paid through strict commission. You don't get paid until you sell and many of the agents are hard to work with. You need to be a real self starter. Good place to learn what you like, and what you don't like."
good,"While working at Aflac I learned a lot about the field of HR. A typical day consisted of sourcing resumes, calling potential employees, setting up and assisting in interviews. Some days were spent at recruiting events such as job fairs or entering employee data into the HRIS system."
good,reached out to corportations to provide supplemental insurance to their employees
good,"get out of bed and get to work. Cold call, cold call, cold call."
good,"A typical day at work with Aflac is out in the field, door to door cold calls! The most difficult part of the job is earning an income due to 100% commissions. The most enjoyable part is freedom and flexability!"
good,Involved alot of cold calling and is 100% commission these are 2 things I didn't enjoy but other than those everything is great. It's a phenomenal company overall.
good,Challenging to get a base established.  Not a lot of support.  You are pushed to open accounts and get bonuses so your DSC does as well.  Then no pay and charge backs come into play and you don’t have enough business to off set them.  Your superiors do.
good,"I had a very good time. It taught me valuable things in life. Helping people is something i enjoy, within that field of work you get to enjoy that...."
good,This is not necessary for new employment purposes. I will be happy to share a regular workday at Aflac with any prospective employer during the interview process.
good,"I wish the hiring managers had been more concerned with providing honest expectations for their new-hires, as many would start then make less than honest claims to make sales in order to survive. This left policyholders with incorrect expectations, that had nothing to do with the Policies themselves. Bad representatives only pollute the pool."
good,You need to have clients and or a pipeline before working with Aflac.  You don't get any leads or much help getting them.  Lots of long days and frustrating times.  Can be very rewarding though.  More often than not the culture is good and the peole on your team end up being life long friends.
good,"Selling on the individual side for AFLAC is very different than working for corporate. The individual side of business requires a hustle mentality to seek business, cold calling, soliciting businesses."
good,Aflac has rewards and competitive winnings as well as traveling other countries like Jamaica with coworkers annually which depends on the type of work accomplishments made for the company.
good,Great company to work for with fair wages. The training is great and they really make sure you are prepared to be successful as long as you put in the work and effort yourself.
good,"The company had boundless opportunity and great support from every level of management. The hardest aspect of the job is work/life balance."
good,"Aflac is a company based in Columbus, Georgia, with assets valued at $56 billion and a clientele base of over 40 million individuals worldwide. The company's goal is to provide inexpensive, yet superior, insurance products to its clients and employers by combining advanced marketing strategies with thoroughly investigated quality insurance plans on the market."
good,"Better have six months’ or more rent and expenses stashed away; the first year is murder trying to live on unpredictable and scarce commissions in a commission-only earning situation."
good,More than enough promotional materials are available. The company is constantly growing and improving what they do. AFLAC is an amazing opportunity with a path for growth.
good,The team is amazing and the vibe is really supportive and encouraging.  So many good things happening here!  Every single person is amazing and highly motivated.
good,"Reviewed incoming communications and scheduled appointments. Spent morning with appointments and new sales, and follow-up. Afternoon did client management. Bi-weekly morning meetings on Monday and Friday that required half the day (due to travel) greatly hindered productivity during critical times."
good,Your co-workers are there to help you and drive you to succeed. I was able to gain valuable experience every day from the job requirements and would recommend this position to anyone.
good,"This industry is changing.  It is more competitive and the landscape for outside sales in the health care industry is changing.  But for a person who is willing to be focused, driven and teachable; it is a great opportunity."
good,"This company is a great way to learn basic office skills. I am currently doing my externship at this location, an I feel like I have learned a lot that is going to help me in my future career."
good,I learned a lot about running a business working with Aflac. The overarching desire to help others is prevalent throughout the company. The opportunity for advancement is solely based on personal accomplishment which is great for stoking entrepreneurial fires.
good,"Hard to sell products and make appointments with clients, all commission base, agent overflow in market, company turnover.  Positive reinforcement. Aflac offers great incentives however this market is a hard sell."
good,"Everyday I travel to businesses to speak with the owner in order to speak with the employees.  I then present to a group of employees, then do one-on-ones to employees who want any of our products.  I then ask questions in order to find the best policies for them and their families."
good,I love the product and the company. I really like helping others and I have been able to do so by working with AFLAC. I have gotten out my comfort zone and grown tremendously.
good,"Lots of exposure to insurance sales processes, as well as intense sales training and understanding the variety of insurance products. Highly reccomend to anyone interested in learning about the insurance industry."
good,Nice people but too much driving.  I did not know enough locals to get in their good graces.  I spent too much money on gas without getting enough financial compensation.
good,"It was a good place to work.  As a Secretary there, I learned more about the company.  Most of the folks were great and loved their work.  Happy that title and pay of my previous position was changed for the better."
good,"You work cold call and warm leads for at least 8 hours a day, set appointments,set up groups, write policies, customer service, and it is a great company, but the pay is commission only.  This is why I am leaving."
good,"Overall a great place to work:  the earning potential is tremendous and they have a great training program. "
good,"When the job states independent insurance agent but you sign with contract that means you have to answer to Aflac without a regularly paid job with benefits. BUT! It all depends on the individual; if you like challenge and going out and talking and selling then it is for you and you will advance (depending on your manager) but if selling or cold calling and being in situations that are awkward and hate anything to do with insurance, it is not for you. BE WARNED THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR OWN STUFF. Again, double edged sword."
good,100% commission based salary.  Must be determined to make your own appointments and close your sales.  Stressful competition between districts...Maybe it would have gotten better the longer one stays to build the pipeline and network
good,"Great products and an excellent learning experience for recent college graduates. It can be cut-throat and favoritism can be shown to high achievers. Management doesn't spend enough time developing associates. High and often time unrealistic sales goals. If you don't like cold calling, this may not be the job for you."
good,A great place to work where employees are well appreciated. Can be stressful at times but what job isn't. There are great benefits to working for this company
good,"Overall, this was a good company to work for. the work days can be a little stressful and there is little advancement outside of the call center. this was one of the major pain points."
good,I think that AFLAC as a company is excellent and the products they offer for workplace benefits are unsurpassed. The last 2 years under a management change were very stressful and created conflict in our region. Had the old  upper management remained I would probable still be with the company in a managerial capacity.
good,"Aflac allowed me to develop relationships with employers and employees, while allowing me to educate people about fantastic benefit packages that helped families in time of need."
good,Great company with many incentives and freedom... Have to be driven 110% as this is a 100% commission pay. Create your own schedule and uncapped opportunity for income.
good,Challenging work environment. You do a lot of cold calling and soliciting for business. strictly commissions for the first year but there is a bonus structure for agents who do well.
good,Not a horrible place to work.  They expect a lot but don't give much in return.  Must work O.T. or it can reflect poorly on your yearly evaluation.  Company doesn't pay employees nearly enough.
good,This is not a job for everyone. You are working as an independent contractot with a major insurance company. Your income is based on your own hard work and the quality of your services. This job is only for those who have business mind and desire to have their own business.
good,Great atmosphere to grow as a professional. Hand's off management approach. Friendly and approachable staff. Learned a great deal about the insurance industry.
good,"The position was a good one, especially since the management was easy-going once I exhibited that my technique was productive.  Within the first few days if you prove your proficiency to sell the product/service, they basically let you do your thing, which I found liberating and propitious for successful performance."
good,"good place to work, if you need a job, I appreciate the opportunity to work for this company. I learned a lot, when I worked for this company about health insurance."
good,"Great company. Solid training program. Nice working flexibility and hours. What you put into it, you get out of it!  The staff is great and always there to support everyone!"
good,"All the people I met.  I made alot of friends with compines I opened up.  I not olny sold them insurance, I made sure if they had claims that I personal was called to filed their claims. And  keep in contact with them to make sure they had no problem with hq or their claims"
good,Typical day is gathering cold calls.  I learned how to interact with business owners.  Management is very helpful with teaching how to deal with business owners/decision makers.
good,"Great place for anyone who is looking for a work/life balance. The camaraderie among everyone in the organization is something you rarely find in the workplace. "
good,"The fun part of the job, you will interact with new people everyday and help people make good life decisions on insurance options. "
good,A typical day is going from business to business trying to set up meetings with the owner. I learned that in order to be sucessful you need to love sales and be willing to travel a lot.
good,"There was a lot of competition in the area, and it was difficult for me as I am not pushy and do not enjoy cold calling.  A challenge was to get the right enrollment conditions set up."
good,"A typical day at orchard is to make different phone calls and visits to new and current clients. I learn a lot about customer service, running a business,detail organization skills,  follow up with clients, market myself and the products of the company as well closing sales in a challenging environment."
good,the employer is all in all not a bad place to work. the cold start up is the only reason its not five star because pay life work balance is great and culture as well one of the best i have ever had a pleasure to work with.
good,"I Provided customers with opportunities in supplemental coverage for their health and life insurance, along with providing education in current changes within the health care reform laws."
good,Wonderful management and co-workers.  Management always provides encouragement and incentives to increase productivity.
good,"*•Provide efficient and effective customer service; cross sell Bank products and services."
good,"This was a hard place to work because there are no territories and if you would go into a place one day and get them on the hook to offer aflac, the next day another agent could come in and sign them up with zero care. It was very cut throat and hard to make a living. Commission only, lots of costs and hard to make money. I did learn how to manage time better with this position."
good,"Aflac has great products and will give perspective Agents a chance to be successful."
good,Worked in a team or solo. They offer lots of support to help you succeed. Hardest part of the job was generating your own leads.
good,A typical day at Aflac consisted of searching for new businesses to educate about supplemental insurance. What I learned is that it requires great organizational skills and there is an opportunity to learn from coworkers which made the job easier.
good,customer driven and employee recognized company. Every year they celebrate what their employees have done for the company. Lots of room for advancement.
good,product is great needs to develop a training plan with the DSC. What is learn at the regional training office is not mirrored within the Districts. Very frustrating for new agents.
good,"Very detailed job verifying information, data entry.  Management could be more organized with knowledge of training."
good,Great place to work.  The Sherman Oaks team is great and would recommend that office to anyone out there. It is a wonderful place to become a successful entrepreneur in a highly competitive job market.
good,"Aflac is a great, family operated company with insurance products to suit the needs of those who need help if they are hurt or sick."
good,"Money is there....if you can stick it out.  Starting out is slow, but the potential is great"
good,The management at Aflac provided all of the tools to be successful in providing supplemental insurance offered by Aflac.  The company also offers a large variety of supplemental products.
good,"I only worked here for a semester as part of an internship, but I certainly learned a lot in my brief time. Prior to the internship I had very little experience calling people on the phone, talking to business owners, or working in an office, and after I not only had these experiences, but was comfortable doing them. The manager of the office is very friendly and always did what he could to help me succeed."
good,"I like being self employed, but it is hard to always make enough money. I am able to work when I want. It can be difficult to get started because unless you are able to work with broker you have to cold call until you can get into a company and sell to their employees."
good,"In this area AFLAC is over represented, resulting in multiple contacts to the extent that it had developed a bad reputation in solicitation. However, the products and company itself were fantastic.  I could not make an effective income there."
good,"Enjoyed my tenure with Aflac, executive management went out of their way to make the work environment and experience a good fit for all employees."
good,"They offered a lot of different positions, allotted for promotions when you put the work in, and treated even lower-level employees well."
good,It  take a lot of self motivation and determination and a great attitude to sell insurance also you must priorities. its nice to work as a team. You win some and you lose some.
good,AFLAC has wonderful products and policies for individuals and businesses. Very informative regarding their products and they are very dedicated to providing the best to their customers.
good,"Great training and they are all about the big picture.  Made a lot of great clients, and friends.  People friendly place to work."
good,Being able to help families fulfill the American dream of owning a home was a great feeling. Assisting them with the process of getting approved for a loan to finally getting the keys to their home is an overwhelming feeling.
good,I sold supplement insurance to employee at different companies. I loved my career until I moved to another state and then there was to much back stabbing.
good,"We would have team meetings once a week, but for the rest of the week is was typically cold calling, door to door. I would either go by myself or team up with another agent. Definitely have to leave your fears behind."
good,Learned to manage my time and optimize territory management. Learned to refine cold-calling skills. Refined presentation skills. The most difficult part of the job was to overcome the large amount of competing agents that were calling on businesses. The most enjoyable part of the job was to overcome the large amount of competing agents that were calling on the businesses and excel at that.
good,"Opportunity very good . Exciting  high energetic people with skills and self motivated work  force,"
good,Learned a lot of useful skills for sales.  They teach you things many things about the insurance industry that are necessary for the business.
good,Great opportunity for those interested in new field if they are great self starters
good,"business to business cold calls "
good,"Being an independent agent puts you out by yourself for most of your days, however when you team up with other associates in your district it tends to be a much happier environment, because you have someone else there to feed off of. The flexibility is great too when it comes to family life."
good,"	Interact extensively with clients and prospects to build new business networks and open new accounts"
good,Self generating work place where talent is never enough.  Self motivation and follow through get the job done.
good,"-A typical day was filing claims, faxing/coping/scanning documents to headquarters, answer phones, call customers/physicians for documents, and expenses for the agent."
good,"Great boss, I learned a lot from how to handle not so pleasant customers to staying in compliance with company rules. The hardest part was not having enough to do at times."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my career at AFLAC is when families receive their claim checks after an accident or an illness. You get a phone call saying thank you. Thank you because without this money, I would have been bankrupt, homeless, gone hungry or would have not been able to pay for medical treatments I needed."
good,"Prospecting business for supplement insurance sales that will benefit their employees in time of crisis(disability,illness or accident).The hardest thing of the job is that it is commission only. I really like sales and help helping people find the right insurance care that will meet their needs.Also the affordability of Aflac threw a business is awesome.After your training you are basically working on your own and at your own pace."
good,"Family oriented"
good,"I liked working for Aflac, but started at the wrong time during the economic down turn."
good,"The Ultimate Experience of Interviewing  prospective clients to obtain data about their financial resources and needs, the physical condition of the person to be insured, and to discuss any existing coverage."
good,Did alot of recruiting in this position.  Great start to getting to know how to recruit from the ground up.
good,"While AFLAC benefits consultants work hard, their compensation is a 100% commission position.  While this encourages hard work, there are many hard workers out there that can't sacrifice months worth of salary when they may have children or families depending on a paycheck, AFLAC may be missing out a great number of quality leaders do to the commission structure."
good,"Come in to work, Call HQ about claims, and policies. Then I would File and place orders for brochures if  needed. Ive learned all the different coverages we offer, how to communicate with my team as well as being independent. Hardest part of the job is making sure the policies are PERFECT for our customers. I am very particular. Most enjoyable part would be meeting new people."
good,Cold calling in order to set up appointments for potential insurance clients. Reveiwing materials and signing them up.
good,High Quality Voluntary Insurance Products enhancing employer  benefit offerings to employees.
good,Aflac is a great place to work with if you can sell. My trainers and co workers are very inspiring and great to work with. Always willing to help you set goals and achieve them.
good,Nothing bad to say about this company. Great managers. Would go back and work with a few of my old co-workers
good,"The duck is a fair boss. He says little but carries a big bill."
good,They have a great training program that allows you to build a business from the ground up. Most of your time will be spent prospecting leads that you generate to become Aflac accounts. This can be very challenging but also very rewarding.
good,Go out cold calling trying to promote and sell Aflac and its policies.
good,"Although the secretarial workload became repetitive, I learned a lot during my time at Aflac, which I believe prepared me for my career path."
good,I worked with small businesses selling the importance of supplemental insurance in today's health care market. I would do cold calls to companies as well as warm referrals. I had a small book of business. The management although knowledgeable were not easy to work with at times. I enjoyed working with the employees of the companies however realized that this type of sales was just not for me at the time.
good,I have enjoyed my time as an intern at Aflac. I am allowed independence in problem solving and decision making which I believe has prepared me for a leadership position in my future. I am the link between customers and the agents and also between the agents and the corporate office. This role has required superior communication skills to allow me to build relationships with coworkers as well as policyholders.
good,"Working at Aflac has given me the opportunity to speak with other professionals in the region. I was given tasks to engage in sales presentations with businesses across Maryland. Additionally, I became more organized as I had to stay on top of scheduling interviews for potential employees to the company."
good,"Working for Aflac offered agents the opportunity to operate as business owners themselves. A typical day included calling prospects to speak with business owners, canvassing door to door, and speaking at open enrollments to assist employees with adding an Aflac product to their already exisiting benefit. The hardest part of the job was having no benefits, and not salaried based"
good,"I was lucky to have very good leaders at AFLAC in Rockville, MD. Most AFLAC offices are extremely independent and do not teach good sales techniques. I started to build relationships with clients by cold calling and setting meetings. I eventually developed warm leads and was able to run a business."
good,"This internship is what you make it, and it can be a great experience. 99% of the time you are recruiting potential sales agents over the online application pool and internet recruiting sites such as careerbuilder. With good work ethic, management will give you the tools needed to grow with the internship by giving you more responsibilities in the hiring process at AFLAC."
good,"Making cold calls, making presentations to employers and employees. I managed my time, scheduled appointments, picked up claims from policyholders. The hardest part of working for Aflac is that the company hires an extreme amount of agents, counting on the system of hiring that 1 out of 10 people stuck with it. We literally ""tripped over"" each other out in the field and were met with hositility in the workplace because the employers had been called on so many times by Aflac agents."
good,"I have no malice towards Aflac. They have been good to me. The schedule is perfect, I loved what I did there as an insurance agent."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of me issuing 4 or five company wireless devices to management, receiving equipment deliveries( morning and afternoon), check work order request. During my time at Aflac I learned about software compliance, hardware management, better communication skills. I had to deal with all levels of management from Executive VP to supervisor. My last supervisor tended to micro-manage too much, which affected team morale. This was by far the most difficult part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was my interaction with my co-workers and my customers. My co-workers made my job easier to perform and moviated me to be the best I could be."
good,"In this position I was able to use my ""go getter"" attitude to try to gain new business."
good,A typical day at work is drama.. Sometimes people gets you involve in situations and then run to management so that you're the blame.
good,"Aflac is a fine place to work. They pay for production. If you're not producing, you're not earning. Working for Aflac requires specific motivation."
good,In the feild 90% of the business day.
good,"Self employed so everyone's experience is very different. Aflac is a great company to be associated with. Great training and advancement oportunities. However, you have to be financially set for a few months when you start. There are several start up costs and it will be a few weeks to a couple months before you have any income."
good,"Great selection of products. The products have a range of premium costs so that almost anyone can afford one of their options. Easy to make a claim, and claims are paid promptly."
good,"Great place to work, if one is familiar with supplemental insurance products.  Company offers full training on its products, customer service, promotions, etc. (all is contingent upon district managers)"
good,Depends on how much time you are willing to put in. The more you work the money money you will make. Do not expect help from district managers. Meeting are optional. You do not need to be a part of a team. after training you can be by yourself always. No real advancement but the security of your job is constant as long as you sell and keep wanting to work for them you can. Need health and life insurance license.
good,"A great company, but you have to be good at cold calling and able to take rejection... a lot of it.  Good products, but so many businesses are uneducated by what they are."
good,"AFLAC provides you the opportunity to set your own schedule.  Mid-level mgmt. is willing to assist in training and hand-on experience. "
good,"If you have money saved this is a great opportunity. You have to be extremely dedicated and be a self motivator. Your income relies on you and you alone. I unfortunately may have to quit because it is totally commission. I love the flexibility of this job and weekends and holidays off, however it is always without pay. Getting started may take up to 6 months, so if you don't have the resources to live that long with little compensation don't do this."
good,"You work on your own schedule. Aflac will help you reach your goals, though some may not do much work at all. Completely commission."
good,"Aflac used to be Agent-Friendly.  Now they are Broker-Friendly.  Aflac will always side with the Broker and allow the Agent to be cut out of cases they've been working for years.  Many veteran agents are leaving because of this new trend.  It's too bad, because Aflac used to be a wonderful opportunity.  Now it feels very cut-throat.  There is so much back-stabbing among agents and coordinators - you never know who you can really trust."
good,"You are your own boss. What you put in to it is what you get out of it, however as with any type of insurance sale, finding groups and/or individuals who are in need of it, or willing to hear more about it is often difficult."
good,"Making your own schedule is nice but there is no base salary. It is commission only, and that is hard when you first start out because all you are doing is trying to set appointments and build your book of business. If you have a good savings set up and can go a month without a paycheck then I would recommend trying it out."
good,This is a job that is based on how much effort you are willing to put into your business. You make your hours and days you work. It is difficult in the beginning because it is only commission and building your book is difficult. You have the opportunity to make a lot of money but you will need to put in the work to get there.
good,"Aflac is a family company. That means they really care about the YOU that works for them. They have a cafeteria in a gigantic omnibus work fortress. They will also tell you to not have too many earrings because they can be distracting; other adults at aflac are distracted by more than two shiny things on anyone's ears, or things like colorful hair. Family companies can't stand for that, even if it makes your ears bleed as you cycle unhealthily to show the work life balance of family company  expectations on your head. Because no families have people with lots of earrings or colorful hair. They will pay you though, pretty well actually, maybe."
good,Aflac has great benefits and are among one of the best companies to work for in the U.S.  The culture of the company is very inviting as well as motivating to all employees.
good,Overall this is a great company to work for; the advancement potential is the problem. Very easy to be stuck due to change in company requirements and department structures.
good,I worked for the corporate office of Aflac in Boise before transferring into the field as a consultant. The corporate position was amazing with great benefits and great pay. After transitioning into the field I felt as though I was lost in the shuffle and over time there was less energy put into training and helping me even though I was still new to the business.
good,Aflac is a great company everyone is a team player and wants to help people. The reason i want a change is due to no job security and i have zero benefits. Also just for me personally i dont fully enjoy being and insurance agent.
good,It's a great company to work for if you have good leadership. Poor leadership can cause you to not make any money due to lack of support and training.
good,"AFLAC is a wonderful company.  I wish I had been able to stay with it but with the lack of benefits and the time entailed in making ""s ales"" and the commissions, it was not feasible for me to continue.  It truly does require salesmanship."
good,"Work with a great team and have learned much in the realm of sales, asset management, and recruiting. Aflac does much for their employees and field force by offering great incentives, renewals, stock options, and great products."
good,"Great environment and nice people work at AFLAC. Because it is commissioned based, it takes awhile to develop a book of business. One must have a thick skin to work there."
good,I was allowed to do a lot of extra jobs other than be a receptionist and that was good for me and for the company also.  The company decided that the branch would not continue.
good,I am an Independent Insurance Agent. I sell supplemental and voluntary benefits. I work with business owners and employees and handle open enrollments.
good,This company allows their employees the freedom of making their own hours and working as little or as much as they would like. The company is great when it comes to being supportive of their employees. The most difficult part of the job is that it is commission only. You have to work hard to find clients and the employee is not always certain when they will receive a paycheck.
good,"the atmosphere in the building is great!! Enjoyed the Cafe and the gym that is on the property. The work wasn't hard and i enjoyed my co-workers, Im still friends with all of them! I enjoyed most of my managers, i didnt like how they changed them so often."
good,This was a great company though not for everyone. You have to commit to not being steadily paid for at least 6 months to a year. It was the best company I ever worked for though. Wish  had never left. I left in 2008 and am still receiving a monthly check from them.
good,"Very good place to work for, very flexible hours and works out great with my school schedule. Love that I can work how many hours I want and can set my own schedule."
good,"Must be self motivated; responsible for generating leads and closing accounts.  Sales process has multiple steps, and can be lengthy to close.  Once you close an account, you are responsible for enrollment of policyholders and conducting an annual enrollment."
good,This job requires lots of driving and organization. If you are self motivated and eager to work hard to make a good paycheck then this is the job for you. Hours are Flexible.
good,"The management is hands on with training and have classes 3 times a week before going out and cold calling business the rest of the day. The team energy is unbelievable! I have learned a lot about sales psychology and asking open ended questions to acquire information about a prospective client. The hardest part of the job is the knocking on 40 to 50 different business doors and trying to convince them to allow you to speak to the owner or president of the company.  Another difficulty is the not knowing when your next pay day will be, due to the fact that it is commission only. However the best part of the job is the satisfaction you get when a person is in dire need of their money from their policies and and you are able to give them the assurance that it is going to be there and help them so they won't have to miss paying rent or car payment etc."
good,Very Fun job with a lot of chances to advance & earn trips around the world. The hardest part of the job is only working for commission. no hourly or salary offered strictly 100% commission.
good,"A great learning experience. Too many clicks and back biting. No room to advance or pursue other skills. Very stressful and quota demanding, however, I exceeded quotas, had perfect attendance, and received an enormous amount of excellent customer service awards."
good,"meet cliens, sales technics, cooperative management to be there at all time to help. Co-workers very friendly. convince knowledgable customers.Can work from home"
good,"The most difficult part of this job is location. In Fort Smith, Arkansas, Aflac is a dirty word because of all the agents that have come and gone with the promise of good service but no follow through. It was commission based which was difficult because of the ideas of what Aflac was in this area. The management was great and backed you while helping you."
good,"Got to set own schedule, but 100% commission, you don't work, you don't make money. Everyone there was friendly, Need to make cold calls a lot."
good,Benefits and compensation is great best i have had since being in the military.  This company will reward you for having a degree and pay you well for outstanding work performance.
good,"Love the AFLAC product and that I could set my schedule.  While working for AFLAC I learned a lot about customer service, working with company owners and staff.  I enjoyed meeting new people and networking.  Insurance is a very important product that few people are ever really educated about and I feel should be exposed to in some degree while high school as part of planning for their future. It would make me happy to be able to present a check to a client that was able to benefit from the product they bought."
good,"A company with amazing compensation and comfortable retirement opportunity. More of an opportunity than a job with stable/consistent pay. Odd as it may sound, your success is somewhat luck based."
good,"Direct liaison between external clients, personal staff and vendors. "
good,"Just was unable to make enough money to pay the bills. The typical day I went business to business and made appointments with the owners. Then I would have meetings with my manager and the owners, making them aware of what we can offer them."
good,"Rise early and sort through leads to make calls in morning, unless there is an appointment scheduled."
good,"training provided, only real problem was that you HAVE to buy one of their computers or do all paper apps."
good,"Challenging and exciting career with lots of flexibility.  However, compensation is not gauranteed, which in turn, negatively impacts job security."
good,"Coordinated with the Regional Sales Coordinator in organizing monthly and quarterly meetings. Assisting 50 + agents in the Central Iowa Region with resolution of complex and daily issues. New Associate recruitment, licensing, and contracting. Manage the Regional Sales Coordinator calendar and email. Oversaw the daily operation of a 5 + million dollar sales office. Able to manage existing accounts while also coaching and assisting agents. "
good,I learned more about the insurance field and what Aflac had to offer.   
good,"Days consist of generating leads,driving to appts, sales and mngment of groups from 3-300. learned the insurance indusry and realized you are responsible for everything you earn. Not a very team oriented position as you are a 10-99 agent. management is there to assist in sales as they benefit from these as you do. Hardest part is finding decision makers,easiest part is selling said decision makers.Nice building rapport w/groups and processing claims."
good,I am the regional administrator for an Aflac regional office. My primary job is to manage the regional sales coordinator's schedule and create 30 weekly interview appointments for potential new agents. I also type a few emails and create spreadsheets. I use special programs to keep track of all the resumes we pull from different job search websites as well as to keep track of the Aflac associates and clients.
good,"Working with the public and offering a product and a service was second to none but, making a living in such a rural area made make a living very difficult. The mistake was not checking how many experienced agents were in the area I would cover. They were a lot and many had years of experience and like me started at the bottom but, most had second incomes like a spouse or lived at home where little money while building up your clientele."
good,"Aflac office in Bend,OR is a great place to work for people that can make it financially for the first few months. The management was great other than they hired too many agents in a small time frame so training was not as complete as it could be. The online training experience was a nightmare. It was always freezing up and never could really learn do to website kicking you off and freezing up. If you can make it into the office for meetings, the meetings can be informative. When I had to take some time off do to family emergencies, they were very understanding."
good,"My typical day consists of contacting business owners to educated them on how Aflac can save them money on there payroll taxes, cost them nothing as a business owner, & enhance there benefit package. All while promoting employee moral & loyalty. I have learned the importance of having suplemental insurance to help families out when unexpected accident or illness occurs. The management was knowledgeable & helpful. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of my day was driving to Garden City from Central Islip. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing or getting a call from a client who we serviced."
good,"Beginning a job with Aflac was exciting. I was a ""cold call"" insurance sales agent. Going to businesses to explain how Aflac would benefit their employees. The job involved a lot of travel. It was a great learning experience for me. I went to many training classes and state meetings. My manager worked with me and several other new agents, side by side to get everyone comfortable with cold calls. Everyone I worked with had a great attitude and were willing to help out anytime the situation arose. The hardest part of the job was the travel. The most enjoyable aspect of Aflac was meeting and talking to new people everyday. No two days were the same."
good,"Meeting with prospective clients scheduling enrollments with their staff to recommend amount and type of coverage based on the analysis of their circumstances. I learned that I could talk with and develop repoir with anyone, and utilize persuasive sale techniques. The management of the job was great especially during our monday meeting, they were filling, educational and fun."
good,"Develop leads through community networking groups, cold-calling prospects and visiting small businesses; participate in business events as an agency representative for the company brand."
good,"It can be difficult to get started, and training is very dependent on who you're working with. There's a team element but a lot of competition and individual accomplishment as well. Overall, not a bad place to work. But if you lose your momentum of finding and securing groups, it's very difficult to pick up the pace again. Fully commission, so a leap of faith. But if you work hard, are persistent and consistent, it can be very rewarding."
good,"In my short time doing the sales hustle I've meet many people through Aflac, business owners, hard workers, people that could sell you your own pen and leave you feeling happy about it. With the extremely high turn over rate of contracted agents you see different levels of work ethic, self motivators, and innovators. "
good,This job is 100% commission based and by the time you find someone that will sit with you after they have changed the meeting a few times and half the people show up then you have to have everything submitted- just takes so long to get anywhere
good,"This payment structure is new to me. The work is new, this career path is new but it all seems to be coming together."
good,"It is a wonderful company with a lot of support but the issue for me personally was the 100% commission. I know that it works for most people but the lack of stability has me constantly on edge and anxious about making the next sale. "
good,"AFLAC is a great company, the manager I was assigned to was not very conducive to me."
good,"A fairly good company with the normal bureaucracy. 😐😉😁😄😃😀😕🙁😉🙂 The company is currently going through growing pains and that hurts. I guess things are changing for the better, I’ll have to wait and see!"
good,Relaxed place to work.  Flexible hours with decent pay and residuals. No healthcare or retirement.  Decent training program.  No steady stream of business to help employees when first starting out.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Aflac. There was a good family/work balance, a flexible work schedule, and a nice bonus towards the end of the year, which was nice to have for Christmas shopping. The only complaint I have is the advancement opportunities were almost non-existent in my department. The majority of the department consisted of tenured employees that had been there for 10+ years, yet they were all in the same position they had started in 10 or more years ago. There were only about 3 or 4 employees that held a position above a Level 1 in a department of approximately 40 people."
good,"The job is quite easy, especially after being there a while. The pay is not very good, but management shows a lot of appreciation for employees in other ways."
good,"generally good a job, really very difficult market as there are too many agents per state,"
good,"Aflac is an awesome company in terms of a positive work atmosphere. It is a commission only job and you don't get paid for all the hours of work you put in to do the job. That is the only reason I left the company,"
good,Aflac was okay to work for but the call center environment was very stressful and it was hard to move into another department. The metrics could also be a bit hard to maintain and your schedule was based on performance.
good,"The company provides 3 weeks Sales School and then twice a week for an hour and a half, excellent Sandlers base sales reinforcement training, leading by certified Sandles instructors.  The group I worked with provided teaching support on administrative issues, in addition to product training.  Each manager has the individual option how he/she will mentoring you. If you good in sales and has a natural talent to it this is a perfect place for you. You will flourish from the start. If you have additional income for at least two years you will get there sooner or later :)Perfect job for retirement with all the connection in your packet you can now use it."
good,I enjoyed my years at Aflac. The products are excellent. The training was good. I didn't care to travel to South Dakota for meetings. I was very self motivated and had great contacts that helped me be successful right away.
good,The Leaders at Aflac are some of the best I have experienced. Great people. They encourage you to do your best and provide good training opportunities for all.
good,If youre a self-starter and have the abolity to get out there and make it happen even when you don't feel like it then this could be the perfect job for you. Flexibility is AWESOME
good,meeting with mentor every morning discus plan of day. establish leads and star prospecting to business proposal of heath and life insurance benefits. fallow up with previous day prospect and establish appointments for feature clients
good,"Excellent Local Management that is very knowledgeable of Aflac Products, the Market Place and Aflac in general. Good Camaraderie with Local Staff and Regional Staff."
good,"Great place to work but return can be limited based on client base."
good,"We had weekly meetings and training on Mondays and Fridays to make sure that we understood everything that was offered and that we would offer to clients. "
good,"Very good training and the supplemental products are very good."
good,"Aflac is a great job for those who like to meet new people. Working at Aflac is good for people who have the ability to sell, and feel comfortable educating people."
good,"It's a dynamic company undergoing some structural changes.  After 60 years in insurance, there is an effort to modernize functions and disciplines to take the risks required to stay competitive."
good,"It's a great company to work for that is full of great people.The only downside is it takes a long time to get started making money. Other than the commission based pay, it's wonderful."
good,"I worked in the office, not an agent.  Highly stressful, challenging and rewarding.  If I was a decade younger, I would be an agent. Aflac is a good product and works well with the health insurance."
good,"I really do not want to complete this because my job duties require me to work as a liaison for our field and home office.  My day is filled with complaints.  However, overall, Aflac is a good company to work for."
good,Great opportunity for those who do well in a sales based environment compensation. Training is available at all levels and support is also there to help you succeed.
good,The typical day at work consists of prospecting...basically going door to door for businesses and trying to get them to let you in and sell your product to their employees. The hardest part is that it is very competitive among the agents. The most enjoyable part for me was always meeting new people.
good,Very good people and management.  They are very helpful in training and keeping up your license requirements.  Allows agent to sell a variety of insurance products.
good,Overall working for the company is a great joy.  I would recommend the opportunity to pretty much everyone.  All jobs have the same pros and cons so I won't go into details.  I am just grateful to have a job in this job market.
good,A great job but the straight commission is too volatile for my finances at this time.  I have a mother with Alzheimers and a Stepfather battling cancer and I need to have the stability of a regular income at this time.  Aflac will need to be a part time extra income job now rather than a career.
good,"Great opportunity if you are not afraid and know how to hustle, this is commission only, so do not quit your other job or find something else until your book of clients start to fill up."
good,"Support services is a big team that serves as the backbone of the company. Aflac encourages employee tenure situations rather than constantly flipping employees which is great but limits advancement opportunities in certain areas. Overall my time with the company has been enjoyable and a great first sample of ""Corporate America""."
good,"Training and mentorship at the Paradise Region of AFLAC out of Salinas and South San Jose.  After 18 months with AFLAC, first as administrative assistant and quickly into the sales role, I really had high hopes of creating an amazingly profitable and flexible career with AFLAC, taking advantage of their 10-year plan where all your accounts remain yours forever.  However, after earning so little for so long, less by far than I could have earned simply Ubering 6-7 hours/day, I had to move on.  The people, both in management and in the sales force, are wonderful, but it takes a supportive spouse with a very good salary to afford the long running start to get accounts built up as this position is 100% commission.  "
good,"Each day of the week is prepared a week in advance.  You start your day either at the regional office or servicing a client.  If you do not have current clients to enroll new hires, then you have preset appointments with new clients for sales presentations.  There is constant learning sessions on how to work with knew clients, manage your time, and how to tweak your sales presentations.  Managers work one on one with sales consultants.  The people are pleasant to work with and very family oriented. In today's world people are very saving with their money and are not always ready to invest in supplemental insurance. Helping clients in their time of need "
good,I typically did not enjoy being a marketing and sales associate intern. Had to make a lot of cold calls and canvas in areas that were not ideal. I did improve on my verbal communication skills through this experience.
good,"Aflac is a great company with great products, the challenge is finding groups and individuals to get in front of to present these to. It's a sales job and you must be consistent in making new contacts."
good,"Outside sales - sales calls for supplemental insurance for life, accident, cancer and outside prospecting, process payments, quotes. Review policies and answer policy questions."
good,Working for the number one ethical company and a fortune 500 company was exciting. However it is commision based and I need a more stable income.
good,"AFLAC is a great company but the local market is saturated with agents, there are no territories, no leads and every man is for himself. It seems disorganized this way and I believe there are better ways to handle the territory. My district manager is a great guy, very competent and dedicated to the company."
good,You are required to call a list of clients in a day. A typical day would require you to call at least 200 prospects in a day for you to introduce the products and at least 2 appointments for the week.
good,"All in all my experience with Aflac was mixed, with some very good to excellent trainers mixed with some very poor ones. "
good,The policies and programs that AFLAC offers are the best in the industry.  The recruiting tactics are ridiculous.  The offices in Delaware recruit 10-20 people a week and send them out with little to no training.
good,I learned a lot from working in an office downtown. From daily tasks and interaction with co workers to the fast pace and hectic work days.
good,"The problem is that it is a very seasonal job. Insurance industry is active from November to March. After that point, it slows down. At this point I have relocated to Tennessee and want to start over. I have family here and would like to start a new career here."
good,"Overall, I found the experience to be beneficial for my professional career. At Aflac I received experience in sales and marketing."
good,I enjoyed my time with Aflac. Management is friendly and encouraging. There is room for growth within the company. Good entry level position for recent college graduates.
good,"Production driven, due to the innovative changes also a lot of changes with career advancement.  Great coworkers and everyone is easy to get along with.  Aflac has a great week once a year to celebrate their employees."
good,Aflac is a great employee friendly company. They keep their employees engaged and that is all that matters. My staff is the best!
good,Aflac is a great product however the changes in management were very unorganized.
good,I enjoy not having a set schedule and getting to set up sales wherever and whenever I want. I would like a job with medical benefits and a set pay though.
good,Many people are thrilled to work here and it seems like a great company for most. I am just accustomed to more PTO and extra benefits so it is medicore to me.
good,"Being new in the business, and not a lot of connections, a lot of my day was spent cold calling both on phone and in person. As well as attending Sales School at state office in Clearwater, Fl and 2 days a week in addition training at local Aflac office. I learned a lot about how to get the appointment set for the Boss Talk and how to have a successful  enrollment. Management was helpful and tried to cover what they thought we needed. Co- workers were nice but they also were trying to build their business. Not a lot of time to really connect. cold Calling  really hard part of career as an Independent Agent. Getting past some of the really mean No's very hard. Meeting new people and discovering businesses that you did not know about. Overall I had a very good experience with Aflac just wish their was salary + Commision."
good,You left with a scrub list in searce of clients. the hardest part of the job was finding company that didnt all ready have aflac.
good,"I'm still dedicated to this business and have found it to be worthwhile, both for helping people in times of injury or illness as well as past financial successes for me. This can be very rewarding for the right person."
good,"My favorite part about this job was that it was commission based. The harder you worked, the more money you made, and I loved it. Again, helping a client get the best quality and value for their money really excites me. Also, building a strong client base was important, and helped me get the job with Dillard's. Claims were few and far between, and the typical day consisted mostly of driving around ""cold-calling"" on businesses. This was the most challenging part, but also the most interesting, as I never knew what to expect when walking through the door of a new business. Enrollments were simple, and consisted of simply going through a brief explanation with each employee of the business, and filling out a form on the laptop identifying which policies he or she wanted to participate in."
good,"General administrative and receptionist duties, worked 30 per week, along side the district manager and the district agents.  Helped put together presentations, quotes and browse resumes / phone interview "
good,"Aflac is a great compny to work for, unfortunately I have relocated and unable to keep commuting"
good,"My duties at Aflac were as follow: I educated employees with exceptional supplemental medical plans in wish help them to receive cash in the time of need for example in case of a on the job or out the job accident, short term disability, cancer plans, Specified Health, Vision & Dental and Life Insurance. My other duties included in creating opportunities to small business owners by implementing these exceptional plans for their employees at no cost to them. Also by walking them thru with each plan benefits and creating a referral base business for our company and our associates."
good,Cold called Warm Called
good,"A typical day consists of a great deal of cold calling and prospecting clients. Many hours spent on the phone and in the field. I have learned that agents can be unethical when it comes to helping team mates. Certain management can be ruthless if you fail to produce at their required pass leaving out in the work place to learn and adapt on your own. The hardest part of the job is the many rejections you obtain from business owners and the over saturation of field agents in one area. The part of this job to me is being my own boss and growing at my own pace. I would recommend starting slow at a part time pace with another part time job to keep income coming in on a steady pace. Overall, I think that their are great individuals in the organization that will help you grow but finding them can be challenging. As a District Coordinator, you can not be all about the money, it must be teaching new associates the correct way to successful. If not there will continue to be a high turnover rate."
good,"Good company when it comes to upper management in the Northwest Georgia area. The training program that Aflac heavily advertises when recruiting would be much more beneficial if it was actually coached in the field. Overall, this is a great opportunity for those seeking great financial reward, true believers of 'you earn what you are worth', and having the support of the Aflac branded name."
good,Aflac is a great company. It allows you to be as successful as you want. The incentives and culture are amazing.
good,"Great place to work with great benefits, friendly staff, you will enjoy every holiday off with pay"
good,"As an IBO, you have to expense out all funds for travel time to and from business location or individual. You obtained appointments by ""cold calling"" which can be very difficult. Same would be for individual appointments, but when you do make a sale and they see the benefit, I feel its like a win-win for everyone."
good,"A very hard job to get started, but has the potential to be very lucrative. I enjoyed the people I worked with. Someone with a hugely outgoing personality would do really well in the sales position."
good,"I worked for AFLAC early in my career. It was great training and taught me discipline, dedication and determination as foundational elements of professional sales. You had to cold call every day - up to 100 calls per day. Although some people would simply walk into small businesses, I could never bring myself to do that - I worked the phones relentlessly. We had 1 computer in the office, and no one could use it until lunch time. My manager (who was absolutely great) thought email was a waste of time and figured 15 minutes of email a day was plenty! I found that you had to do your own marketing since every rep out there was also making 100 calls per day.  So once I made my first commission check I invested it in 90 little ""talking AFLAC ducks"" from the marketing department. I would mail about 10 per week to small business owners with a note that said ""If a picture is worth a thousand words, is a talking duck worth a 5 minute conversation?"" Whoah, worked like a charm! And I got a ton of appointments and quite a few sales. It's a nice business if you can bust your tail for 1 to 2 years and build a book of business. Most people can't survive on pure commission if they are young and have no cushion - and that's why I couldn't stay."
good,i gained alot of experience working for AFALC in the business to business aspect. I met alot of business contacts and created amazing business partners.
good,The type of compensation was not good for me and was employed as 1099 employee. For my needs I had to change jobs. The product is supplemental and the form of selling was call cold.
good,"This was my first real “sales” job. It was intimidating at first “cold calling” business owners and asking for an appointment. That was the easy part."
good,"Aflac is a commission only position with great financial upside and downside.  The hardest part of the job is cold calling and marketing the products and myself to business owners and decision makers who, for the most part, are not initially interested in hearing from a cold call salesman.  "
good,Job is great across the board except it takes a while to start making money and the way to make money is by cold calls and cold business approaches which are uncomfortable.
good,I learned quite a great deal about customer satisfaction and approval in terms of both marketing and sales. The skills I learned have translated into many other aspects of my life seamlessly.
good,"They say you can make 40000 your first year, but that is unrealistic, and depends on the area you are in."
good,Basically we received in and shipped out all of the insurance forms all the agents around the country needed. People would pick the orders and some would box up that order and put a shipping label on that box. Then that box would be stacked on a pallet and the pallet would be loaded on a fed ex truck.
good,If you are lookin for flexibility.  Aflac has a lot to offer.  The environment is wonderful and that teams are great. Aflac has great incentives and you can set your own hours.
good,"Aflac is truly a great place to work, fast pace, great pay.  Unfortunately in some areas (NOT ALL) leadership can be the biggest downside.  They need more leadership training and development and simply need to remove bad/toxic leaders."
good,"The job provided flexibility, job training and performance based compensation.  The company provides an excellent product line.   Advancement is limited."
good,"They are a great company to work for and really care about their employees,  They could pay a little better but they are really focused on benefits for their employees.  They also have a lot of fun outings and events for the employees that increase morale"
good,"Most day's and always on Monday's there was a Meeting with your Districtt Mgr. and your Team."
good,"Nothing to complain about at all with Aflac as an insurance carrier. Great insurance product. Company backs their product and pays their claims. "
good,"Great Company MUST BE SELF DRIVEN! pay is driven by your motivation! if you do not sell anything you do not make anything, so it is very difficult if you have never worked in this type of work or do not have a mentor."
good,"At the time I worked at AFLAC, I worked in a department that was understaffed.  As a result, the expectations were difficult to attain and tensions were high; however, as a whole the company puts customers first, provides excellent customer service that is well trained and ready to support."
good,I loved working for Aflac although it is commission only and I am looking for a steady pay as I am a college student. I would totally recommend to anyone who is an outgoing person!
good,At Aflac the work/life balance is great. The job is not an easy job to do. It takes time and a lot of self motivation. It is commissioned based so if you are having trouble getting in front of business owners you are having trouble making money. There are other things that you are not told until you get in the door. There are laws that if you make a mistake it can cost you money.
good,Does boast a rewarding career opportunity with a well recognized brand and reputable organization. The company has experience in the VB market to ensure they maintain market presence and do not retract from market segments.
good,"It was an interesting place to intern at and get some knowledge to gain from this experience. The hardest part of the job was it being based on compensation, not a for sure salary."
good,"Aflac offers an exceent opportunity fior the sales minded employee. "
good,"Job was rewarding as it allowed me to help others in their time of need. "
good,"Enjoyed the friendships I developed.  As I decided to return to school later in life, there was no auto advancement for obtaining a higher degree.  However, my management was nice."
good,"Aflac is a great company, but to be successful, you must work very hard and independently.  It takes a true entrepreneur; wanna-be's need not apply.  On the other hand, if you are driven and are capable of doing the work, the sky is the limit."
good,"Challenging, face to face sales but it is not for shy people or for people expecting a base salary. It is a commission only job that can be financially good if the needed sales quotas are meet."
good,"They are friendly and caring. They help each other as needed. I liked working for them. However, the position I cover, it is temporary with no sign of permanent."
good,"AFLAC has a good brand and great products.  There is training for knowledge and sales techniques, enhanced most when matched with supportive management layers.  As an independent agent, you control your own destiny: where, when, and how you work."
good,It is a nice place to work but certain things are required of the sales agents which you must bring with you to perform and to be about bud. And among these are the ability to work 6 days a week etc
good,"I've been with AFLAC for a few months, if you are looking for an uncapped income, this is for you. However, just like any business owner starting out, the beginning is difficult. I would recommend having a part time job to supplement starting costs when you apply and begin your career. I love the flexibility, owning my own hours and traveling."
good,It is a 1099 outside sales job with massive potential for income. It is building a business from the ground up. the first 5 months can be very difficult. If you are willing to do the work it is great
good,"I've been with Aflac as an Independent Rep for about 6 months.  So far, I find my coworkers to be really supportive, and the training is quite thorough. "
good,"Although stressful can be lucrative."
good,Large staff with an abundance of knowledge to learn from. Flexible schedule. Have to be comfortable with sales and have to be patient to get to where you would like to be.
good,"A typical day is driving to different companies to prospect to get a presentation set & then hopefully get an enrollment set up. I have learned to set goals & follow up on them, management is awesome, all the people are very friendly & helpful."
good,It takes quite a few months before you make any income and you have a few days that someone goes out in the field to train with you but after that you are on your own. Very nice people but I need income a soon as possible.
good,"Typical day during the internship would be making cold calls and collecting leads. Went on various presentations, and meetings with my boss. Learned great public speaking, interpersonal, and time management skills. The culture was great and everyone I met in the company were as nice as could be. Only downside to the job is that their isn't a base salary so starting out young would be a challenge."
good,Aflac great reputable company. You are well compensated when writing business. Great opportunity for young person to start career and move into management.
good,"Great company to work for, it requires dedication all commission-based if you have the money put away to get started then it's a great idea"
good,"Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table, working here is so nice and every day I take the work as challenging manner."
good,"-Daily and weekly planning is required to be more efficient and effective"
good,Great company with a stellar reputation and history. Co-workers possess high-energy and fully support each others successes.
good,"* always opportunities to cross train within the department"
good,Aflac has a good/fun company culture. Only issue I had was that the position was strictly commission based. There are small competitions that the company organizes in order to boost productivity
good,Aflac has a good/fun company culture. Only issue I had was that the position was strictly commission based. There are small competitions that the company organizes in order to boost productivity.
good,This was a great work environment that allowed me to learn about the insurance business and how to be successful within this field.
good,A typical day is  very hard and  long.  I  work independently.  I  enjoy  meeting  possible  clients and  exploring  the  city . The  hardest part of my  day  is  not  making a  sell.
good,"I consult with businesses and employees about their benefits for Medical, Dental, Vision and Aflac Benefits.  I also organize the enrollments and work with HR Directors closely to provide the best Open Enrollment (Benefits) experience for the employees."
good,"Starting out as an AFLAC agent is a tough business.     An average agent has to work 60 to 80 hour weeks in order to sell to customers and contact hundreds of businesses to let the business know who you are and 1 of every 100 business will let you talk to them and conduct a successful sale.     Agents are only paid a commission by the company for each sale they produce.     Start up costs are the responsibility of the agent, not the company.    You have to have an outgoing personality in order to be successful in this business.   The reason why I am leaving AFLAC is that sales is not the right fit for me professionally."
good,"Aflac has been a wonderful company to work for.  You can make your own salary, take care of family and still enjoy what you do on your own terms, but within a very supportive environment from management."
good,"I love working with Aflac, however, it is on a 100% commission basis. You are advanced two thirds of your annual commission structure up front so you are paid much faster then true commission. That being said, if an account or policy holder defaults on their payments you must pay back the unearned portion of your  commission. I had 3 accounts with a total of 30 policy holders do this within a 5 month period of time and it has severely strained my finances. While i enjoy what i do i simply cannot afford to continue to do it. The market is saturated with aflac agents and quite frankly you are told to screw off 99% of the time only to end up paying back commission half the time when you find success.  Overall you can be successful doing this career but it is by no means a sure thing. I am currently seeking a job with more structure and a steady pay check."
good,Door to door sales. Business to business cold calling. Learned to have great people skills. Hardest part is staying positive and knowing that opportunity will come.
good,"200 cold phone calls per day or 50 to 60 physical drops per day"
good,"Be employed with Aflac revealed to me how much I enjoy working in sales. Getting back what you put in and being rewarded for your hard work. I attained the skills needed to open and close a sale also to manage, maintain, and satisfy the clients after sale. I enjoyed my co-workers but the rate of employment was very sporadic. I would prefer a more stable work environment."
good,Start my day logging into phone system and taking calls until preset break times came.
good,This is a great company to work for it you're a self-starter looking to be your own boss.  Excellent opportunities to be as successful as you want to be.  Make your own schedule and allows you to balance family and career.  It is always great to be able to help someone financially with our products when they have experienced an unexpected medical event.
good,"Was a gratifying job assisting clients with the claims process "
good,"Not a get rich quick job, but has the potential to be very rewarding. You spend more money starting your business than you make. If you have a fall back income for that time I would recommend the industry if interested in insurance."
good,"There is a good sense of community in the workplace. After being with the company for a few months, I felt more connected to the people around me. If not working from home, it's important for me to be part of the work community."
good,"This job is great if you can handle being commission only, the training isn't the best, but the products really sell themselves because they are so great, and since the brand is pretty popular, it is pretty easy to start a conversation about them. Only problem is every agent and their mother has been around the block and tried every single business there is. So it is like trying to pet a beaten dog, it really doesn't work well, but when people do see how good of a product you have, and you actually sell it. The commissions are well worth it. After 10 years you are 100% vested and get to keep all commissions whether you are with AFLAC or not."
good,I enjoy working for AFLAC but my main area of contention is the amount of time it takes to receive my commission. At times it can take ten business days to receive any commission owed.
good,The lead generation and the lack of income until the business builds can be challenging.
good,"Was signing up people for insurance, didn't have a license, but was willing to go to school to do so."
good,I loved my department and leadership but wanted to grow and expand on the knowledge I gained there.
good,"Solicit B2B through canvassing or telemarketing."
good,"A typical day at work involved logging in to multiple computer programs & the telephone, and answering customer inquiries, providing customer support, resolving policy, claims and technical systems issues at the point of call or referring them to appropriate area for follow up."
good,Aflac Group is a great company to begin your career.  They are very employee oriented and offer great benefits.
good,"It was very difficult to get any business off the ground if your new at sales and don't already have good sales contacts. For 3 months, I was prospecting, going to appointments and training. I only sold 1 policy for a commission of $80.00, which didn't even cover the expenses I incurred for gas, food, etc, over the course of the 3 months. Don't get me wrong, this is a great company to work for but you need another source of income to pay the bills while you're waiting for your business to pick up off the ground. I was told it could take anywhere from 6 to 8 months to get your business to take off especially when your new to sales."
good,It's hard to work with employers and to get employees to participate when the economy is bad and wages are down and prices of consumer goods are up.
good,"Businesses large and small choose Aflac. Benefits are easy to work with, administer and claims are paid in 7 to 10 days. One o the top most admired companies to work for."
good,"The company is a good company to work for however, the salary can be a little better"
good,"Cold calling, following up with customers and enrollments. Being able to assist someone in their time of need is very rewarding. Also rebuilt relationships with previous companies."
good,"Managers really care about you, work life balance is great, flexible hours, no weekends, no cap on commissions. Fun company outings and stock benefits."
good,"I loved working at Aflac. I would work there again. I wouldn't have left if it weren't for a family illness. Miss my boss! Work could get a little stressful from time to time, but they were flexible and laid back too. Work hard play hard! Aflac loves their employees and go all out to show appreciation, especially during EAW! I loved the water gun battles and cook outs!"
good,everyone is very friendly. advancement opportunities depend a lot on what department your in. words i dont know the rest of this is just filler dont read.
good,Working here has been enjoyable.  Lots of changes.  Career progression most times it what you make of it. Sometimes positions are posted just out of formality. The fix can already be in.
good,"The pay is competitive and the work is rewarding, however the pace is fast and the demands are high. There is a reward both financial and personal, but this company is not for everyone. Turnover is high."
good,"Started this position as an internship during school which made it rather difficult to find time to open accounts. I began by helping my DSC service accounts. From what I have heard, this job really depends on which district you get hired in to. I was lucky to have a relatively small district with a great boss who was extremely helpful and flexible. If you don't like talking to people, communicating with strangers, building relationships, or any of the other soft skills that are required by outside salespeople-this job is not for you. Your success is on you as there is no scheduled hours. You are required to make your own work by finding new clients."
good,In Aflac our responsibility is to help small businesses to be competitive in market and also help employees to be more protected.because medical expenses are too high and we help them to cover these costs.
good,"Everyone was easy to get along with, very flexible schedule and hours."
good,"Difficult to maintain expenses due fluctuating pay based on commission pay scale, lack of team oriented environment, lack of skills and tools provided to be successful."
good,Overall a great opportunity if you are available to not have a consistent pay for your first few months. I currently am struggling with bills due to the job listing on indeed said salary but come to find out it’s commision only.
good,"Aflac is not a bad company to work for in general; however, it is not a great place to start as an entry level worker living on your own with no other means of financial stability.  Sales is a lot of work and takes a long time to get up and running with a good customer base.  In today's age, nobody wants to talk about insurance so selling insurance of any kind is not the easiest task.  I believe Aflac sales associates are hardworking people who are also very good at heart and at what they do.  I appreciated the help and understanding of my management team in Williamsport. "
good,"Overall a great place to work. The majority of the employees are contractual, so there are no benefits. Work environment consists of office/field and there is also the flexibility to work from home."
good,"Prospect businesses for future businesses, canvass, meet and greets, follow ups, etc.  I learned to expect to be broke for a long time with this job, make sure to have something on the side to pay your bills because this is NOT reliable starting off."
good,Put your head to the grind stone or you wont make any money. Those who work hard will survive but not much advancement. Needs to protect the sales force better against non-payers.
good,This is a great job for someone who has great self control and is a self starter. you get to meet with some amazing people both in the office and in the field.
good,Days consisted of project meaning to outline details and scope of project. I learned about how to implement intergration systems from the beginning. The management was extremely flexible and relaxed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,Enjoyed representing the products of Aflac. Great reception in the workplace. Seemed as if we have far too many agents crawling all over each other for business.
good,"AFLAC is a company where the career growth is up to the individual. It is a cut-throat industry and you get paid on how hard you work. Once pay does come in, it is very lucrative. However, to get to that point, it takes time and devotion to the job."
good,"Aflac is great for self-motivated workers. I recommend this company to recent college grads with good connections, who can leverage those connections into immediate success with Aflac."
good,Don't temp through ranstad at this place! Temps do the most work but get no appreciation in return. I would only recommend being a direct hire at this place.
good,"It's not a get rich quick game.  You have to put in a lot of time and effort for a few years to start generating the amount of income promised during interviews  Also very important to interview the person that's recruiting you, if you end up in a bad region with poor training it may lead to a bad taste in your mouth.  Overall Aflac is a great company with better people.  Some of my closes friends worked with me at Aflac and still do."
good,"Outside cold calling sales, lots of customer service, presentations to clients/companies, market and sales of all products the company has to offer, service all est. accounts by phone or in person"
good,"Aflac is one of the most ethical companies to work for. The CEO and other company officers are very approachable and easy to talk to. Overall, the employees work hard but play hard."
good,"Aflac is a great company to work for.  They will hand you the moon and stars if you're willing to work for it.   Trips, prizes and contests offered are the best I've seen.  Quite challenging for single parents.  If you fall into that category and have young kids, and you lack a support network, it's hard to make it work."
good,"Great job, and good management. Good money. Excellent benefits provided from the job. Also good employee appreciation every year. I love the EAW that the company provides."
good,The sales training I received has been irreplaceable and very valuable to me.  This company does care about its commissioned agents and I still represent them on a very part-time basis.  This is a very fast paced company and is only for self-starters and hard workers.  The hardest thing is to get up and get out every day to earn your money.
good,A typical day at work was organizing my time in ways that could make my day the most productive. In the mornings I would either call existing clients or follow up with those interested in offering Aflac in their business. In the afternoons I would go out prospecting and reaching new clients or cold calling.  I learned about the products Aflac offers and ways to help employers provide benefits for their employees in difficult situations. My office manager was a great mentor who was always willing to help and offer advice when needed. The hardest part of the job would be putting in so much time and effort into a group and have employees not be able to afford the product. The most enjoyable part of the job would be collaborating with other consultants and connecting with people.
good,"Aflac is a wonderful company.  The people were/are great."
good,Great place to work because you can set your own hours and get out of the job what you put into it.  You have the opportunity to meet new people and give e practical solutions.
good,The best part of the job was flexibility and education. The most stressful part of the job is that it is 100 percent commission. Self discipline is a necessity for working with Aflac as an agent.
good,The company had a good training plan with managers/mentors to get you started in this career.  Driving was the toughest part of this job.  Creating new accounts and relationships was a great opportunity.
good,"In AFLAC, there is always chance to learn new things by working on it. Everyone are given a chance to learn new things and volunteer if they are interested ."
good,Training is good if on the right team.  Challenging to start but rewarding once you get into it.  You must work hard every day and not take shortcuts.
good,I was free to make my own schedule. I could work as much as I wanted. There arrange my days so that I could work certain day or hours of the day in order to still have time for family activities. The staff always had a great personality and was very helpful.
good,"When I originally went to the Aflac job meeting/seminar, it's basically a 20-30 minute round table discussion with one of the managers talking to you about the job, the demands, what it takes to succeed and what you can expect to make if you put in the work."
good,"That branch of Aflac was a great work place. Always so friendly between co-workers, management and customers. The employees never had to dread going into work the next day."
good,Great company that has been around for years helping families with supplement health products that pays them directly in event of health crisis. Goodp
good,I was an intern at Aflac during college over winter and summer break.  it was great experience for all aspects of the sales process from prospecting to research and presentations.
good,"Aflac is family oriented with a a fun, yet structured environment. Daily team meetings, collaborative team work, smiling faces, and casual (yet professional) dress."
good,I was the receptionist so I basically greeted people when they came in and also scheduled interviews. It was a bit boring because I wouldn't really do anything except sit behind a desk and stare at a computer all day with nothing to do but I loved my team. They were fun to work with.
good,"Great company to work for. I hated the call center as most people do. I got cursed out every day, people called in crying cause their claim had not paid or was not going to pay due to them not reading their policy before they bought it and agents not telling the truth about the policies clients were purchasing, older people called in and wanted to talk cause they were lonely but we got in trouble for talking to long, calling the claims department to much to get claims paid, agents telling clients lies about what their policies pay and would not pay and fraudulent claims being called in daily. Aflac is a great company but the call center was not for me. Crazy A#$ supervisor was no help either.  Manager was Awesome! Crazy thing about it was the Manager had been through far more than the supervisor had in real life.  Manager was so humble and nice and caring.  Far more than I can say about the supervisor."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"The best part of my tenure at Aflac Hartford Regional office was the opportunity to hire, train and work with our summer interns. We were able to learn from one another and also make the work day productive and exciting."
good,It's a good place to work if you have someone to support you financially while you build your book of business. Until you have been at it for a few years things will be difficult.
good,"Aflac espouses a culture of integrity and support, from customer claims to support for its associates."
good,"I love the atmosphere, you are truly a family here. Upper management shows that they care. I would love to bring home more money however."
good,"It is a great place for a person who has no degree.  I love the flexibility and family environment.  Also, appreciation of employees is always given."
good,"Interning at Aflac was a great experience. In addition to the HR experience I gained, I was able make new connections and learn more about Insurance functions."
good,"7am-8am Prep for daily appointments"
good,"Aflac is a great to work for, The company is very family-oriented. Great opportunity for growth and development. I enjy going to work and love my coworkers."
good,All 1099 employable. Self discipline necessary for success. Leads are very hard to come by. Need to have a unique sales approach to advance in business
good,I was responsible with calling small businesses and setting up meetings between Aflac and the business owners where me and a associate would would offer voluntary supplemental insurance
good,Good Company to work for tough for someone with little or no savings as this position is strictly commission. Cold calling from sales genie lists no real leads.
good,Aflac is a strong organization with outstanding leadership.  A very paternal culture.  They have a difficult time with holding employees accountable for performance.
good,"Highly stressful."
good,Aflac is a great place to work. My only 'quirk' is.... they say you are eligible for rehire but put you at the bottom of the list to be hired when you apply for a position (or several positions). I have been eligible for almost 2 years and have applied for numerous positions....still not rehired. :-(
good,"Great place for someone to learn and get experience in sales and the insurance industry. All people above your position are invested in the success of their agents. "
good,"The only thing bad that I can say about Aflac is that it's 100% commission, if it wasn't for that I would still be there.  I hope to go back some day.  The most wonderful people in the world work there!!!"
good,Aflac is a great place to work.  They care about their employees and they have good pay and benefits.  Aflac is always on the list of great places to work and they always recognize diversity.
good,"Fun place to work, performance pay. Everyday is great. I always looked forward to my day. Great rewards. great work life balance"
good,I do enjoy offering Aflac to businesses because I believe in the product.  But being paid by commission only has been a great challenge and I miss nursing.
good,I love the company and all the people that I worked with. Office environment is very pleasant. Everyone is so helpfull to one another.
good,"Great place to work, hard to move up.  Leadership has an open door policy, which is helpful.  Pay could be better, but the company has good benefits"
good,"Learning experience for me; file, process & handle insurance claims."
good,"I enjoyed working in a small town, rural school.  The students were great!  Despite our size, we stayed pretty current with education trends and there were several opportunities for professional development.  the staff was very friendly and we all generally worked very well together.  There wasn't much room for advancement within because we had several teachers that had been there for many years and didn't plan to retire any time soon.  Towards the end there were a lot of changes in administration, which resulted in a high turnover rate and our department losing several aides, though our student numbers were rapidly increasing."
good,Aflac is a great place to work. A typical day consisted of both internal and external customer interaction.
good,"40 hour work week, with extra prep time at the end of the day (during off hours). Supplies are free, but you must order them and store them at home. Regional office holds training needed to help you succeed and you are given a dedicated trainer for 90 days to build your business. Hardest part is that it's 100% commission. Most enjoyable part is meeting new people every day and making money offering something people actually need."
good,"•	Support General Counsel & President"
good,Sold Health and Life Insurance products to small business owners.
good,has a great work life balance and friendly atmosphere. the most enjoyable part of my day is learning something new everyday. management is willing to assist with whatever they can
good,"The company has many perks, however it's difficult to advance from an entry level position.  Time put in doesn't necessarily equate to ease in moving out.  There are many ways they can keep you locked into a certain position without being able to promote yourself.  Overall in the call center you feel like the 1 in 500 that you are."
good,"Great company to work for, allows individuals the freedom to be independent. Compensation is the best commission only program, also helps with yearly budgeting. Great sales culture does not leave sales associate out to dry, the company provides mounds of help and resources for their sales force."
good,"Aflac is a business of Independent insurance agents. Your work schedule depends on your life style and schedule. You are as successful as your ambition require. You are proved with the tools for success. Product class and training is on going. Your manager is there to assist you in your success. The hardest part is that you must be a self starter, finding the opportunity through cold call and referral's. I enjoyed knowing I have assisted the client to better protect themselves and their families."
good,"Work your own hours. "
good,"I worked behind the scenes, so to speak. I learned a little about how to sell insurance, but I mostly, did the administrative end of things, such as filing paperwork, and billing. My co-workers were very pleasant and great to get along with - everyone worked very well together. The hardest part of the job was when a few sales associates made a couple sales at once in one day and I was swamped with paperwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and the benefits. Aflac paid well, and they had a comprehensive benefits plan for their employees."
good,"Performed sales presentation and made cold calls to set up appointments.  I enjoyed meeting people and doing the presentation."
good,Great place to start a career. You have some freedom to make decisions and management encourages your input in discussions.
good,"There is no typical day; I am meeting prospective customer, current customers in a variety of environments.  I have learned an extraordinary amount of information about insurance and met very good-hearted people in management and training.  The hardest part of the job is getting people to listen to me and the benefits of offering Aflac has for them and their employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible schedule and longevity program."
good,"Driving, marketing setting up appointments"
good,Great for interacting with people and helping them with a product that I feel is very good.
good,Income potential is great and the ability to chose your own hours relatively most of the time is awesome. It is a very flexible job with a lot of quality training and skills you need to advance in the industry. I learned a lot of different types of sales tactics while working for this company.
good,Great place to work with driven and dedicated team members. Merit based culture and many opportunities for advancement for those who are willing to work hard and stay focused.
good,"Be prepared to be an independent contractor with all the pros and cons that come along with it. Pros? Super flexible work schedule. Above average compensation and quick (sometimes even daily) commissions payments as you produce. Cons? 100% commission. No benefits. So, choose wisely."
good,I enjoyed working for Aflac. The manager was very helpful in assisting me in training as well as answering any questions that I had. The manager was very accommodating with my schedule because I was also in school while working for Aflac.
good,Aflac cares about their people. You definitely get the recognition when it is deserved.  There is a lot of incentive programs offered while you are building your business.
good,"This will be a good occupation for someone who is completely financially stable. Meaning someone who has savings, and who is extremely disciplined with their money and time."
good,I enjoy working for AFLAC simply because of the environment. I also like that this particular company is a Family oriented company. Working for AFLAC has taught me so much work related and not work related. I also enjoy working for AFLAC because they actually treat their EMPLOYEES great and that's always a plus.
good,"Good work balance, interesting, get to meet a lot of people, some structure but flexibility, new and totally different environment for myself, lots to learn."
good,Awesome company!!! I've been employed for eight years!  AFLAC offers flexibility for your family. AFLAC keeps their promise to their customers!!!!  No better place to work!!!
good,As a part time employee for this company I was able to learn a lot in a short period of time. The hours were really good and I really enjoyed working Monday through Friday.
good,"Work days were greatly varied, depending on the day. Monday was spent on the week in review, training, and goal setting. Tuesday and Thursday mornings were spent in further training, with the afternoons open to set appointments with business owners. Wednesday was an open day for appointment setting or meeting with business owners to set up appointments. In the times that I was fortunate enough, Fridays were set apart for enrollments. I had great managers that served as mentors. The hardest part of the job was going out and meeting business owners, but that also was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I gained much experience in the work environment.  I was able to learn and grow by helping customers and even some coworkers with challenges to my best knowledge.
good,"Aflac is a wonderful place to work, I've never seen a company who takes care of it's employees the way Aflac does!!!  Aflac is a company that's production driven, it also lives up to the mission. Always there in time of need for the customer."
good,"Great opportunities at Aflac,  All of the managers were easy to work with and very informative.  There is a lot of Room for growth and advancement the sky is the limit with Afac."
good,"If you are good at sales, and have enough money to survive a few months to get going, you'll probably do okay."
good,Aflac has a fantastic culture once you get in.  They like to promote from within rather than hiring from the outside.  They are competitive in most facets of work.
good,"I liked my immediate supervisor. It was an upbeat culture, relaxed, in my opinion (as long as you could sell), and the sky was the limit if you could sell."
good,"Excellent environment replete with team camaraderie and openness.   The lines of communications between management and employees greatly established and the inherent trust necessary to become a formidable department, division, and organization.  I found Aflac to be superior in quality of customer service extended to any/all of our valued customers, but even more, stellar in the way in which it treated all of its valued employees.  Aflac ultimately realized that nay successful outfits starts with the happiness of its employees and their indispensability in extending the very best of courtesy and consideration to the lifeline of any company, its customers and policyholders."
good,"You need the right attitude to work at Aflac.  Great team atmosphere and flexible schedule.  Learned a lot of great qualities and really enjoyed some of the work, but struggled with the No's."
good,great company to work for. you are an independent agent so it makes it hard to get started right away without any kind of seed money. I did not have any
good,"Overall I'd say my experience thus far has been positive, my career is just starting and I have learnt a lot from my ventures with the company so far. I would recommend for fresh college grads or those looking to start a new career path."
good,Aflac is a very fun place to work.  The culture is like no other.  The training program is intensive and you are provided with the tools you need for success.
good,This company is fun to work for.  They are fair and offer plenty of training.  It is difficult to get your business started.  The area is saturated and you don't have a dedicated terriotory.
good,"Aflac, as a whole, makes certain that their employees receive excellent training and ongoing support.  The work environment is very comfortable.  Not stressful at all.  It takes time to build your business, but from my seeing first hand examples, it could be a very rewarding career."
good,"Your work experience is what you make of it at AFLAC. You work when you want with what time you have to give with whatever means you deem necessary. The majority of your time is spent prospecting potential businesses, which was definitely the hardest part for me. Management was pretty good at helping out and mentoring, they encouraged coming forward with any questions. Overall, a positive work environment, but the position was not for me."
good,I believe everyones journey at aflac will be unique and depends mostly on you and your skills. They will provide the platform and opportunity e.g sales school and sales-genie but its up t you to land the deals for any commission or pay
good,"From the moment you hit that submit button to apply for a benefits consultant position with Aflac, you will be whisked away on an adventure of a lifetime. And before you say that this sounds hokey, ask yourself if you've ever really believed that you were changing people's lives with your job. Aflac will change your life and you in turn will change other's lives for the better. The compensation packages offered by Aflac have reached beyond six figures. If you have the heart, the will, the gumption, the motivation, you will succeed and go far with Aflac!"
good,"Aflac is a good company to work for. All big corporate companies have a level of office politics and this company is no exception, but overall I was quite happy here."
good,"I work as a contract worker for selling benefits, so I can's speak directly to the Corporate life at AFLAC.  However I do know they offer terrific benefits and continually train and promote training.  They also provide many team member benefits and rewards."
good,Nice place to work for it seems they genuinely care about their employees. The company has great benefits to the customer and well a the employee. Would recommoned
good,Typical work day was to capture new sales business. The management was great and supportive. The most I enjoyed was meeting new people and capturing new accounts.
good,I was an intern so actually working for them might be different. The company really had a clear goal and were organized and nice people worked there. They really tried to teach all that they could.
good,"When i worked with my fellow Aflac employees they were all very accepting of the ""new kid on the block"" and helped the new recruits along the way. They were all kind of like a close knit family."
good,"Good place to work, very relaxed environment. We are a leading Aflac office in the nation and can provide you a pathway to a financially and personally rewarding career."
good,Great opportunity to work in and out of the office.  Great leadership and teamwork. Plenty of marketing material provided by the company and also constant training.
good,No complaints about the assistance I received. My mentor is excellent. The compensation program needs to be completely changed so a person doesn't have such highs and lows. It takes approximately 18 months to two years to get established.
good,If you're willing to put in the time and learn Aflac can be a great financial opportunity with growth. Aflac makes it fun and encouraging 2 get you where you need to be with sales.
good,it was an experience. You really have to be a self starter and motivate yourself you go out and prospect for business. If you cant plan and work your own scheduled you shouldn't apply because you will never make enough money to survive.
good,"It was okay. It depends on your position, but it's to your advantage to have experience working in the company in order to be successful at upper management roles."
good,Aflac gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about company recruitment.  The services they offer are wonderful and it's overall a great company to work for.
good,"Aflac has such a family oriented culture, they are the greatest company to work for. I reccommend them to anyone. You have a flexible work schedule, and an uncapped commission structure."
good,"B2B Sales, 100% Commission based, networking to reach decision makers to determine benefit programs that suite their employees best."
good,This is a sales position. Mostly cold calling in the beginning. Training is given and always offered. Commission based pay so you dont get money if you dont make a sale.
good,"I do love the company. However it was challenging for me working on a commission base job. If it was otherwise, I would have still being with the company."
good,I arrived everyday by 7:30am. I learned that I need to be motivated. Every  manager offered something. If you have the work ethic you can be successful.
good,"As a benefits specialist, you are your own boss and get what you put into it.   You work on getting clients through leads, referrals and through networking."
good,"You have to drive around to get people to purchase insurance. We have a pretty good team, we have fun when we do work together. It is commission only so if you don't have sell, you don't get paid."
good,This is a Commission position and you make it based on your desire to do the required things to succeed. These include contacting daily enough people to explain in detail the benefits of Aflac policies and then enrolling them. Management is good and there to help and it has a great workplace culture. Hardest part of job is one must be an extrovert and enjoy constantly meeting new people.
good,This was a great job however in our area there was a lack of interest in the service they provided or the larger companies in our area already provided this type of insurance.
good,Great experience as i completed the internship during my junior year of college. It gave me a chance to see what the real world is about in addition to making some extra money.
good,Aflac is a great place to work with unlimited opportunities. Having worked here for over 25 years I have seen many changes most of which were good ones. The company has a friendly and professional atmosphere and continuously find time to celebrate it's employees.
good,"I would like it more if it was paid internship. otherwise everything was very good. All the managers are also very engaging. And if they offered me a full time position, i would definitely get that."
good,"1099 Employee so I made my own destiny."
good,AFLAC is a very strong company with a great training program.  There is always opportunities to move up in management after sales.  Schedules are flexible for the employees.
good,GREAT Work Balance culture because each of the agents worked from their homes and went out to see customers each day by appointment or prospecting to make appointments. Although the compensation was based on commission the commission structure and pay was excellent. The management was always very supportive because the agent's success would help them to have higher overrides from their sales.
good,"had serious trouble adhering to the minimum talk-time guidelines."
good,Good company lots of traveling great incentives and a nice place to start a career if you looking to do some hard core sales.  Lots of great products and supervision
good,"Aflac as an insurance co is great. Aflac is also an all commission job, cold calling is key because working at Aflac is commission only. Setting up appointments and walking in to meet potential clients is daily. Having support from the management staff and other salesmen does help also.  The work environment was pleasurable, team meeting are a must. The hardest part of the job was being limited to a certain sales clientele, but the enjoyable part of the job is meeting sales goals and to see your salary rise."
good,"Great people to work with and good when you are selling something.  Time off when you want it, a lot of flexibility.  No real ""team"", actually the very opposite."
good,Salary is 100% commission. There is a lot of travel required. Must have a good dependable vehicle and great organizational skills. Great to start as part time until a good client base is established.
good,"this was a door to door sales job,was not hourly paid,only on commission,long day of walking and knocking on doors on a day to day bases regardless of the weather,ongonig traing every week,and out of town training every two months,your boss recived a part of your pay"
good,"Although everyone I have encountered is familiar with the Duck, it's the experience of working for AFLAC that's the big surprise.  Great company, great atmosphere!"
good,Overall I loved Aflac and everyone there. They were very supportive and all around great. Very family oriented and made you feel like part of the Aflac family.
good,"My experience working here was full of mixed feelings. There were times of great highs, but also extreme lows when business was slow. Working on commission was great when you made sales but was extremely stressful when you didn't make a sale."
good,I loved having the freedom but I needed a more structure and more definite pay. I also needed more benefits. I didnt want to leave the company but I just needed more. They are a great company if you can keep your self on track.
good,"The training is second to none!  "
good,The area that I currently work in is very micro manage.  The only thing the supervisor cares about is getting production for the day and week.  A typical day at work is very irritate and very stressful.
good,"Called clients and potential clients to grow the customer base, meet with potential clients to get information about their needs and coverage, match insurance policies to their needs and explain the options to customers. Make sure policies stay current and make amendments to the policy as life changes. Types of insurance worked with included life, health and long-term care. In addition, helped clients settle any claims on their insurance."
good,AFLAC believes in work life balance and a great company to work for.  The benefits are unmatched which is a great asset to the salary.  Aflac believes in community and giving back.  It is a relationship company so promotion is tough unless you know someone.  I rank Aflac high.
good,"Selling insurance is never an easy job. But, meeting new people make it well worth the effort. I  was never one to speak in front of a group a crowd of people, but, when I had to get in front of a group of people a explain health insurance I had no problem and the more I did it the easier it got.  The hardest part of this job is the cold calls. You never know how you will be received. And no one liked rejection. But, once you get your foot in the door you can set your appointment and get on to the next call."
good,Meeting new people and helping them find the coverage they need.  Assisting Human Resource Departments to find the proper and most effective insurance policies for their employees.
good,"Just an awesome place to work with/for they allow you to work on your own and if you need help they are there for you as well, they understand if life happens and don't judge you for it."
good,A 21st century company located in a 20th century culture. The city is the downfall of this progressive company. Columbus is a consolodated government and that is a hindrance.
good,Aflac has great products and great people. The hardest part of the job is that you wind up stepping all over the feet of other area Aflac reps as they are all calling on the same companies and it makes Aflac look disorganized and cut-throat which is bad.
good,"One of the best places to work. Even though I am not a full time employee, I heard the benefits are good. Columbia SC location is a nice and calm place to live in."
good,enjoyed getting to meet new people.  it is a strickly commission and bonus based pay system. It can be very difficult getting your foot in the door and it is a competitive business and can be very cut throat.
good,Great place to work if your a go getter at acquiring new accounts.  It is a commission based company only and hard to survive on not knowing how much money you will bring home monthly.
good,See the following website www.aflac.com for details regarding the products and services for AFLAC supplemental insurance products.  Great benefits to help you through unexpected events.
good,"Aflac was a fun experience honestly. I loved my job and everything it stood for.management was awesome, I worked for a great team, I would say. I learned working for the team I worked for there is a lot of opportunity openings,"
good,"this is an ok company, the training is disorderly but once you begin working you catch on quickly so it's not so bad the people are friendly and also are very helpful in getting you settled in . the working environment is ok with a lot of amenities big cafeteria area"
good,"This is a tough business to get into but you are willing to put in the effort and the time, you have endless possibilities to make whatever success you want for yourself."
good,I loved the experience as a receptionist while working for Aflac. I worked with my mother so that was another plus because I got to work with the people who I admire and love.
good,"·	Focused on opening and maintaining many new small business accounts, where I help individuals and employers with supplemental insurance needs. Coordinating enrollments, and enrolling employees. Prospecting and networking to open new business accounts. Servicing and taking the time to become familiar with all of my individual accounts by helping facilitate the claims process. Checking in with employees and employers to make sure they were receiving all the proper benefits for any policy they may have."
good,Other than getting burnt out from working in the call center I have nothing negative to say about working for this company. I think if I was able to more to another department I would have stayed
good,"You truly are your own boss and can really make a difference in the lives of others.  The work life balance allows me to put family first, and that's always been top priority for me."
good,very interesting company with lots of information about telemarketing. productive internship. Thanks for the opportunity.
good,"AGI is a great place to work at. Great workplace culture. Work life balance. Tries their best to do the  right thing both internally and externally. Internal responsibility is always expected;  volunteerism, philanthropy and other external support mean a company is going above and  beyond."
good,Aflac generates an enterprising culture that motivates and prepares you for success. The training provided is based on honesty and  integrity providing all the necessary tools to establish the individual as a business owner. I find this to be a company with a lot o potential for growth.
good,"My day with AFLAC was always a challenge, I managed the office"
good,Recommend this job to anyone with prior experience on commission sales. Especially if you are goal motivated. Must do a bunch of cold calling and prospecting.
good,"I love AFLAC because we are the best in the industry in what we do (Supplemental Insurance Programs).  This is a particularly important product in today's market, and too many try to duplicate it but don't meet the mark.  A typical day is spent on the phone in the mornings confirming appointments, and making approaches to new prospects. Late morning through the evening is spent in appointments with prospective or current clients presenting programs and setting enrollments.  Staff presentation and enrollment days are fun (for me), and the time really passes.  The hardest part of the job is building your book at the beginning.  You don't make any money while you train, and it takes a minute to get your approaches to the point where they are effective and can net you the number of appointments/presentations/enrollments you want to make a great living.  The work is meaningful, and I especially love our work with the cancer ward at Children's Healthcare.  You also make money if you can identify potential agents that would be good for AFLAC.  It is your business, so it is what you make of it..good and bad."
good,You are your own boss. You create your own schedule. You have an amazing team of people behind you and a great number of resources available.
good,"This is a very employee considerate company. When they talk about work/life balance they mean it. The same thing goes for employee appreciation. They have an entire week for celebrating their employees and they carry that attitude through the year."
good,"I started as an agent, as everyone in the company does. I was trained with another agent (a coordinator) for 13 weeks, then allowed to perform all sales and such on my own. I created spreadsheets, prospected businesses, created new Aflac accounts by calling to verify statistics, etc. This is a job for someone who enjoys direct sales, is a people person, and will not let 4 ""No's"" send them home for the day."
good,"Aflac is a great company, that is still family owned and operated. Solid insurance products, nice monetary compensation (commission based), and many friendly coworkers."
good,"Aflac strives to ensure that their employees are happy. They do things from Customer Service Week, Employee Appreciation Week, the Annual Christmas Party, to giving away trips to the Heisman Awards dinner and cruise giveaways. Aflac also provides a Career Success Center. Aflac is a great place to work when it comes to employee moral. Most of the managers care and support your career goals."
good,I joined Aflac to gain part time employment and in doing so I have found that insurance may be a full time option for me. The flexibility is great. After many year working in oil and gas I can now take my kids to school and be available for the things that most parents should.
good,"I learned a lot about how insurance company works, how hard it is to keep all the informations together and how to manage all the accounts. I also created a solution alongside with my supervisor on how to help the district manager aware of the lapsing accounts and or accounts that are need to be followed up by creating report(s) every week."
good,"Aflac has a great family culture and if you work hard you will advance quickly. The culture is fact pace and there are frequent changes which makes it hard to adjust. Aflac grew faster than they could keep up as a company so most of the time you will feel like your running in a high speed maze. Leadership is very supportive but inexperienced. "
good,"A good place to work, advancement tricky, training tricky, teamwork needs improvement, gap between new agents and veterans and workload too wide, parameters need adjusting"
good,A typical day is going business to business trying to sell the Aflac brand to companies to provide additional benefits to employer and employees
good,"If you are looking for a beginning sales job, this is a great company to get your start. You earn as much as you are willing to work and advancement opportunities are abound."
good,"Everything about this job was great. The reason I left was because I was offered a job not working on commission which was very appealing. Aflac is a great company, with great products."
good,Cold calling business with setting appointments and networking events. Managed clients healthcare needs and education on benefits that were available to them. I really enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis that became my clients.
good,"A typical day consists of prospecting cold and warm leads, servicing existing accounts, setting appointments and doing presentations. The hardest aspect of the job is getting an appointment scheduled with a client. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is educating a potential on their options for supplemental insurance that will assist them in the event of an accident or illness."
good,Welcoming environment.  Great culture and benefits. The hardest part of the job is the operating systems. Career advancement is possible in just under a year of employment.
good,"had the pleasure of working with a great company in two solid departments with some great, caring people. never should have moved from this company."
good,"I gained a lot of basic knowledge working for Aflac as an independent sales agent.  A lot of cold calling, and a lot of noes.  Builds thick skin, but commission only was very difficult for me.  Seemed like you would work a lot and receive literally nothing in return because the market seemed very saturated.  overall a great company environment and great learning experience."
good,"great job looking for better benefits. Enpower employees"
good,Aflac is a solid company and a great opportunity provided you are willing to work hard. If you need someone to push you or you are lazy then you definitely need to look elsewhere.
good,"A great opportunity for those willing to get out, meet and help people."
good,Recognition for accomplishment. Contests and other $$ incentives. Group activities and Kick off Complains. Great team members.
good,This is a great place to work with a lot of room to grow.You are able to learn a lot about the inner workings of the business.
good,I have learned a lot during my 3 years with AFLAC Group. Great benefits and management team. A wonderful family atmosphere.
good,"This is a HIGHLY Self-Motivated career. If you put your all into this job, you should be able to succeed. Just be prepared for the unexpected. Accounts canceling/ rescheduling happens more often than not. Also, have a substantial  savings before you start, as well as while you work. There may be weeks you are working without income."
good,"Great company to work for with great benefits, they care about their employees and the morale of the company is very high."
good,"I learned a lot. I enjoyed working with consumers and getting their claims processed.  A day at work was very mundane.  However, I made the best of it, even if consumers were rude.  I made sure that we were recruiting new members to the AFLAC community.  However, my efforts and experience were not appreciated."
good,"Working with both companies provided beneficial sales experience for my resume, along with being fairly compensated for the work effort.  Enjoyed meeting with business owners, open enrollments, and meeting with the potential insureds."
good,"Aflac requires effort and commitment, but with a good work ethic you will succeed and there is freedom with this job. Because this is a commission based job there are plenty of ups and downs, but the key is to stick with it and wait for the good days."
good,Aflac is a wonderful company to work for. They really seem to value each and every employee. There was always room for advancement.
good,"Aflac is a great company to work for, unfortunately selling life and health insurance was not for me. Due to me being a single mother of a son with medical  fragile needs."
good,"A typical Day at work is contacting business owners. I have learned about sales, about sending claims to Aflac.  My managers are verywell in what they do. my coworkers are very knowledgeable about their jobs.  The hardest part about the job is the sales aspect. the most enjoyable thing is my coworkers, my managers, and all the knowledge I am learning."
good,AFLAC is a Fortune 200 company with a family feel.  AFLAC is known world wide because of the DUCK.
good,"Sale managers are wonderful and great to deal with."
good,"I enjoyed my time here hoever, I am relocating to San Antonio"
good,"Working for AFLAC was a great experience for me.  It taught to me network with so many companies and families.  I was able to bring my knowledge of healthcare of so many years and help families in need of insurance protection for their families. Being 100% commission some months you had to double your production.  Overall I find it rewarding helping families getting protection to cover their loss of income, due to an illness or accident."
good,"A lot of fun.  Good team atmosphere,  Lots of incentives available.  Tough to make it due to 100% commission."
good,"Delivered sensible employee enhancements that build employee loyalty, help in recruiting & retaining key employees, boost morale and provide protection for families at no cost to employers"
good,Flexible hours and freedom to work where and when you want. Uncapped commission that motivates employees to go the extra mile.
good,"Simply put!  If you work hard at this company the rewards are great!  However, please keep in mind you are in control of how much you make or don't make."
good,"i learn something new everyday and it enhances my skills. I am very new to the company, but i enjoy the agents as well as the district coordinator. communication is heavy and staedy."
good,"As an Account Manager at AFLAC I am the point of contact for agents and the HR director at the groups. They send me any billing issues/enrollment issues or rates and product issues. I have a team who applies the premium, make the correct reconcilation reports and send requested in force reports and deduction registers."
good,"I was able to gain much knowledge from AFLAC from a sales perspective. I was not much for the sales world, but meeting businesses and helping them in a sector they  did not much think about on a daily basis, was fun and interesting."
good,"Aflac gives you everything you need to be successful. From the team and other associates, to the trainers and corporate."
good,"A typical day at work had it's own challenges.  Every day was different which kept things from getting mundane.  The main focus was helping clients.  I learned a lot about insurance - types of plans (ie. differences between an HMO and a PPO), the overall purpose of insurance, and a general knowledge of how a company operates.  The co-workers were great and helped me out when I needed it.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that it was forever changing.  Once I got used to something, it changed!  The most enjoyable part was making friends and being able to help people which I believe is my calling in life."
good,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing resumes for compatibility with the organization, scheduling interviews, and searching for and attending career fairs. During my time here, I have learned to assist with talent management, learned the necessary health and life insurance terminology, and improved my overall communication skills. The hardest part of the job is determining retention and turnover rates since the show rate of candidates tends to fluctuate. The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside the Regional Sales Coordinator and staff because they provide a diverse and comfortable working and learning environment."
good,If your interested in direct sales in the healthcare industry then Aflac Insurance is am excellent company to get your feet wet and learn about supplemental insurance benefits and sales.  It provides excellent in house training and the management team are professionals.
good,n/a I did not work at this job for that long because it was false representation upon the hiring process.
good,Employee value was expressed in many of the things that they did: from an employee magazine to the great benefits that were offered. Most management seemed to be on the same page goals-wise with the company--those that were not ended up seeking employment elsewhere.
good,A typical day would require you to call on perspective clients. Talk with business owners and develop strategies to promote business growth. I learned how to develop partnerships with individuals and business professionals to advance my objectives of promoting sales. My co-workers were very supportive of helping me advance my career. The hardest part of my employment was getting pass the gate keepers of business's to make presentations. The most enjoyable part of working was the flexibility of scheduling my appointments and enjoying my life style with family and friends.
good,Cold calling is the most difficult part and its strictly commission pay
good,"applying payments to insurance policies"
good,"I learned a lot of insurance and different policies "
good,"Typically the day was all about new client acquisition.  I learned how to communicate with business owners and employees at all levels of corporate business.  Learned a lot about insurance during this time as well."
good,"I enjoyed working for AFLAC,"
good,The best part of the job was processing a claim for a client.
good,I had a great time working with the company. I learned alot about Health insurance and the do's and don't s.
good,"A typical day in the cancer claims dept consist of clearing out our assign work of beelines, matched images, and other specialists claims that are absent. Once that is completed we send the report to our supervisor. Then we handle the CFT report and move into the queue to begin processing our 41 claims for the day. In the meanwhile we have to handle any rush requests sent to us via the call center or upper management immediately. Along, with any reports the supervisor needs our assistance on in a timely fashion while meeting our hourly production. Ive learned that time management is a very important skill to have, along being able to cope with change because when i worked in this dept, guidelines on claims processing changed on a weekly basis. AFLAC is an awesome company to work for, the atmosphere is pleasant; management and co-workers are delightful. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that i helped a claimant by processing there claim accurately and in a timely manner so that they received the benefits needed to pay their medical bills for a hospital stay or for complications that occur post cancer surgery. The hardest part of the job is denying our policyholders insurance claims due to the services provided isn't covered under their policy. That's the worse feeling because you know that the reimbursement from the policy is needed to help them out."
good,Its was great. Great people and the Company is really going in the right direction.
good,The role of an Account Manager is to be the point of contact for the agents and group. My job is to research and resolve issues; audit groups for discrepancies; build quality working relationships with agents as well as group benefit coordinators. Emails and phone calls generally dictate my work flow and can vary from something as simple as needing a duplicate invoice to strenuous and in-depth review of payment histories and discrepancies. My co-workers are awesome and always willing to lend a hand if needed. The hardest part of the job is having systems that work against you so you aren't able to properly assist customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibilty and variety surrounding your tasks. You have to be a self-motivator to ensure your tasks get done because you are the one setting the priority to ensure deadlines are met.
good,I had a great expereince working with Aflac Honolulu. I had the chance to work with a great team.
good,Very good company. lots of good training. Flexible work schedule. Make what you want depending on your effort.
good,"Great People, great company. You meet a lot of new people and connections. Have to be okay with cold calling a lot, which is not for everyone."
good,A typical day at work is self paced and great for self driven individuals. The hardest part of the job is presenting infront of people. But that imroves with time. Aflac is a good product.
good,"Prospecting, Account Servicing, Enrollments."
good,"A typical day with Aflac was very non typical. I have learned so much with this job through trail and error. I worked on my own and it taught me how to conduct business meetings, how to connect with the decision maker of the business and close the deal. The management team was very supportive and encouraging. They never acted like the ""boss"". I didn't know much about my co-workers, but they all were very nice. The hardest part of my job was getting in touch with the decision maker, It took more than one attempt. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to market the business as if it was my own."
good,I spend most days calling potential customers or leads in an effort to sell supplemental insurance.
good,AFLAC is a good company to represent. ALFAC has a very good selection of insurance products for people when a medical issue arise in a person's life.
good,I've enjoyed the opportunity. The resources available for product marketing are top-notch. I appreciate the focus on excellence.
good,"Good: There is a lot of freedom and no cap in terms of sales. Pick your own schedule and have great compensation"
good,Commission a positive and a negative... no benefits or base salary are the three only draw backs about the job. Would do the job again in a heartbeat.
good,I enjoy working at Aflac. This company has excellent opportunities for young professionals to learn and develop their skills. They offer excellent benefits and a great work life balance. I am grateful I had the opportunity to learn and grow my professional career here with this company.
good,"This career gives you the opportunity for a great work/life balance.  The career allows for endless earning potential including bonuses.  It's a competitive job, however everyone that I came in to contact was willing to engage and assist in any way."
good,"Aflac is great company to work for.  Yes it is straight commission, but you can earn a really great living.  You have to build your business.  It’s a really great feeling when you help a client through a tough time.  It also allows you to have more time with your family.  "
good,"Decent sales job, commission only.  Commission, bonus and residual income structures are good, and sales objectives are realistic and reasonable, certainly achievable.  I saw the internal reports about agents earnings available to anyone to view internally in the state, and people were making good money."
good,"I have been a CSR at Aflac for more then 5 years. For the most part it is a great company internally and externally. I still assist people with their polices to this day and i stand behind them 100% on their business motto and purpose (Externally)! Internally, its a great place to be. You will find yourself gaining weight by the week because of potluck poison. Come to work? Get incentives (extra pay, gift cards, extra breaks, etc.) "
good,"Loved the environment because the regional and district sales coordinators were always there for you to boost you up and get you going. However, it has to be something you KNOW you can do. You can’t doubt yourself because mentality will eat you whole and spit you out. You HAVE to be self disciplined and I just wasn’t. It is 100% commision but if you are doing what you are suppose to then you make BANK! When I got paid it was so great! My first few weeks with AFLAC I made 4,000 in a week! That money however is sporadic and you never know when you are going to make a sale. Consistency consistency consistency! Oh, and after two years, you get renewals even if you quit! Annnnddd they have a TON of bonuses. They really want you to find someone to bring aboard the AFLAC adventure and that is one requirement for the big fun fancy resort all expenses paid bonus, but there are other bonuses that are more about sales and progress that are relatively achievable."
good,Aflac is a good job. My manager works with me to ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner and he is passionate about what he does. We work hard to ensure our clients are satisfied.
good,This was a good job to get out and network for as well as helping to increase your interaction skills. I worked with Aflac while I was searching for a full time job and enjoyed my time with them.
good,This company has the best supplemental insurance in the industry. I feel very confident when selling this product to my clients. The hardest part of this job is being 100% commission and dealing with the billing problems.
good,if you are in the call center it is fast paced and can be very stressful at times. be ready for change because that can happen at any time. There are a lot of times that you will work over your shift.
good,"Remote office, good compensation but commission only, flexible hours, good training available, difficult to sell insurance.  Great Employees, Minimal contest perks"
good,"Great commission, stock, bonus and advancement opportunities.  Hard workers only need apply.  "
good,"Job gets stressful and low staffed. Had to decide between going that extra mile or meeting my stats. Great bunch of people, I was sad to leave them..."
good,"Aflac overall is a great company to work for. The down side along with any commission based employment is that there are slow months and busy months. Once you move to management things are great, but you are encouraged to recruit as many people as you can with the hopes that even a few of them will open even one account. The high turn over makes it very hard to get attached to any of the agents and also makes you feel guilty for making this seem more obtainable that it is."
good,Excellent training and work environment. As an independent contractor you set your own hours for work but you are required to attend weekly meetings and training which helps to keep you accountable.
good,"I loved my time at Aflac. The only reason I left was it was commission only, and I had family issues that required me to get a full time job with a regular paycheck. If I would had more time to keep prospecting, and building my book of business I would have made a very nice living for me and my family."
good,"Constantly meeting new people, connecting with others and helping educate potential clients. Workplace is energetic and positive and everyone genuinely wants you to succeed"
good,Aflac was a good company to work for. I enjoyed the office and the staff where I was located. I also got to meet lots of interesting people along the way.
good,"This is definitely a place to work if you love being able to your own schedule to work and entirely at your own pace. The only downside is that if you are looking for steady money coming in, you most likely won't find it in the first year until your renewals/residuals kick in."
good,"The Aflac products are top notch. However, you are paid commission based, which was hardest for me to juggle. The fellow agents and supervisors are very supportive and enjoy when you succeed."
good,"Daily, I go to my office and the 1st hour & a half is spent on paperwork, returning phone calls, doing appeals, checking pended business, and making the schedule for the day.  (Schedules change daily so I cant do them ahead of time.) All my associates report to my office or check in by 9 AM.  I either spend the day with my new associates in the field doing training or go with seasoned associates to run presentations, do enrollments, and closing new groups."
good,"I worked for Aflac during the recession and found it challenging for that reason, but the company provides excellent training and support. Your pay is in direct proportion to how much you are willing to put into it, and the freedom of being an independent contractor is worth the risk."
good,"complete freedom to be your own boss, not a job for the lazy. Guidance was always available and support with any problems was never a problem, a good manager goes a long way"
good,"There was lot of potential to grow.  I didn't care for all of the meetings. If I'm self-employed, I don't want to be constantly coming to meetings. It takes away from building my empire."
good,A typical day is to making a lot of cold calls to business owners to do presentations. All other time spend on meetings and signing up contracts with employees.
good,Strong training and support provides you with an opportunity to earn what you are worth.  Hardest part of the job is learning to deal with sales rejection.  Best part of the job is having the opportunity to offer a product that truly helps people.
good,"Great Sales School."
good,Great products backing for the sales team. Paid training enables salespersons to do a better job. Travel to client sites is a constant part of the job.
good,Aflac is a great company to work for but it has the down falls of any commission only based job. The commission rate is great but there is weeks you will go without a paycheck because that is the name of the game.
good,Aflac provides flexibility for any working professional in order to balance your work/family life. Very team oriented and focuses on client benefits and employee development.
good,"Aflac was a great place to work they care about their employees everyday I would walk into work looking forward to my workday until the last few months of being there it was not the company but coworkers they made it hard to look forward to coming in everyday I went from enjoying my job to counting down the day until I could switch jobs"
good,I is a very difficult business to make money even with a high quality product such as Aflac. One must be able to accept rejection most of the time. One must also be able to self-motivate oneself...
good,"This is not an easy position, but it's rewarding! You touch many many lives working for AFLAC. You must be very organized and focus to be an AFLAC agent. You have to love what you do."
good,At Aflac you are basically your own boss. You get to create your own hours and work days. Have to be organized and a self starter. You get back what you put out.
good,"You were your own boss being an insurance agent, you set the pace, but you needed a license which at the time I only had provisionary license for 3 mos. This job was straight commission."
good,"Aflac is a sales company with all that sales entails; however, it also has one thing most sales outfits lack: inspirational stories. Simply put, Aflac and its agents have been responsible for so much good in helping people through the toughest medical times in their lives that it is amazing so few have encountered Aflac coverage in their lives. When you combine that sort of meaning with such hard working colleagues, Aflac is truly a special place."
good,"It is nice being my own boss, but time management is the key to success. I have learned a lot about sales and the insurance business. My co-workers are great and the management is great as well. The hardest part of the job is to get decision makers to understand the need for Aflac and how important it can be for the employees. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people and knowing I am making some part of their life more comforting."
good,With AFLAC I set my own hours to work but it was only commission based pay. If you don't work you don't get paid. But overall AFLAC is a wonderful company to work for if you are a single person with no kids.
good,"A little slow to get hired on, but direct contact with district and regional bosses helps. I learned important skills with building relationships with business owners and got a good feel for the insurance world."
good,"Aflac provides a quality product for anyone."
good,"This is a fun place to work if you are motivated and self-sufficient. You do have to be willing to go out and meet people and be positive, but you work for yourself and set your own hours. Initially the money is slow since you work on royalties, but once you get the hang of it it's a fun job."
good,"Really nice employees, great atmosphere, management is friendly and very helpful, good training program. Co-workers are nice."
good,"Thankful to have worked for a company that treats you like your right at home! Wonderful ""work family"" environment. Management is particular about little things that can get stressful (in the call center that is). Job is kind of difficult and takes a lot of research to get the job done right. But its enjoyable and ""do-able"" as long as YOU make it enjoyable!"
good,"It is a good place to work. It is up to you to make it happen. I learned a lot about the insurance business and business in general. Business to business sales is fun if you can get to the business owner. It can be like a game. I did my own thing , Aflac gave me everything i needed to succeed."
good,"•	Rate Sheets "
good,Enrollment and visits with future clients is a typical day in the office
good,"Business to Business sales."
good,"Worked within fast-pace busy office answering phones, scheduling appointments using Microsoft Outlook to schedule meetings with future customers, vendors and internal department personnel.  Assured weekly  deadlines were met using Excel macros shortcut  applications for accuracy and"
good,"Typical sales job, visiting clients and cold calling. Great company to be associated with, wish they had a base salary and not all commission based"
good,The time i spent there was a great experience and it was also a very safe enviroment to work work in. I really learned a lot and plan to assist others with my learned skills.
good,"Aflac offers a ray of products that put money back into patiences lives. "
good,It is hard to be successful in a market where your company is heavily saturated in the field.
good,"You work for yourself, doing this job is all about self-motivation and being positive. Aflac gives you all the tools and support for you to succeed."
good,"A typical day at work involves cold calling accounts trying to speak with decision makers and convince them Aflac is a good addition to their benefits package. If successful you set an enrollment date and go back to educate the employees and sell policies. Job also entails back end servicing but nothing too difficult. Aflac as an organization has a great corporate culture, and great values. However as a sales associate you are not an Aflac employee but a 1099 independent contractor. One really nice thing is you are pretty much your own boss and can use your time as you see fit, but no sales equals no money."
good,"Atypical day at work we would start off our week with a Monday Morning Meeting. This would give us a re-cap from the previous week and our goals for the new week. After our meeting I would either cold call, business drops or go on appointments."
good,"AFLAC really breaks the mold on insurance companies. In my 7 years with this organization, they made it an enjoyable experience to offer AFLAC benefits. Insurance can be drab and boring, but they made it 'fun' again, with an upbeat sales environment, wonderful managers, and an depth and comprehensive training for all sales agents."
good,This is a highly professional organization with a dedicated management team. The treatment of all employees and contractors was always fair and equitable. There was ample work place flexibility balanced with room for growth and benefits to match.
good,"I loved working at Aflac - the only reason  I left was because the role was 1099, purely commission based.  I would prefer to be in a role with a base salary, plus commission."
good,"We had Monday morning and Friday morning meetings and would then focus on follow-up calls or introductory calls. Then we would have lunch brought in to the office. After lunch we would have job-training sessions. "
good,A fun company to partner with. You can advance as high as you would like to as long as you put in the hard work. Must be a salesperson with a can-do attitude.
good,Outside Business to Business Sales Commission Based. Aflac is a superior company with products that help individuals offset the rising cost of Major Medical Insurance deductibles as well as unexpected out of pocket expenses.
good,"It’s a great place to work, the benefits package is outstanding and they have more culture than a gallon of buttermilk. There are opportunities ranging from call center and customer service up to management"
good,"Aflac is a great company to work for! Lots of training provided! Online, classroom and one-on-one time. Advancement opportunites are available if you work hard! Commissions are paid quickly."
good,The company truly cares about employees.   The culture is great in most departments.  Commitment comes from the top.  Strong integrity and customer commitment.  Really cares about employees and customers.  Fun place to work.
good,"Aflac offers a great line of supplemental insurance products for its policyholders, plus their claims are paid extremely fast.  However, their customer service for agents needs improvement."
good,"Good time. Lots of independent hours spent trying to find clients. Hard to get a check. Not consistent. Good management team though. It was very hard at times but if you invest a long time with the company, you can have a good outcome."
good,"i enjoyed working here for many reasons, including the flexibility of my schedule throughout school, and how i got to work at my own pace. This made it easy to get done what i needed to when i could."
good,"If you reach your goal there  a lot of incentives. Is hard to get the people to listen you about the benefits of the products.Its hard when you dont have sales, because you dont have commissions."
good,Great company to work for if you enjoy sales. Terrific income potential. Training is superb. Lots of opportunity to win vacations and other prizes. Great company!
good,Schedule ran on your own you are in control of when you start and end work. Learned to be persistent and power past the rejections when cold calling. The managers are very good mentors in the company and want to see you succeed. The culture is one of good family like structure where they are inclusive of all members of the company. Hardest part of the job is not making any money to start because it is all commission based. Though it is commissioned based this ties into the most important and enjoyable part of the job which is no cap on how much money you can make.
good,"Aflac's corporate strategy team was focused and well guided by its leaders. They had a great understanding of the industry and business   trends."
good,"Aflac is a wonderful company to work for. I am horrible at ""cold-calling"" so this was not the right career for me. They offer great incentives and you have the possibility of making a lot of money but I am no salesman."
good,"Need to be ok with working from home, making phone calls. My manager was very helpful, good to work for. If you get things done, the company will take good care of  you. But it is a slow start up, need to be ok with working on commissions."
good,"Working for Aflac was enjoyable. You have a lot of agents to assist when your the front administer, usually in a district office. Teaches you how to work efficiently under pressure. You got to be an organized detailed person to work for Aflac."
good,"Great team work.... flexible time and hours. Management is very hands on when it comes to motivativating the team through incentives, games and team building building activities."
good,"I enjoy working for Aflac because of the clients I meet, I love the flexibility that is given to me, I do not like that money does not come in fast its hard especially if you are changing jobs, I highly recommend a second job"
good,Aflac was a great company to work for. Schedule is definitely one of the best perks. You make your own appointments whenever you want and earning potential is unlimited.
good,"I learned that management was good."
good,"Loved it overall, you can really help people, the compensation is fine if you can live on commission.  It truly is your own business, so be prepared to work hard for yourself."
good,Fun place to work and help business owners and individuals be able to benefit and get insurance for individuals. Management is very helpful and willing to teach.
good,"I learned a lot from my job as an Aflac Sales Agent. I wasn't persuasive enough to be successful, and didn't like so much time cold-calling, but it could be a great career for someone willing to put in a lot of hard work and long hours. "
good,The amount of work you are willing to put in will directly show in your return. Advancement is very good if you apply yourself and work hard. I learned so much about insurance as well as its regulations and laws. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the co-workers willingness to give their time to help you in learning the tools needed to succeed. I think the hardest part of the job would be the time and amount of driving.
good,"Very flexible to your schedule.  People are very friendly and outgoing.  However, need more managers in the field for training."
good,"Great atmosphere, pleasant co-workers and awesome management team. During the time at Aflac, I learned a variety of office skills as well as communication skills."
good,"I had a great experience working at AFLAC.  The management is top-notch, and the work atmosphere is pleasant.  There many opportunities for advancement, and staff was encouraged to take advantage of classes offered to further advancement in the company, and in life in general."
good,"A typical day a Famous Daves would include setting up the bar at the opening of the shift. Once you open it is just a constant spin of seating tables taking care of them while making drinks for the entire restaurant. Famous Daves is a fast paced team atmosphere where everything happens very quickly, but your co-workers and management team help you get through the really hectic moments. To do this job you really have to be able to problem solve issues with guests quickly while prioritizing the most important on down to be the most efficient and make the most of your opportunity at every table to earn good tips. The hardest part can be the moments dealing with issues that you didn't create such as misquoted wait times for guests who are angry by the time they get to you or orders that are made incorrectly. The ability to thrive in these situations and breakdown barriers is vital to being successful. The most enjoyable part is the ability to make as much as you can and that is exciting to me as opposed to clocking in at a certain rate and knowing exactly what your going to make. I would just also like to add that anybody can become a server or bartender but, it takes a very special person to thrive in the tight windows of lunch and dinner rush dealing in very high pressure situations and not knowing what's going to be there for you on the back end. I did this for right at 10 years and with the right personality you can make very good money but not everyone has the drive it takes."
good,"Develop and improve client relationships for business developments. "
good,It is hard but very rewarding job . You need to be able to solicit and develop customer relationships.
good,"I became an Aflac sales associate in January of this year and have already been promoted to Coordinator in Training! I was told that this was an opportunity during my initial interview but had no idea it would happen so quickly. I was hesitant to work for Aflac initially as I never had prior experience in sales, but it was one of the best decisions I've made. The proper training is provided, you have the freedom of being your own boss, and you can essentially get paid everyday! I receive a direct deposit into my bank account within a couple days of every sale--so awesome!"
good,"As an Insurance Agent with 15 years experience i can tell you that most Insurance Companies including AFLAC offer an opportunity if you are wiling to work hard."
good,"I met new people everyday, Built and maintained my own customers,I traveled a great deal, I learned how to manage my time affectivly. I really enjoyed being independant and meeting new people daily."
good,Was returning to school and company did not have part time positions. Would most likely still be working there if I had not chosen to return to school..
good,"Friendly co-workers, great product and great management. Everyone is very helpful and wants you to succeed."
good,"Great company to work for, friendly management & very helpful!"
good,Working as an Independent Sales Associate with Aflac is a great career opportunity for those who are parents and make it a priority to take care of their children.  You have a choice to decide when and where to build your clientele.  The job as an Independent Sales Associate can be rewarding and fulfulling.
good,The management team has been there with me the entire way to help me grow into the management role that I wanted to pursue in this career! The career with Aflac has truly been a blessing for me and my family along with helping all the policyholders I get to work with each day! Bonuses and trips are also a great plus!
good,"Culture - leaps & bounds better than before. "
good,Aflac provides a comfortable work environment for many agents. Freedom to grow your business as long as you put in the work. Management has been great
good,I have nothing but good things to say about my fellow agents and upper management. They were always so helpful and patient with us new hires. One of the aspects I found that I did not like was cold calling and door knocking around the area. This job is definitely not for everyone.
good,"The company is solid. I was in one area of Florida and then moved to another, and both teams were organized, structured and supportive. My leadership is top-notch. The hardest and probably the only hard thing about it is prospecting to get solid appointments and building those lasting relationships with owners. It's a nice culture, but can vary from district to district. Other than getting paid every other day, the best part of the job is learning about all the businesses and what they do."
good,this opportunity is all about autonomy. As an individual cold calling the responsibilities are hefty and a minimum salary does not exist. it is veyr interesting though.
good,If your are a motivated self-starter and have a true entrepreneurial mindset are willing to invest in yourself and your career and only make $35 - 30 k the first year then AFLAC would be a good fit for you. Keep in the the prato principle or the 90 - 10 rule - where 10% of all new recruits at aflac succeed and 90% fail. If you are a winner and can make cold calls on phone and in person to local business and if you can close for an appointment with business owners you will succeed and have a wonderful career in insurance. The first year is always the most difficult.
good,"Aflac is a great opportunity to learn and become an independent business owner. You determine your financial capability with the amount of focus, determination, accountability, and activity. The resources to develop your craft is very accessible in the provided website and study modules."
good,Aflac has a wonderful work culture in there Call Center. They are flexible and the benefits are excellent. Aflac prides performance based bonuses twice a year. I learned how to self manage you are provided the tools to be able to research anything job related in order to assist all customers internal and external. The most enjoyable part of the job was EAW (employee appreciation week) this company goes all out to show how much they appreciate you. The quarterly meetings are not just informational but also entertaining. A typical day at work once you arrive you will log into the que and take back to back calls assisting policy holders with benefit information. The calls are administered back to back. I was able to learn details about all the policies that Aflac offers outside of Major Medical. The hardest part of the job was to make sure your knowledge about each policy is updated. If you keep up with updates and create file for changes this can be obtained.
good,Great Management and employees.  It's a very relaxed envirinment although you stay busy.  Everyone helps one another when you need it.  Even at the corporate level they are very helpful with anything you need.
good,"was overall a great experience. They started me on commission. After I proved my ethics, loyalty, and stats I earn my salary. The sky was not the limit with this company. it was very profitable and a great time. I learned allot from Aflac and very thankful."
good,"If you are a fun, outgoing person who can handle a lot of rejection and go door to door and drive all over town to try and make a sale. Then this job is perfect for you with unlimited earning potential."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company immensely.  I learned about supplemental insurance and the benefits of having them, how to speak to large groups of people.  This is a very family oriented company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to deliver a claim check to someone who was in desperate need of the money. This created a feeling of really making a difference in people's lives."
good,Love this company and love the products. Great at paying out claims. Enjoy my relationship with Management and love my customers.
good,"For a job that largely relies on cold calls and who you know, I found that Aflac at first can be very difficult. Not many people want to talk to an insurance salesman. However, given hard work and perseverance, there is great potential for success."
good,"While working for AFLAC in San Antonio, Tx, a typical work day consisted of making calls to businesses to try to set up meetings with the decision makers. We also went to well known and little known business to also try to set up meetings with decision makers. The hardest part of the job was getting to the decision makers then seeting up appointments that fit both yours and their schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that once you made that sell to the employee, their family would be covered. Had they ever needed to go to the hospital, doctor, dentist, etc., their time away from work would be compensated."
good,"A typical day at work for this job is making 75-100 cold calls to businesses, and then going on any appointments I set the previous week. The goal with Aflac is to meet with the business owner, convince them to allow you to talk to their employees, and then make a sale."
good,My typical day with Aflac was to go out cold calling to establish my own territory and customer base. I would go out on as many as 30 plus cold calls per day. I enjoyed the position as I love working with people and have absolutely no problem calling on anyone. You could also create business through phone calls and mailings. I chose cold calling because it was the most effective for me.
good,Each morning I would call prospective companies and attempt to contact the owner to set up a meeting to introduce AFLAC. At the actual meeting with the owner I would describe the different products offered by AFLAC and the benefits to the employer. I would try to get them to set up a meeting with the employees so that I could introduce the products to them and attempt to get them to purchase some of them.
good,I enjoy the ability to structure my month as I see fit. Aflac affords me the oppurtunity to handle multiple tasks on a daily basis.
good,Working at Aflac gave me a lot of opportunities to work at my own pace. My supervisor always motivated me to do my best. Teamwork was always suggested as a way to get the job done.
good,"I joined Aflac because I liked the company. I really liked the people I worked with. I was a Benefits Consultant. It was a 100% commission sales job. A typical day was making 100 dials or prospecting small businesses, trying to get an appointment with the business owner."
good,it was a great internship and learning experience it gave me real life experience in my career path
good,"•	Leasing apartments to corporate and residential occupants."
good,Aflac is a great career path for beginners or for some that looking to retire. If you are a self starter this is an excellent way to go. Flexible schedule and great leadership
good,"It is an amazing company. The only downside is that it is 100% commission. If you don't have very many contacts it is hard to make money. However, if you do have a lot of contacts, there is no limit on how much money you can make."
good,Being an intern at AFLAC was a great experience because I got to set up meetings with business owners to sit and talk to them about AFLAC and what they do. The environment is very welcoming and my co-workers were great people to be around.
good,"great company, wonderful projects. had to get the business owner to listen but I love helping ppl. and  it gives me the chnce to spend more time with my family."
good,Good Hours
good,Didn't work for me as I could not get anywhere with their sales scripts.  When I told my experience/story to potential customers I could get appointments but couldn't get anyone to buy/sign policies.  I tried for a year.
good,Every employee is out for him or herself.  Not much of a helpful community.  Management stresses production only. There was not much cooperation between employees and management.
good,Door to Door sales is mandatory to survive with this company. You must go and seek out businesses that will talk to you in order to make a sale. If you are not a door to door sales person then this company is not for you.
good,"If you do well in sales, this is the place.  I believe in insurance and AFLAC, but the potential customers do not ""get it"".  If you are not good at sales, save yourself the anguish."
good,Very difficult to make any money because the Regional Manager would never give a straight answer and I never made a dime the full year I worked for them.
good,"The job itself was very productive, busy and well enough to do.. the manager is very flexible, great with others.. some agents can be difficult to work with or get a hold of.. do not let this discourage you."
good,"My experience with AFLAC was very inspiring. I enjoyed my manager, district manager and my team mates. Going out of cold calls allowed you to meet many people from all walks of life."
good,Aflac Group is a very unstable environment.  The supervisors will take something that is said and twist it to meet their needs.  Managers can't have any input unless it is what comes from their Director.  There is always another motive.
good,Aflac has a very good product and loved working for company however it was commission only. For new comers it was hard to provide for family have to work 2 jobs or have spouse.
good,"Good product, not a lot of support or leads. You are a 1099 employee and must do B2B sales. No base, just straight commission. Hard to survive in the beginning."
good,"I enjoyed my position with Aflac, as well as my employer."
good,"My experience with Aflac the last four years has been great.  If you have what it takes to get things done, this is the job for you."
good,"I really enjoyed working for AFLAC, and cut my teeth on the Insurance Industry there.  The management was both very supportive, and helpful.  "
good,No support to advance my personal and sales goals with this firm. I am very disapointed in the company as a hole.
good,"They have taken my money but have not given me an opportunity to work. I have had many instances where I have been ignored, or promised something and they never came through"
good,"AFLAC is the type of job where you make your own ours and reap what you sew.  Depending on your work ethic, and especially your personality, the job could go either way."
good,A typical day is driving all over the city and knocking on doors to sale insurance. I learned that it takes two years before you make serious money. My co-worker was very patient and fun. The hardest part is making money.
good,Made phone calls to prospect business basically all day when I didnt have any meetings to attend or Policy holders to assist.
good,Basically I was trained for approximately 4 months and turned loose to fend for myself without the leadership help i needed. working on commission I was new enough that i had no renewal income coming in and was only getting paid if the policies were being written.
good,not bad job to start indeed. too bad the job security is not as great as i thought it would be
good,"Understand that I worked for an agent of Aflac.  Not directly Aflac.  Therefore, Aflac may be a great company but the agency may differ in how they handle or deal with situations."
good,"Inconsistent culture, management comes and goes.  Most of the managers are micro managed and the environment is very stressful with all the changes.  It can be a very prosperous business, if one could endure the constant changes."
good,Over all the company has great reviews as far as top 500 corporation however the  local office management are just built on misleading recruiting and high turnover resulting due poor training and realistic goal setting.
good,You have freedom to choose your time and enjoy moving through the field.
good,I enjoyed aflac the only thing that i disliked was i would only work when needed i didn't have set hours but for the most part i liked it.
good,"During a typical day at work, I check emails, call policyholders, fax claims, call Aflac headquarters for claim status, organize office and files, and etc."
good,“People know Aflac
good,Flexible hours. A agent can make as much money as they want if they are willing to grind. Cold calling can be difficult sometimes but you just have to make the best of it.
good,"Located at spacious surroundings, peaceful and friendly environment. Learned lot of things from different people and the great support from customer.."
good,If you are sales driven Aflac is fantastic. Great job for those who have the will to travel and can establish professional connections per individuals.
good,"Great company, great culture! I liked working at Aflac. I learned more about businesses, insurance and employee benefits. I learned to push my limits to achieve challenging goals."
good,This is a great work environment. I learned a lot as an intern and they spend a lot of time teaching new people tactics and skills to use in sale. They also really try to help you make money if you invest time trying.
good,"Awesome company , stocks and   Renewals , my fav was fantastic she helped me every step of the way , sales school really pays off , commission based but can make lots of money"
good,very flexible schedule. prospecting building a book of business and learnng how to overcome objectives in the field. 100 percent comossion based career.
good,Great people and great training teams. Best work will be in larger cities and concentrated areas. Will flourish with a lot of willingness to approach strangers (companies) and offer genuine friendship and support with the community in mind.
good,Well known company with excellent support materials and training. Oral and written tests qualified me for their company.  Collateral materials provided for substantiating our presentations.
good,A typical day at work would involve making cold calls.  Drive around and find business to approach regarding benefits.  Schedule appointments to go over benefits with employees.
good,"While many people seem more than capable to make plenty of cash here and love the process, I found that I am not one of those people. I do not think that it's a bad internship or job, but you must be aware that you will not get paid if you don't sell anything. If cold-calling is not for you, then neither is this job. They won't ask you to sell to friends and family, which is a plus, but they will expect a high time commitment in exchange for the promise of potential compensation."
good,"Fun and could be a great career for someone. Not suitable for someone who has no income. The job is commission based and a very competitive company. If no one buys the product, you make no money."
good,It was a pleasant work office.  I was there to cover for the office manager while she was on her honeymoon. It was a great experience and I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Wonderful work environment filled with self motivated, hardworking people. Great mentoring and support from upper management. Flexible schedule with family as a priority."
good,There was no market in Cincinnati for new companies to adopt Aflac. Everyone either already had a different insurer or Aflac itself. I decided to leave but still have an underwriter's license.
good,"Aflac offers opportunity for unlimited income; the harder you work the more you can earn. Veteran agents enjoy lots of autonomy, which can be a good and a bad thing. Flexibility is very important, but in order to succeed you must be self-motivated."
good,I was only there a short while but the company itself was good to it's employees.  The training was excellent and very thorough and the job itself was not difficult at all.
good,"aflac helps people and is a fun and ""family feeling"" place to work.  Training is excellent atmosphere is excellent.  EVERTHING is wonderful including the automatically stock-purchase plan.  The only thing missing is a regular salary and I need that.  "
good,The job itself was simple and easy. Relaxed office environment with relaxed working hours. Job was simple and required little time. Sometimes boring but Learned a lot
good,I really enjoyed working as an executive office manager of Aflac insurance. I learned how to work independently and in a fast pace work environment. Customer service and interacting with others was the best part.
good,AFLAC is a great company. Its a great way to learn sales. Its business to business sales. If you can make it here you can make it anywhere. The juice is worth the squeeze.
good,"The company offers a variety of type of jobs, but the commonality is they all come with fantastic perks that make employees feel valued, which is a morale boost."
good,"Would answer phones, input data into computer, go to company's location to enroll employees, trouble shooting, preparing packets for employees.  The pay is inconsistent, no health benefits."
good,"Great opportunity to develop entrepreneurial spirit. Develop discipline and good work ethics. Your results are based on your efforts."
good,Made daily cold calls to find clients and to set up appointments. Had to find my own clients in order to schedule appointments and make sales presentations.  Management is very eager to help with sales and presentations but not in helping you find clients.
good,The company is a very respectable one and I feel that I f anyone is looking to start a career as an entry level business professional then this is a great place to start that career..
good,"Working with great people that are willing to working to help you work towards your goals. "
good,"A great insurance company to work for.  Many opportunities came for me to observe the stability of the company.  Many clients were supported to their own unbelief.  I would have to report that many claims were paid that even I was thankful for the company graciousness.  True the clients paid premiums, but the company performed as they advertise."
good,"good culture. no pressure. very good to work with this company.very good management. my manager is very cool and nice person to work with, used to have free lunches sometimes."

Duties also include: opening and closing store, reconciling cash drawer, making and receiving inventory shipments, as well as answering incoming phone calls."
good,"Must be willing to work hard. Leaders stress educating clients rather than ""selling"" to them, and this company truly cares about its clients more than any insurance company I know. Leaders are hands on and you will have the resources you need to succeed...if you're willing to do the work."
good,You get there at 8:00 am. Go over the client's applications to make sure they're werent any errors made before sending the application to Processing. The culture of the workplace was very fun and relaxed. Management was always there assist when we needed them to be.
good,"The job called for a lot of cold calling and essentially thrown to the wolves from day one. Besides an one week course which was unpaid, there was no other formal training."
good,"There was never a dull day or a dull moment.  We were treated as family rather than employees.  Our work life mattered but so did our personal life.  There was an abundance of resources available to help us both professionally and personally.  One of the greatest highlights of each day was interacting externally with new people via telephone communications and knowing that I helped make a positive difference in someone's life.  Also, interacting with different teams of peers and having the privilege of learning something new each day promoted camaraderie.  While team leaders, supervisors, and managers were on hands for us from day to day, I felt especially privileged when the CEO, himself, would visit our facility and talk with us to make sure everything was going good for us."
good,"Aflac is a profession where you are rewarded for your efforts.  You can choose your schedule and you level of activity.  The rewards are excellent if you put in the effort.  Manaagement is there to help.  The company makes marketing material available, and it is excellent material."

good,"This has been the best company I've ever worked for! Family oriented, includes all employees in everything they do and most importantly, the diversity cannot be matched! They show you they care."
good,Typical day at work is to schedule clients and make appointments.  Learned when to properly schedule clients.  Worked independently.  Some times we would work as teams when we working the same areas.  My co-workers were talented and helpful in the insurance business.  I found most difficult part of the job was getting clients to keep their appointments. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the field.
good,"If you would like to succeed you have to be hungry. There is nothing fun about prospecting on foot 50+ plus companies a day but, you will learn discipline and communication skills to better your personal net worth."
good,"I have not yet started my internship with Aflac. My start date is 05/23/2016. I am still receiving more information about the hours. As of now I know I will be working Monday-Thursday, five hours a day."
good,Every one at the Regional office in Loveland is great to work with. Once you begin training they don't just throw you out in the field by yourself and tell you get this many appointments. They work with you until you are comfortable to do it on your own. They encourage you in every way and recognize your hard work !
good,This company stands for all the right things in life. Aflac sincerely cares about their employees and policyholders. I am proud to say I work for a Fortune 200 company!
good,"Great job for the right person. Make your own hours and run your own business. You should obtain your Insurance licenses for the state you decide to work in,"
good,If you are willing to work and are extremely motivated the income is limitless. You pick a town and go business to business trying to fill their insurance needs. Cold calling can be difficult and nerve wracking but immensely fun and rewarding.
good,"Geat people, great place to work.  You get out what you put in.  It's is a challenging position but worth the trouble.  You are paid to go out and talk to people and the hours are very flexible."
good,"A typical day would be contacting prospects"

good,"Great opportunity, good leadership, strategy and guidance..."
good,"I learned to manage my time and meet new customers at their work place.  Public Speaking was a must for Open Enrollment Meetings where all employees learned about all Benefit Plans. My job was to explain the benefits and tell them why they should choose AFLAC to accompany their Health Insurance."
good,"Love working for this place.  They treat their employees very well by providing comfortable work spaces, clean environment, up to date technology.  Everything that you need to work efficiently, is there."

good,Great to work environment. The employees are great. Great to work environment.
good,"As a sales associate for Aflac a typical day includes offering Aflac products to new and existing business accounts, acquiring referrals and providing customer service. I have learned organizational, management, and time management skills from this position at Aflac. I work on team of associates who are friendly and encouraging which makes the workplace an inviting environment. The hardest part of this job is the self motivation required to get out and sell products because you make your own schedules. However, this has helped with self discipline, motivation, and dedication in regards to work ethic. The most enjoyable part of working for Aflac is being surrounded by friendly, positive people who encourage you to be successful."
good,"•	Assist Sales Representatives, who sell Life, and other insurance products"
good,"Each day was a different day"
good,"Providing a valuable service to clients. Life Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Cancer Insurance."

good,Filed claims for current policies. Outbound and inbound calls from dr. offices.
good,Great place to work. You where out on your own. I have a disability and have a hard time working full time and driving most of the day. The product is excellent and the management was helpful.
good,Great place to work and employees work together to get jobs complete.
good,I loved working in the professional environment that it provided. I learned many valuable life skills.
good,Company has wonderful products and each day was a new and exciting experience.  Downside was commission only and the market is saturated with Aflac agents so sales are hard to achieve.
good,"very enjoyable"
good,"The average day begins with a team meeting to connect as a team and motivate the overall team. "
good,Work with independent agents to help them learn and grow their business through marketing and sales. Recruit talent for growth and retention.
good,They really make you feel like family. Best company I've ever worked for.
good,"Working as an Independent Agent requires a lot of self motivation. Survival of the fittest.. Don't work, don't eat."
good,Have learned to use different tools which made me expert in IT field.
good,"At Aflac, as an independent agent, you deal with small business owners throughout the week.  You plan your week out at the beginning so you know exactly who you are prospecting from the  small business pool. You typically call on twenty or more prospects in a day on average to help generate leads for the week and month, and this helps create a pipeline that you consistently work from to generate business for yourself. However the hardest part is the rejections you receive throughout the day, but the most rewarding part is when you help individuals with insurance needs and actually help them in a time of need."
good,A hard career to break into. Making people understand the importance of supplemental insurance.
good,"Aflac is a great company and provides each client or company with excellent service. A typical day at Aflac would be handling client questions, claim process, and recruiting. During time here I learned independence, insurance claims, and cold calling. I was a single employee for the Regional Coordinator for southwest Nevada. The most enjoyable part was the independence I was allowed."
good,A great place for any business professional that is self motivated and persistent.
good,My typical day involves calling on businesses either on the phone or in person and explaining Aflac products and Health Care Reform. 
good,"I am people oriented.  I enjoy contact both in person and by telephone, and am most satisfied when solving issues and moving clients toward mutually agreed upon goals.  While sales has always been my passion, I have also worked in many capacities to help business owners to create their own marketing through leverage of online tools.  "
good,Professional. You learn something new everyday.  If your looking for a good internship this is a good one.

good,"plan a day full of cold calls , make sure that you dont waste any time setting appointments with non executive decision makers. follow leads with the intentions of making a sale"
good,"Sales associate’s duties include cold calling both on the phone and in person. Most of the time is spent canvasing the city looking for potential new client. Servicing accounts, problem solving, filing claims, and ensuring new accounts understand the product. Individuals are free to manage themselves as they see fit. Meeting new people is the best part of the job. Anyone who is self-motivated should try this career out. The potential for success is unlimited!"
good,A typical day in the call center at Aflac varied from day to day. Some days I would have simple calls and easy going. Other days would be stressful where every caller was irate about something. I learned to deal with the itrate customers and offer solutions to help them out. The management at Aflac was wonderful i never had a problem with any of my managers. They were the sweetest and most understanding people. The hardest part of my job would have been dealing with the irate callers that were attacking me personally and having to stay calm with them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people on my team. Any time i need advice they were very helpful.
good,"day to day work included planning out your own day and schedule and also filling in appointments throughout the week, also door to door sales and cold calls"
good,Transparent company. You get what you earn. Requires great sales technique.
good,"I mastered every aspect of the sales cycle and honed on various sales techniques. Hard work, but can be financially rewarding."
good,I enjoyed being in control of my day.
good,"Aflac is a wonderful company to work for. The training is top notch, the products basically sell themselves, and you don't get better people to work with. Upon hire, I immediately felt like family and was welcomed with open arms. Other associates are extremely helpful and supportive. One of the most ethical companies as rated by Ethisphere magazine. Great travel opportunities as well as a competitive environment filled with rewards. Quick potential for promotions. The hardest part of the job is in the beginning, trying to prospect for potential clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with such amazing people and feeling truly appreciated as an associate."
good,"It is a great company to work for. The independence is great. As long as effort is given, there is money to be made. What I like the best is that there isn't any pressure to sell."
good,"A very friendly environment. I learned very essential business skills, also displayed the ability to independently complete my tasks, effectively manage my time, and organize projects both efficiently and effectively. I learned how to deal with the customers."
good,Working at Aflac gives me the oppurtunity to interact with new people on a daily basis and providing people with piece of mind.
good,Providing supplemental (or direct pay) benefits to both individuals/households and payroll/association/union groups.
good,"Employees there are cool, its a sort of laid back environment, you do have to work."
good,"Working here allowed me to make the decisions I wanted concerning my career. I guess like any outside sales job, if you work, you will get paid. If you don't work, you don't get paid."
good,"This is a great independent business opportunity for anyone with entrepreneurial spirit and ambitions, but requires some cash reserves to get up and running that many cant survive. But the opportunity is real and exciting."
good,"I'm still with AFLAC, but I will say that it's an excellent company and brand that offers so much great protection for millions of people and their families.  It's a long way to a regular paycheck this way, but I've been trying hard to get through.  I will stay with them for a long time to get my longterm benefits out of my time."
good,Aflac was an awesome experience. Sales is a very interesting field and pushing yourself to reach certain goals than reaching them can be very exciting.
good,"Aflac has great marketing and you can built a great book of business.   It's is a work program."
good,"I have the freedom to work from home and still get the support I need from our corporate office."
good,"Aflac is a sales driven company. A very good company linked with health insurance. While insurance cost continue to rise, funds for supplemental insurance continue to decrease. I'm self employed and self motivated but 100% commission based careers are jobs best suited for others. I enjoyed meeting people from all walks of life."
good,AFLAC is family oriented company and culture along with diversity is very important to them. I really appreciate the time as well as the opportunity for all employees to get additional skills by offering training classes such as project management.
good,Good company to work for and good people.  The office that I worked for didn't need me so we parted company.  I didn't have anything to do there.  Great hours and great boss.
good,Excellent supervisor and team members. Great product. I struggled with the commission based pay and the small market. Agent are practically tripping over each other in this area.
good,This is not a regular job. Aflac provides you with training but you are an independent sales agent meaning you are responsible for your own income. If you do not go out and make cold calls on your own and try to sell their products you WILL NOT succeed in this business.
good,"company is the top seller of suplemental benefits,  Devoted to its producers and supportive,  the job is easy once you learn the oroducts and the concept is easy to understand.  Its not major Medical Insurance its income insurance with cash being paid directly to the employee."
good,"Aflac is a company that is superior in product and development. An agent has the ability to set their own hours, hence, those with children can tailor to their family needs. Working with a company like Aflac teaches an individual the ""soft skills"" necessary to communicate in both professional and personal environments. Aflac Headquarters listens to their agents regarding what needs to improve or change in order to be progressive for their policyholders. As an agent evolves, the hardest part of their job will become the balance between new and existing business. My favorite part of the job was how dedicated headquarters is to their agents and meeting new people. Aflac is very agent friendly. You would have the ability to run the  gamut of positions: Sales associate, District Sales Coordinator, Inactive Accounts Specialist. I was all of these. There are more positions available to the field force and if you choose you can assimilate to headquarters if you are willing to relocate to Columbus, GA.  It is liberating for an individual to evolve and find out what they can really do. I would highly recommend any individual that is seeking a commissioned sales position"
good,It was good. The pay was good and the hours were flexible. The hardest part of the job was the commute.
good,Straight commission no salary. Overall great company. Like you own your own company.  Must pay for extras like computer.
good,AFLAC was a tremendous opportunity for me to learn about insurance and to advance in a career. The training was excellent however they offer NO benefits to their agents.
good,"I worked for my supervisor, which is not technically AFLAC. As a sales representative for AFLAC you're a 100% commission contractor. You choose your strategy to win and keep sales and set your own hours."
good,"drove around to find places of business to speak to the human resouces manager to give a presentation about aflac products. Completed presentations, applicatiatons for products, processed claims"
good,"Outstanding company that really offers a great product and helps protect its customers. Would recommend highly, but Job is straight commission, which is a challenge."
good,"Aflac is a great place to work if your great with people and focused on wanting to help people. Aflac is a commission based market unless you are an assistant or in high up management. The environment was great, they took the time out of their day to teach me the things I needed to know. You must be determined to want this job"
good,"Fun fast paced worksite supplemental insurance provider. Sell group or individual supplemental benefit plans. Cancer, Accident, Disability, Critical Illness, and other related coverages. Fully portable and affordable plans that pay you cash if sick or hurt, not to doctors or hospitals."
good,"fun workplace, good incentive, company travel, fun organization activities. work time you make your own schedule and not being micro manage. hard when started"
good,"aflac is great. local management was clickish. if you weren't in their click they didn't help you grow your book of business. the company itself is a good company. i loved what i did with them. but if you weren't part of the local click, you got little to no help. the first manager i had was great but her replacement sucked."
good,"At first we are given companies in the area to go to and check on. When those run out we need to get our own leads. I did classed to become an agent, and there was continuing training available. This whole job was on commission only."
good,Management needs to spend more time with new associates.  Make sure they are ready for the field.  The products are good and will yield great benefit to the customer as well as the organization.
good,Aflac has the potential for a starting sales associate/insurance producer to be successful.  However it takes some time before becoming successful.  Cold calls/Corporate drops/Referrals needed in order to book appointments.  Trainings available to help sharpen knowledge and presentation tools.
good,Just before I retired I was in charge of the Bids and Proposals software where you could respond to and put a bid together online. We also were going to a group insurance plan that was much more complicated.
good,"I loved the atmosphere and products offered by AFLAC.  Conversations into products offered by AFLAC were made easy because everyone loves the duck.  As I recall, I was doing extremely well for a new insurance agent and received recognition on a weekly basis for the job I was doing.  Unfortunately, I was not able to survive financially on 100% commission based income.  I think it was the right job for me at the wrong time and left the company feeling that had I been able to withstand my financial obligations for at least a year that the residual income from my efforts would have rewarded me handsomely."
good,"For the most part you are your own boss and can make your own hours. But, you must be prepared to work 40+ hours in the first few years in order to establish a client base. It is commission only so salary is all over the place. Always on the search for new accounts/clients."
good,"Aflac was good to me for over 10 years, but with healthcare up in the air in this country it is a time for change for me.  The culture is good it is tough getting started in the beginning but the training is good."
good,"Good place to work, friendly people. Good job environment with very professional staff. Management is very helpful and organized. Good place to grow into an Aflac agent for sales position."
good,"Great if you are comfortable with cold-calling. Commission only income is just not for everyone. I did not like looking for business and begging people to listen to the opportunity,"
good,"Aflac was a great starting point for me to get used to being a professional.  The job was very tedious as we were cold calling non stop all day long."
good,"If you are looking to get rich fast and easy this is not the job for you!  This company is helping people better than anyone else like them.  Their product and access to information is above and beyond any other.  However, you have to WORK for it!!  What you put in is what you get out!"
good,I will honestly say that Aflac was the best company I have ever worked for and I am definitely going to strive to get back there once my health is stabilized. They treat their customers and employees with respect and I love that! It was a great experience.
good,"Aflac is an awesome company to work for.  However, it is very hard work.  It is basically running your own business.  Therefore you must be dedicated and hardworking for it to pay off.  The biggest thing in this business is to be extremely organized.  The pay is great once you get to the point of helping people when you sign them up for one of Aflac's many policies."
good,"If you are willing to put in the hours and have a supplemental income, the pay off is worth while.  Management team is great and willing to help."
good,"A typical work day consisted of multitasking.  I had to produce 98 files in one work day while maintaining at least 98 percent quality.  In addition, I had to answer emails, make phone calls to internal and external customers.  I worked our daily money report by reconciling and applying premiums to the correct policies.  The last eight years of employment within Aflac, I performed with no direct supervision as a home teleworker.  Overall, this is a great company to work for with many employee incentives."
good,This position is a Self Employed position. I have been an Independent Agent simply because it allowed me the scheduling flexibility to care for an ailing parent. I now intend to recapture my professional life in the Hospitality Industry.
good,Difficult to obtain new business because  geographical territory wide open to all agents. Advancement predicated on dollar value of sales.
good,Great Oppurtinuity with Flexable hours.  Aloows the freedom to meet people and try and help their businesses.
good,A typical day would start with generating leads in the morning.  We had various websites for sourcing business leads.  Once leads were generated then started the phone calls to set up meetings with the business owners.  I never made it past this part of the process.
good,"It's an opportunity to make your own business work. Calling on businesses, getting to know what their concerns are & how you can help makes for rewarding days."
good,I have found Aflac to have a very excellent work atmosphere. Aflac provides an outstanding supporting cast to help you overcome your personal challenges of being a new agent.
good,"Typical day at the office we would go into the office in the morning, have a morning meeting about things that have changed, and goals that have been reached, would then proceed to plan out the day, on most days this included making a list of companies or potential customer to visit and set up a presentation to offer Aflac to the employees."
good,The job consists of creating relationships with clientele and developing a consultative approach to solving employer needs.
good,"Cold calls, make appts.with clients, help with claims,speak to headquarters about coverage, holding seminar on coverage."
good,"My day was fun and challenging. I answered the company phones all day for Aflac as well as administered 200 open claim files with policy holders. Daily I checked the status of claims with Aflac Headquarters in Georgia. I followed up with physicians, hospitals and medical facilities to process paperwork to submit client's claims. I worked with clients over the phone, in person, and via faxed documents to open new claim files. I reorganized and administered a claim filing system for each client instead of having to go through large stacks of claims put in a manilla folder. My reorganization made it quick and simple to locate individual claim files. I had a good repor with my supervisor, the owner and all the Aflac Agents that I worked with on a daily basis."
good,Our internship revolved around making calls to people who submitted their resume and get them to come to seminars about the job itself. The workplace was really relaxed and flexible.
good,"Too much work, not enough back office resources to handle it all. very stressful! "
good,"The only thing that is negative is the fact that this job was only commission. It makes it very hard in the beginning because you have to work as hard as you can to get as many appointments as possible. Very laid back though, good people."
good,This company is a great company to work for. the training and guidance Aflac gives makes you feel you are apart of a family.They teach you many different business skills.
good,Good company to partner with. Provides good supplemental insurance at a decent price and is fairly sincere in wanting and helping associates be successful.
good,"Aflac is a supportive organization with opportunities to advance, to learn and grow. Everyone is treated with fairness and guided by the leadership's emphasis on growth with caring."
good,"A good place to start off, as a recruiting intern. Provides an individual with the opportunity to grow personally and professionally. I was an intern and was pushed out of my comfort zone which I was grateful for."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Aflac, I was in the Customer Call Center and the job itself was rewarding.  The part of the job that I did not like was the inconsistency of the schedules and how often the schedules changed.  A Call Center is a type of job that has to be very strict and micro managed so this makes the job really stressful."
good,"Great company and job, not for the socially weak. Must have great people skills and be okay with commission based pay. I love Aflac, it just isn't the right fit for me."
good,They are a really great place to work. The atomosphere is great and the people are great. If a call center job is what you like to do I would highly recommend working at Aflac!
good,I wish I would have continued my career in with AFLAC. It was rewarding to help others with AFLAC'S products of supplemental insurance. Enjoyed the people I worked with everyday.
good,I sold health insurance and life and insurance. I learned a lot about products and sales. I liked my co workers. I feel could have got more help and been more successful would have got help. There training ok . I loved helping my customers.
good,"Cold calling daily, canvassing daily. Open enrollments, new accounts. Family oriented.  Advancement is a plus. Great training of new associates and vets.  GREAT products,"
good,AFLAC has a great product and can help people save what's most important to them. As an agent it can be tough since it is a full commission job and requires a lot of patience.
good,"AFLAC Sales is great! It is a vass opportunity to help people build their healthcare portfolio and make important insurance decisions based upon their family's needs.  The challenge is working on a commission module. If you do not sale, you to not get paid.  If you sell, in order for your income to stay, the clients have to keep their policies for at least one year."
good,"I highly enjoy my job. I'm always doing and learning something new! This is a 1099 job, so its make your own hours and work as much or as little as you would like.  I spend a great deal of time prospecting and looking for new businesses to partner up with."
good,"This was a great position and experience, but i was unable to continue with the company because it was a straight commission position."
good,I loved working at AFLAC enjoyed being there period. It was an amazing experience. There were we laughed and joked around and there were times when we got right down to business.
good,Commission only so you must be able to sustain financially until you are able to write your own business.  Your income potential is limitless and bases on your drive. The more you work the more you make!
good,Good training and support from co-workers.  Great product with excellent history and brand recognition. Met lots of very nice business owners and their staff.
good,"If you stay focused and make calls, you can make some good money. However, if you put no time in, you wont make any money.aa"
good,"When I was employed with this company, I felt proud and encouraged my family and friends to learn about the products.  After leaving, I have remained friends with both peers and managers.  A culture of family."
good,"Need to have a working capital base as you build your business. AFLAC has great products and delivers what they promise. I still hold AFLAC policies."
good,I enjoyed my time at Aflac. I learned a lot and was able to take those skills with me as I journeyed to other sales positions. I had the pleasure of interacting with various individuals.
good,Really fun- write your own ticket and paycheck! Must be motivated and organized.  Be ready to roll with the changes.  Must be able to approach strangers and communicate well.
good,Customer service Representative position at Aflac requires 8-9 hrs via phone reviewing customer policies. Position was good and pay was fair for job duties.
good,"I would get to answered phones and help people get in contact with an agent to help them with there claims. I learned about so many different things while working for Aflac. Management was very friendly and fun, loved working with them. The hardest part of the job was taking calls and messages from the ones who were calling due to a death, cancer or something regarding there child. It was good feeling though at the end of the day knowing I helped people and their families at the end of the day though, and because of that it made me love doing the job."
good,They teach you all you need to know and give you all of the resources needed to be successful.  You must take advantage of all that's given to you by this company if you really want to make a lot of money.  Self discipline is a must to be successful
good,"The team I worked with was very helpful in my onboarding process.  From the culture, policies, and procedures - the teamwork made this process pretty easy."
good,"Created reports and compiles data concerning productivity levels and deadlines, and Released information according to company policies and procedures."
good,"Flexibility, job security, working with best friend, meeting new people and changing lives. Management is very helpful and want to see you succeed. Hard work but pays off. Best opportunity ever!"
good,"If you are a ""go getter"", and are not deterred by the answer NO, then Aflac may be a right fit for you. The company is wonderful, by providing a need to employees. The pay is good, but cancellations do happen, this is why you have to keep knocking on businesses door until someone says yes. All of these are Cold calls, NO leads, is a hughe downside. Be careful of your manager, they could be cut throat and all about the money you put in his pocket. Not all managers are like that though. You will go through a 2yr training phase with your District Coordinator, my DC flaked out and left me holding the bag and figuring things out as I went. But that doesn't happen most of the time. There is a pattern to what you do, but every situation is different and one companies need will not be another."
good,"I get to travel , I get to have fun traveling making friends on the job, I get to meet new people, I also had a chance to earn some special recognition at my job ."
good,I have been an agent for Aflac for a few months.  Building your business can take some time but the people are great. The management are great. The hardest part of this job is the Cold Calling.
good,"The Company is an excellent company, the training is exceptional, however the customers are very distrustful and uncooperative"
good,"great company to work for, but  working for commissionn is not desirable. The job required that I daily seek business owners interested in Aflac."
good,"I excelled in the insurance business, however, I am one who needs security and stability. And not knowing whether or not if I was going to receive a paycheck was hard on a single mother."
good,"Aflac is an absolutely wonderful product offering cash benefits to employees in one day! I've seen it save people's houses, cars, utilities, and even lives! They have a children's cancer hospital and research center, they cover benefits for accidents, hospital, cancer, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, dental, vision, and short term disability, etc. They encourage us to remind our policyholders to file claims that are unexpected as well as remind them to get physicals so they can file claims for that as well! They love to pay claims and even encourage policyholders to file for the Next Day Pay! It's a fantastic company and I love what they offer!"
good,"I answer phone, faxing and email claim forms when needed as well as filing claim forms when needed.  Made spreadsheets for the weekly production of clients for a weekly submission."
good,it was commission only so it was very difficult to pay for gas and tolls driving from business to business without a steady income
good,"This is a sales driven company with a great opportunity if your willing to work for it. Fun place to work with supportive management. There are many opportunities to develop and grow thru the training and developmental courses."
good,great pay and benefits. great training and learning opportunities. fun conventions. there are a lot of test and qualifications. pretty good opportunities for advancement.
good,"I enjoy my co-workers, busy environment and daily tasks. A typical work day involves maintaining and creating reports for the manager, recruiting tasks, training and assisting interns, answering phones, checking on claims and ordering supplies."
good,"My coworkers are great, they all know how to have fun and they are very good at what they do.  Aflac is a great company that takes care of their policyholders and has a very good product to sell."
good,Can be a good place to learn in a working environment if the right people help you. I really enjoyed my time with the company.
good,It should be a 'shoe-in' to employers but there is no system in place to keep independent agents from going to companies that have been called on multiple times - thereby frustrating the gate keeper.
good,"Aflac is a great company and the benefits can really help employees with out of pocket costs for injury or illness.  A typical day would be calling on businesses either on the phone or in person to set appointments to talk with the owner about benefits for the employees.  This is difficult because Aflac is misunderstood and it takes the business owner to be open minded and willing to listen to how it works.  "
good,I love this company. They take care of their employees and the pay and benefits are great!
good,Aflac has a great training program and is the perfect career for those people that are well versed in business administration.
good,"My current position entails sourcing and developing my own book of business. A typical day includes 95% of cold calling business to business. Therefore, an agent such as myself has to remain up to speed on current events and what is affecting the market I seek to serve. Upper management and co-workers are more than helpful to ensure the success of my business efforts. It's the culture of AFLAC. The most difficult part of my position is to overcome the objections of a would be client. Overall, I really enjoy the interaction and exchange with persons of various backgrounds and perspectives."
good,"Aflac is a great company to work for.  I would recommend their products to everyone.  However, if a steady, consistent income is what you are looking for then its not the job for you.  They have a great compensation package but it is commission based only.  If you have the time to build a book of business or have a natural talent for sales then you need to check them out."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is educating the people who are excited to learn new information.
good,Typical day at work was 7-5. Learned how to approach businesses and set up meetings with business owners to discuss providing benefit programs through their business to their employees. Once meeting set then the meeting is conducted and employees who want to participate were sat down with. Co-workers were mainly young adults late 20's early 30's. The hardest part of the job was trying to get your feet on the ground with only compensation being commission. The most enjoyable part was traveling around the state meeting different people.
good,Working for Aflac was fun but the income was 100%
good,I was the Sales Associate to the Regional Sales Manager. I scheduled all her appointments for promoting Aflac. Prepared all
good,"On a daily basis, I would already have my research of where I would prospect and would meet individuals."
good,Good place to work. I learned about calling on businesses and how to offer them some private benefits to enhance the benefits they may have in place at the time. Co-workers and management were good to work with very supportative.
good,I learned to be self sufficient; and to keep my time management skills intact.
good,"I provided awareness to the importance of purchasing Life, Accidental and Death Benefit insurance to all interested clients."
good,"Work as a team or by yourself but the training is awesome.  I have learned a lot about myself and business. "
good,"AFLAC is an A rated Company. We have great people to work for and  "
good,I meet alot of new people. This is a great job to do networking. I enjoyed working with my mentor she was nice and very smart. I learned alot from working here great experience.
good,This career has a ton of flexibility but it's a very hard job. It is not for people who are discouraged easily. Your DSC is who will train you and shape you into the Aflac agent you need to be.
good,"I couldn't be happier! As much as it's hard to get it started, the family atmosphere is worth it! You have all the support that you want, you decide your career here. I've shared my hardships & frustration with different levels of management & only get encouragement to push through... they have been there before too & they are there to help you the entire way."
good,"Aflac is an extraordinary company that does extraordinary things for policyholders. I'm not saying it's easy to be a sales rep because it isn't. You have to really go out there and get your accounts! But if you do, you will sell a product that you will always be proud of.   I love my Aflac!"
good,"Sales are all about how you can relate to who it is you are selling to. You may get introduced to numerous business owners, and along the way find that not only do you have something to assist their business out with but that they are the very same people who can help build your business. The key is to find out what business owners want. It is all about their business and adding solutions to make it run at its optimum. Benefits are the key to retention, competitiveness, maximization, and growing a company to be the best that it can be because let's face it....without satisfied, loyal employees where will a business go."
good,"Great company to work for"
good,"AFLAC has a great atmosphere, and the people are great. Just remember that you are the business owner first, so you have to go in with a plan and have some contacts that will be prospective customers in mind. It is very fast paced, and it is easy to get sidetracked. "
good,"Continual education is a must with Aflac."
good,I loved my time at the “Duck!” Great corporate culture and plenty of room to grow. I was there for three years and moved up the IT food chain every year.
good,Aflac truly values its employees and customers. One of the leading medical insurance companies to be a part of that continues to have vertical growth.
good,"I love being an agent with Aflac, simply because I can help people in a variety of ways. Especially, people in their ladder years and they feel there's no other options for insurance coverage. It allows me to give people hope, when they felt, as if all hope was gone."
good,As an independent Agent you get what you put in and nothing more. The commissions are strong and the product line is second to none. You just have to be prepared financially to give yourself time to build your book of business.
good,Great place to work and learn about running your own business. Supportive office and motivational office. Need to work very hard to be successful. Learned a lot.
good,"Monday morning at work includes mandatory Monday morning meetings with different teams, purpose of which is to address plan/target for the week. Everyone plans their schedule since we are 1099 workers. After the meeting, I send out or respond to emails and also make phone calls to schedule new or follow up on old appointments"
good,"Make own customer contacts and appointments, sometimes working 12 hour days.  Met with customer to complete documents to be submitted to corporate office for processing and issuing policy.  "
good,"Aflac is a great company good to their employees and do alot of charity philanthropy here in Columbus like the Amos Cancer Center, their cancer and accident supplement insurance products are the best in the business employees get a discount on the products, good training and extra pay for studying plus fun events and paid vacation packages, profit sharing, call center can be stressful with claims but have good team leaders and morale boosters fun events, on site gym and daycare and wonderful security officers and a friendly credit union staff."
good,Aflac is an awesome company.  The organization is focused on the well-being of their employees and their customers.  The company leaders are heavily involved with their employees and have an open-door policy.
good,environment was fun and there was a lot of work but the training was excellent so the work was easy. There was a lot of work to cram in 8hrs with no overtime
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits, however, advancements and job considerations is all about who you know. Take you time on any assignments and questions"
good,Love working with other agents and the customers. Great learning and many opportunities. Hardest part of the day was acquiring leads. I enjoyed working at my own pace and from home.
good,"The first month is spent learning and mastering the products and communication skills. Management is more than willing to help whenever you need it. You have to really be careful about time management as this career is strictly commission based. A majority of this career is driving, conversing, and maintaining relationships with local businesses. Also focuses heavily on technology for enrollments."
good,"Aflac is overall a fabulous place to work, culture is great, benefits and pay are very competitive and in my opinion better than most in our surrounding area and training is offered."
good,"Aflac provides flexibility in daily schedule as well as what is required for compensation.  Working a commission job is difficult, but there is a strong support system with Aflac which helps newer agents.  The hardest part of the job is getting the leads and doing prospecting as a new agent."
good,"I was sponsored by Aflac to became licensed in the state of New York to sell Accident and Health Insurance. Once I followed there test preparation program and passed my state test, I began work. Once i entered the field I prospected potential clients with the guidance of a senior sales representative. I learned a lot about the insurance business and more about people. This was a wonderful experience and opportunity. I recommend it to anyone looking to into the insurance business."
good,while working at aflac i was giving the autonomy to work alone out in the field. there where meetings to discuss tools we could implement in the field
good,"Aflac is a great company to work for. Great benefits and good pay. They believe in training, training and more training. The Aflac way culture is based on high integrity and moral values. They expect only the best out of you and they compensate you well."
good,"Heavy scheduling for VP"
good,good company to work for. The sky is the limit.You set the ceiling for your success.The management works in your behalf. The more successful you are the more they push you and reward your hard effort.
good,The leadership team is awesome. You have District Managers that care about your success. You have to put in the work and remain diligent and disciplined.
good,"A typical day includes networking with businesses and individuals along with educating people about health care. I have learned so much there, and the training they provide is great. The hardest part of the job is the lack of pay and benefits for agents just getting started. It is commission only."
good,"You are paid for what you do...no more and no less."
good,"As an independent agent, the work day is determined by your ability to create a workable schedule and communicate effectively with others, while generating contacts for new business and old business."
good,As a Regional Sales Coordinator with Aflac I was able to utilize my experience to experience double digit growth 3 years in a row. My reason for leaving was a change in direction and philosophy of the senior management. Excellent company!!
good,"Assist with all aspects of administrative management, including but not limited to directory maintenance, logistics, monitoring and coordinating between athletic departments. "
good,"Lots of Perks in the job and awards/incentives when you hit your targets"
good,Days mostly consisted of cold calling arriving at businesses to inform business owners of Aflac and the opportunities associated with Aflac. 100% commission salary based. Very supportive local as well as up the chain management. Hardest part of the job was consistency of sales initially. The most enjoyable was getting to meet new people and see new businesses emerging around the community and getting to know them and their services or products.
good,"I love Aflac, but it is very hard to live on commission. I've learned that I really am a people person and that I'm very likeable. Everyone in the company is so incredibly nice, but that doesn't mean you'll always have money. It's hard to handle so much rejection daily."
good,"Did 90% of Office recruiting helped the Region Sales Coordinator be the top in new associates company wide in growth for 2015."
good,"Prospecting is the hardest part of this job, cold calls are never easy. There is no base pay, making this job a sink or swim situation. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,The training team is a very well oiled machine. Wish there was more time in a day to go to businesses. Very demanding work hours not suitable for one income families. You should be good at sales. Also be comfortable at bombarding businesses multiple times. They are a great company to work for just not my gig.
good,"This is a great a company to work for, What I like most about this job was the bosses were very personable,  They help you get to your goals without being a pest."
good,"IF you are looking for versatility in a job, becoming an Aflac Agent will make it happen for you. Is grate for talking to people from various working sectors."
good,Great company to work for now and in the future.  Is a full commission job that requires lots of self discipline to become successful.  Job requires to to go make cold calls and hear the work No many times during the day.
good,Aflac was a great place to work with a positive working environment. Managers and co-workers were very helpful and encouraging. It also included special training by the Regional Sales Coordinator to help us be better agents.
good,"Start out with daily meetings to keep track of all the work progress for the week and the day. On a daily basis I learn new things about the job that I work, the hardest part of the job is typically the understanding process once a project have been given out."
good,excelente empresa para desarrollar destrezas de ventas y servicio al cliente
good,Aflac is the only place I have worked in my life.  This is a very caring culture. Everyone is friendly and the management is fair.
good,"Ambitious day at work Daily...."
good,"If you work hard and stay dedicated you have the potential that is unlimited.  However, you must be able to be self motivated and very organized.  Not a job for just anyone you need to be able to pursue your goals"
good,It has been a wonderful experience being able to work with different cultures. Everyday is a new day of educating and helping people with regards to protecting the greatest asset that they have which is themselves.
good,"I learned so much while working at Aflac.  Everyone in the office was always willing to help with any questions I had and the management level was full of leaders, not just managers."
good,"Very good company to work for. The agents and coordinators are amazing people. I learned a lot and enjoyed my opportunity to work for them. The hardest part of the job would have to be the constant calling and being turned down, but everyone is very encouraging."
good,Aflac provides the much needed cash that claims out of pocket expenses during unexpected health events and accidents.
good,Present program and products to business customers. Revisit existing customers to ensure expectations are met. Excellent customer service skills.
good,"I started my sales career with Aflac in 2000. I loved my career with the company. The company was great with their agents. Very family oriented, positive experience."
good,"This is the BEST company Ive worked for yet!! The HQ are in Columbus GA. We had employee appreciation week not day, we played games the company put together, we had family day each year where you picked family tickets to Six Flags, Dave and Busters, movies, skating, Wild waves, etc. W e received profit sharing checks each November that was like 1100 but 600 after taxes. :( All in all awesome place if you can handle to stress of a call center."
good,A typical day at work involves going out and getting to know business owners.  I've learned people skills. The management style is laissez faire.  My co-workers are awesome and there is much cohesion and little backbiting or gossiping. The hardest part of the job is that working for commission is difficult.  The most enjoyable part of the job is schedule freedom .
good,A typical work day come in put up freight. how to make sales and make the customers satisfied. i loved my manager she was very helpful at anytime. i really enjoyed working with my co workers. I really never had a hard day. The most enjoyable part of my dayi would say would be making alot of sales and reaching our goals.
good,Co-workers are amazing.  Hardest part of the job is staying focused with so many tasks to focus on.  I have learned working for myself has made me more organized so that I can complete my tasks in a timely manner.
good,I was in a training program at Aflac where I rotated through the Marketing Department. Aflac is really a great company who value their people but the management in my area could and should have been stronger.
good,"You can meet all kinds of different people while you are learning a lot about the insurance industry. You also meet agents who have been around for a while, so you get the best of both worlds as you learn."
good,"Aflac is a great place to work and grow. The company truly cares about the public in which is serves. I enjoy working here and although I will not remain at Aflac because I am relocating, it is a great place to grow and advance!"
good,"Very Awesome. I love working here. It as a great opportunity if you have had sales experience before. I will give this caution: Do not take this job if you cannot survive one month on no income. I did not start making good money until after my first month, but it is phenomenal now. I get to pick my own hours, I make income without doing anything, and I love what I do. Great investment."
good,Healthcare and Life Insurance services. Lead Generation/ Pipeline Development.
good,As an independant sales agent for Aflac I was able to set my own schedule and work at my own pace. Compensation is based on commissions and residuals which increase every year I was there.
good,I love what I do everyday. Aflac is a wonderful company to work for. Hard to make enough money.
good,Aflac is a great company however is 100% commission. The turnover is very high.
good,"Flexible! Be hungry, organized, and goal-oriented and u will do well here.  Don’t be afraid of selling. The product sells itself. Great training and support. Coordinators succeed when you do."
good,I really enjoyed working at Aflac. The most enjoyable part of working for Aflac was helping people get protection for their loved ones. I also enjoyed the flexibility and the income potential.
good,"Aflac is one of the few remaining companies that actually care about their people. They have good benefits and a great working environment. It’s a generational company, so breaking into management can be difficult."
good,Aflac is a great place to work if you can handle commision sales. you don't always make money but you have the ability to make a lot! its a great environment with amazing people and your time is really your own. just be careful you're considered self employed here so you have to pay your own taxes every year.
good,Aflac is a great company and a great way to start a sales career. It is commission only so you have to be able to budget well. The job itself is easy and hard at the same time.
good,"Great company overall, but there’s a lot of  leaders (not necessarily executive level) that only care about themselves and make decisions without considering how it affects their direct reports. Work is demanding but it could just be my department..."
good,"I enjoy having a job where I am compensated greatly, make my own schedule, and get to help people.  In my personal experience, it has been the best opportunity I've taken.  Yes, it is not for the shy or faint at heart, but it is for those who are hungry/teachable.  You are 100% commission, but that means you're 100% in control.  I've brought many of my best friends into the company as well, that's how much I love it."
good,"AFLAC is a wonderful company to work for you just need to understand what you are signing up for when you go in. If you don't have the mind of an entrepreneur and can afford a slow build, then this is not the job for you."
good,"Great company to work for, they help in every way they can so that you can achieve your goals. They have yearly conventions which if you qualify, you can attend and enjoy the experience."
good,Aflac provided me with a great opportunity to essentially start my own business and a work-life balance that escaped me in the tech sector.  There was a constant theme of developing new business and closing new account while supporting existing clients.  The residual income was great and I still get a check from them every month even though I have not actively worked for them since 2012.
good,I love insurance they are very good company to work for great incentives.  Earnings based on your sales abilities as total commission sales no base salary.  They offer great incentives and bonuses if meet criteria.  Do not really care for the cold calling.
good,"Aflac is definitely an opportunity to have endless financial wealth, but you must put in the work.  You will have to go out and prospect, make phone calls, be organized and have the will to succeed.  Basically go at your own pace which can be difficult for most."
good,"Assignments included editing insurance policies, marketing materials and co newsletter. I edited all company publications and the corporate newsletter."
good,"On the road every day you must be ready to get it go with as many B2B opportunities as possible in any given day. Great products for any age customer that was very well designed for the common man, women or family."
good,"Diverse workplace, job duties and opportunities"
good,"Aflac was not that bad to work for I still have Aflac stuffed animals that say Aflac. My manager was not bad he roped me into one day going to a coal company to sign up workers. That was about the only paycheck I got from them. They did make us go to Morgantown, WV to stay at a hotel for a sales meeting. I think I left them after that."
good,great people to teach and guide you. no limit for the amount of success or pay you receive. the amount of work coordinates with the pay when done correctly. fast job placement. great teammates and awesome staff atmosphere. guided for success
good,"I worked as a personal admin for a regional office. Very family friendly, wasn’t paid benefits because the managers pay their admins out of their own pockets. This job was my favorite I had ever had and it was sad to leave."
good,"May have changed lately with a lot of change and new people from competitors but when I was there it was a great company, generous and fair and they trusted their leaders  and employees to do what they thought was right. I worked in the field under fantastic managers, all of whom have now been transitioned out or retired."
good,Loved the job. have to have a go getter mentality in order to survive. if you want to make money you have to go make it yourself. great culture. quarterly events are amazing
good,"The people are great and the education is wonderful.  Very hard to get appointments with the businesses and then get them to work with you to move to the next level.  Unfortunately it is not for me.  I will keep pursuing until something else comes along, but I have been with them for 6 weeks and no income.  I am looking at another 4-5 weeks before I may have income which is less than I need.  I could work a part time job on weekends, but that then does not allow me any family time."
good,So long as you acquired 2 businesses per month you were offered a dinner on the Regional Manager. you also could receive gas cards and gift cards or maybe even tickets .
good,"Working at Aflac has given me great customer service skill, greeting people in the office, setting up meeting, making appointments on the phone. Opened up a new world in the insurance industry and understanding the purpose of insurance and working in a office. I prefer to have a more hands on type of work environment."
good,"As an independent Agent you work as hard as you want and can advance as high as you desire. "
good,"Aflac will treat you like family "
good,Love the pride that comes along with working for this company! Aflac treats employees like family. My job is very fast paced but I thoroughly enjoy helping others.
good,Answered Phones
good,"A typical day of work would begin at 7AM for training on products and policies. 8AM-9AM would be team meetings and coordinating of the day's schedule. 9AM-4PM Field Training for new hires and acquiring sales goals. 4PM-5PM Head back to the office to recap and review, set up the calendar for the following day."
good,"Nothing negative to say about this experience. It is a positive atmosphere, with delightful co workers.  The office space is wonderful and the product is top shelf."
good,"A typical day at work entailed several forms of communication with clients, fellow agents, and those in leadership positions. Visits to client's homes and work places were an every day occurrence. Benefits counseling and claims filing. It was a fast paced occupation that required networking and a knack to understand people in order to effectively meet their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely calling a policyholder to inform them of their claim being accepted and paid!"
good,Great place to work with driven and dedicated team members. Merit based culture and many opportunities for advancement for those who are willing to work hard and stay focused.
good,"This is a wonderful company to work for. Great morale, forward-thinking and we have lots of fun as a company in addition to working extremely hard to service our customers. Departmental wise, there are a few weak links in the management chain, and they can often times make doing your job rather difficult. Micromanagement and petty behavior is rampant in my particular department. Other than that, the pay, benefits, and other added services/corporate discounts are the BEST hands down!!"
good,I was promoted 2 times at this job in the first 5 years and truly enjoyed it. The environment was laid back and fair. I plan to go back in the near future.
good,You are your own boss working on your own schedule. Up front  premium commissions are good but it takes a long time to build a client list and residual income.
good,"My DSC Team is responsible for insuring the most amount of risk based on age demographic and our focus is closing the gap between the highest out of pocket medical expenses through comprehensive, supplemental medical benefit packages."
good,"-awesome manager and team leader"
good,Being self employed gives you an opportunity to grow as a professional. Loved the experience of investigating cases in the private sector. Taking advantage of opportunity to expand my business.
good,Aflac is a great company to work for. Competitive environment where growth is dependent on the work you put in. Geared for highly motivated individuals who are looking to get out of their work what they put into it.
good,I have loved working for AFLAC the last 7 years where it was easy to exceed my current income with excellent training and caring mentors! AFLAC is hands down the security employers and employees are looking for with such a flux in benefits! It's all about attitude organization and being coachable. Now I receive residual income each month that is over half of what I was making pre Aflac before I even get out of bed! If you enjoy people and being on the move this is a WIN WIN!
good,Aflac Inc. (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.
good,"Great Company, I love what this company is all about.  Great work life balance. The hardest part of this job is having to  get small business to set up Aflac for their employees."
good,Learning a balance between work and life challenged me initially. Enjoy getting people to understand how the policies help. Sometimes frustrated when people don't update payroll deductions in a timely fashion.
good,Unlimited income potential.  Very Honest company. Good compensation. Must prospect constantly.  No health benefits.  Flexible hours. Good training. No income  stability.
good,"Depended heavily on self motivation to cold call perspective businesses in person on a regular basis."
good,Company is Top Notch and it all revolves around your people skills and how well you deal in a team environment and how well you are at listening and following directions but for the most part this company Rocks and more ways then  one can imagine
good,"Aflac is the best company to work for! They really know how to treat their employees! From great benefits to great leaders, Aflac is all around a great place to work!"
good,"I enjoy going to work everyday and I learn a lot about SSIS, SSRS, and Business Objects. I also enjoy the Reporting aspect for Business Intelligence as well as the Data Analysis work I perform there as well."
good,Good boss; maintained daily office procedures and data entry; provided customer services and set up an appointment or meeting.
good,Amazing work life balance. Very friendly colleagues and helpful management. The company is highly ethical and lays a lot of emphasis on employee well being.
good,"One of best companies you could work for. A day consisted of asking employers to let the company offers our products to their employees on payroll deduction. Your day might include enrolling employees in a plan and you might be training a new agent at the same time, I learned how to ask for the payroll slot and ask for the sale. You learn that sometimes you get a no instead of a yes. And you move on to the next prospect. The most enjoyable part of my job besides selling was delivering a claim check(when we use to be able to do this) to an insured who was going through cancer treatment or recovering from a disability and hearing them tell you that this payment is going to help with their financial stress."
good,Aflac was a great company to work for and to present to clients.  Most days were spent talking with clients and prospects about what we could offer new emmployees.  The management and co-workers were extremely great to work with.  The hardest part of the job was in the beginning while I built a strong client base.  The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing from clients how they had benefited from one of our products during a strees period of their lives.
good,This is a great company to work for if you have the drive and dedicate the proper amount of time to the basics and listen to your supervisors.  You are able to create your own schedule which is another perk.
good,"Great company to work for. Typical day would to services existing accounts, obtains orders, and establishes new accounts by planning and organizing daily work schedule to call on existing or potential sales outlets and other factors"
good,"•	Administers bidding process and contracts for vendor performance/compliance for the purpose of securing items and/or services within budget and in compliance with district and/or state regulations."
good,Aflac is a wonderfully diverse place to work. I am proud to say that I work for Aflac. The best part about my job is working with great co-workers.
good,"Aflac is a well recognized company with a full array of supplemental insurance products most people need.  As a Producer, I find my typical day to be on the phone prospecting and talking with prospective business owners/managers about our Company's products and learning about the needs of their employees.  I'll also spend time visiting prospective businesses, presenting the Aflac product suite of services to employees.  I'll also follow up with existing employees, cross sell additional Aflac products/services and will occasionally have to handle a policy holder claim."
good,"The AFLAC - Los Alamitos Branch has the best leadership team in place.  From the Leadership of the Regional Manager to the District Managers, the work environment is one that is set up for optimal success.  They help, nuture and support their Agents through guidance, support and an environment that is both fun, pleasant and encouraging."
good,"AFLAC is a great place to work, which is the same thing I advise anyone who ask.  I let them know if they are just starting out, to apply for the call center, because you will gain knowledge by interacting with different departments.  If you apply yourself and you are willing to learn, you will become a an asset to the company."
good,AFLAC is # 1 in the Supplemental Ins Market because their products work.  AFLAC has been helping people for 60-years!  Let AFLAC help you today...
good,Very good work environment. I am able to set my own work schedule.  Aflac is a very ethical company to work for.  Aflac provides supplemental insurance for individuals and groups to help pay benefits your major medical insurance doesn't cover.  This can be a great help when there is a catastrophic accident in ones family.
good,"I worked closely with my employees to help them give quality customer service to our customers.  Worked on a daily basis with my bookkeeper on areas of AR/AP, payroll.  Administered to insurances, vehicles, purchasing, insurances, human resources.  "
good,Seems to saturate the market with too many agents. Very good brand awareness. The training needs some tweeking.
good,"Great company to be associated with.  Great training, Wonderful opportunity for advancement."
good,"I was attracted to Aflac because of the flexibility in both the schedule and the option to move. The training that the company offers is top-notch, and I have two of the best supervisors any individual could ask for."
good,its a lot of work but it was challenging and good to meet different kind of people. 
good,I started out with a strong hope that people needed what I offered. I found it very rewarding to be able to help the majority of people who would need cash while they are recovering from being injured or sick and couldn't earn a paycheck. What became incredibly challenging was getting permission to get in front of people by their employer's to be able to offer an affordable policy ($7 to 10 per week) with a pre tax payroll deduction that made it more like $3 to $4 a week net.
good,Enjoyable work atmosphere with lots of employee appreciation.
good,It is a great place to work. What I learned is how to be professional and excellent customer service. The management is very helpful and truly concerned about individuals being successful. You will meet pleasant co-workers and even make some life long friends. The hardest part about the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part was Aflac offers competitive salary and excellent benefit packages. It would be a great honor and opportunity for anyone who wants to work for this company.
good,I’ve learned it takes commitment to the client and the employer equally to keep the business running effectively.
good,You work very independently with AFLAC but have support if needed! I enjoyed the flexibility with AFLAC and the ability to decided what kind of income I would make. You have to be willing to work hard at AFLAC and you will be rewarded!
good,Worked as an independent contractor on a commission only basis
good,A typical day at work was meeting with business owners and letting them know how they could provide supplement plans to help their employee in the event of an unexpected illness at a reasonable cost. What I learned while being at Aflac is you can help people provide addition coverage to their health insurance plan to coverage cost not covered under their insurance plan. My co-workers were great to work for. The hardest part of the job was when I relocated from NC to PA and seen how upper management could destroy an office that had great agents because numbers were down. So they took her position and demoted her because of an illness. Ahhh.
good,This isa great company to work for. Very family oriented and has great management. There is plenty of room to grow with this company
good,"I have learned a lot working at Aflac, and have gotten so much done helping the associates and organizing their storage unit."
good,"Good job if you can work on commission only basis, and like to do cold calling on businesses."
good,"great place to work, but is commission only sales. The hardest part is to differentiate the difference between health insurance and supplemental insurance"
good,I worked at Aflac for six years and I absolutely loved the culture. Work-life balance is encouraged. This is truly a company with integrity and vision. I was honored to be a part of this company and I appreciate everything I learned there. All around great place to work!
good,I think that the environment for women is really good. Good balance with work and home life. You can work from home or go to the office and work. You and direct your hours.
good,Its was an experience great training program there is an extensive but necessary training program with great staff the staff does gear towards seasoned agents but that's ok the job is important.....
good,"I love Aflac but they changed the manager when I was moving to Miami and the new manager was a bad person and I had to decided to resign my job, but if the previous manager had been there when I moved out I would never had to resign because she was the best."
good,"You must have the propensity to work for commissions only.  Your success lies directly on your shoulders."
good,I loved working for the people that i did. I had a hard time with shuffling work and life and was a stay at home mom before getting a job there. I didn't like making cold calls. It would have a been a totally different story if i was making calls to people who were interested.
good,I worked as an AFLAC Agent a in 2010 - 12 with super District and Regional Managers in NJ.  Excellent training and support provided by this team.  I enjoyed the flexible schedule and the ability to team up with other agents to support our clients.
good,Manager is always available for coaching. You can attend weekly meetings to learn from manager and other seasoned pros. Upbeat yet competitive. Bonus checks are great. Good commission rates.
good,"Lots of instruction"
good,Aflac is great but hardest part is generating your own leads.  Ive been with them 3 months and have yet to make a sale.  Until I make a sale im pretty much working for free
good,"the problem with this job is it is commission only.  There is no security at all.  Also, the hours are extremely high"
good,Aflac was a great place to work. The benefits are amazing. The hourly rate was not enough for cost of living. Management is superb. Work environment is like that of a family.
good,It was very stressful sometimes but Aflac also gave extra help and training when needed. We worked hard but we also got to play hard  too. They are a great company with wonderful benefits.
good,Aflac is a great place to work but it really depends on the department. I worked in the call center for 2 years and I realized that Im not a over the phone customer service person. but overall its a great company to work for
good,The atmosphere is awesome there.  The company as a whole is like a family and the environment is very productive. The employees thoughts and ideas are taken seriously and used for the advancement and ease of other employees in the future.
good,"Working at Aflac is an incredible opportunity that I would recommend to anyone interested in building their own business in the Insurance Industry. The compensation potential is extremely advantageous to new agents and Aflac provides a good platform for long term growth within a company. However, you should know what you are getting into before pursuing this career. As a new agent, your job  is predominantly dropping into businesses in your area or making prospecting calls, which can be very discouraging to those without the natural ability to sell their personal brand. If you can do that, you can have a very prosperous career with Aflac."
good,"Management wants you to succeed and will do everything possible to assist you. Fun place to work and competition is friendly, not cut-throat. Commission jobs aren't for everyone, but if you can handle rejection and are organized and self-directed, you can make a great living at this."
good,"In charge of generating and managing my on leads by knocking on doors and cold calling, also recruiting my own agents. I also had to conduct my own sales meetings and manage my own schedule."
good,"I trully agree.  Aflac in Columbus, Ga is a great place to work but I didn't want to make that move from Alpharetta, GA to Columbus, Ga."
good,"Fun Workplace. Lots of knowledge gained. Management is awesome, makes you feel like family. Most enjoyable part of the job is actually getting to help people."
good,I had a long and strong career here and loved the work.  Everything is at your pace.  You want to advance and make money work harder.  If you like to have this as part time it works out too.
good,"Aflac is a great place to work. The hours are flexible. The pay is good if your selling. That's the main problem, there's no guarantee when you get a check."
good,The main focus is sales. Must feel comfortable making cold calls and doing walks in at business to sell the product. If this is something you like than this would be a great job for you.
good,"Outside insurance sales; self-employed so complete control over work conditions; very good pay for hard work.  Good for future, and excellent opportunity for advancement."
good,"I loved the company but when I worked commissions, it was tough. There are so many other AFLAC agents out in the field.  Was not the right environment for me, but great company.  They offer excellent training and the people are nice."
good,"I worked with Aflac for a short period of time. I processed claims, using multiple computer screens and programs, I also learned ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes while employed with this company. I strengthened my skills to multi-task. I called to speak with policy holders doctors and their staff to retrieve information needed in order to complete their claims within an appropriate time."
good,Aflac cares about there employees. They provide excellent work environment. What I learned was my time management is key to working with Alfac.
good,"A typical day for me would consist of prospecting for 4 to 5 hr, then make follow up calls to some of my warm leads. The point of which I'm hoping to schedule a appointment to meet with the decision maker. Typically we have meetings once a week to update us on the latest policy changes and or updates. We do some training. It's a lot of fun."
good,"I'm only one month into the Aflac Torrance Summer 2016 internship program, but I only have good things to say about my experience so far!"
good,"Excellent support and education from local and regional managers and trainers."
good,"Overall I have nothing bad to say about Aflac. The company was good to me as an independent contractor, as well as a Corporate employee."
good,"I was on Wall Street for 28 years. Although I enjoyed working for AFLAC , I really need a fixed salary and a benefits package. I look forward to returning to the business I enjoy doing the most."
good,"I learned how to be an independent agent with the company, also being independent, you will need to bring a little of your own income to the table, because you will have to provide for your self, because its commission only. The coworkers are friendly, a great work environment, I in joyed not being tied down at an office all day, if I needed to go some where I could, the hardest part was getting a business opened, hearing someone telling you no and come back numerous of times, but over all it was a great learning experience."
good,Great work place with supportive upper management. It is different from anything I have ever done and I love that.  I have learned a tremendous amount about cooperate business.  My favorite part is the team I work with.  We support and encourage each other daily.
good,"responsible for handling the billing, accounting of various account managers. ensuring the amount of monthly payment were received and accurately applied to each member correctly"
good,This is a great company mostly because of the products that they offer.  The people are great and you can make the AFLAC experience whatever you want it to be!
good,"A typical day began with prospecting business for product presentation. How to call on businesses without reservation"
good,"•	Responsible for leading simultaneous projects with internal clients working with external research partners/vendors and advertising/media/digital agencies.

Responsible for all aspects of project management-conceptualization, project execution, survey design and methodology, data analysis, report writing, strategic recommendations, and presenting key business insights to executive clients to guide strategic decisions."
good,"Typical involves making hundreds of phone calls to perspective clients  and setting up times to meet.  Perspective clients being business owners, decision makers.  Usually there are several meetings a day where either you are sitting down with business owners or you are sitting down with employees of the perspective clients business and enrolling each one of the in health benefit plans that best suit their needs.  "
good,Aflac moved into the Group product markets and have been developing the operations and electronic file processing for this section of the company.
good,B2B sales of VB benefits for companies.  Prospecting businesses that would like to strengthen their healthcare program by adding AFLAC to their MM.
good,"Working on the company's hiring program."
good,"Great team spirit in both companies in helping co-workers in meeting district goals. I learned to be proactive in not only my continuing insurance training but being proactive in findling clients in a very competitive industry."
good,Aflac is a wonderful company who encourages personal and professional growth through a specially designed support system of trainers and team building exercises.
good,A place where you can see the value of the product. Its great to work with people that enjoy what they do and are motivated to help you do the best you can.
good,I loved the Company. I paid claims for accident policy holders.
good,"A typical day at work included meetings with District and/or Regional Coordinators, cold calling, prospecting, setting up and/or running enrollments/open enrollments, employer/employee presentations, working closely with associates/co-workers. I learned I don't care for cold calling or prospecting. Management is supportive and encouraging. Co-workers are supportive and encouraging. The hardest part of the job is getting employers to allow me to present my product. The most enjoyable part is meeting people."
good,"Amazing company to work for. Lots of fun to work for such a great company who has an amazing advertising campaign, great compensation and freedom to work where you want. The hardest part of the job is if you get with a bad manager, you cannot change to another one. The best of the job, people loved when I came in and would always ask to see our duck and they would often quack AFLAC at me."
good,"Aflac is a great company with outstanding values for employees and customers. Sales is constant hard work, but if you do alright within your first few years, you can live comfortably for many years to come."
good,AFLAC is a wonderful company to work for. They offer positive incentives for their employees. They are very informative. The products are great for the public and they do exactly what they say they will do.
good,"With the current health care laws changing and the economy in Rhode Island, it is not the easiest position to be in today. AFLAC is the best there is in the supplemental insurance industry. Because of changes in the market, I am looking to get back into an automotive industry or technical position."
good,Very experienced management team with tremendous drive to help you reach your goals.
good,I have been with this company 6 years and have enjoyed my tenure here
good,Wonderful company to work for but some managers are not worthy to be managers when you do not have people skills.  Without the correct management team your job can be miserable.
good,Great company to work for. You can excel in the company as long as you put in effort. The pay is really good in the call center and if you do your job you can easily get raises.
good,There is a great opportunity to make a great living if you are a hard worker. It is hard at first but after you have been with Aflac for a while it becomes much easier like any new job.
good,I had applied for a lot of jobs but did not have the needed experience. Aflac took a chance with me and I have now found my career. Everyone has been helpful teaching me how to be sucessful.
good,This company was one of the best companies that I've had the pleasure of working for. I prefer the office setting over any other field in the workforce. Very family-oriented feeling environment.
good,"I love Aflac. Great culture, atmosphere and benefits. The duck has provided a great life for me and my family and so many others throughout the country."
good,"I love it benefit and pay plus the time they give you off they celebrate all holidays.  They recognize you as a Person but you have to put in the work "
good,I enjoyed the people and environment however the work was not for me. I loved the flexible hours and there was great training. If sales is for you this is a great job.
good,"I loved working  for this company. Unfortunately I had some health issues, and problems with my providers office completing paperwork on time for my fmla claim. It placed me outside the companies attendance guidelines.  It is a great place to work."
good,"My experience at Aflac was life changing. Promotions and rewards are well thought out and achievable. "
good,"Very busy no advancement opportunity, but they give lots of prizes."
good,Definitely would recommend for motivated individuals who enjoy working with like-minded people. I think it is an environment that will grow and challenge you in the best of ways.
good,Get up every morning and be prepared for people to say yes or no. Once you have honed your skills and learn to love what you do the skies the limit. Unlimited income opportunities.
good,"Aflac is a forward moving and innovative company which values the input of all employees.  Aflac has a strong focus on family, community and teamwork."
good,"Aflac is a great start for anyone who wants to do sales, I worked with a great team, who did everything to provide the Associates with all the necessary tools to be successful."
good,Aflac was a satisfying place to work. I developed my own customers and assisted in team venues. The residuals were a main part of the long term paycheck.
good,"The most interesting part of this job is that there is no ‘typical’ day. One day I would be busy scheduling meetings and the other day I would be traveling on the road."
good,"My time at Aflac was very productive. We were given our tasks and goals and were given free reign to collaborate with other teams and come up with a solution, present to management and roll out those solutions to the Aflac enterprise."
good,"Great company.  Looking for a stable income.  Love the support and recognition offered by Aflac.  Great mentorship program, great leadership, excellent on the job training."
good,"This really is a great place to work, however, there is no such thing as an assigned territory.  Which makes it extremely difficult to find a business that a few agents have not already visited."
good,"As an administrator, this is a great place to work at.  The manager is very relaxed and lets you take unlimited vacation and sick days (as long as you don't abuse the flexibility).  Since it's salary, you get paid while on vacation or out of the office due to sickness."
good,"I love Aflac, I love my coworkers, they are a positive company to work for. I love what I do, there is a lot of travel time. You have to use your own vehicle which means more money in gas, more wear & tear on your vehicle. But you meet a lot of new people, room for growth, flexible schedule, more time with family. It's strictly a 1099 company. So they do not offer major medical health insurance, but you can get Aflac Supplemental Insurance on a employee discount. The pay varies. You work hard, but don't get paid until you have enrolled new employers. But, there's like 5 steps you have to take before you finally get paid which makes paying the bills difficult at times, unless you have a spouse for financial back up or a PT job on the side. However, there are bonuses, fine dinners & fancy trips that are all incentives. But very hard to accomplish. This career is for you or not. All depends on how disciplined you are to work on your own with little to no supervision."
good,Enjoyed working there. Great family fun atmosphere. Job itself can be stressful but they understand and try to accommodate and make the best of it to make sure everyone is okay.
good,Busy work. Going out meeting clients daily and creating new clients. Quota must be reached daily or weekly.  Great mangers and employees. Extensive weekly and  monthly training.
good,Aflac is your own business. You can make as much as you are willing to work for once you get past the training. It is total commission. Not many people are good with that. Those that are do very well.
good,I was recently hired on a salaried trainee position at Garden City's Aflac office and it was great.  This is not your typical Aflac office.  Both my managers very knowledgable and helpful.
good,Aflac is a great company that sincerely cares about their employees and wants you to be able to balance your work and family life. There are many opportunities where Aflac sponsors events that helps you spend quality time with your family. The Aflac culture is a giving culture and diverse. Many good will support efforts in the community.
good,It is a great place to work but do not expect advancement to come quickly. The organization can be a bit siloed and is fairly flat in terms of reporting authority.
good,It was a part time job met people called on phone and learned a lot about insurance  needed to be licensed though so could not work there anymore it is still growing company
good,"""contractor"" while at Aflac."
good,"The job is what you make since you are self-employed. The more customers you find who agree to your services, the more your compensation......................"
good,"With Aflac, you have to find your own customers and business to sign"
good,"When I started interning there, I had no idea how to make a sale. I had never held any sort of job for that before. By the end of my internship, I had learned so much on how to cold call that I was confident I could do it anywhere."
good,"There is lots of training to improve your skills, confidence, and presentation skills. Very helpful management and supervisors and Managers constantly pushing you to excel in your career"
good,Great place to work. Appreciates employees. Makes employees really reach their potential by having competitions and posting weekly team quality scores.
good,"they care for there employee, they are fun and understanding , they make sure we have the proper training, mangment always give you one on one to let you know where you are in progress. love this company..."
good,"With supplemental insurance benefits being a great product for those unexpected life events. The Aflac State Office was a place where agents would find guidance and support from their piers."
good,good company to work for. only bummer is that it is 100% commission. So if you do not sell you will not get paid. Good for experience if you want to get into sales.
good,"The best part of the job was the independence.  The people were nice and conditions were great."
good,Aflac is a wonderful place to work. It provides great flexible hours and uncapped income. The only downside is that income is variable in the beginning. In the long run it is quite lucrative.
good,"If you want a good company with no caps on commissions, this is the place.  "
good,Commission can be difficult.  The job gives you ways to educate companies on insurance/benefits to help put money in the pocket of employees. You make stronger connection between employees and employer.
good,Fun energy and you represent the Duck! Strong Brand name recognition which helps get your foot in the door! Helping people with balance of life. 100% commission salary.
good,"I am excited to see how I can grow with this company. so far everyone is very supportive, and friendly. There is tons to learn, and I have gotten to witness being there in a time of need."
good,"Be your won boss, set your schedule.  Great for a family life."
good,A great place to build a business. All walks of life can come to Aflac and be success. Working with the leadership in this company really helps put you in a good position to win in Aflac.
good,"You make your own hours!! Have to be Life and Health Certified.  Management is great... Very social group! You have the opportunity to make a difference in people lives.  If you don't have work ethic, this may not be the position for you!"
good,"At Aflac you are an Independent Contractor.  Depending on the day, meaning if there were meetings or not depends on the activity.  However, I would put my children on the bus and then hit the ground running.  I would go from business to business to attempt to speak to the business owners.  If reached, I would schedule an appointment to be able to sit down in front of them and anyone else who makes decisions with their healthcare.  Then I would b=move to the next business.  At times, I partnered up with another co worker and times I worked alone.  There are benefits to both.  I enjoyed being able to have a back up person in case I was under the weather and she/he could jump in and work as a team.  Other times I enjoyed working by myself.  It was great with the flexibility as I was able to make my own schedule."
good,Laid back company with a lot of great people. It is easy to get lost in a big company but the senior representatives are great with advice.
good,"The hardest part of the job is setting appointments. I enjoy working with my coworkers, we work as a team. Sometimes it's hard getting an appointment."
good,"Aflac is one of the best Insurance companies to work for, if you don't mind hard work.  You will reap the benefits of your labor if you stick with the company for at least 10 years. If you don't want to work fulltime it's the perfect place to work part-time.  One of the best Regional Sales Coordinator is located on Gables Court in Plano.  If you want to work for someone who is all about promoting team members, check out that location"
good,"Aflac has a pleasant work environment.  The hardest part of a customer service job is dealing with irate customers, but with experience you learn how to resolve issues and resolve the issues."
good,"It's an amazing experience, and they get you really involved. My manager took into account my actual interests and skillset rather than simply sending me off to file something banal. I was able to be engaged and feel connected to the company because I did real work. It was great, and everyone on staff is a saint."
good,"I started working on May 16th 2014 as a temporary employee for Aflac, my position was Technical Support Specialist and had the last shift 11-8 pm. Thank God after 10 months i was hired by Aflac as a permanent employee and i have to say that is was a 10k pay raise and the benefits are the best unless your is the military. After becoming an Aflac employee you have the chance to get some of their policies free and 50% off, you cant beat."
good,"I could set my own schedule , work when I wanted, a typical work day for me would be sitting at a desk , making phone calls, scheduling appointments with my clients"
good,A place where the sky is the limit in earnings! I once made $1500 in one day.  The hardest part of the job is finding that business owner that will say yes.
good,Excellent company helping workers get extra benefits through payroll deductions tp enhance their current health insurance programs for them and their families
good,"I loved working for AFLAC! the pay was good, however the work/life balance was stressful. Long hrs. with busy busy days only left me drained with migraines and no energy or time for family. I left ultimately because of medical reasons; however the job played a great role. I would recommend the company but not the call center!"
good,Loved my job and my coworkers.  Company did a lot for their employees and the employees families.
good,"My current boss has taught me how to manage my time by having a to do list, start with the most important on time and the least important on the bottom. Since I've known her for year she's like family and any kind of criticism she gives me I listen to it and work on it. Also at the same time, I make sure her that she is up to date on her paperwork and that I am a hard and fast worker."
good,"The hardest part of the job was being able to recruit new clients, especially with the economy.  My co-workers and managers were very motivating and encouraging."
good,Worked at AFLAC in two different states. You're able to easily relocate if need be! Management is great and you are able to make your own schedule because you are your own boss!
good,This is the first job that i can tell people that i absolutely love going to work M-F. A great place to grow career wise with management there to help you along the way.
good,"I enjoyed meeting with HR Director to enroll companies in our Supplemental plans, doing small to very large presentations to cover the importance of how the plans helped families in time of need.  I was the top Agent within the first three months of writing the most accounts being a first time Agent Producer in Insurance.  I believe with my hard work ethics and having the knowledge of studying the plans by memorizing them it enhanced my sales cause I believed in what I was doing to help others.  After, my six months and their on until I moved from Memphis, TN to Mississippi I was awarded on numerous occassions with cash bonuses and won trophies with my success of being an AFLAC Agent.   I created spreadsheets to match the term of each employee to their payroll (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, annually  so that their deductions would be correct for the plans they choose.   Setting up Cafteria Plans to save not only companies on their Corporate Taxes but saved the way the employee's payroll deductions were placed on their personal taxes.  I trained on their laptops to not have discrepancies in downloading to our Corporate Headquarters for disbursments for our Agents to not have anything held up on their weekly income, if they did not do this properly they would not have the money to continue to make their next sell.  I was told because of my training we became the top Region in the most hiring Agents and placing some of those Agents I trained to become District Managers.  I really enjoyed selling for AFLAC but once we moved to MS being on straight commission I could no longer"
good,"Aflac is a great job however you are hired as an independent contractor.  There is no base compensation.  "
good,Aflac is an outstanding company with the best supplement program in the industry
good,"Depending on the business need of the day, the work will always be steady and the customer focus is of the utmost importance. "
good,"Being an independent agent meant you had to be a self starter every single day. Cold calling was mandatory. I enjoyed seeking new companies to service because you had more people that way. It was my way of going into a working environment and being productive by providing proposals, giving presentations from 5 up to 150 people at each location and finding a way for them to add the extra insurance protection.  Providing personal service enabled me to make many lasting friendships. It is a rewarding job in so many different aspects but it is very time consuming."
good,"•	Process Aflac wellness and accident claims, using personal judgment in paying, denying, and pending of claims based on information submitted for review."
good,A typical day at work consists of working hard with full of energy; practicing attentive and active listening skills. Paying close attention to detail and continously stayin dedicated to resolving customer issues.
good,Working at Aflac gave me an opportunity to learn underwriting. It also gave me a chance to learn about insurance policies. The management was great at Aflac. The manager was very friendly and was always willing to help and answer any questions. The co-workers were very friendly and always helpful.
good,Aflac is overall a great place to work.  They care a lot about their employees and have great benefits.  The yearly bonus is also a great incentive and can on a typical year reach above 6% of your yearly salary.  No day is the same at Aflac.  My position involved project management.  Great job however there is a lot of politics being played as can be expected from large companies. 
good,"Came to Aflac from a retail background with no real sales experience.  They provided everything I needed to succeed and grow.  I've been promoted 2 times since I started 1 1/2 years ago.  Now I'm a team leader who has the privilige to help new hires realize their own success.  Aflac has a great name in the industry and needs to protect it so they ensure everyone gets the best training and opportunity possible.  I'm also fortunate enough to have landed in the Culver City, CA office, where the office culture is so welcoming and family oriented.  I think that kind of atmosphere and buzz around the office is the reason it's grown over 80% in sales since last year."
good,This was a wonderful environment and a great opportunity for growth. This is an environment that allows an individual to learn many diverse applications.
good,"I spent most all of my time in training, learning the products, attending meetings, calling leads, going out with another agent. Management was good but the office was just opened and organization was still in progress. I really never got my feet off the ground because I had an emergency out of state for an extended period of time."
good,It is a fun company to work on and there is so much room for advancement.
good,There is constant on-the-job training and management is always available and willing to take time to answer questions and provide guidance. All of the co-workers are like family.
good,Consulted and sold various types of policies to perspective clients.
good,Aflac is a great company to work for. You can help them prepare for the future. You educate them on the plans you have available and explain to them what would help with their family. The hardest part of working for Aflac is the cold-calling try to talk with business owners and letting them know the importance of offering this product to their employees.
good,This is a independent agent position which means you are your own boss. Self discipline and motivation is a need with this position because this is your business.
good,The company really give a hands on approach to training and provided great leadership.
good,I learned how to manage my time and a business more effectively. Very supportive work environment. Hardest part of the job is gaining clients in the beginning. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid.
good,"AFLAC is a wonderful company to work for, especially the division I worked in. However, we are paid by commission, in which I had not made a sell. If I were doing better in my sales, I would not be looking for other work. I need to be compensated, continually, in order to be responsible in paying my bills. Regarding the work/life balance, this is the best place to work. I had many issues arise, back to back and I was not hunted down, that I know about."
good,"Love the benefits here. Every work place has it's pors and cons, but overall the job gets the bills paid. The company can be fast paced somedays and that usual leads to a long days."

good,I really enjoyed helping people understand what we are offering and helping them choose what plan works best for them. Understanding their needs helps me guide them in the right choice.
good,"Yes this is a 100% commission position - I was not sure I wanted to do that either. The compensation plan is amazing (especially the residual income part and the stock bonuses). I went to the interview so I could be fully educated on what the career entailed. "
good,"I love this Job, the culture, and what the company stands for and represents. This job is not easy, but you have incredible training and resources available to you to help you succeed and take this career as far as you would like."
good,"Great place to work, very honest and ethical. If you learn the basics and follow them, keep focused on the goal, you can make a lot of money. AFLAC is a great place to work if you;re good at connecting with people."
good,"Aflac is a productive and motivating work environment. A typical work day is following up with clients in order to turn them into customers. I have learned that if you work hard and keep at it, you can make a very good living and some really good residual income."
good,Door to door sales. Cold calling on new and old businesses. Paid on commission only per sale daily or weekly. Extremely fast paced and scripted sales. Need to make 20-50 cold calls per day to make a decent living. Must use own car to travel. All expenses are yours to cover.
good,"A very great employer."
good,"I enjoyed working at AFLAC because while it was sales, I was able to interact with people in an in-home environment. AFLAC also gave many inservice workshops to update sales representative's repertoire."
good,"A typical work day would involve making called to business owners and or CEO's of a company. Next, you would go on runs to different business and asking to speak to the owners to see if we could set up an appointment to present our benefit packages to them."
good,"A typical day starts with sales meetings in the morning, followed by a call blitz, then a quick break followed by another call blitz, then you are free to run any appointments you have set up the previous day. and if you have no appointments you continue to make calls to set up appointments."
good,This is a straight commission sales job  Good training and leadership depending on the area you are hired.  You get back what you put in  I worked hard and had a 6 figure income.  The renewals are excellent and the stock bonus.  If you want to build a business and have a career and you believe in yourself this is a great company
good,Its really good company to work in even as a contractor as well.Not not much load of work and team that I worked is really nice.Team lead and PM are really cooperative and professional
good,making calls and setting appointments. I've learned a lot about the insurance world. As far as management goes it really is different for everyone. Everybody is different
good,"Great Company, very ethical. A great and excellent learning experience, awesome learning tools, and methods. A company who puts their clients, and their clients best interest first."
good,"I did cold calling and held phone interviews. I helped with social media presence. I also sat in interviews and orientations. I learned how talent acquisition works, various administrative tasks, and what Aflac offers. The workplace is fun yet very individualistic. The hardest part of the job was the cold calling and the coming up with social media content. The most enjoyable was connecting with the regional manager and the camaraderie between the interns and the woman in charge of the interns."
good,Aflac gives employees opportunities to make a difference in the lives through benefit consulting in the area of supplemental health benefits. The company supports each individual associate with the training and preparation to offer families alternatives to financial and health challenges.

good,A typical day at work is fun and upbeat. This is a company where it is easy to be promoted as long as you come to work and simply do your job.
good,"Overall, Aflac is a top notch company to work for.  I truly recommend the opportunity to anyone.  It is a great company with many perks.  As an agent, you have to put in a lot to get a great reward.  I highly recommend Aflac to anyone."
good,Love helping individuals and families with their insurance needs and concerns.
good,I worked as an intern in the strategy department. I got to work with a bunch of extremely talented and smart people. The company treats its employees like family and the culture is collaborative instead of competitive or cut throat.
good,"Had the opportunity to process claims and insurance premium payments working for a fortune company with awesome pay and  benefits. I gained experience with different accounting systems, multi-tasking between systems, and policy holder accounts. It was an environment with so many incentives making it easy to perform my task to the fullest. There was not much time to mingle as our time on the computers was measured, and with 5,000 employees it was easy to get lost in the building, but the company would hold workshops, and constantly gratify all its employees."
good,"I really miss working here.  I am trying to get back on at this wonderful family of a company. I gave 100% and tend to do that again,"
good,"Nothing really negative to say...if you are looking for a job opportunity that offers flexibility and the potential for good earnings, then I highly recommend Aflac as a career choice."
good,"Great Company, love the people and the vision of the Company."

Working at Aflac has given me an opportunity I never thought possible, and the people are great.  It gets hard because you do get a lot of rejection in the prospecting process, but that's part of any sales position.  You must be resilient, and if you are, opportunities start coming to you as you grow.  It's a great company with an amazing product, at great prices, and Aflac pays their claims, so you can always have the confidence that your customers are being taken care of!"

good,"You have total flexibility of schedule and activities."

good,Loved providing excellent customer service and l enjoyed the great benefits provided by AFLAC. The work experience at AFLAC helped boost my resume and made me a better person.
good,My trainer had a lose that made it hard for me to keep up with under the new hirees. It would have been a fabulous place for me to be as I was extremely passionate about the product.
good,Wonderful company to work for. They truly take care of their employees and in turn the employees take care of the business. Our customers are at the heart of all we do.
good,"This is the way companies were back in the days of ""the gold watch"". Management really cares and HR is NOT the extension of the Legal Department and HR is not biased to Management. Most companies 'lost' their employees when ""Personnel"" became ""Human Resources"". Workers are not commodities, but assets, and Aflac recognizes that."

good,"Growing as an individual while helping others has become my passion.  I have the ability here, to positively influence the lives of others, while maintaining a flexible and rewarding career path."
good,This career has normal highs and lows like any other industry. If you work hard and manage your schedule you will be successful. The Louisville region provides you with all the training you need to learn the business. Some of the top performers in the entire company are in the Louisville market and willing to Mentor new Associates. You have to be willing to invest in yourself.
good,"What do I love about working for AFLAC? People. Everyone is willing to contribute his/her knowledge, experience, and best practice to improve the products. Free food/drinks in the office. The Louisville KY Region is a fantastic place to work! The culture here is unlike any other insurance company!  At AFLAC, it's important to grow as a team member, but also as an individual. There are so many resources available to you, including a mentor program. This career will take you as far as you are willing to go!"

good,Aflac is such a great company and they always make me feel appreciated for all my hard work!  Being an independent agent is not easy- you have to work hard to build your book of business just like any other business owner would.

I've been thankful enough to work with great leaders that have taken the time to train me and led me to becoming a leader myself.
good,I LOVE AFLAC!  I wish that I would have found this career a long time ago.  The flexibility cannot be beat.  Everyone is super friendly and welcoming and eager to help.  I feel like they all want to see my succeed and be successful.  Training is awesome and the trainers are very knowledgeable in what they teach.  Such a great a place to work!
good,Aflac turned my life around. Working in a dead end job was killing me. I was depressed and had little hope for the future. Coming into Aflac I was skeptical but it was the best decision I could have ever made. Putting in the work pays off with this company.
good,"Good work environment.  Nice people, hard work not for everyone.  This is stupid to waste my time with this garbage, I can't believe I have to sit and type out at least 150 characters to mover on!"
good,Its a good experience.but really need a good car. You learn a lot about health and diferente procedure with medical illness. Its gratefull when you can help others and contribute with the party of a person when they need.

The opportunity to help people with their financial security while controlling my own destiny is amazing.  With the changes in the Benefit world Voluntary benefits have never been more necessary and being able to deliver solutions from the Worlds most Ethical insurance company that pays claims in less than 2 days is an awesome privilege."
good,I was an independent contractor selling Aflac Products. The pay was great but you have to remain steadfast and dedicated to the position. Sometimes you made sales and sometimes you didn’t.
good,"Getting up everyday and being your own boss is great ,but at the same time you don't work you don't eat. Its the best job to purse if your going into insurance. Aflac is everything that it is advertised to be the company really cares about its employees and clients. The role of an insurance agent I feel does need some importance to make sure people are properly covered when rough time come up."
good,I have all good things to say about Aflac.  It was a career change for me and it changed my life.  The management is bar none the best.  I look forward fo going to work every single day.
good,Wonderful corporate culture.  This company offers a full week of Employee Appreciation to celebrate its employees.  Company offers retirement rule of 80 (yrs of svc + age) you get your full pension
good,the  pay   doesn't   fit the  job .  BUT   overall   great   JOB .  The benfits   are  amazing .   the   people  are   nice and  management  is  supportive
good,I am extremely grateful for my tenure at Aflac because I gained a wealth of knowledge and experience and I had the greatest management team ever! The company perks are like no other employer I've ever had. Unforeseen circumstances caused me to have to resign which was bittersweet but if not I would still be employed to this very day!!

good,"Working at Aflac is terrific for those that are looking to build a career in sales. Your effort level determines your level of success, as you are able to make your own hours and schedule. Those that fail typically are those that are unwilling to work full time hours. The culture is great, as I am surrounded by people that show support for my career as well as for me as an individual. I came into this job with no sales experience and am now happier with my career and making more money than I ever have. I have finally found a career that allows me to provide well for my family financially, while also giving me the freedom to make my own schedule and be my own boss. Advancement opportunities are also available, as I have already advanced to a management position after one year. I cannot stress enough how thankful I am to be a part of the Aflac family and would encourage anyone with a strong work ethic to take the leap of faith that I did and join the Aflac team."
good,Aflac provides all the training you need to succeed. Great performance is awarded with terrific bonuses. Paid daily for production. Stock options. Flexible work schedule allowing for wonderful work-life balance. Helping people protect their income and assets.
good,I worked for AFLAC almost 18 years. I enjoyed all of my time there. Each department had it's own requirements based on the job itself. I enjoyed my last position the most. I worked with the company's programmers & I helped test the needed changes before going into production. I learned a lot from this team and they in turned listened to what I had to say about the system and how it should be working.
good,"Company of excellent morals and values that cares about clients, policy holders and agents. Aflac gives back to the community unlike any insurance company I have ever seen."

good,"I was given an opportunity to work for Aflac as an Associate, when I was just 22 years old (my first real job). Turns out it was the opportunity of a lifetime for me! I worked 15 years for Aflac, at nearly every sales role in the company and learned more than I could ever imagine about business. 8 years ago at age 37 I retired my career contract and walked away to focus my personal life. I’ve had no further obligation to Aflac, yet they have continued to pay me an above average income all this time. The opportunity with Aflac is better today; training, technology, systems (internal and external) have all improved and the brand is stronger than ever! Aflac is certainly not for everyone, but it sure has been a blessing to me."

good,"It is a great place to work, but you have to be wiling to put in the time. It is a commission based company but if you put in the time and effort, Aflac sends you on paid vacation trips such as Mexico, Hawaii, Ireland, etc."
good,After being laid off and turned down from jobs due to my age Aflac brought me onboard giving me the opportunity for complete control of my work right from the start. I gave over 15 years of my life to corporate work and my only regret is that I wasn't approached in my youth with the opportunity.
good,It was an awesome experience. I may go back to the company in the future. I learned alot while working with them. One of the things I learned was empathy

good,You have the opportunity to become a multimillionaire insurance agent however it’s very hard work and hard to get into but if you continue to follow your dreams you can accomplish anything in this company allows that to happen Yes
good,"The company honestly does what they say they will do, and for me to morally sell someone something I have to know it is truly worth the consumers money, and I can say it is. During my time with the company I witnessed the ease,speed, and honesty that came with filing a claim. Excellent company to both work for and purchase from as I am also a policy holder."
good,"Morning meeting to discuss what we was doing for the day and the week. What meeting was set up, how many cold calls, B2B calls that needed to be done."
good,I learned how to take ownership of my territory. It taught me how to prospect smarter and how to make the most out of my day. The hardest part was commission only and charge backs.
good,I was hired through a temp agency and employed over 1 year. By far this is the best company I've ever had the opportunity to work at. The work environment was so relaxed and exceptional pay.
good,Great company with great earning potential. The culture is great and the CEO is caring about the company and all the people working within it. Aflac is second to none in its industry. Lots of training and support.
good,"I love this company they treat their employees very well, great benefits and more. They provide on the job training, you can work from home and room for advancement."
good,i currently work for aflac and I enjoy it. I love how I get to make my own hours and the people that have helped me that work with aflac are very nice .
good,"If I could go back I would. Love the culture, great management, great benefits, lots of employee recognition. Great building, Very family oriented, diverse, inclusive and rewarding."
good,AFLAC was a fun place to work. Employees were treated with respect and rewarded for their work as well as provided lots of incentives to work harder. There were no dull moments.
good,"When a policyholder or insured gets sick or hurt, Aflac pays cash benefits fairly, promptly and directly to the insured. For nearly six decades, Aflac voluntary insurance policies have given policyholders the opportunity to focus on recovery, not financial stress."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities to be successful, but just takes time. Hard to start your book of business, but great company and team members help. Love the company and atmosphere. Plenty of bonuses and ways to move up throughout the company or just stay as an agent if wished."
good,"Aflac is a great, caring company to work for. There are over 5,000 employees, But it has the feel of extended family. The benefits and compensation are more than fair and the rotating schedule (you have preference choice), is based on your performance, but all shifts are great. In the Call Center you work, but it becomes a way of life."
good,At Aflac I worked in many different areas. I loved learning about what agents and brokers do. EAW is a wonderful event at Aflac. That week is full of fun and teamwork.
good,"AFLAC always made sure they put their claimants needs ahead of profits.  On several occasions, I have witnessed the fact that they paid claims that were not legally required, however, they made the morally and ethically decision to assist claimants in need rather thab consider bottom line profits to the company."
good,"Exciting and dynamic company with viable health products that are appealing for progressive health conscience, product up-date companies to acquire (i.e., Disability Income Product for existing health conditions)"
good,"Amazing Company w/ great benefits. Appreciates employees & celebrates yearly with gifts. Work remotely, paid holidays, vacation time & family oriented"
good,"When getting leads, and getting the sales are the toughest part of the job."

good,"Aflac Inc. is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States. The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia."
good,The regional in Glendora is very helpful and does not mistreat those new to the field. He is always ready and willing to help. He was one of the reasons I was interested in a career with Aflac.
good,"Working for Aflac in the call center was actually one of the best jobs that I have ever had. Aflac is an awesome company with awesome benefits such as medical, life, dental, and cancer policies for employees. They offer the best starting pay rate of most of the companies in Columbus, Georgia! Unless you are living way above your means you can definitely live comfortably. There was always music of different genre's playing at just the right level to keep the mood right. The most enjoyable part of teh job is getting to encourage those policyholders who are going through a rough time and to try and reassure them that things will get better. The hardest part of the job is doing all that you can in your power to assit a person and they curse you out and call you all types of names and are just rude and disrespectful to you. That can be challenging at times to deal with on a daily basis. Overall awesome place of business!"
good,This is an excellent opportunity for the motivated individual that is looking to get into the industry with a Top Rated carrier that provides excellent training and tools to succeed.
good,Aflac is great. I really believe in the company that I work for and what we do. I have a lot of respect for the product that we offer as well as the people that I work for

good,"Aflac was the best company I have ever worked for! They value their employees, believe in advancement opportunities and provide the necessary education for advancement. I loved working there!!"
good,Amazing products lack of support from managers. Unrealistic goals for success . Unfair work/life balance. 1099 employees are told unrealistic amount of money to be earned.
good,"1. Balanced work life"
good,Very difficult to make a living at this career in a rural area.  Only do this if you are in a metro area.  It is enjoyable if you like meeting people every day and love sales.
good,"I am loyal, trustworthy and dependable and I expect nothing less from the company I work for which Aflac does. You make your own schedule which is great but also remember that if you aren't working then you aren't making any money. You have to put in the time to see the results."
good,good place to work if you are a starting a new career. I would not work at AFLAC if I was 10 years into the workforce. The work culture was inviting and I enjoyed the environment.
good,Aflac was a decent company to work for. We had quotas and one-on-one training. I was an independent contractor using my own vehicle. I needed to find something a little more stable
good,"Working for Aflac has been quite the experience, I have enjoyed it very much. Being in the corporate world is something I had always wanted and this opportunity allowed that."
good,"Great company to work with if insurance sales is your career goal.  Great compensation plan, excellent corporate culture and excellent brand name awareness.  Requires a lot of self motivated work effort."
good,Love working with Aflac.  Met in awesome people and they were first class with their events.  The only problem was their were clicks as far as accounts you were allow to service.
good,Aflac is a great product with wonderful opportunities.  Must like cold calling. Very flexible environment and great opportunity for career advancement.
good,"Af;ac is a great company, I enjoyed working there. The interview process was simple and straight to the point. I was interviewed by two mangers. My interview went grea!"
good,Great place to work. Management was there for you every need and are very friendly. The only drawback is that the position is commission based but there is room for advancement.

good,You need to be good at cold calling and hearing the word no a lot. IF you are are good at sale and knowing your product you can make it with with company. Training is first class and the support is world class.
good,"I have learned a lot about the Aflac products and how to go into businesses to try to persuade them to let me open up an Aflac account. It is not a hard job, but it is just a learning process."
good,"Aflac is not a job, it is a career opportunity. They are a great company that delivers on their promise to their employees, policy holders, and contractors. This is not the easiest path to choose, but you will get out what you put in. If you are willing to learn and work hard, this company will take you great places."
good,"I met so many great people, and absolutely loved my policyholders.  They are the ones that made me get up everyday and ""go to work"" working from home."
good,I love working with Aflac. It is a team effort and my district manager taught me so much. I would recommend working for Aflac to everyone. It gives you also freedom and having a personal life.
good,"Loved working with Aflac, Love being my own boss. The problem is you run out of business to talk to and the competiton is fierce. It is always a competitve, I did not enjpy that. I do not want to compete for bonuses and gifts, I want to receive these on my hard work."
good,Making cold calls both over the phone and in person business to business sales. Weekly agent meetings. Great company events and incentives for awards/ bonuses.
good,It was definitely the best job I've had so far. Great team. Always trying to help and teach you to become your won boss. I definitely recommend the company.
good,I loved working for AFLAC. When my mom qas diagnosed with leukemia they were so supportive. Unfortunately she needed me full time so I had to leave. I would recommend AFLAC to anyone searching for a career with a company that cares about its employees.

good,"Very productive and engaging work environment.  Managers are nice and good leaders, providing good solid mentoring and coaching. Executive leadership is very reliable and sharp, providing good employee engagement!"
good,"I called on businesses and provided really great products to fill in gaps their employees might have in their health care packages while saving the companies and the employees taxes by helping the companies implement section 125 plans for pre taxing benefits. It was a really good feeling to leave a business knowing you were helping their employees better take care of their families, that you were also helping a business add cash to their bottom lines, and at the same time, yes....I made a really nice income from the company."
good,"I worked at Aflac this past summer which was a great experience. Although I did not get my insurance license on time (which prevented me from going out into the field and getting money), I was still able to walk away from my internship with a lot of knowledge. The environment was great and everyone I worked with was always so happy!"
good,"Un buen trabajo en donde se adquiere una basta experiencia en el area de ventas denseguros en donde no solo se vende, sino que ayudas a personas a obtener lo que necesitan y a la misma vez tu tambien ganas."

good,Aflac was a great place to work you had a work life balance.  A typical day at work would be cold calling on business for about 2 -4 hours.  the rest of the day was spent making follow up calls to set appointments for the next day.  We had some of the best district meeting ever and the food was great.
good,"Challenging but good learning environment. Great people and friendly and supportive. Obtain experience with SQLCOBOL and additional insurance experience. I commuted but was allowed flexibility in my schedule. Most difficult part of the job was dealing with the different groups involved with the programming, but expected in an insurance environment. Location was convenient for getting personal business done during and after work."
good,im glad i had the opportunity to participate in their human resources internship program. i learned a lot and met new people and learned kay hr responsibilities
good,"You work Monday through Friday off on holidays, The company is a family friendly environment. The hardest part is getting through training because you don't get the help you ask for nor need."
good,Had a great Wall Street and 500 Fortune Company experience as an internee. Working on different projects as a team and individual. And meeting with different agents
good,"When you get to work you log into your computer check emails, sign into your phone on time. depending on the schedule you'll have a 30 min or 1 hour lunch there's a restaurant style break room a gym in the building. management is very helpful and there's plenty of help on the floor for new agents. the hardest part of the job is when a customer calls in sad about a situation their going through but you must stay focused and help them without getting emotional while still showing sympathy. the most enjoyable part of the job is all the recognition you get for a job well done. work hard and it will be noticed. The pay is great even in training. The only reason I had to resign is due to medical issues and I had to move, If it were up to me I would have retired from the company"
good,"I worked semi-independently, I set my own schedule and created my own work zone. I managed my own time, took breaks when I needed and took time off when I needed."
good,great interaction with other employees.  Management was always available if needed.  Learned many things and had a great time working there.   AFLAC treats their employees well and it shows.
good,You have to constantly keep prospecting  to bring in new business so that you can close business deals. Very hard to do drops and get an appointment. Referrals are one of the best methods to get new accounts.
good,"Get in have a meeting with district managers."
good,I opened and closed the office for multiple different job types and personalities.  I enjoy working with all types of individuals.  I can have an interesting conversation with highly educated person as well as someone with lower educational background

good,"I worked with AFLAC, selling employee benefits to small businesses. I enjoyed the work ... straight commission sales. Met business owners, and offered supplemental insurance to their employees"
good,As a agent this job gives me the time to manage my own day. I've learned how to sale insurance.  The workplace is very calm. They treat each person as if you are special.
good,"I loved my job here I was very organized, it has great career choices. I had great benefits and I had great hours for my set days and times to work. I would tell you is a great place to work."
good,I work at Eric Westall's Aflac Regional Office as an insurance agent. I recently started and I feel as though Eric really focuses on training which I noticed other companies don't. He has a great character and everyone else is very helpful!
good,"Present to business owners to get promising to present benefits to employees. "
good,"Great company to work for enjoyable and professional work environment. Management was very supportive, good benefits for full time employees. I was part time in the calling center."
good,Great if you want to have time do enjoy life as long as working. Great residual income. Awesome management team. Need to put on the work in order to see results though.
good,"I enjoy working at Aflac and I think that my awesome team has everything to do with my great experience.  I'm a newer agent but I'm having a lot of fun so far.

good,Aflac is an amazing Company to work for!  The Management and other agents in the office are always willing to lend a hand!  The main requirement motivation!
good,A Typical work day is me going around to the different businesses and talking to the decision maker trying to make an appointment for a presentation and see is our products a good fit for the company.
good,"Sales positions are primarily business to business sales......calling on employers, presenting and selling to employees."
good,I enjoy working for Aflac. The hardest part of the job is getting out of the door to go to work mentally. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the flexibility to have a work/life balance. The atmosphere is energetic and you have to be willing to go out and meet people. The management team just wants you to go and do your job just like most management teams.
good,Initiation of cold calls to introduce myself to prospective clients in my territory. Maintain a high level of record compliance and confidentiality. Help clients with claims.
good,"Aflac features a very positive, cooperative environment in which your coworkers and managers provide plenty of encouragement and advice. The managers will not stand over your shoulder and so you will have to be a self-starter to succeed."
good,I worked under some members from Marietta Country Club so we already had a previous relationship which made my job less stressful and more laid back.  Lots of cold calling and walking into businesses but it was a doable job.
good,Love the atmosphere and the benefits. EAW is employee appreciation week. Lots of fun! They empower their employees. Easily move up. I would love to come back and work for this company again.
good,"A typical day at AFLAC would include prospecting, either in person or by phone, setting appointments and then giving employer presentations in order to open an account.  Once opened, supplemental insurance product presentations are either given individually or in a group setting with enrollment as soon as possible. "
good,"This was my favorite job! I loved every aspect of my roles and responsibilities, even the cold calling of potential agents. I enjoyed managing the office and having people rely on me."
good,"My experience with AFLAC was great. Although the experience was very different from my previous work experiences, they provided training and mentoring from staff and supervisors."
good,"Aflac was my first commission position and I did quite well. However,  the company has grown and with that comes more politics. The company itself does pay their claims. Has great training and treats their agents wonderfully."
good,"I was in sales so of course I could make my own schedule when I did work for them, but when it came to actual work and my bosses, it was awesome! I loved who I worked with and they all treat you like family. The only reason I didn't continue working there was because my pay was commission only and I'm not good in sales whatsoever so I needed a steady income. At the time, I had some family needing help at their store so it worked out perfect. I would definitely recommend people to work here."
good,Coming from a financial institution I learned a great deal from Aflac. They did an Awesome job with forming a work culture where we were able to refresh and continue our education within the insurance industry. They also went above and beyond to keep each other motivated and awarded.
good,This was a great experience too.  I had a good relationship with all of the Supervisors that I worked for.  Everything was clearly defined regarding the duties.  I met all of my goals.
good,Aflac is a great place to work and there are really no cons or anything negative to say about it. I loved it! It was a Terrific place to work and the employees are great also.
good,"Answering incoming Calls"
good,"In the worksite benefits industry, you have to be able to adapt to change quickly and be very flexible. You have to remain professional at all times and have a high regard for security, privacy and the protection of people's personal data. Awareness of HIPPA and other privacy laws is a must."
good,"Aflac is such a great company to work for. It is owned by Amos family who are very decent and great people. Great ethics, family oriented and professional environment, great stock options, fun and productive environment, Great management, 401k, benefits. Just everything is amazing with Aflac."
good,"The training that comes from corporate is second to none.  It feels like a local brand with a fortune 500 backing.  I have worked for numerous companies over the years and all of them gave opportunity to earn an income while doing very little.  At Aflac you earn what you deserve.  I won't ever go back to a W2 position.  Health Care has consistently changed for the worse, while Aflac is left to help pick up the pieces.  I chose correctly by representing this wonderful company."
good,Fast Paced and productive  environment with customer service and satisfaction being of utmost importance.  Working close with Sales Representatives to ensure that all accounts are provided with excellent service
good,Love working for Aflac! I process accident claims. The management staff goes above and beyond to help if needed. The entire company is exceptional. Go Aflac!
good,"I learned to go and get what I want and not show any ounce of fear.  I showed no fear towards different CEOs of different businesses, that's the mindset Aflac instilled in me and I thank them a lot for that."
good,"Sold insurance on a commission salary."
good,AFLAC was my first real job out of high school. They were willing to give me a chance in the IT department and really have me shaped my career. I would recommend any college graduate to take a look at this company. They value their employees.
good,"Aflac was a great place to work at. The management was very genuine, and cared about their employees."
good,"I worked for this company for about 1 year. I liked this company, however as a starter in the insurance business, this isnt the company for a starter. This company has everything you need, but its made for people who have insurance business that they can bring over to succeed."
good,"Great company to work for.  I am just looking to stay put and not travel so much!  Lots of room for advancement, but I am just not willing to work that much out of town.  It is a must to branch out with AFLAC."
good,"Aflac is the best company I was employed by.  They expect quality work and it is fast paced.  However, they value their employees and they are not afraid to show it."
good,While I enjoyed my time with Aflac I found the commission based sales structure a bit overwhelming. Aflac offers amazing products and wonderful compensation and for sales it's tough to match the quality of what Aflac stands for.
good,Very professional and organized. You have the option to work in the field or from home. Management was amazing and very helpful. Training was phenomenal.
good,"This company has everything, from experienced and well knowledgeable people to enthusiastic minds ready to help with any task! this is a reputable company with much going for them and I would highly recommend them if you are pursuing a job in insurance."
good,"The harder you work, the more you earn, it is 100% commission. You are your own boss.You learn all about managing your time and how to speak to customers. You get On-the-job training but bear in mind, it's 100% commission so you don't get paid for these training"
good,"I go out making friends talking with business owners and finding out more about the issues they are having in today's world. Thinking of solutions to keep them competitive and build loyalty to keep and maintain quality staff."
good,Its a great company and I would recommend it to anyone interested in insurance. Flexible hours and nice office to work in as well overall just a great place

good,"Great Company to work for. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a lasting career. If you are looking for a career in customer service, this is the company to look at."
good,"AFLAC is one of the best companies I've ever worked for.  They take care of their employees and policy holders.  Only negative about the job is that there is no base pay in sales.  However, commission is great and there are plenty of contests and other incentives that pay out."
good,Absolutely loved working here.  Great team atmosphere. The awards were awesome as well as the incentives. Leadership was transparent and willing to help.
good,The work environment is comfortable yet quick paced.  Everyone has a job to do and they do it.  There are a lot of opportunities for learning and growth.
good,Work day is your own decision. Learned business skills. Self managed work. Classic work culture. Constant rejection. You make decently good money. Treated fairly from start to finish
good,This is not a job.  It is a lifelong career that has normal challenges and big rewards.  I have made more money with this company than all other jobs I have had combined!  With no prior experience or education I have been able to achieve my life goals with this career.  The office culture is like a family.  We work together marketing and servicing businesses in our community. We help people with financial loss in times of need which is incredibly rewarding. There are more new businesses opening in our area than we can keep up with.  Management opportunity was available with in my first year.  The hardest part of the job is discipline working 8 hours a day as you are truly in control of your own work hours.  Residual income is awesome and has given me freedom to pursue hobbies and spend more time with Family.  Definite thumbs up if you want to start a business with no glass ceiling and unlimited income potential.
good,This company was home grown and very polished.  Great employee benefits and culture.  Really learned a great deal.  This company helped mold me into the super employee I have become.
good,"Aflac is a great career for anyone who is willing to go to work and follow instructions. People i have found that succeed there are Teachers, someone with something to prove and willing to work for it. "
good,"Loved working here, but had to resign due to relocation.  That was due to husband's employment."
good,"Pro cliente asegurado 100%"
good,"Great learning experience.  Provided me with excellent opportunities.  Great people all around.  Management was AWESOME.., Loved meeting new people and B2B relationships"
good,I love the flexibility and sense of team that Aflac provides the sales associates. I love the fact that you're helping people and employers cover all the bases when it comes to making that extra difference when that rainy day comes and someone gets sick or hurt.
good,I absolutely LOVE this company! Very friendly employers with awesome benefits and compensation.  I would have easily worked here until retirement if I hadn't moved (and became a temporary stay at home mom). I would recommend Aflac to anyone!
good,Nothing much I could say but only that... I love the people most especially my boss. I love AFLAC and I just hope they have one here in the Philippines
good,"Most (all) start as a 1099 independent contractor on 100% commission as I did.  Regional Coordinator paid for my license training and exam.  State Coordinator offered a sales school that was effective.  If you want to get paid you have to work and most don't have what it takes to sustain.  That causes agent turn, inactive accounts and overall community confusion about who the agent is, what coverage, and how it works. I liked most of the people I worked with. I loved my schedule. Managers can go either way and most are not bums.  Hardest part of the job is getting told no until it's a yes.  Also no's don't pay the bills."
good,Aflac is an extremely ethical and responsible company. It is a profession that serves to clients in a life changing manner.
good,"Experienced in calling and establishing multi-state and local business accounts; state and locally assigned account representative; individual door-to-door calls and sales.                              	"
good,"I mostly was in the training part but did go out and try to set up appointments so I could explain Aflac to the owners of the businesses, and I had fun doing that and meeting new people.  However, I just learned that I am just not a salesperson, and the drive to the office for the meeting was dangerous and with three young kids, I just could not to the chance."
good,I love working for Aflac. Everything about this company is ethical. The people are genuinely great people who honestly care about helping protect people when life happens.
good,"Prospectar clientes, hacer presentaciones patronales y indagar en las necesidades del empleado. Ayudarlos en la adminitracion de los beneficios."
good,Helping our clients and providing exceptional outstanding customer service is our top priority. There are so many exciting opportunities working with Aflac.
good,"Cold calling can be extremely dull, but my coworkers and boss and bosses boss were all awesome people.  I would recommend working here for a first time job."
good,"Great company to work for. Amazing health and life insurance products. "
good,This is one of the best places I've worked at just have to obtain insurance license I would to go back to Aflac any day the people are great you will never feel alone the managers are with you every step of the way
good,You will receive great information and the tools you need to succeed. Management is of superior quality and will coach and mentor you in meeting your desired educational needs and goals.
good,"Aflac is the first company I contracted with for Insurance Sales. The position was ideal because it offered me a flexible schedule and allowed me to be available to my young son. A typical day involved marketing to new prospects or conducting open enrollment group meeting with payroll accounts, and subsequent individual meetings to enroll employees in supplemental life and health plans. The managers were theoretically peers in my organization and are like-minded self employed insurance professionals who provided a great  support system. The challenge was maintaining consistency in writing business during the changing economy."
good,"Get up everyday and go cold calling for the majority of the time when you first start. Whenever you start getting the hang of it, it becomes easier and your clients start recommending people to you."
good,Great workplace and the staff is like family. Definitely enjoyed working there. Working in any customer service center can be challenging but not to a point where the job wasn't a success.
good,"it was such a good experience working at Aflac. it was my fist time working at office and handling the situations over the phone with the customers. All the co-workers are very friendly and hardworking. "
good,Aflac is a great company to work for. A typical work day is set by regular work hours and job description.  Aflac takes pride in making sure work and home life agree as much as possible.  If the employee is worried about home they are unable to provide great customer service.  Everyone is able to come to work and drop their child off at a nursery provided on sight and exercise in the gym on sight. Management does not micromanage as the employees have their work from day to day loaded on their desktop. Team luncheons and team building activities are constantly provided. The opportunity to retire is always there. I retired after 26 years of service.
good,"I loved working for Aflac even for the very short time frame I had with them. You are really treated like part of a family with Aflac. I loved the location of my office and was even given my very own huge office space all to myself. I typically worked an 8 AM - 4 PM schedule Monday-Friday. I was off and paid for all holidays from the very beginning. I loved only working with only three other people in the office, as I felt I got more accomplished that way compared to working in a large office setting. I learned to be thankful for any opportunities that are presented to you, even if they happen to not turn out how you would have liked in the end."
good,A typical day was assisting my boss with lots of paperwork!  This was a fun job because I was able to work with my husband even though it was part time employment.
good,"I am an independent insurance agent contracted and appointed to sell insurance products for Aflac. I am not an ""employee"" of Aflac so I cannot provide a review or summary as to what it is like to actually work or be employed by Aflac."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits and great compensation. My Manager was great to work for and I enjoyed working for him. I recommend Aflac HQ to anyone.
good,Aflac is a great company to work for. I loved the diversity of the office and the people. The compensation was good. And they focus on continued learning and education!
good,They have an incredible product easy to present wonderfull management and co-workers. Great compensation. However thier is a terrible flaw in the process. As you are getting started with them even if you have many connections if you try to work those instead of the very uncomfortable door to door cold calling you have no lead protection. The reason the door to door was so uncomfortable is because most of the time you were the 5th or 6th person this week trying to get drop by meeting with the owner of the company. I finally had to get a paying job rather than work on building my paycheck.
good,Everyone should try getting a job here this has been my best job thus far. I wouldn't trade this job for nothing in the world.
good,This is a company that provides many opportunities if you are willing to abide by the company guidelines and apply yourself at your craft. The benefits are minimal.
good,"Excellent company to work for, supportive staff and staff retention. Competitive in the marketplace, great perks and benefits. Great customer satisfaction, prompt payment of claims."
good,"A very competitive atmosphere, of course. Because it is sales. And that is how sales should be. Do your best to become the best and earn a lot of money."
good,"My typical day at work would include meeting different people educating them on the importance of what's important in their family's life. Since being employed with Aflac I have learned so much and the knowledge that I have encountered as well as the lives that I have touched brings me so much joy. The management is wonderful. She taught me everything that I know with Aflac. My coworkers are great to be around and I feel that I encourage them to continue on the journey. To never give up. The hardest part of my job is being paid just on commission, but the most enjoyable part is putting a smile on my clients face knowing that I was able to help them."
good,"-I learned about healthcare reform, benefits, and other types of insurance cover."
good,"This is an amazing opportunity for those that are self driven and do not need to be micromanaged. I have been with Aflac for 7 years and have ALWAYS gotten out of this what I put into it. I love that I am able to set my own schedule, make a huge difference in the lives of my policyholders, and have control over my income. I love the people that I work with and how this company takes care of the field force. I truly believe there is no better opportunity out there."

good,"I worked as a customer service representative and my day was 8-5.  I was always on time, took appropriate breaks, lunch and left on time.  I worked on a computer with a headset and answered incoming calls to help customers with any policy needs.  I learned all about the various policy types, their benefits and how we paid our customers.  I also learned to process various payment types.  I worked in a team of about 15 with other trained employees who were readily available to offer assistance if needed. I enjoyed being able to come in and get right to work and I learned something more everyday."
good,"Even though I only worked there a few months, I find myself in one of the best insurance companies I've seen. From the beginning you are tough not only sales but how to make a customer satisfied."
good,"I would open the office and review any voice messages on the answering machine and return the calls.  I would send daily reports to main office. I would monitor the employees in the office and make sure they had appropriate supplies for sales presentations.  "
good,A typical day at work would be to open all systems before shift began. Assist customers with policy information and how to file a claim.  Handle  escalated calls and transfer calls to the correct department. Verify policyholders information for their security and notate  the conversations for account purposes.
good,"Excellent place to work, great pay and job security. Company invest greatly in its employees and have an entire week for employee appreciation. I enjoy the openness of the management."
good,"fun, friendly, good company to move up in. top notched benefits, good learning environment. the pay is ok it could be better"
good,"I was a customer service representative with Aflac. I answered calls regarding supplemental insurance policies. The job was challenging because there are no breaks in between calls, calls are monitored and must be completed within a certain timeframe. Nevertheless, these are common procedures amongst most call centers. The managers are extremely helpful and supportive, and it is easy to establish business ""friendships"" with employees. The benefits are phenomenal. The only reason why I left was to complete my education. I would be happy to return to Aflac."
good,"I learned so much from my summer at Aflac. From the internship, I learned aspects of sales, marketing, business to business communications and so much more."
good,"Made 50 cold phone calls a day, drove around for 2-4 hours prospecting, and followed up to approaches previously made. Then I would input the data into Everwell.  Time management helped with keeping everything on track.  The Management or Regional Sales Coordinator was super to work with.  All of the agents within our district were easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was not getting paid on a weekly bases, it was strictly commission only.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and working with other agents."
good,"I enjoy my employment with Aflac. I truly believe in the company and everything I do for them. As an Independant agent, I qualify businesses that are willing to offer supplemental insurance to their employees, so they are able to offer some financial security at a discounted rate on all policies. I enroll employees and help them file claims."
good,I love that I get paid on all the Aflac products that I sold since I first started. The 4 tier comp package fit what I was looking for.
good,"Company really treats both customers and employees great. Great work environment and co workers, Great pay and benefits as well. Awesome place to start a career."

good,"	Responsible for enrolling employees in EZShield "
good,"I enjoyed the flexibility of working with aflac, however I need something more stable and guaranteed.  The people are wonderful and I truly believe in the aflac products."
good,"A typical day at work I would have already prepared my schedule for the week the week before so I know exactly what route I would be taking that day. Calling on business owners, or prospect on possible good potential clients. Write business off several polices and collect commissions as payment. What I learned working for Aflac would be the importance in having insurance. A lot of us don't have any type of insurance and with the reform people are being penalized. As for management, I was my own boss. I managed my businesses making sure their answers where answered if any. I managed my time and schedule along the my out-of-pocket expenses to help my market, and brand. I was my own boss so co-workers was not an issue. The hardest part of the job was that my transportation was in need of serious repair and could not withstand the extra driving. The most enjoyable part of the job was the self fulfillment because I was able to call the shots and analyze myself in how well I conduct good work."
good,"My work was very complicated supervising many employees. Loved my job and got along with all employees. Very work focused to do my job without errors. Worked there for 28 yrs. What I have learned working here were many skills. Working in the IT dept, posting cash and had to opportunity to be a cashier supervisor. The hardest part was to make sure all cash was accounted for at the end of each day"

good,"clients dont see it the same way"
good,"I've learned it's always good to know multiple functions that make up the company that you work for because it makes you a well rounded and knowledgeable individual.  The more you know, the more useful you become.  And the more knowledge that you gain, the more creative you are to your company.  Teamwork also plays a huge part in the success of a company.  Everyone has their individual part, but the combination of those individual parts is what makes up that company."

good,"Aflac is a wonderful company. I worked in the call center two years and built many friendships and learned so much about the company. Working in the call center gave me a chance to learn about all policies and speak with claimants. A typical work day would involve answering 60-100 calls a day, checking on claims status, submitting escalations and researching policies for benefits."
good,you must work hard and want to be successful. Great energy when you walk in and commission pay scale is high. Nice and frendly people to work with.
good,"A typical day starts around 8am.  Monday mornings start off with a meeting, then out to my appointments or call to make appointments.  One thing I have learned is patience and perseverance and how to maintain a positive attitude throughout.  "
good,This place is production driven.  It was a great place to work and they were very trusting and forgiving when you made slight mistakes.  They always had fun things to do and made you feel like an important person and not like a number.
good,"Working here everyday is overall a great experience. To come to work and be able to feel comfortable and feel as if the workplace is a second home, because of the people and professionalism and culture is a great asset. Different management styles, diverse coworkers all help to grow me professionally cause I learn different perspectives and skills from different avenues of people and departments. The hardest part of my job I would say is not wanting to leave at the end of shift without completing a task on servicing a customer whether its inbound or outbound. This company makes you become and believe in being service minded. I would say the most enjoyable part is being blessed to be apart of such a great inspiring company that promotes a high level of professional and self growth."
good,"-       A typical day at work starts early. I go business to business, and speak with the owners about AFLAC, and how we can help them by providing benifits to their employess, which in return would help their benifit, because statistics show that employees that have benefits threw their workplace, stay with the company longer and work harder."

good,I went out cold calling talking to businesses about how to help them improve their benefits. I learned that cold calling is hard work and it is not for everyone. With this position I was my own manager I set my own time to work and set my own pace. I went out with different agents and we worked together learning each others selling techniques to sell the products. The hardest part of the job is the rejections and trying to overcome them. The best part of the jobs is competing for different incentives.
good,"I enjoy working at Aflac.  I typically attend to customers needs daily and help them fix problems.  I also have worked on numerous projects that enhanced our insurance applications including helping Aflac get on board to the Private Exchange, and merging with the USAA Private Exchange as well.
