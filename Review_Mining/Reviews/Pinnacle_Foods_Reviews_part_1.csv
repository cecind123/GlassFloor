bad,"If you have the credentials for a job at Pinnacle Foods it does not matter, they award jobs on who they like. The management will go to ball games with employees and then give these employees special privileges. They are not a fair company to work for...one person can be a drunk and falsify documents and still be there but let someone else falsify a document and they are fired immediately!"
bad,"Poor mangement...hopefully with ConAg taking over they will get better management in the plant. A bunch of rednecks who think they know about corporate america...lol.if you are a but kisser  you will have it made...they do not promote on skill, no it is done on who is there friend."
bad,First unless you spend the next year here and then someone gets hired on and starts making false comments and accusations about u so u get fired ....and god forbid u get injured and go out for medical ( short term and long term disablity u cant get till your in for a year ) so they point u every day your off and when u dont listen to your doctor go back to work early than ur supposed to and then a month later your supervisor will hand u a paper saying you pointed out over a month ago ....they sure do like.to waste people's times....training is not good there and no one really knows what they are doing ... No communication between the floor supervisors and the upper supervisors....also i didn't know a lead who is paid salary can say when their crew can go if their work is done they should be allowed to leave ...the crew shouldnt have to.stand around and watch them.do their lead paper work... Pretty sure a supervisors job to tell them when they can leave. Also the constant belittling of employees . the leads are allowed to constantly waste and throw away products without any consequences. Leads are also allowed to take longer breaks and leave property without a word said to them .one day you will get your 8 hours next day u might get 4 hours. Constant equiment failure resulting in being sent home early... So unless your a brown noser this is not the job for you...also if you end up on 2nd shift u can not move to day shift till after a year. No wonder they got bought out no one knows how to respect esch other and or know a good employee when they get one. The turn over rate is
bad,"you have to come back year after year, in order to be full-time at this particular job. because its only seasonal. you have to call in the day before to see if you are working the next day or not."
bad,"I loved factory work. But this company laid me off after two months of working here. I worked hard and put in over time. Loved the work itself, hated the people."
bad,High stress with constant search for the guilty.  Very poor management that ignores realistic opportunities to improve.  Very high turnover of great people.
bad,The workplace culture is extremely unprofessional which leads to the company's high turnover rate. This company can't hold on to good employees due to bad management and lack of corporate involvement in improving it.
bad,"A typical day for me was making sure all the machines were working properly, checking temperatures, calibrating the scales, adjusting the weights on the machines, making sure the papers were correct and match the product and was the same according to schedule, checking all the products were approved by the lab."
bad,Worst Place have ever worked!!!!!!!!!!! You will regret the day you were hired until the day you leave. Working there is like a bad Lifetime movie.
bad,Terrible management. The company is going backwards. I’d be surprised if they are around much longer.  They expect the world from you and give nothing in return. You can never get your vacation because no one is available to run your route. Expected to do all kinds of work for free. You don’t make any money. The only time the product sells is when they give it away which lowers your commission. It equals out to making about 12.00 an hour if that.
bad,"I have been working for Pinnacle for awhile as a temp. I was told after 90 days I would be hired on full time. It has been way past that time for myself and a few others who started with me. The people who have been there for awhile well treat you like you are stupid if you don't know something. Process for layer cake is horrible. The control room operator on C team expects you to be in more than one place at the same time, yet keeps calling you to tell you the same thing over and over, making it impossible to accomplish anything."
bad,They will tell you whatever you want to hear to get you to come work for them. Once you are there they make it mandatory 7 days a week. They tell you it will only be during the green season but it has been that way for the past 2 years with no end in site. When they do shut the lines down to do maintenance they don't have the parts to do the job. If you do take a chance with this company ask for everything in writing. Hopefully you don't quit a job to try and better yourself because then they think they have more leverage. So whatever is discussed in your interview will not matter because you will be a hourly employee working under a union contract for the next 10 years and they can not show favoritism to new employees
bad,"Overall culture of  people on the floor was great, employee wanted the plant to succeed . the issue with the plant is upper  management , the production managers and HR manager to believe more rumors then facts - Production managers they would schedule meetings with employees then never show up , during the last year and half 5 supervisor/ 3 managers have quit / with in the last few months 3 supervisor were fired because of no Control from their manager"
bad,"I can't speak for other locations, but the Centralia plant was the worst example of management that I've ever seen in my 30-year professional career. Failures of upper management were blamed on subordinates, many of whom were terminated as a result. Fear was the most widely used management tool. Very long hours. Note, I can only talk about conditions in 2016 into early 2017. Hopefully, things have improved. If not, run away."
bad,"Poor management.  Supervisors played favorites would edit favorite employees times and allow them to take longer breaks.  Good employees punished for being a good employees while bad employees get promoted and rewarded.  Weekly hours could range from 20 to 50, daily hours could go from 4 to 12.  One day you may get 12 the next day you may get 4.  Scheduled shift was 330pm-12 midnight.  Some nights would work til 230am other nights would work til 7pm.  Leads would talk down and be little employees and when employee would report to HR.  Employee would be fired for some made up reason without the lead receiving any discipline.  A lot of OSHA violations that jeopardize safety of employees and food.  Turn over is high due to people finding out what they were told in interview and promised in interview was not correct.  Shady backroom deals.  Management will tell one thing but do another.  Management not in unity or agreement, communication between management  and management, and management  and employee not even close to being good.  Qualifications doesn't matter if you are a favorite then exception will be made even if there is someone that meets all the qualifications.  Please read all reviews for Hagerstown, M.D. and other locations before applying or accepting the position.  Seems like a good move but could be career suicide.  If I could have I would have given negative 4 stars.  Work fast food first or clean toilets first because you will be treated like garbage if you are a great employee.  Leads are cutthroat.  If they find out one of their employees is more qualified than"
bad,It was very invigorating to be part of the change in environment at this organization.  Focus was not put on the associate value as it should have been.  Plant Managers changed for the worse....
bad,Upper management knows how to set-up goals but doesn't know how to attain them. No teamwork. They will throw you under the bus with false accusations just to make them look good and keep their jobs.
bad,Worked ALOT of overtime.  Management was only worried about numbers not about employees. Was mandated a lot and was treated poorly by management. Learned how cake goes into bags and boxes
bad,"The management at the Plant is great, however this position reports to corporate and corporate management is AWFUL! "
bad,"I've worked at many different companies but Pinnacle Foods Corporate office in NJ has been by far the worst. Oh let me just count the ways that makes this place toxic."
bad,"I worked in the waseca minnesota plant for 3 years, for 6 months out of the year I was required to work 7x10 shifts overnights and could only get time off as Leave of Absence or taking vacation time.  I have 2 young children and I had to forgo coaching my son's baseball and hockey team, had to quit my bowling league and had to miss soccer games for my daughter.  I missed school concerts and conferences, and when I would ask for time off it was always met with fristration, as if I was asking for a big favor.  Communication is poor, and management does not care about the employees until an accident happens, then they band aid the problem and keep moving.  Leads will take the first chance possible to step on you just to get a leg up.  They will tell you one thing, then tell on you for doing it the way they said to do it.  Don't even get me started on their insurance.  It's a joke."
bad,"Pinnacle has made some good innovations in the last few years, copying and improving from competitors. The company prides itself to have extremely lean structures which accelerate the decision making process and also put a huge burden on those who deliver. There are no to little process and management has absolutely no care for people. Certainly not a place to work. As a results the turn over is incredible."
bad,"Wasn't fond of the culture created in the very small office. The work was not very challenging, there was not room to advance seeing there were only 8 people in the office."
bad,Working for Snyders is the worst job ever. MANAGEMENT is absolutely lazy and incompetent.  They have no idea what theyre doing and are running g the company straight into the ground. Unrealistic expectations of drivers that get paid next to nothing.
bad,"No way you can even think about using the bathroom unless its break. Training program is a joke, job duties are different from shift to shift with the same job title. Standard manufacturing maintenance policies of no preventative maintenance and run it until it breaks and then bust out the bubble gum and duct tape to fix it for the next 15 years to concider buying an actual replacement. Birds, rats, or squirrels on the manufacturing floor? They cant have production downtime, so keep all the machines running while somebody gets the pellet gun, but dont forget to sign the sheet for the pellet gun. Working through an average of 3 breaks a week was normal. The forklift should have been retired years ago and i constantly felt like i was gonna run somebody over. If you get an offer, make sure they show you in writing, i got shorted $1 on hourly wage from what was agreed upon. Ive had alot of jobs in 33 years and this was the worst, I have no idea how i even stayed as long as i did."
bad,First off this company does not care about it's employee's​. They treat the employees (the ones that speak English) like indentured servants. 70% do not speak English. The only interest is production. This has caused major mechanical problems that they just want to slap duct tape on. The lack of communication skills and proper management has caused shutdowns forced by the FDA(Food and Drug Administration). Those are the people that make sure the food is safe to eat. There are very few employees that stay at this facility for more than a couple years.
bad,poor management no one has no idea what they are doing and the worst part its union for the people that do know what they doing dont want to show you anything and expect you to do it all because they know your not gonna stay long anyways i was hired in with 6 in my orientation and only one stayed
bad,"Wasn't too bad, but we got laid off a lot, and management sucked. Enjoyed the long weekends every weekend, but didn't like running out of unemployment waiting to be called back."
bad,The pay is good but the cost of insurance is ridiculous. Management does not work well with each other and are not team players. The company has cut back on spending letting the plants fall apart
bad,"This is a place where the ""Haves"" and the ""Have Nots"" are painfully obvious.  Management have nice offices and breakrooms. Laborers have a nasty, dirty, uncomfortable breakroom.  But there is so little time to take a break it doesn't matter does it? The management thinks everything is great, the laborers are stressed about getting another ""occurrence"" and getting fired.  The production environment is hot, smelly, ""fast-paced"" and relentless.  The production workers are unpleasant, especially the shift supervisors.  If you want to be treated like an indentured servant then go ahead and apply to work for this company, unless you get a management job.  Management seems to be easy, breezy.  You can eat all the chips you want while on the job, You can see this in the people who have worked there a while and not worked out because after therir shift they are too tired to move.  Good benefit package though, if you can stand the job!"
bad,very very bad job all the way around. no help no buckets no mix on time. get so far behind that they tell you have to work the weekend even if youre only a 9 to 5. they just don't care.
bad,"Where to start.   Useless raise over a year. Vehicles being driven will fail any inspection. Axle is bent. Window is broke. Locks don't work. Heater / a.c. doesn't work. No barrier between loads and drivers. Tires are worn. Oil is 9000km overdue. Mirrors are broke. Warehouse urinal is broke. Toilet is broke. Sewer backs up creating fumes. Warehouse lights are burnt out. Picker jacks held together with tape. Forklifts have no safety back up sound. Forklifts are in need of maintenance. Tractor trailers are constantly in need of repair. Overhead doors are in need of repair. Drivers work far too many legal hours. Constant vehicle problems. Pallet jacks need replacing. Zero health and safety protocol. If youre a highschool dropout and you don't care or have no ambition to further yourself in life, this place is for you. Anyone else that cares and has ambition, stay away. If I could give this place a negative star, I would,d."
bad,I was a security guard I passed out workers checks watered plants for the management weighted semis in and out checked vistors in and out
bad,"From the time I started to the time I left, I had racial comments directed towards me.  HR was non supportive of Supervisors.  High turnover with Supervisors. During my tenure at Pinnacle Foods, myself, and other Supervisors were in constant defense  of any decisions made.  Upper management is inconsistent in their decision making and are a major source of the toxic leadership in place.  If you desire to work in an environment where you are under constant scrutiny and subject to no less than 16 hours per day 7days per week, this is the place for you.    By the time I left, there were only three production supervisors that were still employed there when I hired in. One left shortly after I did for many of the same reasons."
bad,The company is a good school for how hard the business world can be. There is a highly politicized environment and the Support departments are hardly down to earth.
bad,There was no training for what the HR supervisor wanted.  No legable training manual to following.  Employees were all temps and office staff treated everyone badly.
bad,"Good people trying to make an impact but verge of burn out"
bad,THIS JOB IS OK.. The number one thing that's wrong is inappropriate relationships between employees.. It is a conflict and it makes job for others harder..
bad,"At the floor level this is a great job. The people out in the plant actually doing the work (Shift Managers down to the hourly worker) are a great bunch of people who truly do carry out the values Pinnacle promotes. The senior management, on the other hand, do not value any of the promoted values and only give them lip service. "
bad,managers do not know anything about the day to day operation of the plant. They are to busy attempting to get face time with coporate to pay attention to their surroundings.
bad,I wouldn't recommend  If you can't lift over 50 pounds. Also if your not good at standing for long periods of time. If you can't do any I suggest you look for another job.
bad,"Pinnacle stands behind a track record of success since the IPO in 2013, but does not believe the employees are the driver of that success. Senior managers harbor beliefs based on intuition and experience and will push back against facts that contradict these beliefs. Value is placed solely on results, regardless of how those results are achieved."
bad,This place is terrible they move you all around the plant everyday. The management doesn't care whose on break or when they get back as long as someone is on the line. The coworkers are generally ok but when everyone is mad its not the best site. The checks were enjoyable that's all.
bad,nothing to say but you worked long hours and got nothing out of it. Management always changes as well as ownership of the company.
bad,"Was a different place for me to work, as this is the 1st time I worked in the food industry. My co workers were easy to work with. Worst management I have ever had the pleasure to work with, The hardest part of the job was the hours. I worked the night shift and it was a 2 3 2. The people were the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,It’s an ok place to work payed 14.98 hr that’s if you don’t mind freezing for 10-12 hour a day and than having to come in on Saturday too! They tell you all week your gonna work 10-12 hour days somedays Changing from 10-12 at the end of the day so that you don’t have to work Saturday than on Friday afternoon tell you that you have to come in and work or have the schedule posted for the week and than change it on the fly or whenever they felt like it you couldn’t have a life or make plans!
bad,Supervisor work good lion B lineman or awesome but everything else in the place I did not like anytime you would ask a question somebody would y'all jumped on your throat and then you get calm down relax everyone's nice and then it starts don't like high school games
bad,"Management micro managed you constantly, keeping track of your scans as a forklift driver. Management constantly harrassing employees over little things which came off as hostile toward union employees. "
bad,"slow paced, peeling labels, cleaning bottles, boring. Poor manager/employee communications, poor management/agent communications. long hours. over nights."
bad,"I had no training, no objectives, and very little interaction with any kind of management. I completed every /any task on time, as requested, I was only there for three months, they had very unrealistic expectations. But they expected miracles."
bad,"I never realized how bad this job was until I got a much better position at a different company, and was treated like a human being. While I was at Pinnacle Foods, the workplace was at a near-constant 90 degrees with 100% humidity. I wasn't given proper safety equipment, and ended up burning my fingerprints off in the brine. To add insult to injury, we clock in with a fingerprint scanner, and I had to spend an extra 20 minutes each day (after 10-12 hour shifts) filling out paperwork saying that I had worked that day."
bad,"Human Resources is shady to say the least. Injuries on the job are typically met with company managers you never  see showing up at the hospital to pester the employee with legal concerns. Very insensitive to their bilingual workforce."
bad,"Strong brands"
bad,Fast paced workplace and very stressful. There is no communication between management which causes stress on them in which they take it out on the workers.
bad,"Sold a good dream promising yoy will learn what you need to learn in 90 days. The team asscoiates really didn't want to train you because it meant they actually had to do sone work. The asscoiates were rude, messy, We rarely got anything done in the first 6 hours. My first 60 days were unorganized, didn't get a lot of knowledge of my job until I had to move to another shift because the person training me said i was not "
bad,"Scheduled 600+ workers daily. Awarded bid jobs. approved vacations. employee relations. Helped HR when needed. Kronos specialist, scheduled birthday roundtables montly.  Made employee badges"
bad,"Management is very bright, but narrow minded and tactical.  The products are fantastic, and the innovation is stellar.  Management micro-manages the little things, instead of focusing on strategy."
bad,"A fast paced organization.  You have to be able to learn on the fly.  Executive management is very narcissistic, which often inhibits good ideas and suggestions."
bad,"There is very limited interaction between functional groups and management limits personal opportunity to contribute ideas that might have a positive impact on the business.There is definitely a silo mentality and communication has a defined hiearchy of who you are allowed to talk to. While the company has some very strong brands, they invest behind only a small number of them with innovation and marketing, yet expect to drive increased sales volumes and share based off of historical investment.The organization runs very lean and senior management takes great pride in comparing their low labor costs to other companies as a comparison to overall sales."
bad,didn't like this place was very unprofessional. no one told me where I needed to start or showed me around. I was all over the place.
bad,"Just amazing, I've never seen a company staffed with so few knowledgable employees, especially in the food industry. The culture is one that rewards ""low achievers"" and managers who ""raise the bar"" are looked at unfavorably. The company should be thankful the product sells itself."
bad,Summary of work experience.  Direct supervision was not available to assist correcting issues found.  My hiring manager was promoted within one month of my start with the company and the transition was poor to their replacement.
bad,"I ran incerts for brownies and cake."
bad,It’s an hard job and if your not up for it it’s not the job for you. There’s a lot put into making a bagel and most don’t realize it but it’s hard work and dedication.
bad,This is a very stressful and unfair place to work. The sanitation jobs on 3rd is the hardest job in the plant and is the most stressful. The management is very unfair to some employees.
bad,The work itself is ok.  There are a variety of different jobs to pick from that focus on different aspects of a person.  Management is untrustworthy because they not held accountable for there actions and change the rules often.  It takes a longtime to advance.
bad,"keeping track of product flow, doing data entry, any sanitation and maintenance that needed done to keep with in quality and safety limits. I learned team work and how to stay with in quality guide lines. I enjoyed working with95% of my co-workers. The hardest part was I  didn't have good a work relationship with supervisor . supervisor told team leader and other employees that she didn't like me and called me vulgar names behind my back. Over all I enjoyed when I learn better ways of doing my job in a least coast effective way."
bad,"Don't get me wrong.  This company pays very well.  The benefits are ridiculously expensive and don't cover anything. I loved going into work but towards the end I would come home in tears.  Management was awful and played favorites.  Co workers would stand around and watch others do their job.  Some people were allowed to take excessive breaks, and even leave the property while on the clock with nothing said to them.  When the work was completed, some employees were told to go home while others would sit around in the supervisors office until their scheduled time off so they could get their 40 hour paycheck.  "
bad,its okay if you dont mind long hours driving and working for a company that does things that does what they can to cut costs.
bad,"Complete management overturn, company is sold very often and ideas and company goals change often, is a very stressfull place to work with very little upper management support, alot of backstabbing and lieing."
good,it was fun while it lasted. the pay was good but had too many lay offs and no benefits.
good,Its a good place to work. Long 12 hours. Nice people to work with.Good insurance. Breaks are short.The hardest part  of the job is they run the long to fast.
good,"When you buy croissants from Woolworths, you helps pay our wages. Yes, all croissants, donuts, some cakes and cookies sold at Woolworths are produced here."
good,Would really rather not comment but I can't seem to get past this part without doing so.   Plant management is overbearing and/or not properly trained to do the jobs they are in.  Workforce scheduling is a trainwreck.
good,"Lots of weekend work. On-boarding process needs work, many vital details left out in orientation. Training is most on the individual to seek out, Culture of company is a bit undesirable."
good,Working at Pinnacle was an interesting experience. The money was good but the balance between my life and the job was not.The working conditions were not too bad though. We got 15 minute breaks every 2 hours and a 30 minute break for lunch. There would be special events too for lunch so it worked all out.
good,I ended leaving my job of 5 years due to management favorites and not having stable senior management in the facility. I was not going to ever be getting a raise either my manager told me....
good,"No time off and does not seek to understand, No ownership, Management way does not accept input from others, Poor employee reconigistion or build a team atmosphere"
good,As a Supervisor I have 3 levels of mgr's above me at the plant which means 3 sets of expectations. This does not include indirect managers (4 of them)
good,The hourly employees are the best you can ever find. Silo management style from top leadership makes it a tough environment to want to work in. Only certain individuals are held accountable.
good,This job isn’t for the faint of heart. Manager was a nice guy but wasn’t supported by upper management and this caused him to pressure his reports until it impacted him!
good,I love my job. I enjoy being around my co workers. The down side is you work thare through a temp service. There is no chance of full time or advancements.
good,"I learned a variety of jobs. From prepping the product, to making it. Inspecting, measuring, weighing.  Recording weights, quotas. and other required information. Assited in line service. Weighed and distributed spices. Stocked and labeled products. Sanitized. The job was fast passed, long hours. The best thing about tje job for me, was the pay."
good,was't too bad a place to work. prior to this maintenance had never had a lay off before. so I don't know what its going be like in the future. they did treat me well while I was there and gave a severance package upon leaving.
good,"This company only cared about production. The work environment was terrible at times. Instead of trying to make the atmosphere better, they looked for ways to fire people. That is why the company is no longer in business."
good,it has its ups and its downs i do have to say in some ways it is better than gilster the company that it bought out that i was working for the attendance policy could be a little more lenient
good,"Company has grown significantly. Many in senior management roles have gotten fired or let go, as there is blame for projects not going correctly, rather than recognition of systemic problems such as lack of resources or lack of due diligence. The company is generally slow to promote; common theme of employees not getting rewarded for delivering results."
good,It can get pretty hot in there but for the most part it was a good place to work. Not to long of hours. Not asking too much things are always messing up and one day is not like the next. It's fun and adventurous. I also lost 15 lbs my first month there going up and down 3 sets of stairs. So if you have bad knees I wouldnt suggest it.
good,Nice place to work. Fast paced. Cool schedule. Fun environment. I started through a temp company and progressed to a full time position. Family matters caused me to have to relocate a few hours away.
good,A very metric minded company that helps you understand what is needed or what is behind what is driving the inability to meet goals.  Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the metrics you are responsible for
good,Fast pace working. Packing bagels coming down a conveyor belt. Machine is always breaking down causing chaos and a mess of bagels all over the place. Colder work area. Allowed 2 twenty minute breaks a night. No lunch. Paid weekly is a plus. Work with a younger group of people who could care less if they put in an effort.
good,"I enjoyed working at Vlasic for many years. Towards the end of my employment there, I couldn't help but know that there was something else out there for me. So I am looking for that position now. I am not one to tread water ,so to speak. The time has come to venture out and supply another company with my skills and knowledge."
good,"Company is slowly downsizing  "
good,"Pinnacle is very  disjointed"
good,"All they do is want form after form filled out for stupid things its not Apple or Google its potato chips, they act like its NSA secret material, annoying management makes issues over the smallest things instead of worrying about where their sales are going, they need to listen more to the drivers at Snyders of Berlin, not bring in people who think they know it all, that make stupid forms and have more meetings than any company I ever worked for!"
good,"Their business model was a lean workforce, but I was able to work with that and accomplish my goals. On the whole, the company was a good workplace culture.  I enjoyed the actual work that I had to do, but did not enjoy the bureaucracy involved that focused on minutiae and did not allow for work on a larger scale. I enjoyed the interaction with coworkers, but not those who have unfound prejudice against other workers."
good,When i first started there it was a decent place but over the years it became badly managed  and was sold several times.. moral was bad too very stressful
good,"They work with very slim head count.  People work long hours. "
good,"this job was for one summer and everyday was hot and long. The compensation was good for the amount of time I worked there but as it was a summer job only, there was not option to move up the ladder."
good,If you are recently graduated from college then this is the place for you.
good,job closed to soon loved to work there. worked the night shift just cleaning and set up for the next day fun place to have worked
good,I wouldn't call it the best company to work for but I would say that I got to experience a little bit of everything here.  Very positive for my career.
good,"Leadership somewhat disconnected to day to day functions, but overall good experience. Positive feedback and support from cross functional peers. Upbeat atmosphere."
good,Overall a great place to work. The moral has been down due to the effect of current events that are happening. The people are great and are easy to work with.
good,"Very productive environment, required approval of orders shipped.  Communication with other Associates.  Co-workers were 15 years are longer employees.  Sometimes difficult to work with, because of years of service"
good,It's been a good experience at Pinnacle Foods and it's a shame that we were recently purchased.
good,"the work environment was great. I loved the people I worked with, they knew the meaning of teamwork and weren't afraid of a little hard work. I learned the value of teamwork and how to work hard and communicate with everyone so that everything runs smoothly. the hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the heat but i always drank plenty of water to keep hydrated. the best part of the job was the people i worked with, everyone was always willing to give a helping hand"
good,Typical work day is 10 hours for salary personnel.  Company structure is very lean. Always struggling to get good management personnel.  Very open culture. Team members are very supportive when challenged.
good,i would return its very hot and for the most part the people are fun and work orientated. The days was long and hard and very hot but i would do it all again the pay was also good it was just seasonal and i needed long term employment
good,My work is fairly autonomous. I have the freedom to plan and complete my responsibilities within the approved times and guidelines. I am able to gather people into teams to accomplish assigned projects as needed.
good,"It is a good place to start a career. You manage to learn a lot in a little time, the atmosphere that the staff provided was good, the hardest part of the job was working with maintenance to get things done in an efficient manner."
good,"First year was productive, but going into second year, we had problems due to company investors not being able to successfully do an IP.  Leadership at the plant was one of the best and most capable I have ever been a member of.  Real good people."
good,"Back when I worked at Pinnacle was on the stressful side each day as i had to deal with old machinery. Before I got hurt, Pinnacle was in the process of getting new equipment that was going to make life easier and boost production. I don't know how thing are there now, but things have to be better than when I was there. I loved the people I worked with. Just not the old machinery. I believe I would stiil be working there if I had not got hurt."
good,Good job to work at. Its a union environment. Its a 3 shift operation and has good opportunities for overtime if you want it. Sometimes even if you don't want it.
good,"Pinnacle Foods is fast pace, high volume production plant that runs constantly. Depending on the department the work is pretty easy but you work in a cold environment.."
good,enter the six o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the afternoon it worked exactly as the work have three break time
good,It was a line worker job you would stand all day and do manual labor till your shift ended some of the jobs there were good some were bad just depends what they had you do.
good,"I like working at Pinnacle because I learned many new skills about operating machinery, quality of product, quality of materials used to package product and skills to produce top quality product in short time frame. The hardest part of the job is to produce a top quality product under USDA guidelines but I enjoy trying to do this to the best of my ability."
good,"The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the different work areas. Overall, the management team and coworkers were pleasant and helpful."
good,"Company was more concerned with making profits than well being of employees. there was no room for advancement, my time at this company did provide me with a different perspective of companies"
good,"Reasonable work conditions. Excellent engineered products, good management, proper training. I worked very hard at ASCO a shame that New Jersey was too expensive for Emerson to leave this company manufacturing in United States."
good,it was a nice place to work and i enjoyed the experience the work was steady
good,I was to stuff every jar with as many pickles as possible before the jar passed me on the line.
good,"A typical day at pinnacle was always business the most important thing at the end of the day was production and making our goals,Although it sounds serious your day was what u made of it being the type of person that I am my personality made all my days lovely my interaction with my fellow workers made business a challenge,Our goals on our shift were to stand out and be the best out of all the other shifts that's what made it exciting to actually be at work."
good,nice place to work you are able to learn alot of new things and work with alot of different people.
good,I supervised a 16-person production line of bakers and machine operators in the production of Celeste Pizzas for One and Aunt Jemima Breakfast Entrees. Accountable for troubleshooting of line and meeting all quality and efficiency objectives.
good,"Pinnacle pays ok. there is a lot of politics involved. benefits are pricey. supervisors for the most part are decent, but the management is about 50/50"
good,"Faced paced job.  Planning loads and tracking delivery.  I learned to communicate with all levels of company, local and corporate.  Learned to hone my skills in communication with carriers.  Management was always a challenge to keep up with the expectations of new leadership.  Constant changes in management in my department."
good,Strong corporate structure. Enjoy working with the people. There are a lot of talented people employed here. It has a very experienced workforce.
good,Enjoyed my experience early on and my first two managers made work exciting and rewarding.  My 3rd and final manager had very poor interpersonal skills.
good,"Fast-paced, lean environment. Employees trusted with a lot of responsibility, but sometimes there is a lack of communication/guidance from management and leadership teams. Overall, great people that made coming to work enjoyable."
good,Fast paced job days go by fast people are nice that I work with I have learned alot while working here I think I can take this experience and go a long way in life and improve myself better
good,"The supervisors and their assistants suck. If you're not one of their 'pets' you get treated like garbage, but at least you have a union to stand up for you. Still at that rate you shouldn't have to fight for fairness. If you make a mistake and they don't like you you'll forever walk with a target on your back, but when one of their 'pets' turns around and does the same thing no one notices it happened. Other then that the job is great."
good,The job I had was ok at the time; definitely something I wouldn't stay for if I had a better offer. Management there was great for a fast pace work environment. The hardest part of the job was being one of the few who actually kept up; other than that I enjoyed most the people I worked with and it taught me how to be a fast worker.
good,Some good people.  1/3 of the plant shut down. 12 shifts on nights gets long and tiring.  For someone young the night shift would be great and could make some good money.
good,This was my first factory job so the experience was new but overall they treated everyone fairly and gave you the chance to excel in the company. great place to work.
good,This company has plenty of room for advancement but does not use in house talent like it should.  A lot of opportunity to make a good living and has a descent work life balance.
good,I absoulutley hated working in this place. I cired the first week working there
good,"Very limited budget for training/travel."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits, management sometimes more concerned about them selves, instead of worker, but they have rule and guideline to follow. I love the workers we are family because we all spend a lot of time together. Hardest part of job working in very cold environment, enjoyable part of job you can get a break go to the break room and warn your hands and body"
good,Over all working at pinnacle was a good working environment I loved the benefits they offered they had good vaction and sick day offers more than the average its a place where you have the ability to advance to different departments in the buliding working with good people was also a plus to working here
good,"I works a 8 to 12 hour day. Over my 17 years at Pinnacle I have learned to run some of the wrappers and paper work. The people that I work with, I feel as though we have became a family to the most part but working on the line with some I fill they could do better or be trained better but that's where management comes in. Some are trained too long and others not long enough. I think that's where poor management comes in. Over my years on the job a lot of new people has came into management and instead of them learning the rules or going by the rule book, they just make rules as they go. The hardest park of the job is feeling like if we have a problem, we have no one to really talk to cause when it's all said and done management thick together even if they're wrong or right. The best part is you can pretty must make as much money as you want if you'er will to put in the time"
good,"I guess being very hot was likely to be expected working a factory job. the hours were long but the pay was great, i would recommend, but nothing long term as this is usually just seasonal work."
good,Success is all encompassed with the numbers!! Positive management embracing a strong safety culture. Constant search for improving processes and environment.
good,I really love working there it was a good place i enjoyed the money and the hours. They were fairly fair they respected one another it was really nice there
good,"Lots of standing on your feet and running machines or doing inspection work.  Some heavy lifting,  Can be fast paced at times."
good,"At Pinnacle you worked hard but you also played hard.  Employees made sure things were done on time.  We shared in the work and the fun. The employees were very friendly and it was mostly a fun place to work."
good,It was a great work place to gain more training on Hilo. It also provided a means to get money needed for a time to get through a hard time. The people are willing to help you with training.
good,"I had a great team of co-workers at Pinnacle. Most of the production managers were personable and good to work with."
good,"While employed at Pinnacle foods, I was able to see many advancements and many set backs. The corporate office works as though the factory is running at peak efficiency and does not look to see if they can improve or help the workers or the facility, until it is to late, and another company is trying to buy them."
good,birdseye was a great company till pinncle foods bought them out When the comapany was birdseye foods they put me through a apprentice ship program took me form a sanitation job to maintenance mechanic
good,Working at Pinnacle foods taught me alot in a factory setting. From cleaning to set up and all the details that go into ensuring safety and sanitation before running the next product.
good,"i really enjoyed working in this kind of environment, it makes for a good work day, almost all the employees make it just as much pleasurable. it also made it easy to keep production going at a beneficial rate when everyone gets along, i did not dread going into work."
good,"Pinnacle Foods was a very lean, fast paced organization.  At times it was difficult to keep up but everyone worked together and got the job done.  The company rewarded its employees with decent compensation and bonuses."
good,"Pinnacle was an overall great place to work. Culture is fast paced, and can change based on leadership project prioritization, or by competition headwinds. Pinnacle works to respond fast to innovation or productivity initiatives - and those that share the same passion, ultimately thrive and succeed."
good,"A great work environment but with a little too much micromanaging.  It was fast growing company but has since been acquired by another corporation (ConAgra, Inc.)."
good,"Great people to work with, company has its up and downs, needs alot of imporvement on training and supervisors need to make time for their reviews on employees"
good,Management a little bit to be desired work was not hard training was ok bi lingual a bit harder for some employees hours were good working 7 days a week every week a bit hard on family life
good,"I learned how to work in collaboration with other areas within the companyto expedite orders to be distributed throughout the NY area  I also learned how to monitor and retract errors that were made in the order inventory before being shipped out to the different markets that we served.  Overall, I enjoyed the learning process, but wish that it was closer to home.  ."
good,It's nice they get paid every week but some places inside the building are very cold and it's not worth the money that they are paying for you to be there
good,"very good pay, very strict absence policy even with doctor notes, Worked for a year and loved the pay, hard work but well compensated, hard to get on here."
good,"We received preventive maintenance work orders and repair work orders at the beginning of the day to start. We would do our PM's and repairs and if there was time left in the day after answering calls for maintenance to the line we would do rebuilds. Rebuilds of gear boxes and pumps and many other components of the operations of the plant were the things I enjoyed the most. Over the years I worked with many highly skilled men and women that past down to me their hard earned knowledge of their skilled trade. Many members of the team have become very close friends that I stay in contact with till this day, many are supervision. Looking back at the trials of the job, I would say the heat was the hardest to bear. The plant is run with steam, ovens and heaters. On those hot summer days it was difficult to work, the heat would smother you."
good,"Overall good place to work. Downside is not much career advancement, poor defined career paths, and management does not support and facilitate career growth. Very difficult to move as it is a lean organization with limited opportunity for advancement. Need some fresh minds to innovate new ideas."
good,"My work in the QA Dept helped to oversee the successful operations of no less than eight sub-systems, running simultaneously to ultimately produce frozen entrees."
good,"I learned to do more than just marketing. I got a great GM experience. I was also able to lead key projects."
good,Friendly work environment with great co-workers. Well established company with very a great foundation. Room for advancement is limited.
good,"The job was very fast paced. When you are on the line if you have people that know what they are doing you will catch on very fast. The most enjoyable part is being able to relate to the workers and they are very friendly, Its pretty easy to find a car pool to join also"
good,"I liked working for this company for monetary reasons. Benefits were a plus. Management at the time bias and unfair. Made it uncomfortable to work, even though I did my job to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately after a few years my best wasn't good enough."
good,"Good group of colleagues"
good,great starting job for people who have never worked before.  can be fun when working with the right team. training is always being offered for different positons
good,"Excellent Company to work for. Lots of innovation, continuous improvement and opportunity for advancement if you are willing to move within the company. Very lean structure."
good,"Good Culture and team but very lean in terms of resources, Business Planning for example.  Innovation has been slow but there has been tremendous growth driven by acquisitions."
good,"- Expect to work mandatory overtime."
good,Start work at 4:30 pm till 2:30 in morning. Learned to operate many different machines. Worked well with management on daily basis .Got  along with co-workers everyday. Learning some of the machine operation. Working with management an co- workers.
good,"I ran a machine everyday. There was long hours that ran into the am hours, glass breakage, short breaks, which was the hardest part of the job. Very friendly co-workers."
good,"It's a good place to spend 40 to 50 hours of your week.  The people are great.  The organization is pretty lean so there is a lot to do, but not a ton of places to go.  Career paths are very linear and there is a ton of competition for advancement."
good,Overall not a bad place to work. There is a lot a person can learn due to how lean the company is; it's up to you how much you make of it.
good,The beginning of the shift is rushed - I calibrate the equipment and line function.
good,"At Pinnacle you need to be on top of your stuff and be ready to pull up your sleeves to get it done. Everything is fast and you will be amazed at what you can accomplish. Hard work, but everyone joins in."
good,"inspection product before stacked"
good,"The company was great to work for, despite turnover being a regular occurrence.  The individuals that left, were typically replaced with individuals that fit the company as well as the individuals that had left.  Overall company was great, interested to see how the Congagra acquisition changes things."
good,"Enjoyed working with the maintenance department good group of guys! The work was stressful and always time driven, but the wage made dealing with the drama very feasible."
good,Pinnacle foods growth has exceeded it's ability to rise with innovation. At all times the company puts forth it's best efforts to gain momentum to sustain it's ever growing demands
good,"I never saw a year without a layoff of no less than four weeks per year during my tenure at Pinnacle Foods.  The longest was eight weeks, spread out throughout the year.  The trade off was all of the overtime to be had.  Even with the layoffs, I made more than $10k in overtime, over and above the 2080 hours for a standard work year.  It was good pay for an honest day's work.  Unfortunately, there was little work-life balance, as six day weeks, and sometimes all seven days, was a norm there.  "
good,I really like it there met some awesome people there and some great friends. Work really isn't hard you just gotta wonna work and be able to stand for about two ta three hours between breaks.
good,In my many years as a machine operator I have learned many things. I work on high performance work teams and we constantly challenge one another skill levels on a daily basis. I've always been eager to learn and fascinated with machinery mainly packaging equipment and processing equipment. Im experience in product weight control and producing high quality products. Time management is the key . Everyone should be producing at a good rate never leave a team member behind because we operate as one unit.The hardest part of my job is when a member of the team looses focus and production falls short but what I enjoy mostly is overall we are there for one another if you are having an unproductive day.
good,"This was a very rewarding work experience. I was able to work independently as I helped the plant realize it's capital and facility needs. "
good,"A good company with the correct vision for the future. However, planning and production are not in sync causing long hours for all production personnel."
good,"Pack waffles, and pancakes. How to work with others.A good group of people. They were a good bunch of people. Putting three pancakes in a slot without moving. The overtime!."
good,The only reason i was NOT able too do this job was because of my bad back. other than that the money was good the hours were good and there was always overt time available. ALWAYS
good,Pinnacle has a proactive approach to improving on brands through productivity initiatives and packaging improvements.
good,the main issue I had with Pinnacle was the opportunity for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work Pinnacle Foods, is a day full of hard work. I learned how to operate machines and work along with others. My co-workers and I was a part of a high performance team. When a machine broke down we came together to get the machine back up and running in a timely matter. The hardest part of my job at Pinnacle was when people did not come in and perform up to their best abilities, that would make the job harder on the other co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was, working hard getting the job done correctly. When job is done and done right everybody are happy!"
good,"very cold or very hot, wet a lot of the time etc very rushed on time to complete task with little to no assistance  they do train you really well and pay  is decent"
good,"Pinnacle (Cherry Hill office) was a hard working group, we accomplished a lot with the lean staffing situation, but somehow managed to keep it fun.   Company tried to give perks and show appreciation routinely.   Unfortunately, we were acquired and office is closing."
good,"Pinnacle was a great place to work and was acquired by ConAgra last year. When our office closes I am really going to miss all of my co-workers. "
good,A great place to work for the dedicated employee. Management could be better. Attendance policy could use some modifying to help prevent the abundantly high employee turn over rate.
good,Fairly new factory so it's a little crazy right now.  It's to be expected but they need to sort out the kinks before they lose everybody. The only problem is that corporate had a hiring freeze and they're are not enough people to run normally...take the freeze off! !!
good,"this was a excellent place to work, they inherited a great team of workers and when a chance came they left us for a better tax deal i n another state"
good,"Pinnacle is a fast-paced working facility. There's no such thing as a typical day, in my opinion since every day brings new opportunities to learn something different, and dealing with different issues that require problem solving, which I enjoy. The hardest part of my job is the commute. The most enjoyable part of my job is the employees."
good,The company is very fast paced but you get rewarded for the good job that you do. The hard work that you put in will be reconized with advancement in the company.
good,"typival day a constant walk and lifting,to dealm with people drive a forklift,mamnagement was great,culture was excellent,it wasnt a hard part caught on very easy,enjoyed the people and work environment"
good,i liked working there because i got to run big machines. and do different jobs all the time. the only thing i didn't like was working for 12 to 16 hours a night.
good,"I worked with a supervisor for over 11 years and had mostly good reviews but when the position was being eliminated, nothing was done to find a place for me to continue my employment.  This company is becoming ""big business"" and as such, is looking for the profit margin sometimes at the expense of employees.  Most employees spend much time attending meetings and have to work hard to obtain their job requirements."
good,It was good for a summer job nice management  really fast paced  also it very hot so be prepared to sweat clean place nice supervisors  but the only really thing I didn’t like was you have to wait tell the pitcher person done with break be for you go on break
good,"Fast paced, quality was a most due to the food as maintenance we put in a lot of overtime, during season we would work day-in and day-out for months with out days off"
good,Working at Pinnacle was a great experience! The fast pace of the company keeps you on your toes and you never have to worry about falling into a mundane routine.
good,"Pinnacle Foods was an extremely fun place to work, besides the constant lay offs. If it wasn't for the lack of work for my position, I never would have left. I've never left a job because I was bored and didn't have enough to keep me busy, until I went to PF. The culture, and work environment was very comfortable and a place you loved to be at.Great management."
good,Enjoyed the job and pay was fair but did not appreciate being lied to about my job security and then surprised with the knowledge of a lay off.  I was offered to move to the company headquarters but it would have been unfeasible due to time constraints and no relocation or cost of living adjustment
good,"An enjoyable part of the job is a team of people working on a solution to an issue, implementing those solutions and seeing positive results. If the outcome is not the desired one, the team refocusing of what went right and course correcting to achieve the acceptable end result. Quote would be ""Don't tell me what we can't do, but rather what we can do""."
good,"I was all over the place. Never on one set job ."
good,Enjoy working at Pinnacle Foods and the people I work with. Clean and safe environment.
good,typical work day would be 10 hours a day. The people who work there are great people with a great management staff. I would recommend anyone to work for this company
good,The work was agriculture related and was extremely fast paced. We worked a lot of overtime but the team of coworkers made the long hours very enjoyable.
good,Every day was different w its own challenges which made for a varied and eventful job. interacted w other departments on a daily basis which led to learning experiences.
good,; your work can have big impact. Opportunities to work on projects beyond your regular work. Results oriented company. Great co-workers. Everyone plays to win. Winning track record of results. Easy access to senior leadership. Values are not just a poster on the wall - people actually live them.
good,"Typical work day is 10-12 hours, I learned so amy skills being new to the factory side of work. Management was outstanding and always push employees to better themselves. Workplace culture in the plant builds character, and better people for tomorrow. Hardest part of the job is to retrain almost everyday temporary employees. Most enjoyable part of the job is management recognizing employees hard work."
good,"We start with a daily meeting and give anyone a chance to ask or tell any issues or problems."
good,"fast paced"
good,"Working for Pinnacle is a fast paste environment. Analyzed test result to classify products, or compare results with standard tables. Management changed a lot and a person had to adapt. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was when a new product was produced. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing something you made on the shelf."
good,"Very challenging work, financial restrictions are sometime barriers. The work is very interesting and you may need to work very closely to the auditors,"
good,"Team environment, and the company exercises their values daily. Trust, Candor, Ownership.."
good,"Great company that is fast growing."
good,I enjoyed my job. I worked as a sanitation technician where I worked with others as a team. I enjoyed my co-workers because they were always there to help when needed.
good,Family like company with great leaders showing you the ropes. Hands on experience with any and all aspects of marketing and branding.
good,Good work hours family life not a prison atmosphere benefits are fair treated unfairly for no reason enemies upgraded quicker to boss you around. Follow the rules and take shorter brrakes. Timed breaks and lunch always faster than time must be meth time????
good,"Pinnacle is an awesome place to work, the pay is great and the people are nice as well, very helpful. The work can be a little stressful if you let it get to you, but it will keep you very busy  and that's a good thing because it does make the time go by fast. Good place to work."
good,This was the easiest job I have ever had. Most people do not like the processing department because they rather go to packaging. I think the reason is that packaging is a lot easier and less smellier. But if anyone had a restaurant job then they would take fish processing over anything.
good,Enjoyed set up lines for daily production and training employees to be the best they could be at thier positions
good,great place to work for. safe and clean. good co workers. stable co. jobs and advancements are possible. have had opportunities to further education.
good,I enjoyed working a Pinnacle Foods its a very fast pace job and you make very good money.I learned how to pack pickles the proper way the hardest part about Pinnacle Foods is standing in one spot for so many hours but i enjoyed and appreciated the job.
good,"The company as a whole seems to operate fairly well. The experience was rather fun, to be honest. I enjoyed what I did, and it was fairly straight forward. Sure I went home smelling like cake, but that is the worst thing I can say about it."
good,I really enjoyed working at Pinnacle Foods. I gained a lot of skills in food manufacturing there. I worked with some wonderful coworkers. I felt the life/work balance was great.
good,"Challenge was to close the operation in Erie, and still keep workforce engaged. Being in the position where the ""buck stopped here"" was rewarding. Many good initiative were taken with the total dedication of the staff and workers."
good,"A typical day at work would be preparing product and getting my station or machine set up for that day and being prepared any new task that would be expected or come up as well, both jobs consist of the same description just different titles both jobs made me a success at any place I go to. Pinnacle Foods production was more ongoing packing boxing off products Mostly hands on less machine work then Interstate Graphics."
good,Those who succeed in their career develop good work habits and learn their job thoroughly they are prompt pleasant and neat like all teams everyone who is a member must
good,Good to work with this company. Best work ethics is followed. nice professional environment. Best place to groom analytic skills.

good,I loved this job and had a great Job there the machines were easy  to run and ran on the whole smoothly the management there was fair. This was a great job
good,Work was un organized. Team leader turn over was high due to not being supervised properly.
good,"I inspected food, cleaned, wrote down the numbers for pallets , work prioritization and settling the cooked product."
good,Pinnacle has been a very good company until it got bought.  Worked long hours and very hard and we were paid well in Food Service.  The management team lacked.  Great products and they kept us relevant with acquisitions in key categories.
good,"its a not too bad pace to work. the type of work is a bit too tough but it depends on each person I guess. The team work side of it, just not 100%. But I guess it depends on you as an eployee"
good,"Pinnacle is a good place of employment,  Union ran plant ,good PSM / Safety department. The coworkers will work with you and actually help train you.Great team in my opinoin,but as i always say there is always room for improvement."
good,"I gained an amazing experience in product development and data analysis that i will take with me to my next career. "
good,"Working at Pinnacle Foods allowed me to develop invaluable skills. The company is very lean which allows its employees to have impact, thrive, and leverage capabilities."
good,Great co workers and culture.  Fun but challenging.  Enjoyed doing research and making presentations.  Enjoyed helping others.
good,I loved working there and would probably go back if offered that same position. Only reason I left was over the HR lady that is no longer there was harrassing me and who do you report harrassment to besides HR.. It told a very good friend of mine passing away because of her not excusing him for sick days then he got so sick he finally risk his job to go the hospital after there he passed away within 12  hours..I did not take his death well and the HR lady showed no remorse for his dealth.

Very friendly and relaxed work the pay was great I highly recommend the Company. I had to leave due to relocating but i loved working there and I would definitely do it again l.
good,When I first started I fit right in. My co-workers were very helpful and gave me some really good tips to increase the value of work I was doing. The head cheif was always good at timing which made working at a place when time means a bit easier for everyone

good,"Enjoyed working with friendly new people , Enjoyed the learning process of something different."
good,Pinnacle is a fast pace job.We must get in and put on a cover-all outfit.We also put mask on and safety glasses.I learned how to operation machines.The management was a very neat person.He like to keep his space clean.The people i worked with was very helpful.We worked on the line so it was a group project.The hardest part about the job was the clean up part.Cleaning relish etc.I enjoyed learning how to work machines.
good,Pinnacle is an outlet for the world it dedicates in sanitation and safety quality and performance. It's an Union based company so it takes more to actually enjoy the full benefits that they offer. But cherry season there is always work.
good,Loce the job but had to have a emergency surgery  and couldnt go back but the time i did work there it was great and the people showed me what i had to do and how to do and was always willing to hp if needed
good,"Pinnacle Foods is a very well run company where management has a clear and structured plan.  We work hard to stay on track with the plan and the Company has always met its financial goals.  The Company offers challenging work while maintaining a sense of calm and comfort for employees, allowing individuals to determine their career pacing, to a certain extent, while still meeting the needs of the organization.  The Company maintains a strong value system consisting of integrity, candor, trust and ownership.  Everyone is on the same team at Pinnacle and we get the job done."
good,"I liked working for Pinnacle because you learn different jobs, so that you didn't get bored of doing the same thing over and over again everyday. Also the wok there was not strenuous or had you lifting heavy material."
good,Pinnacle has a lot of hard working and smart employees.  Your experience may vary depending on the department. Some people may advance more quickly than others thanks to how well they play the political game.  Overall I'd recommend Pinnacle as a good place to work.
good,"Enjoyed working alone and as a group to solve problems. Always new challenges daily. Worked within the company, warehouses and customers to solve product control. Contact with quality control for food safety."

good,Job was very easy I was trained in 3 different areas in less than 6 months they give you a chance to explore and learn new things
good,"Good benefits, good retirement , great  hourly  lots of overtime if you like that company picnic  only drawback for me was 3rd shift I didn't like that"
good,"First group meeting beginning of shift make my department rounds clean warehouse of debris use scrubber to take care of floor in warehouse processing and packaging areas take care of dumpster area"
good,The open door policies of the top ranking boss and how job functions are project based thereby giving you a freehand to operate and contribute the the value chain.

Stocked shelves and counters and fridges with inventory to be sold."

good,I cleaned and sanitized machines according to company standards.Used material safety data sheet msds. I also had to make sure I took notes on anything I found during the process.
