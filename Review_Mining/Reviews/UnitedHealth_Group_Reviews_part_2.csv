good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

good,"UHG was my first company. Coming from a non-tech background, I got to learn a lot in the first 2 years. Maybe due to regulations and complications in the healthcare industry, I felt my skills are not updating as with the industry."
good,I loved the flexibility of the schedule and evaluating our customers in their home. I did a lot of travel within AZ and enjoyed the diversity of the different places I have been. I felt supported and encouraged by other staff and management.

good,"It’s a great company to work for, but there are things that could be approved. Love that working from home is an option if you meet requirements. Worth it."
good,I work fully from home so I cannot supply details regarding UHC's office environment/politics. What I can say is their benefits are what one would expect and compensation across many positions is more than adequate. Leadership stays connected with its employees without being intrusive or overbearing. I worked for a direct competitor previously and feel UHC has a clearer mission with superior leaders.
good,United Health was a pretty good company to work for. Very good Vision benefits. My experience with the upper management was also very good. I enjoyed working for United Health.
good,My experience has been positive with this organization as I have been able to oversee my territory effectively without being micro-managed. My director and managers have helped me develop in this role and learn many things about the healthcare industry. The workplace culture is dedicated to increasing employee satisfaction while simultaneously driving results. The hardest part of the job is the administrative work and the most enjoyable part of the job is bringing value to provider offices and helping improve patient outcomes by the work we do day in and day out.
good,I like working in the healthcare environment with constant learning experience in different fields. I love assisting customers the best ways possible with health plans or benefits to the best of my knowledge so they are fulfilled with there requests.

good,"Work from home opportunity allows to schedule own time, avoid traffic jams and become somewhat autonomous. You'll need critical thinking skills and ability to self-motivate. Direct supervisor is there to assist as much as needed and other managers pitch in and help as needed as well. Great teamwork spirit and a sense of community."
good,Nice place to work however most positions are telecommuting and the job can be very isolating at times. All meetings and learning are virtual. You need to have very good technology skills to interact with others.
good,"Inbound/outbound calls. Took notes in the system. Emailed adjusters and case managers. Had multiple systems to work through. "
good,"Good Company to work,   healthy Work life balance environment. More dependency on Onshore management. Nice working culture. Less onsite opportunities."

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I enjoyed working with many people there, the only problem was the misleading interview. I was told I would have direct contact with physicians, submit referrals, initiate prior authorizations, give test results, and refill medications. This job, in reality, was just a glorified medication refill line. We did not submit any prior authorizations or referrals, and the physicians are nearly impossible to get a hold of. We would have patients calling in trying to get refills on vital medications, and the physicians would not respond to our messages/requests until a week later. There were also no direct lines to any of the physicians, you always had to leave messages with someone."
good,"UHC had a great facility and an easy working environment.  I was able to easily balance work, life, and school.  While there I finished my Associate of Arts degree."
good,"I enjoy working for UnitedHealth Group. The opportunities to telecommute are plenty. The workplace culture is excellent. They do a great job with compensation and benefits. Management is very good for the most part, although I have seen extreme re-orgs of departments that sadly have affected many with lay-offs."

good,"I work with an awesome team that is very supportive.  However, the company itself can sometimes be frustrating.  They watch your every move via tracker programs, which can be frustrating if there is no work in your queue. The culture is very inclusive and supportive."
good,Good work culture in UHG. Work life balance is good. I learnt good Health domain knowledge in UHG. Work place is so liberal. I just want to get retired in this company but to grab better opportunity in my work career I would like to work in abroad.
good,"One of the best hourly jobs you can get without specific qualifications. Site is clean and well kept. Long list of benefits if you choose to take advantage. Job security is very very good but advancement may be a bit tricky because openings don't occur very often and you may be competing with people at different sites as well. However it does get you access to job opportunities all over the world. One thing to note is the hiring process for anything above entry level jobs can be a bit inconsistent. "
good,"The people (including those in the upper management) were helpful and supportive, which in turn made the people below them supportive of each other as well."
good,It is a productive work place. Benefits are excellent. The hardest part of job is to full fill quota every week. Management is effective and creative. Workplace culture is flexible. The most enjoyable part of this job is freedom and PTO.

good,"Overall the company strives in putting member first and ensuring that quality care is provided. "
good,Manage caseload of residents in nursing home. Round in the morning address issues. The rest of the day spent on the computer documenting. Many days work brought home. Management is supportive & try their best but we must adhere to  strict documentation guidelines when administering benefits to medicare beneficiaries.
good,"Developing the code using Spring framework, managing production related issues, interacting with clients on daily basis and co-ordinating with other team members."
good,"Management is generally great, if you avoid office drama and stick to working hard and meeting your numbers you will do just fine here. Great benefits. It is a fast paced environment but you get plenty of vacation and the management really cares about their employees mental health and well-being. Even during my most difficult time the management did everything they could to work with me to the best of their abilities.  Its easy to get along with the majority of your co-workers as long as you stay away from gossip and unnecessary drama. I would absolutely work here again."
good,Work place in very good. Management is very nice promote to people for growth. United Healthcare is good facility is given for employees majorly for female employees.

good,"A typical work day includes calling leads and setting appointments, in order to meet with the client in their home to provide information regarding Medicare. Within the meeting, I would explain how Medicare works and find a plan that is suitable to the client. I learned how to run my own business. The most enjoyable part was meeting the clients in their home. The hardest part of the business was keeping the clients list coming for each month, I would have to pay $500 for my leads."
good,"The Job itself Is not bad however I do feel the workplace is losing its culture. Good pay, good benefits, good work life balance. They do encourage growth with in the company and will assist if you are looking to move up."
good,"One can have work life balance."
good,"Good job for an entrance level job. On site, paid training. Laid back environment. Limited but still opportunities to advance within the company. Low salary but good benefits."

good,Empresa que possibilita colocar em prática os seus conhecimentos com respaldo da gerência direta.
good,"Tight alignment of corporate objectives to the IT portfolio, and clear communication in order to achieve objectives.  Deadlines are taken seriously, and many dependencies exist."
good,The work with UGH was demanding but rewarding.  I worked with a very conscience group of people who respected each other and were willing to assist each other when needed.  I worked with the Medicaid division researching individual state laws regarding Medicaid reimbursement and used this information to create comprehensive fee schedule for outpatient reimbursement for UHG members.
good,"Considering its my first call center job I didn't know what to expect, I honestly hate it... loved the people i worked with not so much what I did. if you like call centers then im sure this would be a great fit for you. other than that...……… GREAT benefits, but the company is not very considerate about much."
good,"Workplace culture and opportunity for achievement were good to excellent.  Pay structure for independent sales agents was realigned and reduced by almost 50%, which is very instrumental in my decision to leave the company."
good,I loved my job as a CSR. The pay was good. There were bonuses and incentivatives. It was a fun place to work. I did not want to leave but I did not want the new commute.
good,Apart from Shift timings everything with United Health Group is the best company. Cab will be provided in two sides. Management is good. If they change the shift time then it would the best in Hyderabad.
good,In this position you can expect to answer phone calls and assist member and providers with health insurance claims and benefits. You will handle sweet member as well as irate members. This role will require patience and self motivation.

good,United health care provided over a month and a half of training to me before starting my actual role. I was more than prepared for my position when I hit the floor.
good,A typical day at work was eventful and moved very fast paced in my opinion. The management team worked with me and made me feel at home. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that the small projects that I was doing made a big difference in the lives of my fellow employees and the customers.
good,I had a great time working for this company. The Company itself has their own standards. I am glad I got the best team to work with. i had learned many new technologies after entering this company.
good,"Benefits outweigh the boring tasks. Supervisors are trained to be understanding. Great PTO, Great 401k. Repetitive work makes it boring. Lonely working from home"
good,Answering phone calls all day. Hardest part was scheduled breaks and hard to get away for just a bathroom break. Supervisors were not helpful with anger callers. Not being allowed to get up from a desk to stretch was hard.
good,Good people and good company to work for.  They tried to stay currently on technologies.  Worked very well as a team from different areas to get projects done.
good,"Relaxed and fast paced depending on what time of year it is and can be very stressful during the enrollment period for medicare part D, not for everyone."
good,"Relaxed environment with opportunity to work at your own pace. Strict rules on completing every day work do to sensitivity of information. I learned how to become a leader through the leadership programs offered. Learned to use basic concepts of programs such as Excel, Access, and other web based clients. The culture is very much engaging but optional. Enjoyed the constant change in role and duties to accommodate the health industry and clients. Enjoyed traveling for work."
good,"In this vast moving industry having Customers as your main focus is a very vital skill and working with United Health proved to me that keeping the customer in mind is also vital and having the opportunity to increase my customer services skill within the company improved not only my professional life but also my personal life, zero regrets!!!!"

We work closely with many of the physicians participating in our plan, in supporting their efforts in maintaining the health and well being of the patients. Wellmed offers specialized programs, such as outpatient case managers to work directly with members"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Opptum Care. I had to leave due to moving out of state. I would love the opportunity to work with United Health care again. i worked with medicare claims, Doctors offices and Hospitals. On a daily basis, I worked with medicare patients with biling, Prior Auth and claims questions. I went over benefits with members, and coverage and payments with professionals."

good,The people are great and work can be challenging however the benefits offered to the employees are not what you would expect from a successful Healthcare company.
good,"Nice place to learn new things which will be help in future "
good,"The quality of your position depends solely on the type of supervisor that you have. Some supervisors are extremely uninvolved and you only hear from them when they have an issue with something you have done, and others are extremely helpful and will walk to the ends of the earth for you. Some will help you succeed and achieve higher things, and others could care less what happens to you. Work hard, get noticed by upper management and hopefully you can move up in the company."
good,"A typical day, well, there was no typical day.  They were always very different with different issues which kept me on  my toes.  Management always had the open door policy and I can attest that I did use it several times with satisfactory results.  The workplace culture was a little different from the former company, Alere Health, before it was bought by UHG/Optum.  Optum treats security of patient information very seriously; HIPAA played a major role and so did ever changing passwords.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining calendars of 5-6 VP's who each had their own responsibilities which were forever changing every day.  The most enjoyable part of my job at Optum as an Executive Assistant was the staff I worked with.  My immediate supervisors were like family.  I was included in most meetings and treated like a real person instead of just a worker bee.  My opinion counted."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"I had 2 managers while I was at UHG and they were both exemplary in terms of communication, cooperation, setting clear expectations and willingness to work with their employees in terms of job/home life balance."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for UHC in the CHOICES program.   As a Care Coordinator I had a flexible schedule that allowed me to never miss a family event.  The work load was always very heavy and it felt like work never ended or was never completed for the day/week etc.  You could work ahead to allow for vacation time if needed, as long as things were tied up for the person covering for you.  Went into a lot of poor environments so if this bothers you it"
good,Properly directed inbound calls in phone queues to improve call flow.
good,UHG is very focused on constant growth. This is evident every day. They also are very concerned about results. I was given a lot of autonomy in my position which I enjoy.
good,"I don't have a personal opinion regarding the leadership style of those who were there. Just it was a clienteles cartel, for simple reason they were not fulfilling what is expected of them"

good,"Management doe not micro manage they are very helpful"
good,"challenging roles"

good,I worked on a special government employee insurance accounts. When legislation changes-which it does often and dramatically-be ready and willing to change with it. This goes for all medical insurance companies.
good,Pleasant work environment that makes each day enjoyable.. Leadership has an open door policy and encourage employees to suggest ideas to steam line everyday policies.
good,"Just be in right place at right time under right management. Parties, individual development plans are all in place. Very good learning curve and interesting things come up."
good,"I would go back to the company, it wa nice to work with them they should really pay more. I learn alot from being there the management was great and very friendly"
good,Overall a good experience. I am happy with it. They were nice. Lots of opportunities to advance and a really good cafeteria. My manager was good and I enjoyed streamlining processes and going forward with team meeting where we could touch base offline.
good,I believed everyone work together for one cause and that was for patient care. They care for each other and to make sure that everything is completed for there patients

good,"The United Culture is what really stands out. The United Culture push is definitely an asset to bridge communication and improve relationships. The work life balance is fair. There is high job performance expectations , but in return you get a multitude of benefits for work well done. There is constant advancement opportunities and growth potential."
good,"I love working at UHG, there are so many great opportunities here. There are always new and challenging positions open and the benefits and job security are good."
good,Overall I enjoyed my coworkers and management at this job. The pay was quite low for what was expected in work and compared to how profitable the company was. I liked the environment and the work itself was fairly simple (although occasionally difficult). Many opportunities for advancement for those that could grasp the concepts of health insurance.
good,Optum United Healthcare days always went smooth. There was always continuing education available. Management was a little slow to respond to an employees needs. There was no I in TEAM with the company.
good,United Health group is a great place to work. They have great benefits and seem to really care about their workers. They have flexibility with the hours if you are a good worker.
good,Call center environment no weekends monday thru friday schedule. Taking inbound calls from members about their health benefits. Pretty simple once you learn all the systems to use.
good,"fun place/ Table was installed a few weeks before we had to relocate to a different location."
good,My work day started with logging into the system. From there I would quickly and accurately process health insurance claims that had been submitted by doctors and patients. This was a job that was mostly done in front of a computer with very little interaction with anyone one on your team.
good,Great company with excellent people. I really enjoyed my time at UHG and learned a lot that I still use to this day. Being such as huge company there is always plenty of work to do!
good,"assisting people with their claims issues or patient verification can sometimes become monotonous. remember to be kind and understanding. Knowing that helping to get people the care they need and their caregivers the reimbursement they deserve is very rewarding. Learn all you can because that is the toughest part of the job, especially if you are unfamiliar with health insurance"
good,"UHC is a good company to work for I with career advancements, My role in workforce was to manage a team that was responsible to roll out the new IEX, Nice workforce tools in 2016-2017.   Review information in a daily capacity prespective in order to help operations with capacity planning."

good,Going to work was always a pleasure. The day always went fast because you were so busy. I worked in member services for 2 1/2 years and 2 1/2 processing claims. The management very open and always had an open door policy.

good,"The company is a well sustainable and service excellent in providing benefits to the clients. However, in our department, salary is an issue and other benefits like quarterly incentives are not really satisfying employees because it is somewhat inappropriate not to give the entitlement of such bonus."

good,"Professional work environment. Strong corporate culture. Many resources and educational opportunities. Strong leadership. Overall, good work/life balance and focused on healthcare. Work days can be long, but you are able to take time for doctor appointments, etc."
good,"I was overall pleased with UHG when the therapeutic day school I worked at was acquired in a deal to gain access to the hospital and residential facilities associated with the former parent company. I was paid well with decent benefits, treated fairly, and the company culture was another plus. The only issue was that the management did not know how to run a school, or appreciate the differences between a school and a hospital, and as a result, the program had to be closed down."
good,"It is a typical 10 hour day for supervisors up."
good,"Professional work place and really fun to work and learn at the same time. Resourceful , Knowledgeable and friendly management. I should say working is fun."

good,"This is a great place to work but not thru a temp service.  After spending 4 weeks in training then only got to work on the floor for about another 4 weeks.  This was a new department they had started and didnt have enough work for all the people they hired,  So while in training I got 40 hours but one on the floor then the hours started dropping from 40 to 30 then was told my job had ended due to lack of accounts."
good,"I worked from home after about 6 months of working in the office. I was promoted within a year of hire. The pay was good and there was always overtime. However there were many changes, almost weekly. You were expected to be flexible and team work was encouraged, however there was minimal flexibility with employees. They also have a tracking app on your computer that reveals which websites you were on, how long were you idle for, how long you took breaks for, and who you are on the phone with. They used this data and compared it to your fellow peers. The supervisors were overworked and seemed to have meetings all day so if you needed help you most likely had to reach out to your peers. In some departments there was much negativity. However my department was very relaxing, you got positive as well as negative feedback. The insurance is also really bad. If you are a healthy person i is great because all preventative care is paid for at 100%, but if you had to see specialist or have a lot of sick visits you would have to meet your yearly deductible before they paid anything."
good,"Was not a bad place to work. The dress code was casual dress, jeans were allowed daily. manager to employee ratio was about 1-6. headphones were allowed for music, set your own break schedule."
good,"Good place with career opportunities and good work life balance."
good,"The UHC assingment was through Dial America...UHC was a client."

good,"Chances de crescimento profissional, bom salario e beneficios."
good,"UnitedHealth Group was a supportive atmosphere, where employees were encouraged to grow their skills. It was not particularly high-stress, except when outside factors played a part or deadlines were missed by a significant length of time. Unfortunately, due to its size and the nature of its structure, being comprised of many acquired companies, there were often great variations between work culture between locations and departments. Some would be relaxed and informal, where the site Director would eat dinner with employees, and some, especially out East, would be more formal and competitive, with somewhat adversarial relationships between hourly employees and management. Good to great benefits, especially employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) match. Great dental plan, good health plan. Generous amount of PTO."
good,"good experience working with optum ,good values , having fun on sakath monday and bombat wednesdays , good at understanding employs views and ideas. i like to work in optum."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"It was a great culture and environment. The hardest part of my job was jumping from meeting to meeting and insuring my staff had full access to me.  Overall, it was a good experience and always changes for advancement.."
good,"My job was a telecommute position. Although co-workers lived in various states, we still had good communication. Everyone on the team was helpful to one another and had each others back."
good,"I really like my manager, very nice and supportive. I would recommend this employer to anyone out there who is looking for a good work environment. if you can't work night shift, this will not be an ideal job for you because you might ended up working 2nd shift when it comes to shift bid."
good,"In my role I was client facing for many different service lines of healthcare. I worked with Practice Managers identifying opportunities for improvement within their clinic. I put together a plan of action, ways to track the improvements and provided follow-up feedback. I also did a lot of data analysis and root cause analysis when looking at problem solving."
good,Solid company. Big on establishing a culture of performance with compassion. Focus is on the people we serve - and it is sincere. Decisions are made quickly and are generally understood. only complaint is rather low salary and since people tend to stay with the company for a long time there is a logjam of talent making advancement hard.
good,Enjoyed working with physicians and staff. Everyday learned something new. Lots of room to advance. I worked Evenings. Have a awesome Education program for new employees.
good,"Good corporate positions. Many opportunities to advance, both lateral and forward. Good benefit, many locations, a lot of work from home positions also."

good,Great place to work. Training is extremely long but not long enough for all the information that you have to learn. Claims calls are the most difficult part of the job.
good,Working for UHG has allowed me to have a better work/house balance. I no longer miss important events in my kids life. Being the that work environment is relaxed it has allowed me to go back to school to pursue another degree.

good,I really enjoy working for the company.  Great people and benefits.  They really appreciate their employees.  Would definitely recommend the company as a great place to work.
good,"Recently United Healthcare has been focusing more on work/life balance for their employees. Amenities added include a game room, decompression room, exercise room, etc. However, with a 30 minute lunch you cannot enjoy those amenities much. This job is stressful day in and day out. The pay is good and the management is good. It takes the right person to hang in there and stick with it. There isn't much room to climb the ladder farther than supervisor unless you are willing to move laterally to other departments and see what they have to offer. All in all its a great place to work considering the pay and benefits. I will point out it is a stressful place to work long term when you're on the phone taking the brunt of callers problems."
good,This is a great company to work for. The pay is competitive. There are many activities to promote employee engagement. Most supervisors are very approachable.
good,"Aprendi muito na empresa, visto quase 21 anos de carreira construída lá."
good,"A typical day at work is busy. Our calls are back to back. I've learned how deductibles actually work, several programs for health and wellness and etc. The management here is fair. The hardest part of the job is when you have done all you can for a member and their issue may  not get resolved at that current moment and they get upset. The most enjoyable part of the job is being there for our members and doing our best to assist and make them happy."
good,"It's very difficult to put in words about the quality of work culture at UHC. The company stands for the position it holds among Fortune Competitors. It's a school of learning and performing."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Lots of opportunities for advancement due to the companies persistence in being the best in the world at helping people live healthier lives, and constantly looking for opportunities run the business efficiently."
good,"Very fast paced inbound call center, I had to deal with people whose claims were  paid or received, to see if a claim was approved for special dme equipment. Mail out claim form"
good,"Great position but this department shift bids which makes life difficult for adults, and adults with children. A lot of room for advancement and work at home is a plus."
good,Empresa onde cresci pessoal e profissionalmente. Preza muito pelo treinamento e desenvolvimento dos colaboradores e possui uma cultura institucional contagiante.
good,"Great atmosphere, great moral but no benefits, Coaches are great when it comes to supporting employees however are not knowledgeable in all areas of the everyday operations of the service being provided. Training should be done in a more extensive manner to where its understandable to the trainee prior to coming to production floor."
good,"This company understands work/life balance. My managers have been great in addressing the needs of our team and reminding us of our objectives. The hardest part of my job is being stuck in traffic during my route to and from visiting members. The most enjoyable is knowing the data I collect from each visit helps improve the healthcare system, programs and ultimately the lives of our members."
good,"Met with project team, formally and informally to ensure project was on schedule.  Created status reports to keep the stakeholders informed of progress."

good,United healthcare was a great please to work. The people are very helpful and friendly. It was a very fast pace job and kept the day going. Never a dull moment. United Healthcare also would let their best workers work from home. Very nice if you have a long distance to travel each day. Plenty of room for advancement if you wanted to try working in a different department.
good,"- Exposure to all facets of the enterprise"
good,"It was nice working with UHG a very friendly atmosphere and supporting head's."

good,"Employment with United Healthcare Group for 7 years; which included Appeals & Grievance in Cypress, OPTUMRx Costa Mesa and Bilingual Customer Services Representative.  Company offered excellent benefits and good pay.  My last position with company as Customer Service Rep. the new system applications updates were extremely problematic.  To many issues that had to be resolved before it would run smoothly.  Which made for a highly stressful work place and unfortunately I did resigned Feb. 3, 2017"
good,"A typical day in the call center is very stressful due to call volume or there may periods of open enrollment where we have to take more than 100 calls a day, but its all about helping the members"

good,"Hospital de ponta, bem equipada, funcionários capacitados, ótimo local de trabalho. Bom Gerenciamento, meu trabalho era bem simples, porem exigia bastante atenção, pois assim como meu superior, eu exigia o máximo de minha competência, assim exercendo um bom atendimento tanto interno quanto externo, tinha bons colegas de trabalho e isso me agradava muito, contudo também tinha os maus colegas, isso me desagradava um pouco."
good,it was good working with this company . management was supportive. pay role was good.. capable to iomprove our skills . nice company
good,The culture is great even for a large company. Great work / life balance. Management is very nice and understanding.  Ability to move in lateral positions if desired.
good,"Love my job there.  Management is very supportive.  Co-workers are great.  Supervision does not micro-management. You are given the opportunity to telecommute if you desire. Advancement is excellent.  The only con I have, no overtime and the shifts run from 7am-8pm. Which is practically day shift.  I prefer late 2nd shift or 3rd shift plus overtime availability.  It is a call center environment.  But if you are consistent in making hitting your required metrics, doors will open for you. Also upper management sends out surveys to allow you to grade how they are doing, what they could be doing better, how to help you make UHC a better place to work.  In my short time here, they have made changes for the better.  Always striving to be better."
good,"I am a customer service advocate I take Medicaid calls for multiple states. I assist members with benefit inquiries, and help update information on members account such as address, COB just to name a few. I learn something new everyday about each type of plan if I have a question I ask my peers and my supervisor is always able to help as well. I get along very well with my fellow co-workers and that makes the work place that much better. I like my job I don't have any complaints, I wouldn't say it's hard but you have to know where to find the right information, giving incorrect information to a member can harm your job but it is not hard to find, and there is always help when needed if you cant find something."
good,"UHC was a good place to work.Teamwork was very effective. Depending on the manager,  you felt either very supported or less so."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,Please see prior review of my position at United Healthcare Group. I believe that entry should provide an adequate response.

good,"It is a good company to start a career  with. It pays good, and facilitate to Work from home. You can maintain a work life balance here. But the career growth is slow."
good,"UHC puts a lot into educating their employees and have extensive training. Once you on the floor a typical day as a resolution Specialist is spent helping  providers with benefit information, pre certification or claims. The calls can be lengthy at times depending on what the issue is but most providers are pleasant and understand. The best part of working at UHC is have a sense of helping members to live a better lives and knowing your knowledge of the material can be a deal breaker on treatment so its imperative that you get it right the first time. Training is the hardest part of the job if you can make it past that, you in the door."

In an enterprise this size, culture will vary from department to department."

good,"Worked in a team of three people, was assigned daily processes that consisted of Medical, Rx Drugs, and Rx Drugs. Payments were 90% ACH and the rest were on site check printing. I enjoyed the ACH processing the most because it was different from the standard way of processing checks. Like most Accounting jobs, there was a time limit in terms of running the processes and sticking to our forecasting schedule."

good,"UnitedHealthcare cares about their employees and works with them to make sure there is a work/life balance. It is never the expectation to burn the midnight oil, and the company is also very conscience of its involvement in the community. Volunteer events are constantly being announced and managers encourage involvement."
good,Great place to work. Flexible hours and great co workers. Management is fantastic and very keyed into employee needs and work life balance. Great benefits and solid progression.

It is a family and they are very compassionate when it comes to unforeseen things that may happen in one's personal life.
good,I learn something almost everyday by just asking and listening but the hardest part is to ask someone that doesn't enjoy their workplace and the favoritism.
good,"Good working environment.                              "
good,It’s best to know how to use computers and type at least at 40 wpm. It will allow you to get multiple tasks done in an quick and efficient manner. Having those skills will help get the work done and your supervisor happy.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,I loved working at United Health Group the atmosphere was a great place to work and has a lot of benefits for workers but the work is stressful they promoted me to a position that I don’t believe I was ready for and the act of sitting at a desk all day and working on a computer just isn’t something that I think is good for my physical health
good,The company does a great job of providing work life balance and provides an opportunity to grow within the organization. There has been a variety of opportunities to learn and work with other areas of the organization as well.
good,"You have to want to do this kind of with but it is rewarding and this company gives an above average work environment."
good,High call volume ever changing rules and processes making it difficult to keep a rhythm and high stress at least for me. Management is excellent. Pay was decent but not enough to survive the cost of living in San Diego. I relocated to Nevada and resigned before I did so on a regular work day because my nerves was so bad when I sat at my desk that I took one call hung up signed out my programs and walked up to management to survive
good,"There is definitely room for growth, but be prepared for a tedious hiring process. Once you're in you are in. There is room for advancement which I loved! The pay is competitive and Ioved taking advantage of the stock programs."
good,United HealthGroup was a great company to learn from early on and helped develop much needed skills to later implement in my work for other complained moving forward.

good,It was great to work for a company that is actually a leader in the healthcare industry.  The benefits are wonderful.  UHC was always supportive in bringing new ideas to the table.  And there was a very good sense of working with professional and knowledgeable staff whose main concern was for the patient.

good,"Line of business: Medicare "
good,"Best part of the job was the friends I made on my team.  As a nurse, it was very nice to get out of the rat race of clinic/hospital nursing and have better work/life balance.  I almost NEVER took this job home with me - rarely gave it a second thought after I left.  I could flex my time around my kids/family needs, never worked a holiday, and only worked weekends by choice.  The hardest part of the job is going from people seeking your care to persuading people to accept your help."
good,"It was a very good place to work and the pay is competitive and benefits are good for individuals & family , my co- workers were great and the ability to learn about the healthcare industry and the medical terminology that is used and the ability to be able to help customers with various problem solving"

good,"Excelente, horarios flexibles, buen ambiente de trabajo. Buen salario."
good,"learned about Cliams , medical codes, data verification, team management, corporate world behaviors setting goals for career, every moment in the office is friendly and learning at every stage."
good,"This is a GIGANTIC company and YMMV depending on your group. Keep that in mind when reading. Anyway, I've been here only less than 2 years months, but I think I have enough of a feel for Optum to write a review. The positives: Great work/life balance: I never have to stay late, work on weekends, etc. I get 23 vacation days and my manager encourages me to use them AND completely unplug while away. Beautiful office: Building is modern and comfortable."

good,It is a fun fast paced environment. I enjoyed my time there. The job itself was customer service which depends on the customer. Supervisors and upper management are awesome!

good,"Foi uma ótima empresa, havia estabilidade e muito ensino, atualizações em todo o tempo quando mudavam o sistema, cursos de aprendizagem para os funcionários, ótimos benefícios, fiz muitas amigas e gostava de trabalhar na empresa."
good,Workplace culture and work/life balance are wonderful.  Could be challenging for promotional opportunities if hired from outside the industry.  Takes time to build experience and is good for someone that is entering into the industry fresh out of school or perhaps with experience.  Wasn't a good fit for me personally  or what I expected my role to be.
good,"The company is good at keeping their agents happy. They have a lot of programs for fun, team buildings and you can communicate with other workers from US"

good,"It was a family oriented atmosphere, pleasant people to work with. The training team was unorganized but we managed to learn the products and services through the time we spent the rest. It could of been a little bit better if they had time. The site was a new upcoming pilot center so things was a little slow but picked up later."

good,Great work environment. Management was excellent. Able to have a work/personal life balance. Able to be promoted within one year of employment. Great opportunities
good,There was a constant flow of customers to handle. The customers were at times challenging due to insecurity about medications etc... Most of the time is processing refills.

good,"I enjoyed my working experience at Optum. My management team took time to mentor as it was available, and encouraged a career path of advancement and knowledge expansion. I would have continued at the company but was part of a personnel reduction that was financial in nature.

The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"great company good benefits good pay"
good,"Aprendi muito na empresa e fiz boas amizades, haviam pessoas muito boas profissionalmente. A gerência estava em fase de adaptação pois a empresa mudou em um ritmo muito acelerado e não acompanhou a mudança...e a parte mais difícil era a falta de informação por conta dessas mudanças que ocorreram.

Como por exemplo toda rotina hospitalar ao paciente acamado (banho no leito, administração de medicamentos, aferição de sinais vitais, aspiração de vias aéreas...) Trabalhei com uma ótima equipe que era muito unida e prestativa. A parte mas difícil foi logo quando iniciei pois não tinha vivência em rotina hospitalar, mas com o tempo e com ajuda da equipe fui conquistando confiança. A parte mais agradável do trabalho era ver a reabilitação do paciente e o carinho do mesmo e de toda a família conosco."

good,"Plenty of room for growth.  I worked from home for the last two years so I didn't really have too much interaction with my co workers.  The first year I was there and did interact with them, they were great.  Management in the call center was nice.  Once I went to appeals I noticed the differences right away.  Their management styles were very different.  Appeals was not as organized as the call center.  I was still able to learn a lot, but from my peers."

good,As a Interim coach; helped with trainers to produce high volume of Customer Care Providers.
good,Great company over all to work for but there micromanaging down to the last second was very intense but manageable. It made things a little stressful but it was not uncomfortable. My coworkers were above and beyond amazing. I can't put to words how pleasant it was to work with these people. My supervisors were always very good about communicating with me ideas and information if I needed to ask a question. One of my favorite jobs of all time.
good,"A Amil é uma Empresa que reconhece o potencial de seus funcionários, promove processos seletivos oferecendo possibilidade de crescimento e treinamentos diversos.

good,The managers work hard to make everyone feel like a part of the family. Although it's not all work. The expectation is that you do work hard and learn more skills so you can move up. Your work is greatly appreciated & compensated not just annually.  If you're only looking for a pay check this may not be for you.

good,"I loved the company, there were great benefits and so many opportunities that could really make a difference. The company offered so many different benefits and health options as well. It sucks that such a great company was overshadowed by the management that was not very good nor consistent. Because of the favoritism there was little to no recognition and that was really discouraging"
good,The only reason I would consider leaving UHC is because I'm in Sales and we have to bid our schedules every four months. This can be a good or bad thing. I'm a mother of two small children and I have to have a consistent schedule for them. This is just for Sales as far as I know. Other Departments like Customer Service have fixed schedules Mon-Fri morning shifts.
good,"I worked in the field as a Care Coordinator. I learned to work with translation services so that I was able to communicate member assessments accurately. Management was great.

good,I had no formal degree in computer science but the hiring manager was willing to give me a chance anyway and I learned a lot there. Great first job out of college.

I start my day off by checking emails and reviewing new case/prior authorization assignments. After that I start making my calls.

Most of the management is super friendly and they honestly seem to care about the employees and they honestly care about their members.  Obviously we can't give the member's everything that their hearts desire, although I'm sure that would be wonderful, but they are fair in their determinations and decisions.

good,worked as temp but the pay as a temp was great and if I could have gotten on perm the pay was awesome. My manager was the best as long as you came to work and done your job he didn't bother you. The staff was fun and full of life definitely a company with my approval
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

good,I learned that constantly things change and learning to adapt and remain optimistic is important. Management are not all the same. I loved the culture and the meaning of coming together to uplift and encourage. The hardest part of the job was dealing with employees that were not mature for the environment. However I thoroughly enjoyed calling or receiving calls with the Provider or his or her staff and making their day by making corrections or updates for their business to run smoothly.
good,You need to be very patient but it is not a bad job! There is plenty of opportunity for over time and growing within the company. High season can be stressful but not impossible.
good,Desired job departure was unplanned I would've love to stay. The people was friendly the commute was suitable and last but not least the benefits were compelling.
good,"My typical day at my job is I log into my computer, I answer the phones mainly talking to pharmacies all day. They call in needing prior authorizations for medications. I also get phone calls from patients that are on workers comp that are checking status on where their medications are due to they are on mail order. If medications are not approved, we usually refer them to their claims adjuster."

good,United Health Group is a good place to work. They have very good training to make sure you feel comfortable with your position. The position entails a lot of talking on the phone. Answering questions for providers about benefits and claims for their patients. You have to make sure you adhere to your adherence. Overall a good company.
good,"Spoke with at least 65+ people daily answering calls from provider offices from over 6 states and plans with United Health Care. Starting a case for Outpatient Procedures according to plan I would be able to approve some but, know when I needed to send to a nurse for further review. You got to know all the plans and states but if unsure you had a spot to look on computer to be sure of yourself or speak with a Lead. Everyone is friendly and we would have days that we would bring food so we can have a little party. Of coarse being on phone you might have a provider that is not pleased with the process. You just needed to help them and hopefully make provider comfortable on the phone. Then you were pleased with how the calls are handled."
good,"A empresa tem o seu diferencial, tem humanidade, ótimos profissionais. A gerencia com um ótimo equilíbrio. O trabalho agradável, com musica de fundo, sala de descanso, lanches."
good,"During a good part of the year there is little inbound call volume and work is slow. This is a boring time, reading is one way to keep the mind going.  Measuring up to metrics is looked at closely. During the slow times there are outbound campaigns which has proven very tough for many because enrollments are more difficult."

No stress of working in an office for 8 to 10 hours a day.  No schedule breaks or punching time clocks.  The working conditions were great because it was more like a contract job.  Only time to contact supervisor was when there was a problem with the facility your worked in or a at home patient.  The working conditions provide less stress than being closed up in an office all day.  The traveling on the job gave employees much more freedom.

good,Would be a delightful workplace if someone would get rid of all of the leadership and start over.  Their blatant disregard for employees is astounding.  It is a system where friends hire friends and inappropriate relationships are tolerated.  Leadership does not appreciate the efforts of their subordinates.  Great benefits and co-workers.  Poor leadership team!!!!!!!

good,"I work from home through United HealthCare Group and although i'm only authorized a specific amount of paid hours to work, I'm sure we can all agree that the care of another is a full time round the clock job.Taking care of another is no easy task especially when said client is a family member. On 3 days out of the week my day starts at 4am; Waking my client to get dressed and ready for dialysis ensuring he has a blanket and other necessities packed for his appointment. A typical day at work for me is pretty much wifely duties. Cleaning, cooking, laundry, and ensuring a clean and safe environment for my client. Since becoming a caregiver I've learned a lot. The responsibilities of caring for another with physical and health challenges, lots of patience, time management, planning, multi-tasking, etc. Since I work from home my work environment (although hectic and loud at times) is pretty relaxed for the most part. What I enjoy most about my job is that at the end of the day I can smile at the fact that I'm able to care for my dad, the kids and everyone else as well as maintain my house and get things done that need to be done and still get paid to do so."

good,"While I haven't worked in multiple areas of UHC or UHG, the one department I have been in is a very tough area to work.  The work is demanding and emotionally/mentally taxing.  The compensation isn't as competitive as other health insurance companies and their benefits do not compare to other companies either.  Certain levels of management are better than others, and while I am not completely satisfied with my level of improvement available to me in my department, I do know from others that the chances are available elsewhere within the company.  The ability to transfer within the company is not very easy and takes serious consideration and is time consuming.  The glass ceiling is present for all in each area, but it is not impenetrable.  The people you work with quickly become experts in their field and are quite knowledgeable of their skills and their requirements.  The work load isn't always balanced, but it can be adjusted if you know how to work.  It is definitely corporate America type of business.  You are not judged on your performance in so much as who you know and how quickly you can network."

good,"Works on US health care insurance claims for claim adjudication process."

good,"Everyone has been made for some particular work, and the desire for that work has been put in every heart. "

good,"It's a great place to work and they work with your schedule. Differential pay for a after hours, as well as quarterly bonuses."
good,Loved this job i worked from home and only had to go the office maybe every 3 months other than that we had conference calls. Other than that the Manager would let me know what she needed finished for that week and would get that done for her even if it meant working for 10 to 12 hours a day.
good,"People were great but some managers did not know what they were doing and blamed their employees for their failures."
good,Good time I had working for UHC through Teletech. I’d work there again. Supervisors were friendly and there to help you understand the product better at any given moment.
good,Middle management is horrible as are benefits. Advancement is easy and plentiful. Great people around you outside bloated middle management structure.
good,"Pouco organizada, profissionais as vezes sem conhecimento e sem treinamento."
good,Overall it is a great company to work for. Depending on the department you work for is whether or not there is a work/life balance. I would say anything in the customer service field on the phones is not a good work life balance for parents at least.
good,I don't want to give a review on my company. I originally worked for quest diagnostics and they purchased our department. It would not be fir of me to rate uhg as I do not have much experience with them.
good,Make Outbound calls to members who are in a health-related program to see how they are doing and give them an opportunity to explain their concerns and needs.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"I loved the people, but the job was not for me. Training is adequate, but i feel you need more online time in the training phase. Supervisors need to know how to do the job, not just manage the staff."
good,Empresas que reconhece seus funcionários e incentivando com promoções.
good,"See overall rating great life work balance."
good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar, preocupação com funcionários e clientes, bons benefícios ."
good,"Many benefits of working at this employer, 401k match, fitness room, cafeteria, Giving match. hardest part of job being on the phone and no time to get up and stretch"
good,New organization changes are causing lots of layoffs. The company itself is growing and is going the Agile way. New management is lacking direction and need to manage the teams better.
good,United Healthcare is a great company to work for.  There a a lot of opportunities to advance.  They offer decent benefits and incentive programs.  I love working here and really would like to stay.  My advice to future candidates is make sure you and your manager are aware of your value as an employee.  It is very easy to get lost in United Healthcare because it is a large company with very talented employees.
good,management needs more training and the culture of the business needs the be altered around the employees. This company went is very hetic and unstructured. I would no longer consider it for job stability
good,"Great work environment, great co workers to work with and the best organization to grow personally and professionally"
good,I love working for them and love how we do a great job at keeping our patients out of the hospital. Great doctors to work with and reasonable pay.
good,"Training SUPERB  Salary more than competitive Truly temp position"
good,"A typical day at work was handling all incoming patient related concerns on a daily basis. I learned how to handle every situation I had to deal with, from screaming members to members who were always very polite. The management I worked for was excellent and supportive. Unfortunately, the department I worked for the co-workers only cared about themselves and were not team players. In an office environment, working as a team is essential in keeping the work flowing smoothly. The hardest part of this job was the members who were always calling with complaints and sometimes would stay upset because we couldn't do anything to change their situation. The most enjoyable part of this job was my management, as she was a great manager. This company was also in transition to becoming United Healthcare when I was working there."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy when I'm able to resolve and issue for them so they can continue working.
good,While working in UHG i found that u must have a jack to grow or you can say that your work does not make u prove yourself but u must have a godfather to get yourself proven

good,Good place to work and competitive working environment. Challenging roles available and good at every level. Employee engagement & their commitment is their priority.
good,Great work environment with a great team. Downside was that as a PRN employee things were always changing and hard to keep up with and over working there 6 years PRN I never received one raise. Working from home was an awesome benefit though. Good company that strives to do well. Just needs to take better care of their PRN employees.
good,"Depending on the team or job area, it could be very rewarding or very frustrating. It is preferred for people with small kids or that are close to retirement as the 8hr days make it less stressful. You can attend children's events, it is not a physically demanding job, so it makes it ok for older nurses."
good,Great company. Communication up and down the ladder is poor at best. Good friendly culture with lots of community involvment. Professional development is provided but little to no guidance to use the system Learnsource is the platform.
good,Great place to work for. Great company . Nice benefits. Beautiful environment I enjoy working for uhc. One of the largest health care  in the united states
good,Working for this company started my growth. I  love this company but it showed me no stability. I  wish I was able to find balance and security. They trained me not o ly in my career but also in life. My health plans are chosen properly thanks to them. I even still help others when I can.
good,Alcançou níveis ótimos de desempenho e performance. Mostra um interesse verdadeiro nos colaboradores e em encontrar soluções para seus problemas.Fornece treinamento contínuo a sua equipe e parceiros. Incentiva a colaboração com a equipe.

good,UHC is a great company to work for. I worked there for almost 10yrs. I have great benefits and really enjoyed what I did. The only bad thing about the company is its all about the numbers and not the employees

good,"Empresa ótima, clima agradável e bons benefícios. "
good,"Look to serve members to the best of my ability."
good,"I enjoyed my time at UHG's Optum overall. I was payed decently and most of the staff was nice and helpful. Time went by quick as long as I kept busy. You have a metric to fulfill each day (i.e provider queries- Where you fill in doctor and patient information that is filled out at a doctor's request).  However, it was only a temporary position. Optum's projects last roughly 3 months depending on the volume of clients and speed of employees in processing the requests doctors make through Optum. There are four ""stages"" that you may be assigned to, each with a task of correcting and/or processing provider queries. "
good,This is a great company to work for just wish the pay could be better. They are very flexible and care about your career advancement. The best part of this job is the flexibility.

good,"It is difficult to get hired  permanently unless know someone or related to someone in management. Manager was very fair and firm.  Provided training, but was rushed  and limited or no support after training."
good,"uma grande empresa onde aprendi muito , uma ótima gestão muita competente e agradavel"
good,"I love my job at UHC. Helping the members is very rewarding. As far as the company goes that hires you to work for UHC the benefits are horrible but then again what can you expect for health insurance. the workplace culture is great however Administration office,l which is located offsite, can be horrible. They have no idea nor concept of the word compassion. When you request a day off month in advance and are approved they will mark you a no show and you have to fight them to get it removed. You will request a day off and suddenly it will be denied the night before your appointment. Our motto is to show compassion and concern for the member and to always remember to walk in their shoes because you do not know what they have been through. Administration does not know the meaning of those words."
good,A great place to work at
good,"Production environment which means some stress to ensure you are doing your job exactly as the guidelines and requirements demand. The perks can be plentiful if you keep those number up and running consistently.  It is a good company that tries to keep it's employees happy and involved.  Such as, volunteering at local food banks, and helping with Christmas donations, etc."
good,I take pride in being a UHG employee. The company in itself is good. We do under go a lot of Change that is understandable. Other than that it's a great place to be.
good,"A Amil foi um grande desafio na minha carreira, me desenvolveu para o mundo corporativo."
good,Awesome job! Great members! I loved talking to them amd getting to know them and I felt honored when they called in again and wanted for me to assist them rather than other advocate.
good,"Fui criada nessa empresa e admiro a humanização. Os pacientes são tratados da melhor forma possível, existe um cuidado muito grande com as condutas e é sempre feito o melhor."
good,"The typical day at work for me did not start as an Senior Administrative Assistant as I starting out cleaning out cabinets, loading boxes and putting together brochures helping sales coordinator in which I was not interested in as I have already done that type of work as a Marketing Coordinator many years ago and that is all I have to say about this position."
good,"Indico para amigos e familiares. Uma das melhores empresas que ja trabalhei, onde aprendi muito, e sai com uma grande bagagem de conhecimento."
good,"Not family friendly, Mand overtime at a moments notice.  Did not see my children's programs at school for a few years while there. Blocks of time that can not be taken off."
good,great company  but compensation is low. there is not much advancement opportunities.  I worked from home so this was an extra perk for me.  Most of my managers were great.
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my teams as they progress on various advertising campaigns. I check in and help them with any issues they may be having such as doing mock-ups or securing rights to songs. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied with the promotional materials."
good,"Empresa muito boa, com um nome renomado, mais o salario na época não era muito atrativo."
good,"Received incoming calls from providers and members inquiring about their insurance claims or benefits viewed members claim information that was sent electronically, mailed or faxed."
good,"I have been loving the environment and learning Opportunity here. People get plenty projects to up skill with proper domain knowledge."
good,"This is not a good place to work if you do not like change. It changes so often its hard to keep up with what's going on.. Management here in Denver CO is all over the place and seem to want to be friends more then actually a manager. The pay is well under the average and the benefits( if you get them) are not as good as you would think coming from the actual insurance company that we work for. With all that being said, if you love to help people and make members happy, this is a nice start."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"Empresa jovem, porém sólida. Profissionais comprometidos e voltados para o bem-estar da clientela atendida. Lido com sistemas de informática integrados que facilitam o meu trabalho. "
good,Being in Independent Broker allows you the flexibility to work your own hours.  UHC training is topnotch.  Hardest part of job?  Working without a salary.  Its a commission based only position.  Most enjoyable part?  Flexibility and freedom to work your own hours.
good,"Love to work here"
good,"During my current project, I've met with many employees from many different backgrounds. Everyone I met was great to work with and passionate about the work they do."
good,"Love working here, can work from home. I didnt like that the computer would crash and no room at office to go work there while  waiting to receiving new computer and they took my PTO to cover the days I was down.  Insurance Health Benefits, deductible too high to meet."
good,"There is not a work life balance that belongs to United. However their recruiters help to remind you that for some people coming from a retail or hospice environment,  UHG pays double. The benefits were great the first year and then the required HSA bundled high deductible plans were being pushed. I felt management was held to a different standard. Their mandatory meetings in mid-day left much to the imagination. So much needs to be examined at sporadic intervals to know what actually is the UHG culture."
good,"I am dande swetha,i have completed MBA fiance, presently working in united health group."

good,I have been employed with UHC for over 9 years . Its a good company to work for . I like that I am able to work from home . Although at times upper  management misses the mark not understand what it is we do on daily basis and thinks its easy to do the company in whole is not bad. Benefits could be a lot better . We work for the company and have pretty much the bottom of the barrel benifits . one would think we would have the best we do not .

good,Great place to work with excellent benefits.  Learned much about project management that has attributed to my successes in employment.
good,"Good job, raises are not great, insurance is fair but not great."
good,The company was a great learning experience for me while attending college. I was able to develop my customer service and communication skills while remaining focused on my studies. A typical work day consisted of posting students' tuition payments to our Peoplesoft system and answering phone calls related to students' accounts. I also assisted with our collections department by creating spreadsheets and contacting students with overdue accounts.
good,Management stands beside employees and assist in helping employees become their best.

good,aprendi a desenvolver melhor a linguagem
good,"I worked UHG for less than a year. Work life balance is good, salary is good but it will take some time for them to mature in the field of data science"
good,Training environment and work environment were great. Management is very un-willing to help or support employees. If you do not have a year in then there is no security at all. Supervisors and managers will not fight for your benefits or BONUSES  earned.
good,"Tele-communicator assisting a case load of about 300 disable, retirees and terminal members, coordinating all the possible medical and community services are possible, enjoy communicating with different groups of people, entities, medical and other services according with their needs. Learn every days, from members, services, policy changes, vendors and the wonderful humans the come across.  The sad part of the job is the limits for some of the members and the graters needs that some times their clock of life go faster, before can be achieve. the most enjoyable is to be able to help the people in need and help to cross the obstacles.  I love to help other to get that one more option to make the difference in the daily life."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHG it was a good job there was room for growth. Excellent Benefit. Very nice coworkers,Referral Bonuses, they offer discounts on cell phone services"
good,Good company to represent. They gave great coverage for their clients and I was very proud to represent a company with high quality care. The hours were very long but some of the agents worked a lot fewer hours than I did. It was based on salary plus commission so it really was up to the individual as to how many or few hours they dedicated to the job. No set schedule other than the weekly meeting on Monday that was mandatory. Untied Healthcare treated their employees with respect and went out of their way to make a good work environment for all the agents on their staff.
good,"needs more room for advancement, I was there for 6 yrs and the growth in pay was very slow . changes are made daily and it's hard to keep up with it. management needs to be more in touch with employees."
good,It was a seasonal position and I was there for a certain time. Unfortunately I had a car accident and I had to end my employment there..................................................
good,"fast-paced, compassionate with members and great customer service skills. Surveys are crucial and allow the members to rate the call, but also not fair because most members are rating the service from the company not just the call"
good,Great core values with amazing people living and leading those values. A lot of people in the company to collaborate with in in different aspects. Community driven.
good,Easy to get promoted. Always ask to do extra activities. Needs more improvement on employees that have conditions such as having a option to buy extra PTO

good,Everyone works well togather team effect we have understanding the work to be proformed. No advancement as of now. Thwy really care about your will being
good,Fast paced call center job that had little to medium stress. I had little to no interaction with other co-workers since we were sent home to work after 2 years of employment in the Business Park.
good,I enjoyed working for the company and would of stayed with them if they still had work in this area but at this time there is no work here. The hardest part of the job was having to be able to work on your own and have the abliity to think thing through on your own.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"I feel if I stayed longer I might've eventually found my perfect place in the company. cos i worked for united health care as a client for teleperformance under Americals roof. I feel I would've ""graduated"" from floor phone guy to some kind of tech service which a lot of company's under that building needed. "
good,Excellent place to work.. day or evening shift... met a lot of cool co-workers.. pretty laid back... if you have a family mandatory overtime can be a killer especially around the holidays
good,"Very bias management, favoritism towards a certain culture. I may even say prejudice towards certain ethic groups. No one is really called a ""discriminator"" in real life, nor are they called a ""chauvinist"" unless it's specifically used in the context of a ""male chauvinist."" Yet I have experienced this on at lease 3 levels of management that cause me to resign and find work at another company."
good,They need more training  and the management was not what I thought it should be.  There was some favoritism that took place.  Not a over all team effort
good,Solid organization with solid leadership.  Culture is very results driven so those who don't perform don't last long.  Salary is a bit under market but horrid.  Its a huge company so change and decisions sometimes seem to lag but they do have a vision and plan on how to execute that plan.

good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

I hardly ever received time off from work unless it was a company paid holiday. Towards the end of my time there I had a work overload.

They want you to have a good balance of home live and good quality of living for personal healthy but I and others do not get that at OPTUM / UHG. My personal roll was both a ""Cross App"" and ""App PM"" roles with 12 - 14 projects running simultaneously. I came on as a contractor, offered a FTE position but turned it down as the FTE pay was to the very and the benefits and paying for parking was not beneficial to becoming an FTE. Getting help was often a difficult task as well. As much as management states ""ask for help"" if you need it, 98% of the time it was non existent. Ask a million and one questions within the first two weeks of starting here or you will be lost of who is who and what person represents what LOB."

good,My was great. A typical day at work was incoming calls from members inquiring about their insurance. I learned about insurance coverage and medicare. Some managers were amazing I was placed with a new manager so she was learning as I was learning which was not any help to me. Co-workers were very helpful and supportive. Hardest part of my job was hearing members not being able to pay for their medication and having to explain why is was not covered in their plan.

I feel as if though I became a better employee and asset because of my time at UnitedHealth."

Questions and concerns are addressed IMMEDIATELY and everyone contributes to improving processes.  EVERYONE helps each other and wants each person to reach their personal and professional best.

Most employees are virtual, but there are several opportunities to interact via chats, phone, and WebEx. The day is fast-paced and requires the utilization of good focus, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

I currently work in a shift schedule four days on and four days off, I work two of the day cycles then move to night for two. This is the only thing I struggle with, I pride my self being on time an reliable but the move the nights to days or the other move have caused me to be late once and be confused on when I worked another.

Upper management took a very keen interest in supplying our needs. I had some great co-workers who I am still in touch with.

Also, I had to handle any escalated calls to refrain going to upper management, if possible. I enjoy helping others."

good,one thing i really liked about unitedhealth group is the people. very people oriented from management to staff. not much for growth due to they need more people to manage the calls rather than upsizing the workforce
good,Great work environment! Really care about their employees and work with you to find perfect fit. Would highly recommend working for them to anyone interested.
good,This was a great company to work for. They have a very positive work environment and opportunity for advancement. I only left due to scheduling conflicts with my children's needs at the time.
good,I enjoyed the working environment and all of my associates. I was disappointed in the abilities to move up in the company. The word around the office was that you had to start at the bottom to work up in the company. So there was a lot of favoritism on promotions and that resulted in a lot of turnovers.
good,"UHG is an amazing company to be a part of.  The culture of the enterprise binds all employees and brings together one of the largest companies in the world.  Driven by a common mission to improve health and the health system for everyone, UHG is an organization that leverages it’s competencies to improve the way we all interact with the health system world wide."

good,Culture is fast paced but collaborative.  Cutting edge on being front of change.  Most enjoyable part was knowing part of a team changing healthcare delivery
good,The great company I had some of my own issues at one point but it was a health issue had nothing to do with them. I honestly would go back if they would allow me and in fact I think I will apply this week and we'll see what happens. I made a lot of friends there also friends that I'm still in contact with. And they all still really like their job. There is mandatory overtime which can be difficult for some people but it is also worth it
good,This is a great place to work as far as culture goes. Lots of rooms to move around and accelerate career. However the benefits are mediocre. Not having co pays and having high deductibles is hard on all of us.

good,"United HealthGroup is a great company. We worked hard in Iowa to give all the Medicaid members everything they needed and deserved to have with their healthcare insurance, and the current politics and politicians got in the way of our care. I would have stayed with company until retirement, another 20some years."

If you are not willing to work hard I would not suggest applying for a job at UHG.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."

good,"After logging into the system, the work assignments are loaded to my profile and I am to work each assignment and to make sure the information that goes into the system is correct.  I work with a nice bunch of people who are willing to help you even if you ask the same question."
good,"My day starts off with greeting my co-workers. I start my system up review my cases and proceed with my daily process. I have been on my job for 7 years. The experience and the people there have been great. United health group is an excellent company to work for. They are flexible, and are dedicated to their customers as well as their employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"A typical day at work- I would call scheduled members the day before to verify appointment time. I would print the member list and plan the visits. upon arrival to the members location I would  Preview health history in tablet, Meet member to collect health history and perform head to toe assessment, review medications and educate members. "
good,"1) well developed organization"
good,I love this company and its work culture.Good timing .Transport facility.Friendly manager.
good,"I absolutely love the organization I work for currently. However, the opportunity for advancement is slim to none. Communication is also lacking within the company in specific areas of the organization. I enjoy the work environment  and peers that I encounter. It is friendly and enjoyable. Management is consistent with the needs of the business. The hardest part about my particular position are the unhappy providers that are upset about the way a claim is paid. Being able to channel a friendly attitude when a provider is clearly not happy about a specific circumstance. I do enjoy the ability to help others and solve problems when the opportunity presents itself."
good,"Não tenho muito o que falar, pois fiquei pouquíssimo tempo. Devido ser um trabalho temporário."
good,"I really like UHC however, the advancement opportunities and pay are not very satisfactory."
good,UHC is a great place to make a career. There are a lot of opportunities there and the benefits are great.
good,"Great opportunities to network within the organization. Innovative approaches to process improvement. Really engage employees to participate in changing the face of health care. I have learned the overall business process of health insurance products, claims processing, reimbursement polices and Medicare guidelines. Multiple platforms to perform cross-functional tasks is amazing. Senior Leadership clearly defines and communicates business objectives and goals. Claims adjustments and auditing are challenging careers well suited for those that are looking to stay in that current position. The most enjoyable part of my job is the social causes that we participate in at the site. Overall great organization to work for."
good,"My day is an 8-5 position, I manage a marketing mailbox where custom requests come through, I manage them from A-Z. Keep monthly, quarterly and annually budgets/reports. Work with multiple vendors per day. Have to engage in time management to ensure that all custom requests and individual projects are maximized to the fullest and stay within budget."
good,The management for this office was outstanding & very helpful.
good,I enjoyed working for them.. It was Oxford Health Plans they got bought out by United Healthcare..I loved coming to work it was a family atmospher. the work schedules stated anywhere from 745a-600p M-F..they had company fun days where there were company picnic on these days we shut down early and the staff & their family would enjoy a day of fun a local them park or beach...they had quarterly prizes and bonus..each year based on performance 1 luck employee would win a car/truck..what every the company (all employees) voted on.. once united came in things were cut out but they kept the CORE vaules of Oxford...they encouraged growth and developement and compansation matched your developement.for that i thank them for the experience..

good,Back then 2013 the culture in the company was amazing even the salary. Working in a in-house captive environment is definitely a wonderful experience.
good,"a typical day at work is very busy when plenty of charts available to code."
good,"Boa empresa. Deveria ter um melhor reconhecimento com o funcionário, quando fechar uma unidade reaproveitando  o funcionário em outra unidade."
good,"Great place to work. The company promotes growth, healthy lifestyle, and planning for your future  They recognize the issues people face i n life and try to accommodate."
good,"cool people, fun place, not the same for the management. "
good,The company does a great job of providing the best healthcare for members. Work life balance and a positive work environment for the most part. Also great community involvement
good,Great workplace maybsuit others and others not. Depend on individual. Great company to work for. If you like being sitting for hours at a desk then it's for you.

good,"I worked in atmosphere and surroundings that exists Skillful employees, with pressure absorbing qualities makes the working environment even more interesting and unique with fun filled activities ."
good,"I loved it there"
good,As a Nurse Practitioner I found UHG  to be an exceptional place to work.  They offered ample opportunities to keep abreast of the latest in medical knowledge.  There was ample support from management to provide a high level of care to our patient population.  The hardest part of the job was seeing the chronic changes in the patients as the naturally declined.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a workplace culture that supported individual growth as well as being a part of a team.  We worked in close collaboration with the team to provide the highest level of care to our patient population.
good,"I enjoy my telecommuting work, conducive to learning, collaborating and productivity. It is a very supportive environment. Typical 8-10 hr work day depending on breaks.breaks..  The most enjoyable part of my job is advocating for our members quality, and cost effective care."
good,Job was very straightforward but training was horrible.  If you don’t know how to teach yourself you will be stuck.  Management is  not structured they are all over the place.  And the micromanaging is horrible.
good,a typical day at work consisted of working remotely from home and calling members.  This job was very rewarding. Working for United for 6 years was one of the best experiences I have ever had.
good,For the short time that I worked there it was a very good atmosphere. We had wellness every Wednesday and most of the people I worked with were very nice and had I stay longer they probably would have became like family. My boss was very helpful and gave constructive criticism.
good,Enjoyed working for United Health Care and would return to work for this company again. Enjoyed my time there! Employees are friendly and work together as a team. I learned a lot in the managed care environment.
good,Working at UHC was a fun experience. I would highly recommend anyone to work there. If you get in the right department you can easily move around the company.
good,Good place to work I enjoyed my employment with this company it was unfortunate that I was part of a lay-off group so that was the only downfall to my time with company
good,Empresa de excelência como um tudo  ambiente agradável para trabalha com facilidade em equipe
good,Good place to work. Good technology and training.  The management is for letting employees get training in new technology.  It is a good place to work but they have a lot of layoffs.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"Everyone embraces the Vision, Values and Corporate culture. Many are Culture ambassadors supporting all of this. Great work life balance. Many telecommuters."
good,I love working for UnitedHealthCare. The benefits are almost unmatched. I really wish they paid more. The pay is competitive but I still find myself living check to check.
good,"It is a job with great autonomy and flexibility,  great management, productive and a fun place to work, coworkers and manages were very productive and supportive, I had the opportunity to learn and gained a lot of knowledge on case management."
good,I love UHC...!! It's a great place to work and it helps that I've been working from home for 3 years. Great work life balance. The people are great that work here!
good,I loved working at UHC.  I looked forward to going to work every day. It was a great company to work for. I was hoping to be there for many years to come.
good,Just like any business UHG has a customer service expectation. They care about employees who show they enjoy what they do and want to grow within the company. You get what you give when it comes to any job. This company is set up in a way where you start at an entry level position and your efforts and energy that you display will guide where you go. They are there to help you help yourselves.
good,"Would recommend, opportunity to grow within company from entry level positions.Great benefits, fortune 500 company.my favorite benefit was working from home."
good,"Conducted .(HEDIS) outbound calls were made every day to provider practice requesting medical records. Documented each call made using Excel and updated calls made on a spread sheet provided. I learned how to communicate with Medical Doctors thru phone conversations and making calls quickly enough to complete my assignment by the end of the work day. Supervisor relied on me to complete the project assigned. The more I did each day during this assignment, the easier it became for me. The most enjoyable part of my day was lunch time from which I was able to join my team players and laugh/relax for a little while. Workplace given every day was private and quiet for me. The company made sure we were comfortable while working there even if it was temporary."
good,Great place to work with flex hours as long as you did your work. It was great. The people were friendly. There were lots of layoffs throughout the company.
good,"I am writing this review as a Technology resource. OGS in the Philippines particularly in the IT delivery team is some kind the nice place to work. work schedule often times is flexible. Not so good people managers but tolerable. There are a lot of change in organisation, team re alignment and changes in management."
good,"We have a great team who are 100% about what is best for our members. Management is present and understanding. Questions are answered immediately. Pay as expected. Great work/life balance. The health insurance could be better, considering."
good,"It is a great place to work! Great benefits. One downside is they don't really care if you have a degree or not in that field, felt overqualified for job position and ""waiting periods"" made it hard to move within the company."
good,UHG allowed me the opportunity to advance my career rather quickly. If you do the work you will get recognized. I would not be where I am today without UHG.
good,"United Health Care, is a good company to work for,  their support is great.  They invest in the their agents a lot.  I have been with them for abut a year "

good,"Career advancement opportunities, work from home anywhere in the United States available. At the cotton center location they have a gym and shower. Overall a descent place to work."
good,"Foi uma experiência satisfatória e de muito aprendizado. "
good,"After 14 years at UHC, I am still as satisfied with my career.  If you are looking for an hourly job as a stepping stone than you may feel the demanding pace and needs of the business are too stringent for you.  If, however, you want to build a career and are willing to expand and stretch your limits you will fit right in.  The environment and leadership changes often which can be scary but that is the nature of the industry.  Work/life balance is good and the company does invest in you as an individual."

good,"I am thankful for my job at UHC. It is fast paced and there is always something new to learn. The pay is decent and my PTO days are as well.  My manager is amazing. My only complaint is they keep changing our metrics making it harder and harder to earn bonuses. They have a lot of Good, hardworking employees who get discouraged about these metrics. They need to be a little more realistic and stop changing them, not in our favor, all the time."
good,"I handle calls from New York and New Jersey providers on Community and State calls. I do eligibility, claims, appeals, authorizations all day. I enjoy talking to different people and the co-workers are great. The healthcare field can be very rewarding and is a constant changing environment."

good,"Offers the ability to work remotely, very flexible when it comes to hours.  Merit-based increases and bonuses, good PTO, so-so health benefits.  Pay is generally above average and is based on location; e.g. a pay grade in New England would pay higher than the same grade in the US South due to cost of living differences."
good,Great place to work and advance. The culture was great. A lot of different people. It is a peaceful place. The management was fair and kind. I would go back If I could

good,Relaxed atmospher but work can be stressful at times. All team members help one another to succeed. I would LOVE to join this company again. Management works with you if there is an emergency outside of work and doesnt hold it against you.
good,The best part of the job is the flexibility in scheduling.  There is a clear gap between supervisor and management relations.  Very competitive staff to supervisor relations.

good,"I liked working there and the pay was adequate. I had an amazing supervisor that worked with my schedule so I could go to school full-time when I worked there. I only left to change careers completely otherwise if I still wanted to work in a call center it was probably the best one I ever worked at, I worked from home which was amazing."

This job has taught me a lot about customer service and being professional."

good,"Freshers can learn a lot from this Company. Work culture is too good."

good,The company overall is wonderful company benefits great pay an for the most part your peers are great dont only thing that was i a bit of a bother was putting a person in a management position that on paper is looking great but as a person amongst peers can be very unfair an does not work well with others. Understandable that we all go through things in life outside of work but should never be carried into work that affects your behavior or attitude towards those you are responsible for in the work place .

good,The position was new and created to handle all aspects of the company from insurance to finding doctors to claims etc and there was not enough training to cover all the areas involved.  If your computer had issues you got behind and were left behind.  Expected co workers to be team members but then set metrics to compete against each other in a cut throat manner.  A different position and I would have enjoyed working there.  I like fast paced busy at all times but this was too much

good,"Empresa maravilhosa, ótima estrutura e gestão. Indico sempre que for possível."
good,"I can day that Unitedhealth group under Optum  is one of the best company in the history. They are not just thinking about just cincern about their members and client but also the care about their employee's welfare by giving then paid time off, manager's advices that won't let a staff feels down but motivated to do their work better.  They assist and help each staff to have personal growth within the company."

The BH UM group was very tight knit and worked exceptionally well together; there was a great deal of mutual support. It was a busy group so there was, at times, a high level of stress but management was excellent in terms of resources and support. My clinical skills remained very sharp as a result of the pace of work, the diversity of situations encountered and because of work expectations and interactions with staff. "

Some prescriptions may be more challenging then others, so I look in our protocol/procedures and if I cant seem to find the answer then ill go ask the lead tech and she will assist me with the problem. So every single day I learn something different. Management/co-workers are great, always there for us when/if we need them, very understanding group of individuals.

The part that I most enjoy about my job, is the environment, my cubical, I enjoy the office/desk work."

Mostly it comes with years of learning and experience, most importantly by practicing patience on how to accommodate and deal with colleagues and manager and balance work and by taking criticism to our stride."
good,UHC is a wonderful company to work for. Must be self driven and goal oriented. Must be compassionate to members of all ethnic and health backgrounds. I enjoy all of my coworkers.

good,"I really enjoy working at UHC and especially in my line of work. No two days are the same and often time we work with different co-workers on a daily basis; HOWEVER, working in my field can also become a curse when trying to venture into other areas within UHC. The hardest part of this job is during the holidays and summer months (per diem also know AS NEEDED) when we HARDLY have work and trying to schedule other contracting companies is often difficult, since many consider UHC as their primary ""meal ticket"""

The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility of my work hours."
good,It is a great place to work as I get to talk to many people a day and help assist my customers with any issues or questions they may have about our services.

good,Job duties did not fit my career goals. Very little training. Benefits and pay were great.

good,A typical work day is very busy. The calls come back to back. Training is very thorough. I have learned so much about claims and benefits. The management is very caring and willing to help when ever needed. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help each person you come in contact with on the phone.

good,I truly enjoy working for UHC.  It is a great place with great opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering anywhere from 85-100 calls, all inbound. You will use at least 3 systems on each call but can use up to 6 per call depending on the provider. Once training is over there is a major culture shock. There are things that you are going to wish you were prepared for during training but give it time..... My trainer told me it would take about 6 months for everything to make sense and she was right. Now a year later, I have learned how to quote benefts, check for authorization for all procedures. I have learned how to read how a claim is processed. I have learned so many things in the year I have been with UHC. "

There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Muito agitado, dinâmico. "
good,I worked for United for over 8 years. I had a great time working here but decided to leave for a different opportunity.
good,"A typical day for me would be reviewing company metrics and putting together a detailed email on how we are doing. Then join a couple of morning conference calls with upper management discussing how we are doing in regard to the company internal and contractual metric goals. Then meet with my team discuss how the plans they manage are doing. I'll then meet with the forecasting team and training department to discuss if we need a new hire class to cover forecasted call volume or if we can cross-train some of the current staff. Later in the day I will check to see if we have some availability for supervisors to either pull agents for coaching or let the go home early due to low call volume, or on the other hand see if agents can stay for overtime due to higher than normal call volume."
good,This job has great advantages if you would like to work from home.

good,"Logo quando entrei na empresa era como recepcionista de hospital, foi bastante dinâmico trabalhar atendendo os clientes. Aprendi ser dinâmica, ágio, sempre gostei de trabalhar em equipe porque assim podemos contar com ajuda dos colegas e ajuda-los também. A parte mais difícil era quando a demanda do hospital estava cheia, gerava reclamações dos cliente, o importante e que sabíamos da solução. Trabalhei como recepcionista a três anos e fui promovida para auxiliar administrativo onde trabalhei em escritório e fiquei responsável por duas empresas conveniada da Amil.

good,"I loved working at UHG, the people were great. The company and management were a breeze to work for."
good,Worked for OptumRX division of UnitedHealthGroup. Steady job with high job security. Average on the micro-manage scale. Only left because of low pay and commute.

good,"People are nice and focus on work. There is no negative culture where people are pressured to work late or meet impossible deadlines."
good,I would recommend working at UHC to friends and families due to the flexibility of hours as well as working along side with my previous management team.
good,"in a normal day there is no supervision you have to be very independent and work by yourself, if you need help you have to reach out to management via phone or group chat. there is no dress code so that's the good thing."
good,I enjoy most being able to work fully remote. There is no travel required in my postion. The company values itself on being a family friendly environment.

good,"I liked the one thing most that they are fully focused on employees health."
good,"Fantastic management on a technical level. Great colleagues that are sociable and highly intelligent. Relaxed culture. Only drawback is bureaucracy but that is common in all large companies. Overall, great place to work (depending on team), I’d highly recommend Optum/UHG"
good,A typical day of work was reviewing information systems to make sure that United Health Care had the same information as Medicare/Medicaid and as well as the Social Security Admin had in their systems. I would update information and send out letters to policy holders and make them aware of penalties that were applied if any. I enjoyed coming to work every day
good,Great Company! Very flexible with work schedules. Awesome leadership. Enjoy the daily huddles. I love working remote but this constantly consists of meetings every other day. Overall good company.
good,Good company to work for overall. Management is very helpful.Traveling from location to location was fun and getting to meet new people weekly is exhilarating.
good,"For perspective, I was laid off after 6 years but I still say the whole experience at UHG was great and I'd do it again if given the chance. I am much better for having worked and dealt with a very large company and I take with me many skills that I could not have picked up working in smaller environments. The day involved meetings from 1-5 hours a day most of the time there was enough time to take care of programming and with anywhere some days are better than others but overall most days were pretty great. The culture was healthy I believe in large part due to telecommute, there was no office cooler so no heavy politics and fewer unwelcome interruptions.  The hardest part was feeling bound to old technology. So many systems were outdated and the people who set them up have long since moved on in their career so nobody quite knew how they worked/how to fix it/how to replace it. "
good,Great Teamleads and HR dept fun filled activities computer labs and great work activities food trucks and family day the day is great the traffic varies the direction you have to travel from hr lunches two 15 min breaks very laidback chill environment always hiring

good,constantly growing and changing. Friendly coworkers that want to make a difference. Management was supportive and knowledgeable. The option to working full remote was a huge benefit.
good,"I have worked for this company for almost two years, and was a contractor for one year. The work environment is phenomenal. The company welcomes innovation. Managers are supportive with all staff. Teamwork is apart of the culture, and it is experienced daily. As far as advancement since the company is awesome, most people stay in the same position for a while so that can mean that advancement, and progression is not as fast. However if you express interest in another department or asks for other opportunities it may take some time, but you will have the support of management and they will point you in the right direction. The salary is average, but the benefits are awesome. You also have the potential of bonuses which are given quarterly, but it is based on your performance during the quarter and your performance is based on meeting the metric goal established."
good,United Health Care allows you to have fun while working hard. Though there were days that were so stressful yet they manage to lift you up and give you surprises at the end of the shift.

good,"At Optum/UHG, an employee must be a very effective learner as well as doer of the things learned. Employees are cooperative and responsible. We have fun exercises at work that unites the floor's team members and leaders. This company does not even hunger us while at work due to food availability in each floor of the building."

They praise you often when you do something right and constantly communicate in teams to assure common goals are met."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with our team. Learned so much from our rounds, discussions, meetings. Genuinely felt as if we were enhancing the patient experience/health outcomes."
good,"Not applicable for this my position was cancelled "
good,Experince working with UHG was quite different as i started my carrier from their only and learned alot my managera were awesome until i got moved to product engineering team where manager were so micro management oriented that she ruined my carrier and i have to decide to quit from their and look for another job
good,Management always are will to help you to perform your job well.  They always acknowledge your effort in doing your job.  I left because I had to relocate to a different state but I will be applying as soon as I able to do so.
good,It is a call center so it is rather stressful but working with Medicare seniors was rewarding.  The call center design environment was very good.  Ergonomically arranged for comfort of employee.
good,"I was proud to work for United Healthcare for 17.5 years, and I would still be working there had my position not suddenly and expectedly been eliminated."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none.

good,"I worked there for close to 8 years, it's a Great company to work, Management can be worst because of few people but the company policies are far better,"
good,"I can describe the culture and benefits like such, ""Of course a healthcare company would invest in the (physical, mental, emotional) health of their employees."""
good,Great company to work for. They’re very generous. I left because I didn’t want to be in a a call center environment anymore. Great pay and great management.
good,Wish I could’ve stayed hope I get brought back didn’t like the drive but I loved working there would work there if asked again or if there was a position open
good,This is an overall good job if you are just looking for a check. The people are friendly. its a positive work environment. There is just no room for growth and alot of decisions are made based on emotions
good,At UHG people get various opportunities and management is very supporting to support innovation culture. Based on size of organization all tools and technologies are available which helps an individual to explore his expertise in desired stream / technologies.
good,"A great place to work. Pay is great and flexible. Training but you have to be flexible. Recognition for hard work. Managers do not micro manage, as long as you are doing your work. It shows in production."
good,"The work environment is the best I’ve ever experienced. I love the compassion that the company shows to our members. It’s rewarding being able to assist our elderly members, especially those who need that extra help."
good,This is a great opportunity  for those that enjoy working with seniors.  The staff are supportive and the Doctors truly care for patients. Some of the nurses are difficult to get along with but the majority are phenomenal.
good,The company keeps branching out and merging with others and it changes the culture of whatever group you’re working with. They pay a bit less than P&C companies. Overall I liked it bc I like working in healthcare.
good,"This place has a really great working environment. They help with your needs, the only down fall is the Short Term Disability department. They are hard to work with when an emergency arrises."
good,As an at home agent I have enjoyed working with the state of Florida and United Healthcare for several years. I was able to use several different types of skills at the same time in order to help others in need to receive benefits of the company.
good,"A good place to learn and grow. The company has segregated there IT business and gave it a name OPTUM . With OPTUM evolution as IT service company the policy and culture is not same as when its UHG "

good,"Glad to work with optum great work experience and great work culture. Issues will be solved instantly"
good,UnitedHealthcare has been very rewarding experience. A typical day at work with UnitedHealthcare is answering approximately 30-50 calls per day. With UnitedHealthcare one of the most important lessons I learned is compassion walk in the member shoes treat them as they are your family. I found with my job the hardest part was when a prior authorization for either medical procedure or medication was denied and letting our members know they could not receive something they were expecting. The most enjoyable about UHC is our members helping them live healthier live.
good,I enjoyed my time when I'm work there unfortunately I got sick and had to be medically discharged but I would work there again if I had the chance. The salary was competitive the hours were good the overtime was great and it was a great place to work great benefits 401k stock matching Optum Bank Health Options great place

good,"There was a lot of research to be done daily.  I would research high dollars claims, denials, and assist providers on understanding why a claim didn't pay or why it paid as it did.  I have learned a lot about the healthcare industry.  The Culture was very professional and courteous.  The hardest part of the job was attempting to calm irate callers.  I enjoy the research part and I love helping people to understand what they are looking at involving their healthcare benefits."
good,"UHC is one of the best companies that I have had the opportunity to work for. Not only did they fund my Health Insurance Licence, but they made me feel good to work with them because of the tremendous care they show their consumers as well as their employees."

good,Working for United Healthcare was the absolutely best job I had during my 35 year career span. When it was time to work..WE WORKED! When it was time for fun..WE HAD FUN!!

Were it not for my health...I would go back any day.

good,"More than anything else, I enjoyed working with some amazing people!  Challenging role, I learned a lot and appreciated the opportunity to advance in my career when I was there."
good,United Health Group is a great company that is new to Georgia. The manager and supervisor are great. The hours could be better but it’s a stress free environment
good,"These companies are amazing as they have diverse pools of professionals. You will have a chance to work and learn with these amazing people about their field of expertise and their roles at least once throughout your employee's life cycle. Because of these companies, I was able to honed my skills, I like the culture as well as they show compassion, integrity, and passion."
good,United makes it very easy to telecommute. A great company if you are looking for flexibility and opportunities to grow. If you are an individual that needs face to face interactions and build relationships this may not be the type of job for you as most of the meetings are teleconferences.
good,"For the most part I have a lot of the benefits of a small company with the support of a large organization. We get to solve really interesting, meaningful, challenging problems. There's flexibility to work from home (depending on the org you're in) since we're spread out all across the country. There are also a Ton of educational opportunities internally which makes professional development really easy."
good,"Throughout the contract, there are these ""easy"" days, yet also there are stressful and mind-wrecking times. After all, at the end of the day you'll learn patience and perseverance to accomplish the task. To know and understand the system's logic is one of the keys, then you might enjoy doing each task afterwards. They give rewards and incentives. Competitive salary. Good working environment. It was a great experience. :)"

good,I gave United healthcare five stars  because I enjoy working here.  United healthcare provider great opportunities and pay to their employees .  UnitedHealth care focus on integrity with their employees and the  individuals that they support.
good,Working for united health group is a good company to work for. They are very active with their workers and they go up and beyond for there members and also there workers. All though I worked for Temp agency under them I always wished to work for the Company it self.
good,This was a great place to work.  The only problem was that there was a lot of mismanagement.  The management staff changed on a regular basis.  You never really got a chance ot know your manager
good,"on a normal day, I would come into work add start up my system. check emails and respond, prepare for morning meeting and target goals. I've learned how to asset government guidelines and apply them to my work file for customers and providers.

good,"I work from home, which has it pros and cons."
good,"I worked as a contractor for 7 months there and have rarely worked with such a wonderful group of people. Of course, there were hiccups in the project but everyone took it in stride and did their best to maintain a positive and encouraging attitude. Work does move slow and can be a bit tedious at times, but the people made up for the dullness of the job. I also was given plenty of opportunity to learn new skills to better assist in the project, and was given a lot of freedom for my work process, though almost every final decision was made by committee--which could be annoying. If you can work in insurance without going out of your mind with boredom, you should work here."
good,I have learned and grown professionally at United Health care. It is a rewarding and innovative environment and offers opportunities for advancement in my career.
good,"Very fast paced, which I enjoyed. I learned alot about people, their personalitys and compassion for them. I worked with some great managers who were very concerned not only for the clients, but also for the employees. The hardest part of the job for me was when a customer could not be helped due to their finances or health issues, the most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer was satisfied and taken care of."
good,Employement was servicing the Tricare Contract. The company enforced their culture on its staff members without acknowledging the Tricare Contract and what it means to be apart of that culture and their community. It was a different environment and more relying on its employees to do the training.
good,Working at United Health Group was a great experience. The culture was great and management was very upfront about the company's future. The flexible hours were a plus!
good,"I was given bonuses for incentives and was able to be in contact with my superior easily."

The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Well for me, my design manager didn't communicate effectively. "
good,I enjoyed working at UHG and if an opportunity does open again in my career to return as an employee  - I would be very interested and would seriously review the offer. A typical day at work was - in one word - very busy. The hardest part of the job was prioritizing the day - The culture was amazing and many wonderful people do great things for UHC and the members.

good,"My role at that time was in PCRS and I loved it. I loved being able to help and also being able to use my brain to solve puzzles with provider claim issues. The hours were a lot and I eventually went on to further my career on the clinical side so that I could be more hands on with patients and providers by giving them information based on my knowledge of insurance while working as a Certified Medical Assistant. United Health Group was a great opportunity for me and a great stepping stone for my career path, too."

If it wasn't for a necessary move I would still be working here."
good,"A typical work day consists of calling patients to schedule at home doctor visits."
good,I really do not have the time to write a review for UHC.  This was a good job and unfortunately I had to relocate and could not keep the position.  However I recommend them.
good,Excellent company to work for with solid pay and benefits. Culture varies depending on the business segment. Promoting is difficult even for top performers.
good,"All companies have their pros and cons, however, overall United Healthcare is a pretty descent place to work. Opportunity to grow and advance within the company."

The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to explain everything and have that member thank you for thoroughly explaining it to them."

good,"The work for the PEDS(product engineering department) which is new but very furious in their work culture. The leadership wants the best tech and lot of budget goes to the RND department.

good,Optum is a great company with great vision. Lots of opportunity to grow. Typical day involved making calls doing demos and building sales pipeline for both new and exiting customers. I learned a ton about the healthcare while working at Optum as they are an industry leader. The hardest part about our job was also the most rewarding which was striving to hit sales targets. The workplace is fun however between departments can feel segmented and there are silos. Loved being part of an innovative company that delivered great products.

good,"I technically worked at Optum, but that aside, I really enjoyed working there. The company knows what kind of employee they have on their hands, and are quick to find a place that better suites you. I was initially hired for Insurance sales, but they quickly found I was better suited to the more challenging Retention position. There I flourished, and really bonded with my manager and other employees on my team. My only regret is that they moved their call center out of my area."
good,"I performed customer support via telephone.  Assisted customers with billing questions, setting up their network, and provisioning the Vonage devices on their networks."

good,"A typical work day at UHC is unlike any other. Even though you're on the phone every day, the people that you work with are there to keep you company and make the day go by faster and make the day worth being there at work. The management system was good. They are very helpful and are very knowledgeable about the information you've asked for and looking for. Hardest part of the job is knowing that you can't be there to face your customers only through the phone. I think that having a face to face interaction with people are always better than not getting to really meet."

Medsynergies was purchased and as a result, restructuring began which closed my department.  While MSI promoted good work/life balance, I had many long days due to a personal need of always being prepared.  I enjoyed my job so much that it really did not seem like work to me so the long hours that I imposed on myself were not an issue.  The most enjoyable part of my position was working with the market leaders.  I also enjoyed working with the different operational teams within the company along with building relationships based on honesty and trust. I worked closely with two leaders in this company.

I have also learned a ton in the position I am in now. I love my boss too. I am ready to move up to the next level. Only thing I do not like, is they put a Big Brother software on our computers and after 3 seconds if we are not moving the mouse, it clocks us. This software also tells Mgt what applications we are using, what websites we are going to etc etc. We are also required to log what we are doing through a separate software.

The expectations of your work are clearly outlined and you're not left wondering what's expected of you. The pay is good. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the members, some of them can be very difficult to interact with.

My co workers and management are very fun and dependable to work with. We always come together and help out other teams to make sure they reach their goals. The hardest part of this job i would say would be making sure claims are processed in a timely matter so they don't miss their PG Metrics. The most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing that you are making a difference and helping make sure that the customers and providers are happy and satisfied with the service we are providing them.

Overall, I enjoyed working for the company and would highly recommend the company for employment."
good,"Great place to work, just needed something new. The work environment is great because you get to work from home. The managers were nice and understanding."
good,This a a good company to work for. They are very supportive and understanding. It’s many opportunities to move up in the company.  Apply apply apply apply
good,I spent close to 7 years here in various positions.  This is a great place to work that has several locations across the country with many positions being able to telecommute.
good,Supportive management. Many programs to enhance professional development. Tuition reimbursement plus employee assistance programs and clinical ladders.
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,This was my dream job but we lost the contract. Best bosses and company. Best plposition I have ever worked. I was proud and felt worth in what I did.
good,"Optum, the Behavioral Health division of United Health Group, has excellent leadership and utilizes evidenced-based techniques and processes.

good,This company is rewarding to work for; you are working for an organization that directly impacts community healthcare. They also promote a strong sense of community within their staff.
good,"I had tried for years to work at UnitedHealthcare. It will be a year this month that I have been working here. I knew from the first face to face interview to the day we got to do their meet and greet prior to starting work I would love to work for this company. I have not been disappointed. The management does their best in taking care of their staff. They show we are appreciated and reward us with quarterly bonuses, potlucks, employee recognitions that included a special lunch that includes a beautiful table setting and meals that are either cooked by the managers or catered for team leaders selecting someone from each team, gifts for both Mother’s and Father’s Day, weekly/monthly fun activities, monthly/quarterly community volunteer work, and promoting within. This has been the most diversified company I have worked at in awhile. The managers are both men and women equally as well. This is a call center environment without it being your typical call center. We do not share cubicles and they are nice and big. The sound level is low for a call center environment. Would highly recommend working here"
good,i enjoyed working at UHG. I just needed to transfer company because of the salary. I need a higher salary as I am a single parent. Working environment was fun though

good,"I worked here through my last pregnancy and they were highly accommodating . I was able to take maternity leave and short term disability pay as an employee, after complications from birth. I returned to work once these resolved and held this position up until the point I left TX."
good,"I worked here back in 2014; this place was a great place to work... Management was all over the place and people got promoted for being in the ""social group"" but overall it was a great place to work."
good,"I've worked at UHG for the past 12 years. Overall, it's a well-run, properly managed business. If you work hard and occasionally go above and beyond, you will be rewarded. They do their best to be flexible to their employee's needs."
good,"Busy call center environment, for the most part great job."
good,"I enjoyed working for UHC. I relocated to another state however, and the assistance to transfer to another position that I qualified for was minimal to none. The benefits are decent, which include Bravos, which are points to obtain gift cards or purchase items from their internal store. There is not a work and balance life as your having to work overtime or on your time to meet deadlines and your review is dependent on you meeting those deadlines. The great thing about working at UHC was that I worked remotely and could work at any hour of the day. My manager and team were great, very helpful and knowledgeable in the LTC Medicaid program."
good,"Unfortunately they were reorganizing my department and cut about half the position. I do have a chance to apply for other positions. Great place to work, family oriented."
good,"Good company to work with, worklife Balance is good, not too much of workload, no micro management, leadership is good, quarterly and annual parties keep happening"
good,"In my extensive career pursuits, it is easy for me to say United Health Group is the best place I have ever worked!  Although, due to the nature of my position, I tend to work a lot of hours (solo support role in a remote* market).  However, management recognizes this and provides any support necessary and never questions any time off requested."
good,How the job opportunity not come up with Wells Fargo I would have stayed with United Healthcare.  The team and work  evironment helped get through day
good,Great group of people to work with but over 100 people laid off. We were well trained for policies we would be selling in specific areas of the country. I also was helped in getting Health and Life Insurance  Licensing in nineteen different states.
good,"I was with the company for almost two yrs and position was terminated by the state. I was responsible for calling members to remind them on gaps, including physical appointments and other annual check ups. I liked the phone and face to face contact with members and some of them were very pleased to hear about those missed appointments reminders and to have someone to talk to, to be able to help them out scheduling appointments and look for resources for them. It was a pleasure to empower most members; but it was also sad to leave with out the opportunity to get to some others. Working with these members made me understand them more and to see how lonely they were. Working with members that got used to having someone to talk to and ask questions about their benefits; specially the Spanish community.  The hardest part of my job was to leave with out saying good bye to members. Most members were very happy for  the extra benefits offered by UHG. Even when my supervisor was hundreds of miles away, she was always there for the team. Thanks for the opportunity UHG."
good,"Excellent company employee friendly, worksite balance.  Great minds to work with,  excellent leadership to work under and learn. A dream organisation to work."
good,"This company has so many facets to the service that they provide patients, it is an awesome experience to see so many teams working together to accomplish a common goal."
good,"A typical day of work starts with calls as soon as I logged into my phone at the beginning of my shift.  I worked remotely from home the last 2 years of my employment with UHC.  I learned how healthcare works from the ground-up, as I had never had a job in the healthcare industry previously.  I had 3 different supervisors in the first year and a half with the company, and the last one I had was fantastic.  The culture emphasizes thinking outside of the box to achieve first call resolution, and to embrace the grey when it comes to finding a way to make yourself stand out from the rest of the crowd in how you help customers as the face of the company.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the high call volume during Jan and Feb each year.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the cooperative spirit shared within the team as a whole, the interpersonal relationships built over time, and the strong sense of ""TEAM"" which made me feel like I was not only making a difference for people each day, but being able to say ""I love my job"" and actually believing those words, not just saying them."
good,"Great culture within this company.  Although there are unexplained layoffs at times with this company, that is corporate america and it could likely occur anywhere. When Optum downsizes, it is rarely about the person but more about a role elimination.  "
good,One of the few companies where an employee feels valued and understands their value to the company. Bonuses and availability for advancement were always there. Training is thorough and there was consistent help to improve.
good,I had an great experience working there it was relaxed and management is so respectful and does a good job & I enjoyed working here & the time I spent there learning new things

good,Self motivated is important to excel in any role at UHG. You have to be a go getter in order to succeed and grow within the company. UHG is a great company!
good,NA When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the bonds that enslave them. It takes a village or whatever is required .

I like the fact that we were able to take a down time when we were overwhelmed after dealing with a difficult customer.

good,"I love my job at UHG/Optum! I have been in healthcare as an RN for over 20 years and NP for 5. With this job you go to members home...obtain h&p, preventative care, review meds, perform head to toe physical exam, obtain A1C and FOBT if applicable. Educate members and notify pcp with any urgent concerns. All the members I have met have been very kind and appreciative. They are very impressed with the time and thorough visit and are very willing to continue to have future Housecall visits.  You make your own schedule as long as you get your designated hours in the 2 week period. You can work weekends if you needed. I have read other reviews that they don’t pay overtime...it is salaried but if you complete so many visits you are given incentive pay. They give great incentives! I have increased my income by several thousands through incentive and my base salary is very good. The charting is maybe an extra 30 minutes in evening but NOTHING compared to my previous job. Optum also encourages education and provides opportunities to further your career, of course that depends on what jobs are available (as with any company). They also pay 5k per year for degree advancement and 2 k for CE’s. I highly recommend UHG and I love my manager!"

I started out working in member services, but now work in provider services. The only complaints that I have is that you aren't given any sick days. If you call out sick, you get an occurrence. And, since the ACA took effect, our employee insurance coverage has changed and we now have higher medical deductibles on the insurance plans that we're offered.

good,"I worked in a call center selling Medicare Advantage plans for United Healthcare.  The only problem I had was I felt that they wanted me to force a new sell. I think that was more the call center than actual United Healthcare. My opinion is that if a senior citizen is happy with their plan, it is working well for them then their is no need to put that person through the ordeal of going over several different plans. Usually going over too many things will confuse them anyway. Of course, if there is a need for change then lets make a change."

good,"I have worked for UHG for over 8 years in some capacity or another.  I have always felt as though I have a great purpose with this company. I feel like they care tremendously about their employees as well as their members.  They go further and further all the time to incentivize members to stay healthy.  I work 4 days per week 10-12 hour days and I feel like I offer a tremendous service to members who need/deserve additional time in front of a practitioner to address any/all health concerns.  In this day and age, we are so rushed and so busy in health care. So I believe that our service is crucial to these members over the age of 65 who just need to talk and gain a more thorough understanding of the services they receive from their doctors and practitioners across their continuum of care.  These members are so important to me and I love the feeling of being able to provide a valuable service while still maintaining work/life balance. My managers have always been very supportive of my goals and motivate me to better myself all the time.  I am currently working on my DNP and UHG is contributing a large chunk toward ensuring that I reach this goal.  I could not be happier and intend to retire from this company if they will continue to have me!"

The work challenged me and helped me shine as I became more knowledgeable in managed care. I had the best management team ever. My typical day involved logging on and reading my emails, addressing urgent matters first before looking at my work queue and triaging my caseload. Once triaged my cases according notification requirements, URAC guidelines, urgency of request, so forth, I would review and determine if request could be administratively approved based on direct benefit language. If no clinical review required, approval or denial letter would be generated that included applicable covered benefit  language per Summary Plan Document and information about appeals, if request was denied. If request required further review, clinical documentation was requested form requesting healthcare provider and I would review the clinical documentation to determine if it meet the guidelines for approval per approved peer reviewed, evidenced based literature (medical policies), State/Federal Mandates, Summary Plan Document and applicable Specific Account Instructions.

During a primary care visit, Providers have a time limit that can be spend with patients. It is very rewarding to performed a physical exam in a more calm environment  and to be able to answer their questions in their own time, and to educate them regarding health and medications adherence. The only thing I was worried about sometimes , I had to visit clients in a neighborhood that I did not feel safe.

Then in the afternoon I would call patients that were discharged from the hospital and agreed to be followed up. We would discuss medication regiment and availability, if home health or hospice had contacted them, if they had made appointments for the MD for follow up, and if they had any questions and or concerns."

I am very pleased to be in a job with PTO. I am in an entry level position and I am able to support a household on my own. I came from a job working as management for less pay. It is nice to be able to support myself and only be responsible for myself at work. I am constantly telling my friends and family what a great work environment I am in.

good,"In hindsight, I probably should have stayed at United. Although the upward mobility that my career path took was invaluable to my all-over success, it is United Health Care that is the largest carrier in the country with enough of a diversified product portfolio, that the company's bottom line didn't ""live and die"" by their percentage of Federal monies via the Medicare Advantage Plans and the Medicare Prescription Drug Plans. As I reflect back, I ended up taking a circuitous route to achieve my career goals, when in fact, I would have moved farther up the management ladder at United had I been more patient. I was too young and perhaps not smart enough to realize exactly where I was in the Medicare industry. Hindsight is 20/20 !!"
