bad,"Worked in Queens and Brooklyn. Meetings held in Queens, projects in Brooklyn and various Westchester County locations. Management team lacked professionalism, guidance and support."
bad,"This company needs to start from the top down.  Get rid of the Board of Directors, followed by the CEO, Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents.  Then, build the company by putting people in those positions that have morals and ethics."
bad,"Working for a utility in the middle of NYC is hard to imagine.  The culture at Con Edison is not for everyone.  "
bad,"Always busy, never a moment to take a minute for yourself. Management was always onto of every movement you made. Micromanagement was what they did best."
bad,"As a Con Ed employee for the last 10 years, I have watched the company go downhill! Every year they strip out more out of your benefits. The company cares less for its employees and only wants to pay dividends to its shareholders. You are not allowed to think at this company! Not a good place to work anymore"
bad,"Horrible. Didnt help when asked , lied about everything! Yes the benefits were great but i didnt not like anything else. If you would like to get a degree out sode of Con Ed make sure you want something within the company. They wouls not let me go for education."
bad,"Poor leadership, horrible culture, stressful, lack of direction, poor training locations, incompetent medical staff, Job advancement is limited, racism"
bad,"Although the salary is good, the management at the company simply do not care about the safety and personal lives of their workers."
bad,"1 star company.  No room for growth, no prospect to be hired from within.  Hiring a lot  of contract work no permanent jobs.  Hard to be hired to the Union, better off being management with a Grad Degree"
bad,"I worked for Con Edison in NY,  The company changed to a cut-throat operation.  You are especially targeted if you are in the union.  Employees with more than 20 years are especially targeted for termination since those employees almost have a full pension.  The union is weak and has limited resources to defend you.  The job gives good pay and benefits if you can hold on to it.   If working for this company it is better to go for a Management position since you at least get can get a bonus for hard work."
bad,"I was hired as an ASP.NET developer. In my time at Con Edison, I did not get a single assignment that had anything to do with ASP.NET."
bad,If you are motivated and hungry for knowledge it is a great place to work. The benefits and pay scale are average but could be improved with promotions
bad,only want you for a number don't care about other things and they pay really well but you work whatever times they say until they need other people on a different schedule
bad,"Although you could advance it was frowned upon, nepatism when in management as I was no protection and everyone that you managed did not care for more trainning more work or simply regular work."
bad,"Con Ed was a great company to work for, but recent sky rocketing medical benefits and horrible managment make you want to leave!"
bad,This is a very easy job to do but they have no values. This is truly a company that your success is based on who you know. Seniority plays a very big role as well. They say if you have no seniority just follow suit with what others do and you will keep your job even if what they do is wrong. Management is awful but I guess that is solely because they have no union cover. The pay is excellent and the benefits are okay. You get a set schedule and it is hard to change and you only get a set amount of vacation days in which people with seniority get first pick which means you have to work every holiday but good thing about that is you get paid double time and a half.
bad,Great place to work if you want an opportunity to move within groups and learn different aspects of the business.  There is definitely opportunity for growth and advancement.
bad,the money and benefits are great but the work ignored to get that pay is a lot. you basically do every other departments job swell as your own.
bad,not very friendly towards military reservist.they seem to go out of there way to being a reservist as difficult as possible. All about the money. management gets rewarded to make union workers look bad and to dish out punishment and so they do. stable job all the same if you need one. poor work culture.
bad,"My Supervisors like to mess with you and grill until you were out of your mind stressed. Otherwise, I could I moved on from my co-op to the Gold Program, but I did not want to work in the utility industry, which is why i left."
bad,"There is a large disparity between management and union workers. It is a company to grow in but it is very difficult to move onto another department. As a part-time worker, they are willing to work with you a bit on your schedule."
bad,"This is an elephant's field.. when they get to an old age.  Unless you graduated from the leadership program, which I did, upward mobility is limited.  Luckily, I graduated from the program..."
bad,Good job but doesnt pay well enough for the work. Outside contractors qualified for the same work make way more then con edison employees and i dont find that fair at all.
good,Good company.  Stressful job culture.  Worked long hours 6am to 5 or 6pm. Stressful job security and advancement.  Management often randomly changed priorities.
good,"Some nice people and interesting work and job security is good.  However, advancement opportunities in the Law Department are not based on who contributes the most or who is most qualified.  The Law Department presently suffering from low morale and higher turnover."
good,"I was a good place to work but I wanted more in my field."
good,"Not a family friendly company: company policies are lousy: Union is weak: no STRIKE FUND, SO WHY DO WE PAY SUCH HIGH DUES"
good,"as a customer service rep, you do get full benefits but no advancement or full time hours until you have 3 years. They have unrealistic goals for representatives."
good,"Majority of the position consisted of the employee overseeing construction sites. "
good,you interact with many different people and different cultures the late rules are horrible not people are all into your business
good,"Laid back atmosphere, lacking professionalism, and extremely unethical work habits."
good,If you seek to grow and contribute amongst your peers this company isn’t the one for you. They have a very archaic method of managing people/projects and at times don’t provide you the support to feel valued.
good,Management is stale.  Once a manager gets comfortable they stay without interest in enhancing their management skills.  If a manager is not on the fast track they are stuck in their position and so is their staff.
good,Chaotic and lack of communication between management and union employees. It’s diccicult to move from union to management. They use interns for Mngmt.
good,"The company should do a better job of monitoring mid-level management, there are some bad apples that seem to survive many EEO complaints. No clear track for career advancement"
good,"Once offered growth, great benefits, options for retirement, as well as career development.  The changes in the company have taken away retirement benefits as well as fixed pension plans."
good,"A typical day of at Consolidated Edison is receiving work for the day from the supervisors. We then driving to a single or multiple locations and accomplishing the tasks at hand. The tasks can consist of inspecting a valve, or breaking and digging the street, or sidewalk to reach the gas piping in order to  repair the fault or leak. When the job is done we return to the yard to return the construction vehicle, and hand in paper work."
good,Very hard to advance. Need to know somoene in upper management to advance. Talk about a lot of changes but changes do not really get implemented.
good,Good company to start working. Offers a decent amount of training and foundation to build a career.  No motivation for folks to get additional training and very little recognition for developing academically directly connected to work functions.
good,"The CSR position here at Con Edison can be very stressful, there is a lot of micro managing, and the job itself is very demanding! It is very fast paced as far as the calls go, they come in back to back."
good,"As someone who did not have a degree in the field I was working in,I found it both interesting and rewarding to learn alot  from different coworkers. A typical day involved receiving email notification about new jobs, importing them into a database, processing information from the field and coordinating with the law department to process claims and create estimates of damages and customer claims. "
good,Daily tasks began with going into the building to clock in and sit at our desk. the IT room was divided with General IT staff and IT staff just for execs. General IT staff members do 90 percent of the foot work as the general company is larger than the executives in the building so if you land a job supporting the execs. you will have a wonderful life. other wise its above average work with a lot of very smart people and fun friendly management. we do natural disaster training/planning for power outages and major storms etc. great professional place but sometimes can be overwhelming. overall its very fast paced so you will never feel bored. i certainly liked the management staff and IT dept and the programmers. besides that it can feel like a public building on the ground floor.
good,"The key is to get into the right group within the company that will focus on individual growth and not manage the group like they are still working with nuclear power plants. On paper Con Ed is all about work-life balance and excellent culture. However, that is all up to the manager's discretion. I've heard comments such as 'Work/Life Balance is only for people with kids', 'allowing people to change roles within the two year time period promotes individualism', and 'we are really trying to avoid people from gaming the system'. It is a very scared mentality that with its rigidity squashes any creativity. On the other hand, within other groups people love Con Edison and don't experience the same rigidity and micromanagement. Also, while they do offer an excellent Tuition Aid program, be careful that they don't verbally agree over the phone that your program is covered, and then after getting into the program they go back on their word and then when you try to appeal to upper management they say things like 'why would we pay for your education when we don't know if you're going to stay here long-term?', even though the policy claims to begin as soon as you begin employment. Unfortunately, the culture certainly lacks any trust, and while it is necessary to avoid losses/fraudulent behavior etc, it creates a very unnecessarily stressful environment."
good,"I did an internship but based on that experience, my manager didn't really do much to help me learn about the practical side of accounting. Other than the people that worked there were good to me and I also keep contact with them to this day."
good,Management is terrible.  New college kids dont know much about field work.  Too many in management positions and only know how to micro manage.  Too much favoritism in company.  Hard to move around to other positions.
good,"Safety is priority due to nature of business"
good,"First you have to call the head quarters to get a route, then drive to the location in your own vehicle & wait for the con Edison truck to arrive, while you block off the street with cone."
good,"They tell you you start at low pay but make up salary with ot"
good,"Good work culture, diverse pool of people. In NYC so good location. Big company, lots of interaction between various groups and offices. Interesting experience."
good,"Con Edisons management employees should stop micromanaging their staff and exhibit tactics that will bring more production, motivation and an overall better work environment. Also being that the facilities are not the cleanest working from home should be an option for staff members with respiratory issues."
good,"Consolidated Edison is an excellent company to work for depending on the department. Advancement, while encouraged is a challenge. The Customer Service department is a very challenging and intense environment. The importance and need for utilities impacts the daily activities. Successful customer service requires patience, understanding and providing customers with available resolutions. A consistent daily challenge is faced when customers refuse to accept the customer service provided. Overtime, working side-by-side with co-workers leads to a pleasant work environment and lasting friendships grow."
good,Was given a lot of work that should have been broken up. Hardest part of the job is the people you work with and cut throat attitudes at time. Job pays for tuition.
good,"Generally good benefits, although for non-union employees, the pension program was ended some years ago.  Depending on which department you work in, your experience may vary tremendously."
good,"Check email in the morning "
good,"The Company is trying to improve its employee culture.  For example, they have expanded vacation carry-over to 10 days and you have the entire year to take it.  This is an improvement from the ""you must take all your vacation"" attitude."
good,"Upper management bounces and moves too frequently to get a real sense of departmental direction. Culture is based on hurry up and wait mentality. The hardest part is keeping the day in day out interesting. The most enjoyable part is the people, there is a lot of respect between employees at the lower levels. A lot of diversity as well."
good,"A typical day at work for me was a 6:30am and 1:30 pm meeting to briefing upper management on the progress of my assignment. I also consult with other departments on where their are in their progress. I Set up bid walks, write requisitions and process them in a data base. I also reviewed and approved invoices for payment."
good,good when working locked out do to company greed company very good at training their employees
good,Con Edison is a stable company with decent treatment of their workers. Provide their workers with a comfort level that allows people to work their for many years and create a career for themselves.
good,It is never a good thing to speak negatively about a former employer. Thanks for looking at my review!
good,Highly energetic and competitive company that focuses on accuracy and efficiency of your work and demands excellence and peer and client Plus One Service.
good,Project management. Technical meetings. Systems analyst. Review technology needs.Management fair. Enjoy the employees. Learn about cloud computing and other technologies.
good,"Con Edison, specifically IT where I worked needs to revamp it's culture. I honestly learned to deal with great people, as well as people not so great."
good,"dealing with customers, i have learned how to move safely. the hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. the most enjoyablr part is walking around sight seeing"
good,Decent company with an opportunity to grow. Coworkers are decent. Management decent. You get what you give. Approve if you like working for 25 plus ears before retirement
good,It's been great working for coned for over 3 years and counting. I have a great team. I just hope that I could be an employee instead of a contractor.
good,Company is always working on the future which makes for changes all the time which makes your work day always a challenge. They provide everything you need as far as what you need to learn about the job to tools and uniforms .
good,"Con Ed is a great place to work! It provides the necessary tools to advance your career, and your daily job requirements. The support of co-workers are unmatched compared to other companies."
good,"The engineering, procurement, and construction schedules were challenging and detailed.  The earn value system was educational and informative to understand where a project stood at a certain time."
good,"don't do it, cut throat co workers are not nice, supervisors are even worse. union is terrible and the work environment is stressful. I spent 4 long years there.."
good,Job security is the culture. If you are an engineer it's a great place to work. There are many pros and cons. The company is going through a cultural growth .
good,The atmosphere is very open which made it comfortable for communicating with colleagues and supervisors. They really want employees to learn new skills while improving their own systems.
good,"Lots of racism going on back then. Especially against the minorities.  Things like where to sit in the truck and so on.  Tough job this can be.  I got out after working there for like 11 years. I'm a minority but I did my work good and reliably.  I was no longer given the worst of the  stuff other minorities were given, because I knew how to play favorites, and do hard work as well."
good,No professional career advancement. Corporate direction involves too much vendor involvement.  Very long work hours with no compensation on the additional hours.
good,"Excellent paid internship, although an intern will have little to no responsibility the compensation is good. No reimbursement for travel/commute expenses."
good,"Awesome first job out of college. After a couple of years to move into upper management you need to know somebody. Yes, there are interviews held but manager positions are already given before the interview is even conducted. A lot of social promotion goes on in the company."
good,Its a great company for security as well as room for advancement.Management always came once a week to check in on us because i worked in a office environt and we where pretty much self suffiecent.We dealt with customers on a face to face level which varied from billing inquiries to opening and closing residential as well as business accounts.
good,"i mainly worked alone overviewing the running of the station.  Which meant troubleshooting any alarms that came up, Preparing equipment to be taken out of service or being put into service.  Sometimes working in conjunction with other working groups making sure the equipment they would work on was dengergized and properly protected.  Reviewing this via walk thru of the equipment and the handing out of proper work permits"
good,"Work not very challenging, Environment can be difficult to navigate.  Good work life balance but company is way behind standard of other NYC companies and very slow to change."
good,I learned a great deal from working at con Edison. and working overtime was the best part. Good bunch of coworkers. Management was good. the hardest part of the job was working in the ellements of weather but much welcomed for variety of work conditions.
good,"Did not agree with company practices involving employee, manager, and intern communication. Many actions and work order processes were greatly slowed down by inefficient communication."
good,To many managers are in positions because of who they know or knew and not what they know.  Positions are created for certain individuals and when time to apply for different positions for most you have to be in your current position for 24 months or longer for others they allow you not to follow that rule if the department heads wish to ignore the rules. Most departments coworkers are a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of the job is working for a place where most of the time your hard work goes unnoticed but if you forget to tie your shoes they are quick to point it out.  However it is not the worst place in the world to work for
good,work environment is pretty contained.  typical corporate structure.  great employee training.  advancement opportunities reasonable.
good,A typical day at work would be sitting at my desk. Most enjoyable part of the job was conversations with other employees.
good,"great co-workers, learned all about the natural gas system"
good,Great company if you are looking for stability and great pay.
good,"The job site was 2 hrs away and the shift was an evening shift so it wasn't ideal.   Dealing with angry customers all day, no breaks and having random calls screened and revised by supervisors was stressful."
good,Even your bathroom use is timed. Last minute notice Mandatory overtime during busy seasons. Every single thing you do is monitored. And you better not get sick or you’re getting written up
good,"There are pros and cons in working in this kind of environment.... Although I have met a lot of great people here, there are a lot more people within the company that seem to have a ""cardboard"" personality. Not very friendly in the hallways even when one makes eye contact with a smile."
good,"Every department is different. Male dominated industry. Women are still paid less than males. There is room for advancement but many obstacles to overcome, some manmade interference. Can stay with company for 20+ years. Offers health care package."
good,working at Con Edison was very rich with the knowledge that I was exposed to. My biggest problem with the company was favoritism. Management did not fairly promote or treat employees.
good,"Q&A"
good,It is always a busy day and a great place to work. Its great place to be able to work with Engineers and assist with company changes and feel part of the team.
good,Con Edison is very demanding and its very little time with your family when your required to work but you will gain a lot of knowledge and experience that you can use in any department in the company
good,"It was a good place to work.  A bit too bureaucratic at times, so part of your job was to conform to many state mandated requirements.  As a utility it was also part of the job to be available in an emergency (weather related as well) even if in the IT department.   "
good,"Con Edison is a company where you can have a career if you can assimilate to the corporate culture."
good,"Management employees are careful with Union employees.  Union employees feel that they should have equity in outcome.  Within management, it is bureaucratic but there are a number of capable and intelligent people to work with.  Within Union there are also people who are intelligent and work hard.  However, the culture is just a bit odd."
good,"working with Con Edison for almost 5 years was extremely rewarding in adapting to the corporate world on how to conduct myself like a professional and also see things through their eyes. Con Edison is a highly diverse company to work for, which made it interesting to work in. Having so many different people from different countries, religions and cultures can be invigorating because you learn something new about the country, religion, language etc."
good,overhead distribution system. Learned something new everyday. Management let the crew run the job. Hardest part of the job was hand digging for poles.
good,"It is a very structured company.  The hierarchy is very specific and your promotion through the ranks has a lot to do with who you know, so peer help can be of great advantage."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and learning how utilities operate.
good,"IF you are in union position its a great opportunity, The customer assistance management department needs to be revamped. Overall my years at the company was great. I wish I decided to go into management in another department."
good,I enjoy being a parking attendant for Con Edison. I meet alot of nice people during all times of the day. This job is very great to make some quick cash.
good,"IT was constant learning experience, also theory and application fell hand and hand with jobs skills sets. new procedures and upgrades was always available to employees."
good,"culture of safety, union job, good benefits.  Hardest part of the job was working outside and stressful working conditions.  Managemnt was different in different departments."
good,Not favorable to the employee. Company tries to pit employees against each other.
good,"If you join Con Edison avoid the Facilities Department . This is the worst department to work for, very poor leadership and no room for advancement. Overall it’s a good company"
good,"For long-term job security with ongoing training and room for growth, Con Edison is a great place to work. Technical and engineering backgrounds are beneficial."
good,"During my internship, I had 3 supervisors; all of them were really supportive. They gave me suggestion not only regarding the work, but also gave me advice about how should I go about the CPA license procedures."
good,"Got in an entry level position as a meter reader so I can advance into other positions. Was alarmed to see that the great majority of employees holding entry level positions were there 15+ years, many going to retirement. Although the position was provisional, we still had to wait 18 months before posting for another position. Employees who were there before the provisional title did not care to post out because their jobs were safe."
good,Con Edison is a great place to work and learn.  The Company offers numerous opportunities to change careers and grow.  I recommend entering the Company through the Union and move up from there.
good,The company promotes learning and training.  The company encourages people to move around and accept new positions where they have little experience.  The hours are generally early (0700-1530) to support field groups.
good,I worked as a contractor for 4 years . ConEd heavily uses contractors to control costs.. Loved my job and was well thought of but no permanent positions were offered /available .
good,"good experience.great work culture,"
good,Great place to work if you're comfortable with city life and congestion.  Room for advancement into management if you desire. competitive wages and good benefits
good,I am satisfied with the company. The job is relaxing and secure. The only problem is that I am not happy with the band level setup in the company. No room to improve......
good,"Con Edison is a good company to work for, employees are well taken care of and it's a place where you can retire from, you won't be rich but you'll be comfortable."
good,"Electrical troubling shooting is a job that requires a high degree of skill. It can be very dangerous if you are not focused. You are dealing with electric current in the range of 120 to 13,000 volts and above. When there is trouble the safety of your customers and public is in your hands. All in all it is a rewarding job when you restore or bring light or gas service back to the customers who have lost it."
good,"Good mentors, with interesting problems to solve. Learned a lot as an intern, such as how the electric grid in NYC is maintained."
good,worked in underground electric department. worked outdoors. most of coworkers were knowledgeable and helpful. the elements and coworkers with bad attitudes were the hardest parts of the job
good,The first thing I did upon the job given day was set up a safe work location following  all safety regulations. I worked in underground transmission manholes .I prepared and repaired pipes by cutting pipes. I did pipefitting and maintained transmission feeders. I repaired and prepared pipes plus much more over the 12 year period that I worked for this company. The best part of my day was the end when I knew that me and all my co-workers had a safe day with no injuries because this job could be quite dangerous at times. The hardest part of this job was definitely the summer months when the weather was hot and  I was dressed in our safety protocol cover-alls because of the stifling heat.
good,Good to work for a company that keeps the lights on in NYC. Training for a job within the company is excellent.
good,"•	Managed monthly closings for general accounting functions of PPE, cash, accounts receivables, lease accounting, accruals, payroll and consolidations for multiple legal entities"
good,"Consolidated Edison was a great experience and I gained a knowledge that will stay with me forever."
good,Customer service is not tough because for the most part the customers are nice.  A typical day at work is not easy because you are expected to be glued to your desk under all circumstances.  I learned that dealing with the general public is not easy but when you can help someone it is a great feeling.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and their micromanaging.
good,"If you start off in the field in a dangerous job, expect to earn your chops with the guys, no fun. Field work opens doors to other jobs which may turn out to be amazing. You can learn a lot here."
good,"A typical day at work would include answering an average of 80 phone calls, assist customers with billing inquiries and emergency situations. I learned many useful skills that can be utilized both in and out of the workplace. The co- workers made the work environment very pleasant and management was very helpful and a great learning tool. The hardest part of the job would have to be not being able to fully meet the customers need due to your inability to control inclement weather. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I was able to satisfy my customers needs."
good,The work is meaningful and interesting. The building itself is also beautiful inside. Some managers expect too much overtime though. The culture there isn't bad however.
good,Fun Work Place. I have utilized most of my skills here. I have good rapport with my managers and colleagues. I will recommend this place to a friend or a former colleague.
good,Good company with great fundamental policies (on paper). Many people concerning themselves with politics rather then the tasks at hand. Good benefits.
good,Job was fairly balanced can't complain it was temporary at that time full day work relaxed people fun place to work considering the small compensation
good,"co workers are great fun intelligent people. sometimes fast paced, and it does get busy in middle of summer and winter time. always overtime available at least 10 months out of the year."
good,"Benefits were great. There was room for expansion, great programs for interns. Several locations so it was easy to find placement. Company culture is a bit uptight, but that was my personal experience."
good,"Typical day in my field is overseeing contractors working on the companies infrastructure to upgrade it. I gained supervisory skills, how to input work completed for contractors payment. How to deal with irate customers, as well as some co workers. Management was great to work with, though you have those that make it hard to work with them but its typical like at any job. The hardest part was the lack of diverstiy that was represented within the company, even though they advertised it existed. Overall i enjoyed my job, working with the contractors and trying to exceed the expectations that was set forth for me."
good,"Fast paced and incredible pressure to perform."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the good people you meet.
good,"Enjoyed learning and working as a flagger, being shown how to stop or slow down the vehicles when needed. My co-workers was very nice and patient they showed me what I needed to know and how to go about it. I am a quick learner so it was a good experience. It was a very good part time job for me."
good,"As manager over the steam distribution engineering section, I had engineers and senior engineers directly reporting to me. I also provided guidance to the Union employees of the section whose titles span from Junior Designer to Senior Engineer Designer A. The section consisted of five subgroups - design, metering, maps & records, equipment engineering, and system engineering. The combination of engineers and designers working together promoted the best opportunities for a productive work environment."
good,"Con Edison is a great employer and a great company.  Working there feels historical, even if some of its ways are somewhat out-dated.  The company keeps employees even when they are not performing well.  The benefits are good."
good,The employment her is stable and have a great training facility so that you are always on the cutting edge of knowledge. They ahave great oppertunities t grow and move throughout the company.
good,"can be cut throat at times,work place drama. very impersonal environment to work in. job is limiting and restrictive. company is very sensitive on social issues which makes the work place awkward and uncomfortable at times."
good,"I am currently working for Coned for 13 years now but looking to relocate.  As a mechanic in substation the work can be challenging but for the most part it is a good job,"
good,"Great environment to work people are awesome, management have a clear vision, great collaboration  within the teams. good approach towards complex situation."
good,"Management is a good place for advancement... it allows you to give your input into current jobs being done, and future projects that need to be finished.  Your chance for advancement is excellent."
good,The Company is great and the job is very interesting and challenging at times but the mentality is sometime too old fashioned and very much old school.
good,"Working for con Ed has been a pretty good opportunity in the fact that it's a a company that carries weight and it's advanced my salary all while giving me experience but as a temp, it's scary to see coworkers sacked due to budget or dwindling examinee registration. There's virtually little training needed for this job but the training provided is quite bad. The scariest thing however, is the possibility to be let go on the spot, same day."
good,Was a great company when i first started but has changed dramatically. Depending on one's education level and wirk ethic it can be a place to gain valuable experience but comes with many challenges.
good,"The company gives its employees lots of opportunities to improve and move up, very diverse environment. Co workers do their best to make you feel comfortable and apart of the team"
good,"I worked as a salesforce develoepr. I learned a lot in from our company. Its a very good work place"
good,"Good benefits, steady salary. Over the past few years there has been some changes and most of the employees are not as satisfied with their jobs."
good,Busy all day friendly co workers best part of the day is when customers job is done.
good,"Management and bureaucratic divisions can be a little overwhelming Overall can be a wonderful experience, but you have to be willing to play politics."
good,"This position I met plenty of ineresting individuals , This gave me valuable experience in dealing with people from all walks of life."
good,I work in energy efficiency and it's interesting. There's lots of people around to help and ready to assist when needed. A skill I touched upon in a previous assignment helped in getting me this position and I'm grateful. So far so good.
good,"Great experience working at energy services and utility - challenging work with lots of incredible projects to work on across departments, would recommend."
good,"A large area to cover . a 40 hours a week work "
good,"A typical day at work depends on the environment, the weather, the place, and the customers being home or acknowledging what we are there to do at the work site. You learn to help consumers and educate them on energy efficiency. The work place is set up with a small crew along with a Team Lead(field tech II) who manages the crew and installations by crew who is there to survey and retrofit apartments in residential buildings based all over NYC. Because site change daily all over NYC, The hardest part of the job is getting to the work site using public transportation or other ways of travel. However, The best part of the job and most enjoyable part of it is satisfying customers and educating them on different things they can do to lower energy usage and be more energy efficient."
good,Customer service representatives are over the phone reps. The minute your shift starts you must be ready to get on those phones. most days is one call after the other and very few days you will have some down time of about one minute between every call. This job reaches almost every department in ConEd so you will learn a little about every department which is a good thing if you are looking to transfer to another position. over all it is a good job with a lot of opportunity to grow. its pretty much all up to you.
good,"Life at Con Edison is good. Lots of chances for advancement. I've  spent 30 years so far and have had 3 different jobs here. Hardest part for me is that this job now requires a lot of outdoor work which is not bad in the summer, but winter is feeling colder for me now, which why I am seeking greener pastures down south."
good,"Very stressful environment, not enough training prior to being given an assignment, lack of instructions and proper documentation for training purposes"
good,"A typical day would consist of entering fuse sheets that has errors on them and I would have to get in contact with the inspectors or supervisors to get the correct information. Then it turns out smoothly...sometimes."
good,"Typical work day is fast-paced and you're juggling competing priorities in a matrix environment. There is plenty of room for growth if you work towards that. The majority of management is a pleasure to work with but there are always exceptions no matter where you work. Very senior leadership lives and promotes a culture of  transparency, inclusiveness, teamwork, celebrating success, and respect for all which unfortunately does not trickle down to all departments. Workplace culture depends on the department and departmental tone at the top. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to meet some genuinely good, hardworking people who are kind, supportive, and want you to be successful in your endeavors."
good,"It's a workplace that seems like everything has been done the same way for decades.  Software that is used is outdated, but if it's not broken, there's no need to fix it.  Everything is still handled as paperwork, so there's a lot of redundant work that seems unnecessary.  Expect to see crates filled with payment information that no one is going to look at until some minor dispute comes up with a contractor over pipe installation work that was done ten years ago."
good,"Working for Con Edison was the greatest internship I could have imagined. The huge variety of departments allowed me to work with so many different kinds of people. The networking options were incredible. Having the option to go through all the steps in different projects allowed me to experience all the important parts that are played by different groups. The work environment was always so engaging, and everyone is very familiar with interns so they welcome any questions and inqueries. The only reason why I didn't want to work for them full time is because, they don't have work in my area of study. They are more of an electrical engineering company, and don't really have the kind of constriction that I'm looking for. other wise, they are a great company. A typical day at work includes, a lot of spreadsheet work, conference calls for project updates, talk with coworkers about questions or steps that must be taken from updates on the call. The hardest part of my job are doing tedious tasks that take absolutely no brain power, but they are vital parts of some projects. The most enjoyable part is when you've done all the research for a product that you know can help your department both economically and work efficiently, and then it actually gets done."
good,"I found working there educational, exciting, always interesting. I learned a lot there, but the amount of knowledge that I gained from my co-workers was exceptional. Safety was the most important part of the job and it always ended That way  . SAFETY FIRST."
good,"usually travel by foot and interact with customer on the field"
good,I worked in the Accounts Payable department during the transition to an ERP system. during the transition the unionized employees went on strike. the remaining staff worked over 70 hours a week to help implement the new system.
good,Con Edison is a great company to work for. Competitive salary and good benefits. Job security is excellent.
good,"A 24 by & shop is good and bad there are days that you need off and can not get them but there are times that are are off for days that you need to be. "
good,"They provide extensive training, paid certifications and licenses. It can be rewarding work. Must be resilient and willing to work in all conditions and various environments."
good,Great experience. Friendly coworkers and strong work-life balance for my intern position. Would recommend this company as a start for any engineering student looking to gain real world experience.
good,"It’s a great place to work and build your career, you can be very successful if you are smart and hard working especially if you are able to maintain a good relationship with upper management."
good,Overall I can’t say I have any complaints. The company is very large and has countless opportunities if you are willing to change functions and locations but growth can be limited within certain areas and departments. The only way to climb the ladder is to have broad experience. Great benefits and easy going culture.
good,Enjoyed the opportunity.  Supervised two field reps. and worked with internal and external stakeholders.  Provided great opportunity to network with middle and senior level management.
good,"Compiled data analysis and data reconciliation for monthly report on gas pipes."
good,A great company to work for. Cares about the work/life balance of its employees. Believes in a respectable salary for both union and management employees. Promotes career advancement and overall organizational growth.
good,"Pioneering , interesting engineering  projects."
good,Con Edison is a great company to work for. The work environment is great and management is very friendly. Employees are willing to help and answer technical questions.
good,I am very sociable. The job is a great work out due to all walking. The hardest part of the is never knowing what to expect when entering the basements. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers. I've learned how important safety is to the job. The management team is ok.
good,Great people. Casual atmosphere. Decent pay. Good benefits. Upward mobility encouraged.

good,Good Experience at the company for six years.  Great place to work and gain skills once you complete college.  Stress the importance of employee safety which is critical int he energy industry.
good,Con Edison started hiring engineers for upper management positions which left no advancement for lower managment personal. At 35 years old and a foreman I had twenty years before retirement and no way to move up.
good,"A customer service rep working in Coned should know how to handle stress. It is one of the hardest call center job I had worked in, but compensation is very good."
good,Good place to work if a team player.Co workers are helpful and willing to learn as they go along with yur experience or learning together.Very leanant inmanaging your ability to get things done.
good,"con edison always states safety first but never follows through with common sense,and safety isn't always priority due to expenses,and workers also tend to be primadonna's and several levels of hatred toward management,communication skills are extremely poor and their training status in far from being in good status."
good,"Depending on location , its a great work environment and majority of the staff are easy to get along with.. work day starts early a d depending on the weather can end late."
good,"Getting a job through the Union gives job security and great benefits, with the ability to advance or move into management. The work isn't always exciting however, unless you really enjoy your position - it can be repetitive and boring at times, but you can move around every two years if you'd like and apply to new positions in the company. "
good,"Con Edison is definitely a place where an individual can grow and make an impact if that is a goal. Although navigating politics is a must-have skill, the company isn't very bad and provides its employees with a fair work/life balance."
good,Affirmative action did not benefit everyone. The city is very diverse and that is the neighborhood electrically served. Being hired in the early 80's meant getting to the back of the promotion line because a weighted average is used in determining who should be promoted. Talent and hard work does not have to have the highest weight.
good,"Got into a car accident with this protector on my phone, my phone flew out of the window at 55mph and hit the highway and DID NOT BREAK. The cover cracked in the corner, but it is barely noticeable. Just went and replaced the broken cover today, and my phone was not broken underneath. For the price, it really doesn't get any better. Will buy these again because if they can hit concrete at 55mph and still not break, it is well worth it!"
good,"I handled all aspects of video from concept to execution to editing for both internal clients and external customers. Found engaging ways, in the field and studio, to communicate complicated topics visually, including employee benefits enrollment, job site safety, and executive messages."
good,good to work with your company. am relaxed and feeling happy. and the placements and requirements is better. and the work place culuture is fine .........

good,a typical day at work at work would consist of reading meters interacting with customers..
good,Con Edison was a great company to work for. Being the main electric and gas provider to the 5 boroughs made the job feel very important. There were at the very least 100 calls to be taken per day. They ranged from bill payments to regular account troubleshooting. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer who was going through a rough time that I was no able to grant an extension or any other assistance due to the amount of delinquencies on the account. On the flip side one of the most enjoyable parts were when i was able to help a needy customer keep their lights or gas services on by granting any of the many helpful ways to keep service running.
good,consolidated Edison is a great place to work pay is good and there is always room for advancement or movement. they do give lots of training and some is repetitive

good,"While the company has a good Life work life balance, there are difficulties in advancement if you are not under the right department.  The company is a regulated industry so don't expect things to move quickly to a startup, but there is good job security."
good,The best part of the job was the people. It was like a family there. Everyone helped each other and cared about each other.
good,its a very busy and fast paced work environment.
good,"The people you work with are great! but the job is mentally demanding. It can get wear you down if you down do your own self-care. Over all the pay is great for what we do, it is not a challenging job."
good,A typical day of work include reviewing data sheets and assisting supervisors in basic tasks. I've learned to improve my time management skills and to to really  push myself to make initiative decisions. The culture is safety comes first. The hardest put of the job is finding somewhere to put your sandwich in the fridge. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the amazing staff.
good,"Great for electrical, chemical or mechanical engineers. Lots of growth for opportunity and plenty of benefits. High paying salaries and quick to move up."

good,I had a great experience working here. Amazing coworkers and if you're lucky get to know the good people in management. I had to quit since I have a sick family member but they didn't want me to go. Great hours and benefits. You just have to pass all of the test and interviews!
good,"Coworkers and management are friendly"

You get to help out live customers daily through the voice chat system and assist them with their energy bill and questions. They will be monitoring your dials and calls so you need to always be working.
good,I answered phone calls related to electric co. People would call to start/stop electric service. They had questions about electric bill. I would be a problem solver by sending out a work order for an electrician tech support to their homes.
good,"I applied for con edison because i was looking for stability and a career. What i found is that the position i applied for was a temporary, provisonal position that i wasn't totally aware of during the interviewing process, i was  excited to have the opportunity but i felt as if i was wasting my time. i was looking for a position with growth and that wasn't it. The meter reading position wasn't as safe as they explained it to be i ran into rodents plenty of time all kinds of bugs, construction and unfinished locations, also vacant and super creepy buildings with perverted supers locations. I was always terrified. The reason i couldn't complete the job is due to my health with being asthmatic. The conditions that i had to work in i experienced mold, mildew, rat droppings and urine large amounts of dirt and dust, I WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE.I wasconsitently at the doctor and i was lacking air flow to my lungs."

good,Compensation Professional at one of the premier Utility companies in the country. The company empowers its workers to have good work/life balance.
good,"All the employees in the office are very friendly and helpful. It is a nice environment to work in, however sometimes it can become very boring. Typically people are assigned one role and do alot of the same work over and over. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to present your hard work to your superiors and get their feedback. There is alot bureaucracy and sometimes corruption when it comes to who gets promoted and who does not. Rules and regulations complicate jobs and make them take longer to complete."
good,Great company to work for if your a permanent employee. Helpful & friendly staff. Permanent employees have amazing benefits not to mention plenty of room for advancement.
good,"A typical day consist of 12 hour days with a team/group of 7 employees responsible for keeping electricity flowing in Manhattan.

Work with some really fantastic, loyal men and women.  Will need to ge able to follow rules, snd adjust to their culture."
good,"In all Con Edison is a great company to work for. They give so many incentives, such as tuition reimbursement. They have a facility dedicated to training their employees. Several departments within the company to aid their employees in personal and career manners. Unfortunately, like many other companies, they have a few managers who believe they own the company and treat their employees in an unfair manner with the protection of company policies. Energy Services has a corrupted manager who is known for creating hostile environments and eventually terminating the employee. Be careful of some departments, they have old school managers although the CEO promotes diversity and inclusion."
good,Good Working culture and very friendly colleagues. A great exposure to diverse fields and supportive seniors help you gain knowledge and experience about the utility operations.
good,My one crew would consist of a large cable pulling vehicle and the other vehicle would be the cable lugger on it would be the cable you would install in the underground system. All of Manhattan is a underground confine space work area. The work area above the ground is congested with traffic and people coming and going. We have to make our safety setup advanced traffic notification and have access to both locations . One for pulling and one for feeding the cable .We perform our pre entry safety checks before entering the underground manhole preinspect for safety and to locate the cable for removal or the duct for installation. My mechanics would layout the technic they would use and what the job goal was. Using point to point radios both ends would be in contact with each other. The job would proceed and they would complete the paperwork. Finally moving on to job number two and start over again. The size of the vehicle are a problem to move from job to job weight height size and blind spots. I have a second crew so I leave crew one and go to my next crew and repeat the cable performance. Check the crew for safety procedures manhole entry confine space and safe pulling operations' in the underground system. Perform safety inspections and check productivity. After a while I would repeat and return to crew one and two all day long.
good,Great environment to work in; 8am - 4:30pm schedule.
good,There are many avenues for advancement and contracted benefits. There are office and field positions. Attendance is important. You can work as a Management employee or Union.

good,"Consolidated Edison of New York is a traditional company which offer their employees benefits, growth opportunities and stability."
good,It was bad to work in the cold during fall/winter seasons. Sitting in vehicle for long period of time makes you tired and youll fall asleep if that happens you get in trouble
good,"My job that I do can get very instense and stressful at times because of the quick action we take to get power back on.Each and everyday is a learning experience that I will keep and would share with new employees We have the best management team I've ever worked with Anything you need or would like to be done,they'll make sure its taken care of.The overall environment of this company is great I would recommend anyone to work here The hardest part of my job is being able to move at a fast pace and be safe while doing so.The end results of each job that makes it well worth it is when a customer thanks you for your hard work To me,that's what makes me enjoy working here"
good,I feel very fortunate to have worked for Con Edison for 44 years. My son has been employed now at CE for 12 years. The job training & safety training is the best around.
good,"Stability and job security are essential when looking for a new job.  Conedison provides security for their employees. "
good,A typical day in the field is to check-in employees a sign work for the day. Go to the field to check on crews and review future work assignments.
good,Great place to work. Easily adaptable to new ideas and people. I really enjoy working here.
good,There is no typical day when you work on the street. Some of your co-workers you would call friend others you would prefer not to work with . Second line supervision is caught in the middle of knowing how to do a job and yet upper management continues to interfere in work rules and safe work procedures that have been developed and proven to be effective to complete the job....Inexperienced Upper management work under the premises that change even destructive change is good. The reason you will never return to the way you were working prier to the destructive change. One new department head well call him Righteous Horace was never under the ground and yet he was in charge of this department making decisions . The guy selling hot dogs on the corner would have been more helpful. The hardest part was and is the good old boy club working rules don't apply to them. That is the way it was and that is the way it is today.
good,"Can’t say much until you pass the test, to get into a great company. As all companies like to change for there future and wallets.. they do pay well and compensate when you do."
good,"Good company to work for-friendly environment. Promotes learning and promotes diversity and inclusion. Great benefits-salary, medical, dental, pension and 401k."
good,Great place to work. Culture of constant improvement.  Extremely dedicated and competent work force.  Some office politics and bureaucracy; no different than other large companies.

good,"Con Edison Company of New York fosters an environment of professionalism, collaboration and innovation. Diversity and work-life balance are a key priority to the company which is demonstrated by it's commitment to providing employees with the most comprehensive benefit package in the industry."
good,"If you are a likeable person, who works hard, you shall not have a probably moving up in this company. They emphasize on mentoring and provide many opportunities for growth through the plethora of continuing education courses they offer through their learning center. Teams work together well and look to continuously improve. Some of their core values are to ""seek and accept responsibility"" and to ""plan the work, work the plan."""
good,"great learning environment, they go over and beyond to teach you different aspects of the company."
good,"Handled any tasks the project manager assigned. Most tasks included creating documents and excel sheets of power plant upgrades, order upgraded parts from vendors, and pick up and deliver ordered parts to correct department."
good,Good company but you must be connected to someone in order to advance. Everyone has a relative who works there. They need to change the old military culture to attract and retain young talent.
good,"Great place to start your career, entry level positions can turn into careers within two years of service. A lot of promotional opportunities, via resume or exams. Union can be better."
good,i would still be there if it was not for transportation issues.it is a great company to work for. i have a ton of friends there still and management is fair and straight to business.
good,A typical day and Con Edison includes ensuring safety is number one. I have learned that everyone is important regardless of the job. Management is making moves to make it a more inclusive workplace. The hardest part of the job as a supervisor is balancing the need to get the job done against your employees personal needs.
good,"Rather than going hour by hour through every day,I focus on a few main tasks, and describe how to go through those tasks in a typical week. I focus on duties that are relevant to the position for which I'm are applying.I learn a lot form the senior man day taught me a lot.Management is great they will help you if you need it.The hardest part of the is job is setting it up. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting together and talk about it after it's all done.I enjoy working there for 40 year."
good,"For us workaholics, This is a great company to work for. If you are willing to work for it, you can get very far within the company. Compensation/Benefits are phenomenal."
good,"They was paying me good money for my age so I always loved it , also it was your choice and where you want to work so that was always good for me since I still attended school."
good,it was a very enjoyable experience with the technical staff as well as the musical artists and non-technical/regular staff in the building
good,"Con Ed was certainly demanding, but the rewards were well worth the time spent. The bottom line is that I retired at 55 with millionaire status through company stock purchase program, 401K and a pension. Though I retired, I miss the work and the people I worked with. But, the most important thing is I was able to retire at an early age, very comfortably."
good,"My first real job that I ever had. Everything was great about it. Except for managment. When your making good money, people start to believe that they diserve to be worshiped."
good,"Never a dull moment. People skills are a must. Our customer have been through some tough times since "" Sandy "" passed through. Many of us have worked 17 days plus without a day off double shifts to help people try to rebuild their lives. We don't always see eye to eye with management but we always find a way to resolve any issues. Healthy discussions. Together we get the job done safely and as efficiently as possible. My co-workers are like family. Much like family we don't agree but we watch each others back. Going home at the end of the day is our goal as well as public safety. Extremes in climate make the job difficult but that what we do. Not many people can do what we do. Con Ed still has an 80% failure rate for the OverHead. I am proud to be a Chief Lineman and to be part of an old tradition. Celebrating success is the most enjoyable part of this job.For example, on a trip to Buffalo New York we completely restored every circuit we were given by the end of the double shift. Obviously much of it was temp but the customers were able to get on with life. I take pride in what I do and I am proud of the people I have trained. They have all been successful in their careers so far."
good,"ConEdison culture is a good one. As long as you are a hard worker and come in to work on time, they will train you for customer service and customer field representative. The classrooms are challenging and open to questions. The instructors are approachable and knowledgeable. Con Edison's environment and culture SHOULD be tolerant, but I have witnessed favoritism and prejudice in SOME, not all, and they get away with it. Overall, though, it is a fair company."
good,Great work environment friendly staff positive environment to work in my supervisor was awesome she was fun and upbeat the day would go by fast I enjoy working here
good,Work was fun and easy going. I learned extensive electrical and construction work. Management was decent.  It was a safety first work place. Working in outdoor conditions in the summer and winter months was sometimes trying. Learning different aspects of the job was enjoyable
good,"Coned treats there people right. You have to find the right department to work for. Everyone I worked with was like family, you really get to know your co workers. Even the bosses are like family"
good,Best job ever and a great co. to work.they reward you for outstanding work.I was able to help customer with paying their electric bill by calling my office and making a new agreement.
good,I love to work in diverse areas such as Con Edison. It's always interesting to be able to do the job and get paid weekly. But it is also fun to change the area of expertise...
good,great company. really enjoyed working for this company. no other company that I have worked for has toped this company.
good,"Great benefits, hands on training and the people are just great! The corporate culture is relaxed while there is a major feeling of being a part of a team. The company mission statement is clear and it seems that all employees really are there to help people find jobs in their own way. Expectations and goals are high but the support is present to help all employees achieve set goals. Management wants to help their teams succeed."
good,Con Edison is a company that an individual can enter and see immediate financial progress and job advancement. I recommend anyone without a college degree to apply as they evaluate you base on your skills and not just your education.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Con Edison, there's no typical day every day was a learning experience. The management staff and my Co-workers were very friendly and knowledgeable. Hardest part of the job was getting a lot of information on different aspects of the job all at once. I cant say I enjoyed any one thing more than the next, my whole experience was great and enjoyable."
good,"I got some knowledge of how a big organization is operated. Supervisors and co-workers are nice and communicable. And there were plenty of benefits including corporation discounts. It was challenging to get assigned to do something that I never though of. Everything was so new to me, but I enjoyed a lot."
good,Assisted customers with daily account information. Worked with caseworkers at various NYC agencies with assisting customers with arrears
good,"Assist and support 10 managers."
good,"Coned employees commence their workday before most companies do, extending overtime as becomes necessary when emergencies (power outages/storms/trees downed/floods, etc.) arise. Customer service is perhaps the most highly regarded aspect of everyone's job performance. It is ultimately that dedication that contributes to negative opinions from the general public, e.g. observing sleeping employees in trucks- not realizing how many hours were spent in restoration of public services."
good,Con Ed is a very professional organization. An employee can obtain the help needed to be successful in both their career as well as their work projects.
