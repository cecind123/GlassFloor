bad,If you want to truely help people in providing great customer service & care Wal-Mart is not the company for that. They are to preoccupied with finding ways to cut help & cost.
bad,If you love your life and love to live it Walmart is not the place .. Well all depending what Walmart and with what manegment cause the one I work with was HORRIBLE.
bad,"Never staffed enough associates for the required job, Management unhelpful when needing backup. Have one CSM running the frontend at a time. Just very unorganized and chaotic, with no help from Management"
bad,"Inconsistant hours, terrible lower and upper management, chronicly understaffed so that they can over work their employees, poor training, no benefits and minimum wage."
bad,"Running the service desk check cashing ,training photo department,customer service,doing returns ,cleaning ,and putting stuff away The hardest part of my job is not being moved up in the company"
bad,IT was a job. I helped open the store on Moreno Beach Drive in Moreno Valley. that was alot of work but also alot of fun made alot of friends. But the management they they really sucked cause after i was there for a year i put in for a vacation time and they denied me so i went and took it anyways i didn't care what they said. so i was there for 2 years.I got another job oppertunity and i took it.
bad,"A typically day of work as a cashier at Walmart consists of greeting customers and ringing up their purchases at the front registers. The only thing that I could really say about this job is that I learned how difficult customer service really is to deliver. The most difficult parts of the job involve dealing with cranky, sometimes emotionally unstable customers who can be quite demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job involves interacting with coworkers who are in the same age bracket and have similar goals. This job would be unbearable if I could not interact with other college students who were working there during the same times of the day as I am."
bad,I was written up for not calling out one day while I was in the hospital despite telling the manager the day before that I was at the hospital due to diabetes complications and would be out a few days. Despite this they did not tell me I had to call everyday I was out. They do not care at all for their employees.
bad,"Wal-Mart under pays their employees. The management did no real training. The managers had disgusting attitudes everyday, very ill tempered. The way it was being run at the time was rather unprofessional to say the least. You can not take care of a family on the income you'd recieve from working minimum wage at wal-mart"
bad,"This was the 2nd time I worked for Walmart and i was paid even less. They paid the night stockers 1$ above day time hours. The work was hard, grueling and had to be done in a short amount of time, and did not care how hard they pushed"
bad,"A typical day at work is doing 10 jobs in one working for walmart. Management team sucks want help you ,but will load you up with 50 things to do in 8 hours."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the hours and heavy lifting.  The management staff was very reluctant to provide proper equipment in order for the employees to do their jobs properly and safely.
bad,"When working at Walmart they stress credit card applications because the more you get whether the person is accepted or not it adds to the employees bonuses. So you know you're in trouble when multiple managers tell you to fake credit card applications by putting in fake information to get more money towards their pockets... "
bad,"With thousands of locations, Walmart may have a very diverse set of environments for people to work at. My store was in Florida. It was disgusting, poorly maintained and badly managed."
bad,A typical day at work was like being in prison. I learned that if you a good worker management will be on you for everything if you don't do your job management treats you like gold. Management is terrible one doesn't know what the next is doing and they make up rules as they go if management doesn't like you then they will try to do everything possible to get rid of you. Work culture is very poor. The hardest part of the job was keeping your mouth shut in a situation that cooperate had already been called on you go in and its the same thing over and over and over again. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing everybody daily.
bad,"They told me about all these great benifits. Then i started working, they threaten me of my job every day even though I would finish my job to help others so, i got hurt helping the woman they were over working, I thought Walmart would fix me up but they said it was my fault.  they destroyed my life. My family an i suffered"
bad,I do not recommend working at Walmart to anyone. The pay is poor and management is horrible. Your voice is rarely heard and nothing there is consistent.
bad,"many of the employees were cut throat , back stabbing. most managers were incompetent and vindictive . no caring for the employees , will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat"
bad,"Poor judgement because they refused let me relocated to my hometown. I don't like this job very much."
bad,"To do your job as a manager plus jobs for the assistant manager when it is not your job. Under paid, always being talked down on, no one knows whats going on, your suppose to have bonus per quarter still haven't seen that. when in need for help the managers do not come to the rescue till its last minute and customers want to go off or try to physically hurt you"
bad,"Uma empresa péssima em todos os aspectos para trabalhar"
bad,I learned a lot about Walmart they don't  treat there employment like they should they work you to hard and then expert you to finished your task when they ask you to do something else but i learned a lot working for walmart i enjoyed helping the customers out everyday thats one thing i like about that but from management they was rude and loud and if you didnt come get your returns our something you would had got coach which it was crazy but i would say i learned a lot about walmart.
bad,After nine hours in the deep freeze stocking at -30°f. I was told I wasn't fast enough. And written up. This is after 6 months of breaking my back for management. Worst job ever. And my last job had me getting shot at.
bad,"When you come to work, your expected to work hard. When others didn't do want they we suppose to on their shift, it means more work for you. I would tell management and nothing was ever done to fix the problem"
bad,"When I started working there, I was happy. But, I noticed : poor and uncaring management, lies and a lack of training and I began to think differently"
bad,"The management team is horrible. No one never does what they say their going to do. My supervisor started so much mess in the department that I worked. I reported most things using chain of command. But nothing was done. Then I reported issues with home office, but nothing again was done. For the 13 years I was employed there it was not worth my time. I was over worked and under paid. And its just too much favoritism."
bad,its really a culture of keep your head down and do bare minimum. there are employees that go above and beyond each day but are not recognized for their efforts because the atmosphere is so stifling its definitely not a positive enviornment.
bad,The management was a complete DISPLEASURE to work with. They were too controlling even though they knew next to nothing about my profession. They were a waste of my time! This company has no respect for their employees/human capital.
bad,"Working for walmart was horrible. You didnt get paid overtime , anything over for had to be cut on your lunch. You had to get approved to change your schedule which management never wanted to approve. If availability is approved they still schedule you outside of it. They never approve vacations. They think your life revolves around walmart and do not care about your outside life. CSS are very lazy and do not like doing there job. There is alot of favoritism in the store. I would not recommend a soul to cherry hill walmart"
bad,"I do not believe anyone should work for this company. In my opinion they do not care about the well being of their employees. This is evidenced in the fact that hardly any hourly employees were hired at a full time level when I worked there. This allowed the company to avoid paying any insurance benefits or paid time off. When I worked there I was frequently reassigned to work in the backroom unloading trucks even though my position was that of a sales floor associate. I was not paid any more for working these much more physically intense positions either. Management did not care about if the employees were doing their work, and were apparently afraid to fire people for poor job performance. You are only going to be scheduled for 30ish hours a week, but will be expected to be available anytime. This makes it difficult to hold the second job you will need if you plan to live off the wages they pay you."
bad,garbage place to work did not enjoy myself at all would not tell anyone to get a job here they micro manage you nonstop don't care if youre sick or need to do something just make you work work work even get mad when you don't want to work overtime.
bad,"No comment as I have people I still associate with that work there, wish they could find somewhere better. Walmart has better employees, committed to doing their best, and holds each other closer through friendship than many places. I feel they band together so tightly because of the ridicule they receive..."
bad,You cannot count on the company to be there for you as they promise. The benefits you pay for will be skirted around as much as possible because they are self-insured they do not want to pay.
bad,"Not a place you would like to spend your career, they pick and choose who moves up which are people that don't work hard or really care. They do things on their own time and they don't care about their associates!"
bad,It was a good company to work for lots of learning opportunities. Finding a supervisor who could become a mentor is the hardest part of the job. Somedays you can`t seem to get any one task done.
bad,"Worked there for 3 and a half hrs, started at $9 and ended at $10.50. Not good if you have family. Wal-Mart makes it very difficult to advance quickly."
bad,"Nothing is good enough and the managers don't encourage, only critisize. They don't care much about personal troubles and not very well run in all. I am looking for something much more team oriented and non-profit."
bad,"Muy mal ambiente de trabajo! No respetan tus horarios, Sales a comer tardisimo, No pagan lo que es!"
bad,"Does not care for employees. They will work around your schedule but you will suffer severely financially. They do not accept Doctors notes, They will not help you with more hours, and are very unprofessional and unsympathetic."
bad,Management does not care about the associates.  Typical work day is mundane. The way things were done was not efficient. Most employees were grumpy. Hardest part of the job was the work place. I loved the customers.
bad,Most of the management was rude. When you tell a customer something the management will over ride whatever you say just to make the customer happy. Which makes me look like the bad guy. Hard to get advancement because the management has their favoritism. They hire the person they like not the one that is more qualified for the job.
bad,"Not the worse place to work, but the truth is, the management only cares about your being there.  If you want to be on your feet everyday, this might be the place for you."
bad,Absolutely terrible place to work if you are not in with the In Crowd management they will find a way to get rid of you and they'll fire you for whatever reason even if it's false then they'll say oh you can get your job back but why would you want to work for someone who just kind of gets rid of you for no real reason they expect a lot from one person even though people from earlier shifts  will do nothing all day and not get in trouble and you come in to do your job and you got to do their job and yours and then you get in trouble if yours isn't done
bad,"Worked for Walmart for two years in upper management,moved from another province and now have no job due to restructuring,stay away they ruin peoples lives.THe senior management are very sneaky and the store managers are terrible.They will be never number one in the supermarket business,no business sense"
bad,I have worked for Walmart for 8 years. In the beginning it was a great place to work. Good pay with lots of perks and benefits. Slowly over the years all the perks have disappeared and the pay rate has slowed dramatically. I make the same per hour that a new hire would coming in and that's minimum wage. Only reason I stay with this company is because I'm getting older and work is hard to find. Definitely do not recommend employment with them.
bad,There is no room for growth when you are upfront and honest. When you know policy and aren't afraid to exercise your right to those policies Management would retaliate against you.
bad,it is hard  work and they always want more out of you ever day. You can not work at your own past it is always harry killing yourself for these people who treat you like your a slavery.
bad,"You are hired and trained to do a certain job, but you are rarely doing that job.  Employees are expected to fill in wherever they see fit at any given time, even if you aren't physically capable of doing the task at hand.  "
bad,A typical day for me consisted of being outside for 8 hours whether it's 100 degrees or a blizzard. Towards the end we were no longer allowed to keep water with us. Management seemed like they wanted you to fail.
bad,"funciones: reclutamiento y seleccion de personal"
bad,This was the worst place I worked. Managers walked over the the employees. Some would hide complaints from corporate. Lots of favoritism. Get ready for feeling gross after work and good bye life.
bad,"Being a department manager I was stressed so much my health was affected. Making the company let me go, because my doctor and hospital visits were not excused. I felt this was unlawful. Being a fortune 500 company all employed do not matter and are expendable. I feel the company should be required to change policies by law."
bad,"Walmart is a self interested company "
bad,"Between the biased and favoritism from the management all the way down to the employees that didn't want to be there. Its your typical ""act happy or we will fire you"" kind of place. I could go on and on but i think I have said enough."
bad,Managements favorite thing was to harass employees and wrongfully terminate them for things they weren't guilty of. Then would let people go without a word or reasoning.
bad,Walmart is a typical non-union place of employment. You must document everything needed to provide support for yourself in order to remain employed. Turnover rate is unbelievable.
bad,Be prepared to never move up unless you kiss the right managers butt. Don't be to good at your job or they'll never want you to leave it. There is no loyalty there for long term employees.
bad,Wal-mart is terrible to work for.  The Wal-Mart in Palatka florida is one of the worst wal--mart I have ever worked for.  They are mean and they have no respect for you or your family life.
bad,"The atmosphere was awful to work in. The coworkers were unpleasant, the managers were overbearing to the point that my shifts were stressful, I was written up twice for not asking for credit cards when I was, and I was never let out on time. I could never get hours scheduled but was expected to pick up others shifts frequently. The communication was almost nonexistent and I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone. Not even a good first job choice."
bad,Poor management with no communication even between various shift managers and store manager is constantly taking vacations and pushing out anyone they don't like.
bad,"While working at Walmart I was treated with less respect than I have ever received anywhere I've worked. Not to mention the flippant, inconsistent and disregarding attitudes of most salaried members of management. No one at my store knew what the other person was doing, nor was the store manager a good person. My store manager picked out people to pick on out of no where, and no one else cared. I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone."
bad,My friend got fired for buying a discounted item. Im most likely getting fired because I had back spasms and couldn't move to go to work. They took me off the schedule before my leave of absence was approved or denied.
bad,"Terrible management, poor employee recognition, and no time off. Designated location of work was unorganized or made unfit to work in. Requested time off would also be ignored."
bad,"I think Walmart needs to reconsider their ""No Exceptions"" point system.  Things happen in life that can't be helped and are beyond your control that you must miss work. This 9 points and your fired rule in unrealistic and should be abolished."
bad,I worked there for 18 years.  I enjoyed my job.  Managers were ok most of the time.  They needed to all be on the same page at the same time.  Recognition for a job well done was rarely noted but have an off day and was told to everyone in the store.
bad,I worked there for almost a year. I never got a raise. The pay was not enough to live on. 8.95/hour is nothing these days. It was only 32 hours a week when I was available full time. They said they hired within but hired 2 brand new people to be full time over the employees that were up for full time already. I was one of them.
bad,Compare to them now is totally different. The people's that run the store that I work in don't know how they got they. I just go and do my best. Suck.
bad,"Management repeatedly started drama as well as condoned bad behavior. Good pay for what you're required, but the overall mental strain makes it completely undesirable."
bad,I worked very hard for this company. I mean it was like a boot camp. We were not told how much work it really was. They basically hired any many young healthy people they could to re do their store. It was a huge job and they made you work very fast and very hard. They cut people constantly. You don't need an aerobics instructor with this job. I went home after my shift exhausted every time. Sometimes it was fun but not really. They didn't want you to talk and the work was heavy. I did make it through the re do and got hired as a night stocking person. It was just as much work. 5 people to do the stock for the whole grocery dept on most days. That's including freezers and dairy. Huge over stuffed pallets. I like the challenge of hard work so it was something I could do but it was pushing it.Christmas at Walmart is a huge deal and very taxing on the staff beyond the already taxed staff. Then they decided for whatever reason to get rid of us one by one after Christmas was over.  Even people I know who were good workers. And they weren't nice about it either. I saw several people get into words with the manger and some left crying. It was a very tense environment. I would recommend the Marines before Walmart. I hate to put a job job down like I am disgruntled but this job was really awful.
bad,"got picked on a lot no one is treated equal, i don't feel safe going to work, even with a doctors note they wont listen. they say one thing and do another. they tell you your family comes first but they are NOT a family friendly employer."
bad,Management will not help you out on available shifts unless you change your availability and of coarse you end up with less than your 40 hours. You get discouraged.
bad,"A typical day would be full of stress, Walmart allowed belligerent customers to verbally insult employees and or physically assault employees or management.  I learned that I never wanted to be treated like that again in my life.  Management was under educated and poor work ethics.   Culture was poor.  The hardest part was too much work, heavy lifting, not enough pay, and not enough hours on schedule.  the most enjoyable part was leaving the job."
bad,"I have nothing nice to say so it's just better left unsaid. The worst company ever to work for.They will stab you in the back every chance they get, specially the department managers"
bad,"Wal-Mart may have paid well but they don't care about their employees. They only see dollar signs. If you were hurt, 4hey didn't care. If you were sick, you still were punished."
bad,Wal-Mart is a large corporation which treats their employees like disposable razors.  Use them up and throw them away.  I worked lots of hours before Christmas and was cut to part time three days after Christmas.
bad,"I am looking for another job, no profi, no coaching time, not organized, no sesonsibility for anyone, no culture, no ineresting about any others feeling, life, no greatings back from each other, I dont care behaving, low salary, incompetent management, sliw problemsolving or no problem solving, etc"
bad,"Walmart seems like a good place to work, it isn't bad lots of favortisim and treated with disrespect, , lots of backstabbing and lying from management,"
bad,"Walmart structure is designed to stress the lower rank employees and get the most out of employees, however employees do not get treated fairly. They are yell and given threats of getting fired almost everyday even when you work hard."
bad,"When I first started, I enjoyed working there but a year after people started going above their heads. They didn't want to work with me and started taking people from the department I worked."
bad,I hope I never have to work at walmart on highway 18 again. it was the worst job I've ever had. The management sucks and they are quite inconsiderate.
bad,"if you show any sign of competence at your job your workload will soon be bigger than any of your coworkers. 90% of your coworkers are idiots and do not have a good work ethic. Most managers seem lost at their job and don't know answer to basic questions that you would think a manager should know. To close this out the scheduling sucks, didn't have two days off in a row for over six months."
bad,"Poor culture; Unstable job environment due to competition from Amazon; Stressful; lots of politics; lots of friction with eCom team in San Jose, CA; would not recommend anyone to join the company;"
bad,They fired me for an injury that was someone else's fault. They don't help you out with anything. They go through employees super quickly. Managers don't want to compensate their employees who need it
bad,"Will never go back. Manager in produce continued to sexually harass me, management and personal would not do anything in my defense. I quit and never went back... But to.get my check"
bad,I worked for the company for 20 years total. Was the most stressful period of my life. My family sees a huge change in me since I'm out of there. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
bad,"Working at this location is the worst place to work. I have learned that some of the managers have no clue of how to manage. The workplace is not fun at all, everyone has an attitude. The job overall is easy"
bad,"everything you have heard about Walmart is true!  Overworked, underpaid, favoritism, if you have a brain in your head you are penalized for using it. No appreciation at all"
bad,Management was horrible. 2 different managers would tell you to do 2 different things. they didnt help me out when i had mersa . they were extremely rude.
bad,They hired me on and expected me to throw 70 cases an hour with no training what so ever. I mentioned this to management several times but all they did was coach me and tell me that I wasn't doing my job right. I asked why I hadn't been given the training that they said they would give me and they replied that they had all ready trained me. The simply cursed at me and told me to work harder.
bad,I enjoyed working at Walmart because the team made it very fun while also being productive. I was able to learn from my customers and also teach also.
bad,No work life balance. Public humiliation for mistakes. Terrible culture. Expected to work insane hours and clean up others messes all hours of the night. Plan to work 70 to 75 hours a week without overtime or meal breaks. No relocation as your store will NOT let you leave to take a promotion even after it is offered. High turn over and lots of call outs of your staff as everyone feels the stress.
bad,Management is terrible. There is 0 communication between management so associates have a difficult time providing customers with accurate answers to questions. Depending on the day would depend on what policy was followed.
bad,walmart management can accuse its employees of.any thing and you are disciplined for it.they have take away paid holidays and vaction time has been reduced
bad,The company dont care about their employees more than half receive government assistants and its the largest retailer in the US you have to work every holiday or be threaten to get fired
bad,Being at walmart for 11 years what i learned is how to do cost inventory and to order products what is needed and learned how to work as a team got a lot of customer service experience lots of Pallet jack experince too.
bad,"Good place for a student to get a job. I wouldnt recommend it for a career, the minute your not in the managers click, your a target. Alot of two faced managers, ex. if you get in trouble the managers are telling others about it in the breakroom."
bad,walmart is horrible they are a multi billion dollar company and still under pay thier employees.they work you to death and cut your all your over time hours just so they wont have to pay for benifits
bad,"Had a terrible employment experience with this company."
bad,"The walmart I work at (norwalk) is absolutely terrible!! Terrible managers that choose favorites, won't work with you if you have a mental/ physical illness, and not to mention they pick and pick at certain employees until they run them out of there!! They treat us like dirt! They let the customers treat their employees like dirt and get away with it cause ""we want to make everyone happy and the customer comes before you"" Also worthy of knowing is they refuse to work with you on your schedule no matter what the situation. If you can't handle certain hours because of illnesses. Well too bad for you the customer comes first!! That's why they hired you!! To be a work horse they can use and abuse!! Please, please, PLEASE  if you can avoid working at this establishment I would. This ""family oriented and employee friendly company"" is a big fat joke, they are the worst. Just as long as they get your money. They could care less."
bad,"Although Wal-Mart makes it seem like they only hire the best and they love promoting from within, it's just a lot of talk that sounds good and looks good on paper. They do not respect even the hardest working employees and they reprimand you if you have to go to the doctor or if you have to take a Leave of Absence for an unexpected problem. They favor a lot of their people and make the one's they don't like do all of the work. They won't train their people or try to cultivate leaders. They'll send you to a ""training academy"" that basically restates all of the messages they divulge throughout the day. None of the managers actually care about their associates and they'll blame anyone for anything if it means keeping their jobs. They allow a lot of bad managers to work for their store and they love retaliating against you if you point out any major flaws with the business."
bad,I don't recommend this job for anyone the benefits aren't great the pay is not enough to meet anyone's standards you work too much with not enough pay
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the training videos, everything else was poor. Managers were constantly unprepared, jobs were never done. Very unorganized."
bad,A job that basically does not understand that when you put a person to choose between job and family. Job will lose! How awful is it to work for a company that DOES NOT accept doctor or medical excuses. Store Manage mixes personal issues with a employee with business which is a major NO NO!
bad,"DVD movies playing in break room Entirely too much office politics. In addition, there tends to be a lot of  misconduct and inte-roffice dating going on. Would recommend it for people who can't find another job."
bad,"Customers can be hard to work for, co-workers gossip and that can uneasy work area, and managers that can improve their sense of time management.. When working outside of closer, the hours one works can be rather chaotic with other departments seeking assistance."
bad,"The managers don't defend their people from the public."
bad,I would not recommend anybody to work there the people are not professional and very over whelming! The management is very rude and they treat you like you do not matter!
bad,"Stress all day long , poor management no school at all and they can be managers, co managers up to store manager with nothing in their heads .No respect ✊ they treat hourly associate like nothing but ""sleeves""not fear I feel sorry for who still working for Walmart."
bad,it was ok could have been better. they needed to train the managers better so they would be less stressed. i liked some of the work but didnt like the pay thought it could have been more
bad,"I have worked for the company for three years, almost four. Management was awful(still is). Only way you get anywhere is if you sleep with management."
bad,I enjoyed working here mainly because every single customer that I've helped was very impressed by my efficiency to make sure their time at the register was very short.
bad,I would come in every day and get to work in my department. It was hard having over 10 different managers telling you something different ever ten minutes then watching you struggle because of lack of people and seeing them stand around talking all day.
bad,Poor management want you to bust your hump while making minimum wage I worked at jobs that required lots of work but was payed decent t for it I'm a hard worker but I felt so used and unappreciated
bad,"Mediocre place to work, must have open availability so you don't really get to have a normal life since you are required to work weekends and holidays."
bad,Walmart doesn't treat their workers right. Advancement was never depended on experience. You can get promoted simple because no one else wants that position or because of who you know. They hire unprofessional people as employees. Mangers don't listen when you have problems in the store. I will never work for them again.
bad,"Walmart pays its employees high wages, but schedules low hours."
bad,Working at Wal-Mart I realized that majority of the time promotions and acknowledgment has nothing to do with your abilities or skills it has a lot to do with who you know.
bad,"Not a good place to work....Do not feel valued. With a ""Management"" position paid $0.40 more than current minimum wage. Sometimes working 12-13 hour shift because upper managements poor scheduling. Upper management will never take responsibility for lack of staffing. And when CSM arent responding to cashier action codes fast enough or validating the many things CSM are required to validate its because the CSM is on a cash register for 90% of their shift. ITS A JOKE"
bad,I worked 3rd shift in stock . Pay sucked and they broke a dr. Note which cause me to quick . Mangers ride people who does there job by the book .they wanted us to force stuff out . But that is how company lose money by pulling .
bad,"I was an overnight stocker and the work was very hard, especially when you are as small as me. The management would give us a time limit to be done, yet i would be the only person putting up the entire department."
bad,"Afgter working for this company for 3 years I decided to leave bacause when I returned to school for a medical and not a business program I was told theat they would not change my schedule to help with time to get to my classes, butr if it was going to be a benifit to the company then they would do what they could to help me"
bad,walmart well chew you up and spit you out. they know there are a million other people out there looking for a job and if you cant do what they want they will replace you in a heart beat. i started as a cashier and didnt have too many problems with management. but they moved  me to stocking because we closed at night and i have a back injury and they would constantly berate me for not being able to throw as much freight as every one else.
bad,walmart does not pay the employees enough the amount of work that is required in the work day. the deli is crazy and unorganized. the absense policy is not fair and no matter the reason a day off even if put in months in advance is a fight to get
bad,This company provided no experience besides learning to do everyone elses jobs that were to lazy to finish and or start. Horrible management and severely lacking in moral.
bad,This company pushes you to the limit. Very physical demanding job. They do not accomidate for family emergencies. They are very strict with rules and policies.
bad,"It's an extremely fast paced, hard working environment. However because most people who work here hate it, they show very little effort and have a screw it attitude, including management. They place systems that nobody really follows"
bad,"Try and find someone to get my hand held MC 40  to perform my daily tasks. "
bad,"I loved my job, but after a while i learned its crazy in walmart . Always off breaks are off your lunch is off. They forget about up to 3 to 4 hours if it gets to busy. Ingore your lights becuase they have attitude . Walmart was a dream gone bad"
bad,"I clean restroom, sweep and mop floors, remove empty boxes. Other then that I have to do other people jobs, and I have to beg management to approve my vacation time."
bad,"Where to begin?"
bad,"Managers dont help you with anything. You can go to them with a serious problem, and they tell you to suck it up, and go back to doing your job because they don't care about it. Until you get corporate involved."
bad,"Walmart has the chance to make a lasting impression, however chooses to over work, and berate their associates. When life happens, they will not work with you, and instead force you to abide by there views or have you terminated."
bad,"Walmart isn't what it used to be. Back when i first started working there they seemed to actually somewhat care about the employees. They gave generous bonuses every quarter, a decent performance based raise every year and were very understanding of any needs or problems that occur in a employee's life. This has changed drastically with in the past year and a half or so. First off they promised to increase wages for all employees, even made a big deal of it on the news. At the time I was making around $10.05 a hour, I started out at $7.50. I earned that pay after years of performance based raises. Of course when I heard of the increase in wages i got excited, till they went into effect. At first they only increased the starting pay for new hires and bumped that up drastically. To my dismay I learned that the new hires were making MORE than me at $10.20. They keep promising to give the more senior employees raises later on in the year. When they finally decided to do so, months after the initial increase, i was shocked once again to find that they were only increasing my wage to meet the new hire increase. So yes, the new hires are making just as much as me now. It seems Walmart couldn't care less about their more senior employees. "
bad,"motivation is usually gone in two weeks, no desire to help customers or fellow employees, lack of respect for management, poor food service commitment (did not follow FIFO procedures, or proper sanitation procedures)"
bad,"managers were inflexible with hours, constantly changing my shifts and cutting hours. wanting me to provide full availability but they'd only give out minimum 12 hours a week.  Managers rarely care about any associate problems. Was treated like a number not a person. No room for growth, hard to book days off. Id say half the customers were rude or crazy, very unpleasing to deal with. The videos on youtube called ""people dressed weird at walmart"" are true... you see things.."
bad,The job was a decent pay but the management should be fired and new people be put in their place. I am 17 years of age and was treated like I an unintelligent delinquent with no class.
bad,"Get hired in as one role, but they have you do jobs above your paygrade without compensation and will cut your hours to keep your payroll low.  Having a cashier go out at 4am in the morning, alone...As a young female this was wrong.  It's dark, the parking lot is not well lit, and the cameras fail to catch anything that happens in the parking lot.  Cart associate was the lowest paygrade at the time, and they would have cashiers work as front end supervisors without compensating them for a management position."
bad,"management was rude, we needed leaders not dictators. I am a single mother of a child who was very sick in the first 2 years of her life and they wouldn't had no cares"
bad,Walmart no longer cares about their employees as in the days of Sam Walton. Older employees are given less hours and high paid employees are let go for reasons the company comes up with.
bad,"I thoroughly hated working at walmart , I mean wages were okay but management were terrible , extremely rude , inconsiderate human beings . Co - workers were also a handful to deal with ."
bad,Christmas is the only holiday off. Don't recommend for students or parents of young children. Majority of their customers are rude. Not enough resources or equipment for associates to complete tasks
bad,Es una empresa en donde casi no se tiene calidad de vida y en ocasiones no respetan políticas
bad,Not bad for a summer job. Terrible for a career job. Management doesnt care and they will throw you under the bus. Pay isnt enough for what you have to deal with.
bad,"Very low pay, unprofessional store manager, otherwise fine. Met/worked with some really wonderful people (coworkers). Difficult trying to make it financially with the $8.40hr pay."
bad,"Its not the same as it used to be. A phrase spoken by every remaining ""old head"" left in the company. The benefits are disappearing and the pays are stagnant against inflation prices."
bad,Could be a great place to wotk but managment just cant seem to hold on to enough people to relieve the stress on others..minimal room for advancement and most like to play favorites
bad,"a typical day at work was busy, always had something to do for the most part. the management was terrible. They didn't have a lot of respect for the associates. All in all the place was alright but definitely wouldn't recommend."
bad,"They claim to care about you and be a ""family"" business but that is not nearly the case. You have no free time its either Walmart or Walmart. Maybe things got better ? Who's to tell..."
bad,"There is culture of favoritism,  Your work ethics mean nothing.  The company is becoming more stringent about salary increases and absences. Employee's actually save their sick time (now PTO) to cover mandatory hour reductions in January thru March.  The current raise in salary came with a reduction of hours. Management is unrealistic about the time required to complete any tasks assigned. Employee knowledge about product or product placement is not encouraged or even required until an employee becomes a manager."
bad,"I was warned that Wal-Mart tends to hire people for season, make them think it's not temporary, then fire everyone a few months later. I didn't take it too much into consideration until I saw it happening myself."
bad,Walmart Suck!. It's for people with no ambition work. Management is terrible. If you buck the status quo you will get no where in the company.........
bad,"i was an over night stock crew member. and being brand new i was expected to not only keep up with the veterans, who have been doing the job for years, but to surpass them. i was let go because i was misinformed during training."
bad,Stocking shelves helping customers and constantly getting told that work isn't getting done fast enough. I learned how not to treat people by most of managements example and the hardest part of the day is clocking in for work. Most enjoyable part of the day was leaving that place.
bad,I worked here for years and barely made any raises no matter how hard I tried to get ahead. The management were all buddy buddy and did as little work as possible while putting as much work on the individual. I was expected to cover areas so large that normally 4 people worked that same area just to cut man hours so that management could get their bonuses while working us to the bone. Don't work here unless you absolutely need a job.
bad,"poca atención al empleado, el trato de los jefes hacia los empleado era pesimo"
bad,Necesitan checar más al personal y enfocarse que sea un mejor ambiente de trabajo.
bad,Management did not care about their teammates  and did not communicate information in a timely manner. Would try to  push them beyond the capabilities
bad,Terrible management with no appreciation of the associates. Although there are decent benefits the compensation is not great. Good job for anyone just trying to hold out for a better opportunity.
bad,"poor management they truly don't care about people's personal lives...all they want you to do is work and the pay wasn't even worth it...the work environment there was not healthy at all, no team work and stuck up store manager!"
bad,"Absolute worst company I've ever worked for. Every associate is ""just a number"". I've worked for the D.C. For 9 years. They have taken away every benefit that I have worked for. We continuously fall short of our incentive, longer tenured associates were guaranteed a $200 bonus every quarter to compensate for that. Now that is gone. We were recently forced to to work 3-12 hour shifts instead of 4-10's, so our hours are cut to 36 a week instead of 40 with zero premium change. So we're asked to work longer, harder hours for less pay. The company has spiraled out of control the last 4-5 years. I've got way too much to offer to continue at this unappreciative company."
bad,Walmart corporation is very greedy and do not know how to treat there employees they don't take doctors notes so even if you are on the brink of death u have to come in or risk getting points which could lead to your termination .
bad,"Day shift allowed to do nothing majority of the day, night shift picks up all the slack and gets the recoil if they cant finish it. Overnights was recently cut in half and sometimes given more work."
bad,"Being an older person, I feel they try to get you to quit. Unrealistic schedules and breaks. Goals that are impossible to reach. Un trained management. Can't be trusted with information given to management in confidential meetings."
bad,"They have mandatory 45 hour weeks, attendance policy is unrealistic and they fire people unethically. Pay is good for what I do but overall, most people here are looking for a new job with another company."
bad,"Unfortunately my experience with working with Walmart was not a pleasant one at all, which is unfortunate given that I was hoping that it would have gone more smoothly. Very hectic work environment to say the least"
bad,a lot of work to do daily not a lot of joking around more of a serious atmosphere very hard working though I like the fact of being around all the different foods
bad,"Empresa com uma boa estrutura, deixando a desejar na gestão e planejamento. Empresa poderia ser de grande exemplo pela sua grandeza porém promove pessoas totalmente descapacitadas para tais cargos. Ao meu ver trabalho temporário para quem está desempregado."
bad,"A typical day at work is having 5 to 30 hours of freight to put on shelves. One night would be putting up freight another night on registers another would be working serving customers in the electronics section. Some nights would work in all 3 areas."
bad,"This job was fun in the beginning. Then as time passed and things began to change in the company. The work loads are not acceptable. One employee is expected to do the work load of 3- 6 employees. They do not help nor work with people who have been injured. The hours are not worth it. They swindle the employee, meaning they say you are full time but in actual your not. You will be scheduled 36 hours. If you are scheduled an 8 hour shift you get two 15min paid breaks and an hour lunch unpaid. So clearly you are not full time. They will also cut your hours and tell you to come in on your days off if you want your hours.  I do not recommend this company to anyone. The"
bad,If you're wanting job where hard to move around in the company and they want you to do two & three times as much work for no raises then this the job for you.
bad,"Management would continuously schedule me at 4 am while my availability was set to 6 am. I told them I could not work at that time, however they then changed my schedule for the following week so I would have split days off and everyday during the week was at 4 am."
bad,I would work an do what ever they needed done that day. the fun part of the job is when everybody let you alone to do your job. the management team was all about them selves an they gave up on their associates. unless you was their favorite
bad,They kept changing my schedule on me as in saying I had a day off on m schedule and then calling me telling me I have work that day but I had already made plans for my days off. All in all I would no recommend working at Walmart to anybody.
bad,Gostava mt de trabalhar na empresa mas o que não era bom era que gerenciavá... Trabanhava como operadora de caixa... Mas sempre que precisava ficava atuando como fiscal mas nunca tive oportunidade no cargo...
bad,"Favoritism is common, work is very physically demanding and not rewarding. Deadlines are steep and everyone must rush to meet them while picking up the slack of others. Very hard to advance to a better position if you are not a favorite."
bad,Management doesn't care about you. There is no room for advancement. Atmosphere is a bummer. That is all there is to say about this company but there is a 150 letter minimum to review it.
bad,"terrible work atmosphere, management not consistent with directives, long hours, constant firing line. no staff. usually a chinese fire drill. just a bad experience"
bad,"Working at Wal Mart can be a challenging and depressing experience."
bad,"Hired to work in PhotoLab.  Often only employee on duty required to cover photo, electronics, Toys, shoes, infants, automotive and hardware.  Never enough staff to cover all the departments.  Complaining continuous in lunch room, not a encouraging work environment.  Trying to do a good job is not promoted when unable to take regular breaks.  Cannot give the proper customer service I was used to giving and was demanded in other employment experience, because didn't have enough time to help when covering all the departments.    Worst place I have ever worked in 30 years,"
bad,"The programs you use on the computer to do your job are not user friendly or in any way intuitive at all.  The processes you will have to go through in order to do anything other than give away money to smooth over a problem, which you are discouraged from doing, seem to be set up to be as convoluted as possible."
bad,"Nothing much else to say, reported a manager for harrassment and later that week was fired on my day off with no notification."
bad,Management suck they do not know how to talk to people they do not listen then when u are not there no more its hard to Get  paper work from them they just say kiss there butt they need bring kmart back and let walmart go away
bad,"Wal-mart has a habit of paying someone far less than they are worth, regarding Experience. You could have 10 years experience in Retail, and they would pay you $9.00 an hour. "
bad,"Walmart in the past was a great place to work,however I now have mixed emotions about the company. I have been with the company for 20 years and now my job is being eliminated. Feeling used and unappreciated. I  was given 90 day to find another position in the company or be terminated."
bad,"I've worked here for four years and I can't wait to get out. It gets worse every year. If you aren't a favorite you don't move up, your management won't even know your name. I spent 2 years begging to go to dayshift from third, I only got to go to days because they know I'm moving in June. I'm worked like a dog and treated poorly, while others get everything they could ever ask for without lifting a finger because they suck up. Most of my coworkers would throw anyone under the bus for the smallest thing just to get ahead. I work with people aging 30-60 who act like they're in high school, they love to gossip and start drama if you if you seem like a ""threat"" to them. I wouldn't suggest working here to anyone unless you can come in as management. I make the exact same amount of money as a new hire, they screw over their long time employees to get rid of those they've given full-time to."
bad,Overnight shift is the hardest part of the job. I learned more friendly communication with customer based on their personal needs when they are seek specific things.
bad,I usually helped customers and made sales. I learned a lot about electronics. Management helped me with trying to get my full potential out of me. The work place was very laid back and not too much pressure. The schedule was always different.
bad,"Good starting salary, but not many advancement opportunities. Employees make simple processes complicated due in part to lack of training."
bad,I loved working with customers and talking to them working with money I didn't like the way they ran the front for cashiers they didn't give enough hours and if they wanted us to stay late they wouldn't ask they would tell us
bad,Was not a very employee friendly environment gave me a hard time with time off when grandmother passed away. Which made it impossible to attend all the funeral arrangements due to grandmother being an organ donor postponing the service
bad,"Not a lot I can say. I learned a lot about how to deal with people as someone who was very shy,  but aside from that, the stress was beyond overwhelming. Walking out of that job was the best choice I ever made."
bad,The store is not very employee friendly toward people that are challenged and they are mean toward people who need help with the registers or the customers needing help finding things.
bad,Horrible people unfronfessional manegment disrespectful coworks the enviroment was horrible and i never felt comfrontble  at work also my hours were always being cut to 4 or 5 hours a day
bad,"The hours are random never really set, the management and coworkers are not nice to me or each other. They work you very hard for not enough pay. Not respectful"
bad,"In your first 6 months of working at Walmart, you have 4 points before you are terminated. They refuse to accept doctors notes unless you are terminally ill, so if you get sick and miss work, you receive a point. You do not get full time until you get to six months. You have to be there for a few years before you are allowed to advance to a higher position. I highly suggest not working for walmart."
bad,"Very badly managed at the store level.  WalMart as a corporation runs a tight ship.  Very admirable.  However, at the individual stores, management is rotated frequently.  Periodically, the experience with hours and work requirements changes based on the ego, personality and education level of the 'latest' manager.  Often decisions are made because 'they can' make them without concern of how WalMart, or the employee,  is affected"
bad,You have the option to gain more hours by adding it through the app if someone calls in sick but the place I worked at is firing people they do not like by coming up with lies.
bad,"cannot get ahead in life working at this place would not advise anyone to work here. Management is terrible, the whole job is terrible."
bad,A day at work im doing stocking or im unloading the truck or assisting customers helping them find every things to they needs.
bad,People that you work with are nice.  There is no communication between associate and management.  Rate of pay is far below what is expected.  Benefits are a joke.
bad,"They  work you change your shift without telling you 12 years as a manager was enough"
bad,Loved it when the store just opened but then it got really bad. Management was not all on the same page and made it very difficult for all other employees.
bad,"Working standing on your feet constantly is bad enough, but often not getting breaks and lunches on time. Sometimes even being told that you already took you break or lunch when in actuality you had not taken either."
bad,"This store has a bad habit of ""watching"" employees on security cameras, and issuing ""coachings"" for an employee not being where they should be at any given time, no matter what that employee was doing outside that area, whether helping customers or using a restroom. Also, they apply their ""standards"" preferentially to employees they hired over employees who transfer in from other stores."
bad,I was happy to at least be able to say that I had a job but it was hard working in such a negative environment.  Most of the staff was unhappy and rude.
bad,"For the most part, the staff within the department was easy to get along with. Customers were friendly for the most part and completing job tasks on a day to day basis were self-challenging and wanting to be better."
bad,A typical day at work will consist of a lot of work that never seems to have a finish so an employee will always be busy yet running behind I have learned to have a lot of patience and not take anything personal Management seem to struggle just as hard as the little man but take it out on the little man Co-workers are great They seem to understand that they are all in the same boat The hardest part of the job is to not take anything personal and keep the attitude and mouth in check and the most enjoyable part of the job is going home
bad,"dont work here"
bad,"The company has a very high turnover rate. Most of the people were nice, but the management is a bit to be desired. A typical day wasn't bad. It went y quickly when I did work there. I didn't really learned anything when I was there, at least nothing that I didn't already know."
bad,"Walmart is so scared of lawsuits, this will keep Asset Protection from doing their job. Shoplifters seem to have all the rights at Walmart. Asset Protection Associate must have a witness in order to stop a shoplifter, the sales associates are told to not get involved with stopping shoplifters. How are you supposed to do your job when you have no back up!!!!!!"
bad,"Waterloo Walmart sucks "
bad,"Management constantly makes you do other people's work when short staffed, condescending attitudes that prevent you from moving up the latter, and hours can be cut at anytime."
bad,"They assign tasks to people who have no knowledge or experience in a certain department or position. "
bad,"Bad management, bad safety, no communication .... I hated working there. They have you do everything but what you was hired for. The management talk to you crazy. The place itself is nasty and unorganized."
bad,"I was a customer Service Manager, but I was often required to handle tasking and problems that were everywhere from 3-4 pay grades above mine. When I brought this to the attention of the store manager he basically told me I either kept doing it or to get a new job. "
bad,Walmart is a great company to work for as long as you are an hourly employee. Managers are not treated fairly or with any respect. Job security for management does not exist.
bad,"Walmart is all about how you make it, not saying working conditions were not terrible. Job security is one of the biggest issues for me because management would literally tell you that you could be replaced at the drop of a hat. The hardest part of the job was be able to get a raise. Typically when you get hired you are suppoosed to finish all the computer modules or (CBLs) at the job but I was thrown on to the sales floor without prior knowledge of what I was supposed to do. Of course you get to physically train with someone but when it is busy it is hard to grasp every thing you need to know. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is meeting need people from all walks of life."
bad,No job security in working for Wal-Mart. They hire two part timers to make one full timer so they don't pay benefits to the workers. Make you work holiday with no holiday pay or they cut your hours the week after so there really is no holiday pay.  This kind of job is not worth it if something else is available take those opportunities first.
bad,Good job if you just want something for a short time to make a decent amount of money with no experience required. Hardly any sort of job advancement.
bad,"My overall day at Walmart included preparing edibles. Working with the public on face to face terms. Ordering supplies, delegating work, and working withing Walmart's strict guidelines."
bad,Poorly managed. Work conditions constantly changed. No overtime. Works were treated like cattle. We lost people faster than we could hire. Yet they still treated us as if we were replaceable.
bad,"Just like the title says, this place is just not for everyone. If you ever work at Walmart I suggest you have an open mind about hours. They'll take them from you just as fast as they'll give them to you."
bad,Not a secure job hour were never guaranteed. Co-workers always called out and managers expect you to do their job also they refuse to hire full time only part time
bad,"Front end is horrible "
bad,They expect you to complete a job that cant be complete. They set you up for failure. I have never felt that bad for a company ever. Hardest part of the job was not to cry each and every day I worked there. The most enjoyable part of the job was my day off. A typical day at work was an incomplete job. Never and I mean never was it possible to complete their daily tasks. Totally impossible.
bad,there is no type of professionalism the training sucks the managers never answer they lie to you there is a lot of favoritism they always sending you home and cutting hours
bad,"I made many friends here and that's the best thing I can say about Walmart. They are evil, slimy, conniving, snake like management who don't care about you unless u lick their boots. Overworked and completely underpaid. They will promote someone who doesn't know as much about the position before they give a qualified person a chance. There is no holiday party or time and a half, they took that away. Walmart is a joke who doesn't care about you or your family. Glad I'm done there."
bad,"Could have been a much better managed employment situation as well as comfortable situation. Was a little out of the ways from my place of residence, The managers and supervisors seemed to be slightly unorganized and there could have been a bit more professionalism."
bad,The management is unprofessional and will not do anything but laugh with each other until the head manager comes to visit the store. They expect so much in so little time and expects one person to do a 3 person job within 8 hours or less.
bad,"The job isn't worth the wage they pay. They we're cutting job left and right to add them to other job description thus making it feel like you had two job yet only one and still paid minimum wage. The manager WILL write you up for the slight miss step and don't you dare take a sick day they'll write you up regardless that you are sick or not. You don't get benifits and have to fight to get hours."
bad,A typical day here would just be dealing with customers on a day to day basis. All I learned was how to handle cash and customer service while processing transactions.
bad,"People who work terribly are treated better than people who work hard, and if you work hard and bend your back for your managers they will continue to add more and more work and ask for more and more favors and will not consider you, your health or your personal life if something occurs. They don't treat you as humans beings. You're an accessory to them, a slave that gets paid (not nearly enough) to do everything for them."
bad,I'm quitting and dont even have another job lined up yet because I cant stand to work for these insane and rude managers anymore
bad,"A typical day of work involves first getting & doing the returned merchandise. I also check to make sure my telxon, printer, and walkie all have full batteries or else I cannot do my job as effectively. Throughout the day I zone as needed and especially in the areas that really need it (that means clean up and put merchandise where it properly belongs). When needed (during times of high customer traffic) I will ring up customers at the cash registers."
bad,"I loved my co-workers, they were very helpful and kind, and I loved being able to check people out and put a smile on their face. However the way the place was not run very well. I was told by a supervisor that management was going to give me a coaching for my absences without following their rules and policy. First you are to have a discussion about the absences, then if that does not change then another discussion and a plan is to be made, if that does not work then you are to have a coaching. They wanted to skip the discussion, plan making and just give me a coaching. She caught wind and said that was not how things were done."
bad,You are thrown into any position without any training and you are expected to swim. Management offers no help and laugh when you express interest in advancing.
bad,They management needed to be more understanding and treat their employees better. Less bias also. Not enough workers nor help when people called in. Too much work not enough pay.
bad,A typical day working at a convenient store was stressful. I had to work with rude people all day. People would come in and try to steal. It was only one cashier and that was me. I would work at night and have to call police if I thought anything was out the ordinary. I had some rude co workers that did not care what you went through. I really did not like anything about this job.
bad,"unrealistic goals to get freight unloaded from shipments and stocked to shelves and finished."
bad,The customer service manager are rude and they don't treat me as respect when needed. They talk to me like I am stupid and talking to me in a mean tone.
bad,"Working the register, cleaning and stocking the front end, and sweeping the floors where regular obligations I took upon myself to go out of my way and do. If my managers asked me to do something i did it in the best way i know how. I was very friendly and a Very hard worker with amazing work ethic. "
bad,"When I first started out it was a good place to work. Now there is a lot of disrespect from the managers and the co-workers, have a very upsetting time."
bad,"management for walmart in anna, il is terrible. they lack responsibility and professionalism. the working environment is very hostile"
bad,The bakery was an absolute nightmare to work in.highschool bullying attitudes.as well they have a 5 sec rule😷where if ya drop food you have to puck it up and put it back on the tray.the head baler was an absolute nightmare and beyond rude
bad,company policies are over looked by management when we are asked to be supervisors and make decisions.  If you request Pto for medical reasons or family get aways they are denied because there are not enough people.
bad,"They don't hire temporary workers based on experience but on stupid irrelevant interview questions. Being interview by people you won't work for is bias also. You show your skills and still don't get hired. It's a cult based environment not a culture! If you're not from Bentonville, Ar do not come! Traffic is the worst getting to work also!"
bad,my experience at all four walmarts is that you never know where you stand with the company and if you do real well and excel at your job management will assume you are after their job and report fictitious problems to upper management..... you will NEVER know because upper management never communicates middle managements problem with you. You will never move ahead unless you are friends or family with someone already in management
bad,"I loved the job and working with the customers. "
bad,"Conhecimento de área administrativa, conhecimento área de setor de produção."
bad,They expect the whole store to work like machines while cutting back on workers. Workers have to cover the work load of 2-3 people even with health or time constrictions.
bad,Just because you have more managers doesn't mean you'll have better management. I feel as though all employees are stuck in a predicament to cover their own butts rather than work as a team to succeed and that in itself was a horrible feeling. Managers liked to use fear tactics to scare you in to staying at a low paying job that couldn't even make regular bills. Nothing like feeling drained at the end of the week and not getting anywhere. If you enjoy being treated as a pawn rather than a human being then this may be the job for you.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for over 4 years and at first it was amazing. WE all worked has a team and it felt like a family. They used to hold BBQ's for us once in while to say thank you for a great job. In the last year they stopped doing everything and expected more from us. "
bad,"* unprofessional"
bad,just don't. unless you have have superb drive and are able to get into upper management. and are able to deal with a c.r.a.p. load of bs on the way up
bad,"I worked with this company twice, anx at different locations. That bee g said it is the most discriminatory workplace I've ever been in. As far as company advancement, that's only if you suck up to certain managers.  I saw three of the laziest, most incompetent people advance to management positions. This company is a joke."
bad,"Brantford Walmart night shift. Worst possible place to work.  Management have no clue how to run the night shift.  They strictly rely on rats who sneak around the store, spy and spread vicious rumours about employees.  Night management favours these few employees by taking very long brakes and giving them the easiest jobs.  Those employees who do not meet criteria of management, are persecuted and centered out. "
bad,"I currently work at Walmart . I love the people I work with however , the scheduling is very unorganized and sometimes I don't even know when I'm working till the night before . "
bad,"They didn't care that I was a mother first, or that I had mental issues. Nice cashiers to work with but the management needed to ne nicer"
bad,"Management was terrible, not responsible of important needs. Very favoritism but not how people preformed there job more like if you cared about there personal life."
bad,Management make their jobs look harder than they are they can't keep up on any tasks and would rather blame the employees than take responsiblity I could and would gladly take their jobs as manager I would be a lot different then.
bad,"Management didn't respect the associates. More and more was expected of everyone, while at the same time hours were cut."
bad,I do not recommend anyone to work there if you are trying to support your family or really get anywhere in life.  This job is for high school kids just trying to make a buck because you cannot live off of their wages.
bad,"Walmart says they are a family oriented company, but they are not.  Management will tell you one thing one day and within a week change their mind resolving in the termination of an employee due to circumstances beyond that employees control."
bad,"walmart would be the idea job if you like cup of noodles for lunch and dinner , because that is all you will be able to afford working for a company like Walmart who really doesn't care for there workers"
bad,Walmart forces unreasonable and impossible expectations on their employees and blames their employees for failing to accomplish the task.
bad,my typical day at work first meeting second find supplies third  clean store fourth put back supplies fifth  go home the compony doesn't pay overtime they is not enough associates to complete the task they ask for the promise and promise but don't deliver
bad,Told them I could only work about 24 hours a week before I accepted the position and they went and gave me 35-38 hours a week. Most of my coworkers talked behind my back calling me lazy and used foul language. I then needed 2 weeks off for health reasons but was told to quit or be fired. I was still in probation period.
bad,"The summary says it all. Walmart has a reputation for what it's like to work for them, and they've earned it. Expect capped hours, low pay, and endless red tape. True leadership is discouraged, decision making of any kind is discouraged, blind followers are rewarded the most."
bad,I worked for several Walmart stores in the six years I worked for Walmart.  The first store nearly all of the management team walked out because corporate would not allow them to raise wages to be more competitive with the local job market.  The final store I worked for we had a great team and were getting a slightly failing store turned around and cleaned up.  Then corporate stepped in and did a restructuring bringing in management that had shown to not be able to handle their responsibilities the reins and undoing a years worth of massive forward strides.
bad,This is a terrible place for employment they do not care about their employees and they will run you into the ground. Management never wanted to here what you had to say. Co workers were ignorant. The job wasn't hard just unorganized. Nothing was enjoyable about this job.
bad,walmart over worked us for little pay. discount was very low. management are rude. i did not enjoy nothing about walmart and i will never work there again.
bad,"I loved working here, that have a very bad point system, and will not work with you. Other then that, they do not teach you about serious thinks that could happen on the job."
bad,"Little job training-quick to reprimand.  Favoritism is abundant.  Little chance for advancement, or  full-time."
bad,"The management of this company is inexperienced and poor. I was never given the opportunity to fulfill my potential. Whenever I made suggestions I was scorned, ridiculed and disciplined."
bad,Not the best experience. Did not learn anything helpful for life or business. Discouraging management and little room for growth and promotion.
bad,the co worrkers are great but management has one concern get the freight done . i ve learned when you respect your associates and appreciate them alot more gets done . also when associates work over they at times are made to take offf their over time which is wrong
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart was exhausting and unrewarding. The management was not friendly and very unresponsive. There have been many times that I was assigned by a manager to work on a register that did not have a sufficient amount of change, which is extremely frustrating, embarrassing, and unprofessional when a customer requests cash back. It is also very embarrassing when a member of management takes upwards of 15 minutes to bring cash enough change for the register and the customer. Many of the associates loathe their jobs, and it is apparent. It is so hard to locate a floor associates that often customers come to the registers to ask where to find something. The hardest part of the job is the unproductive environment and the lack of consistency in the amount of hours I was assigned to work."
bad,"No matter how hard you work it goes unnoticed and as soon as you make one mistake management is quick to fault you. "
bad,"My co-workers were great."
bad,"Low pay, average hours per week . Benefits are sub-par . Stable pay check.  Entry level job to wok force. This is a stepping stone job."
bad,"Poor communication between manager and manager.  If you were not friends with a manager then you were subjected to extreme hardships, making the job experience very unpleasant"
bad,They have a high turnover when it comes to management. A new manager means new rules. A typical day there was none you always walk into new rules
bad,"The company is going through major changes once again.  Managers that have been with the company for 10 and 20 years are being pushed out the door.  New store managers are being brought in from the outside that do not understand how the company runs.  An MBA from an ivy league school does not mean that you can handle 3,500 pieces of freight coming off a truck into receiving.  "
bad,"I learned that sometimes it always not gone easy"
bad,"i worked here for 6 years.  this company only cares about how much money they can make.  people steal all day long and management does nothing.  one time a manager made me return over $300 worth of merchandise to a ""customer"" that had stole all of it.  another time a customer got mad at me because i would not cash her check with out identification.  she called me every name in the book.  management sent me away so they could assist her.  don't shop here unless you have too.  pay the extra buck to be treated better and shop at target."
bad,"A typical day at work started with me having to take the damaged goods to the back because no other coworker would do the job.  I learned how to tolerate several kinds of people in this world from this one job.  Management, except for the store manager and maybe two assistant managers, were the worst to work with. The hardest part of the job?  Doing what everyone else wouldn't.  I did all of the heavy lifting (I'm talking huge TVs, and as a young woman) by myself.  No one helped me lift anything up when I requested it, including the one male I did work with at the service desk.  The most enjoyable part of this job?  Customers.  90% of my customers were the best people in the world, and they were regulars in that particular retail location."
bad,"management was terrible, if they don't like you they find was to get under your skin, wrongfully firing associates because the store leader was taking merchandise for her own use out the store"
bad,"Walmart is not the place to work. management is horrible and getting breaks on time or at all is a joke. over all, I would not recommend."
bad,So bad. run dont walk away from walmart. literally everyone can do better. No fair treatment no understanding. They dont care about you only about themselves. Aweful
bad,"It's Walmart.  The associates you work with are friendly and the health benenfits are good, but that's where the pleasantries stop.  The management team is a joke.  They lack interest in your feedback and expect you to work miracles every day.  The superstores are extremely understaffed, the pay is pretty low for a company that has been part of the top ten Fortune 500 for decades, the schedules are all over the place, and if you happen to get holiday pay or a bonus, they'll make you take an extra day or two off to balance out your check.  But the main thing about the company that caused me to leave is that they don't back up their workers.  A customer can yell at you, insult you, even put their hands on you but management diffuses the situation by making you look like you're the inferior party in the conflict.  I had to quit.  Walmart isn't a place meant for people who want an actual career or self respect.  I don't recommend anyone to work at Walmart unless you have absolutely no choice."
bad,A typical day at walmart is confusing. You have management teams on different pages throughout the day. The learning process is horrible as they do not train you properly or give you any assistance when needed. Management are only concerned with themselves and do not care about their employees. The co workers were ok although there were some people in a position that they were not qualified for. The hardest part of the job was not having enough associates. My most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on the customer faces.
bad,"cada tienda depende de como sea el gerente "
bad,wouldnt let me advance to anything but cartpusher. even though I was let to work loading but wouldnt advance me when I asked to be.
bad,"best place to work in London"
bad,Horrible bosses. they had no respect for others. I would say one suggestion and they would yell at me in front of people. I would do one thing and if they found out if i was doing more than one thing they would pull me aside and yell me for not doing the one thing they asked for
bad,"there is a lot of improvement needed in this company. a typical day at work is extremely hectic and upper management has no clue what is going on throughout the store. i have learned patience, being their for my customers and to work well under pressure. i loved working as a team with my co-workers they made each work day enjoyable. the hardest part of the job is not having proper staffing. my most enjoyable part of the job was being there for my customers. i not only helped my customers but i built friendships."
bad,"everything about Walmart is bad, dont do it, bad. Vey very bad. Everyday is bad. Most co-workers are cool tho. everything else is bad"
bad,"Walmart hides behind policies and practices that make them seem like they care about their employees. In truth they care for nothing more than saving the company money regardless of who is affected. They often perform job cuts and cut part time and full time alike hours."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for 11 1/2 years.  Took pride in my work.  "
bad,Company is run by idiots. Low level education with no future. no communication and rude people. company is corrupt. From start to finish your being followed by people who dont understand the concept of a business.
bad,"I don't enjoy working for Walmart (Asda) at all. Not a nice place to work, managers treat you as children like they are better than you. Always hostility going on because management cannot sort out a dispute. Morale is always low due to hours being cut."
bad,"All Management are in a depressing move all the time, taking advantage of the people that live of the job and can't lost their job, stepping in everyone and every time someone make a mistake they said YOU HAVE TO DO THIS JOB OR I FIRE YOU"" if really depressing see people crying because the are scare to lost their jobs and every time a manager show up the people start shaking because there are scare of then. Management improvement is mandatory, associate relation in all HR areas, new management training and develop General Store Manager programs. In other words all management are500% company and 000% associate,"
bad,Walmart has to be the worst place ever to work. I took the job there because I was promised a management position.  Little did I know it was part time with absolutely horrible pay. The amount of responsibility was not worth the pay
bad,"Unloaded trucks, a inventory"
bad,"Having job security is nice, but dreading waking up every day knowing that you have to go to that place to survive is not.Micromanaging happens every day. The store manager is not really good at her job. Workplace drama is unavoidable."
bad,"I started at Walmart having come from the field of construction and found that I actually liked the job more than I expected to. It didn't take long to understand that liking the job and being able to do the job better than many didn't matter when put up against a rule of law by management that amounts to ""do it the way the company says to do it, no matter how unreasonable, or you're fired"", almost always under the conditions of being understaffed. Policy states that there will be no personal feelings put into play when it becomes an issue between management and employees, yet employees are routinely fired for reasons that stem from personal issues with specific managers. And contacting the corporate office to report unfair treatment in the work environment tends to be a catalyst for dismissal. It's a shame that so many people who love their job to one degree or another must work in fear of losing it if they do not push themselves beyond their own limitations just to get the job done."
bad,"theres never coverage,they pay you the  minimum for your job code,even when you are they're hardest worker waste of time usually your co workers are lazy and make the same thing as you even when you do 3 times the work"
bad,"management offers extremely low chance for growth, pay is average, coworkers are generally rude and unhelpful, breaks are short and extremely punctual, customers are generally unhappy and difficult to work with"
bad,Working at this job caused me a lot of stress. Managers wouldn't do their job and allowed conflict and violence to go on in the store even when told about it. They wouldn't do anything until the store manager would say something and then everyone involved gets fired except mangers and they started some of the conflict. Some co-workers were just like family. We looked after each other and helped each other when we could. Others were lazy and stood around all day on their phones and left there work for others. There was nothing hard about the job and I really liked doing what I was doing it was the working environment and things not being handled appropriately.
bad,El ambiente laboral es estresante graciasa sus dirigentes.
bad,"The worst caliber of management ever contrived.While there seems to be some modicum of dignity among the associates, there is an immense divide between them and management.  This prevailing culture of degradation seems to only exist from the levels of Assistant Store Managers to Store Managers. That has been my humble experience and observation. How far it goes is anyone’s guess…"
bad,"People are not happy working here,  which leads to a poisons atmosphere. The management does not deal with issues between staff members and this creates a work place that no one is comfortable in. Most people start here healthy and eventually have depression anxiety and other mental health issues! It is a very toxic place to work!"
bad,Executives at the company are still playing catch up with Amazon from years ago and do not spend money enough to invest to compete in the future
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy. The hardest part of my job came when items were not fount in the computer systems and the marked down prices were not in the system.
bad,"The store managers and assistant managers do not care about anyone but themselves. They talk to you any kind of way and treat you like horrible. Pay is horrible, no benefits. Horrible place to work. Messy people."
bad,"I actually had a district manager forge my name on an employee evaluation??  Work at Wal-Mart if you are a pharmacist who enjoys being dictated to by district managers who are not pharmacists.  When my name was forged, and nothing was done I realized just how corrupt this company truly is.  Stay away!!"
bad,Provide costumer service to people. Push shopping carts for costumer. Stock items when was needed. Provide detail about our new offers.
bad,"This company is horrible, it does not provide the workers with the necessary resources or equipment for us to perform the work properly. Sales continue to grow, revenue grows, but the people who's labor is responsible for the wealth creation (the workers) aren't even the ones who benefit from their own labor."
bad,As seasonal positions go... I would not recommend anyone over the age of 25 to work there. Their pay scale is the lowest in the region for front-line & sales floor workers.
bad,Very busy work you learn to meet different kind of people. the most enjoyable part of work is customers leaving happy. but the pay wasn't worth the time.
bad,"you are over worked, there is no competitive pay or bonuses. management is unorganized, and unappreciative. also the only thing that was great about walmart was the associates. the associates seem on the same page but not the management"
bad,"Dealing with about 800 different personalities in an 8 hour shift, with most customers not having any respect for you, makes for a very challenging day. Did not mind the work but did not like the lack of respect from many people, including management, everyday."
bad,"This job was my first job. Your starting pay is barely above minimum wage, you work hard stocking the store for 6 hours, and unload mack trucks for the other 2 hours. The managers will not work with your school schedule, nor do they seem to care anything about things going on in your life aside from death of a immediate family member, or a baby being born. I was never allotted vacation time, and I spent most of my day fixing things the night shift screwed up. You will sweat on this job, make customers believe you're a hero, do your supervisors job and you will never be acknowledged for it by management."
bad,Did not like working here. They hire with promise but do not follow through. The managment was a joke. Hire lazy associates. Very bad schduling.
bad,Its a great company for a person that's getting out of high school and need a start job. Other than the company sucks on moving up and helping their associate.
bad,I was with Walmart for 4 years and not even a single promotion. I asked to transfer to other areas of the store. They pick favorites and unfair work environment people who work hard don't get anywhere at the company most of the people who are promoted are the ones who you see stand around talking instead of doing there work.
bad,"Walmart is a cunning and deceptive company who will stab u in the back if you do not do it their way. I was one of the few cashiers who wanted to actually wanted to save the customer money and help them and not help the company. Because I was different, they didn't like that because I wasn't aimed towards making the company better, and in returned had associates write fake reports and had me fired!"
bad,"Management are rude, it was always a negative environment when going to work. The store manager did not care about his associates at all."
bad,Working was not too bad at Wal-mart. The strore had horrible management and didn't have the place together. I did enjoy working with other people and being on the floor
bad,"little advancement opportunities, non-competetive pay. part time workers of course get the short end of the stick, but you are able to sign up for a 401K after one year employment. make wal-mart a temporary stop in you carer, don't get stuck!"
bad,"la empresa me enseño mucho  así como me enseño me quito  de entrada pedía mucho tiempo , laboral y no pagado ni con tiempo ni con salario extra no tenia vida social ni familiar entre responsabilidades tenia que cubrir tiempos de otro compañeros faltistas e irresponsables . En un día típico de labores  los fines de semana muy pesados  ya que eran los días mas concurridos  y mas estresantes, pero satisfactorios  ya que se cumplían con las metas,  lo que me gusto de mi trabajo fue que conosi a muchos buenos compañeros y buenos clientes muchos buenos amigos"
bad,"Employees abused mentally and never know where they stand."
bad,"poor management associate relations "
bad,"Worse place to work at, experienced bad management! Didn't get enough hours and they don't work with your school schedule."
bad,"Walmart treats their employees like children, and handles problems with workers on the sales floor in a very inappropriate way. They never make their schedules consistent and require you to ask off three weeks in advance only to approve the requested off day and still schedule you on said day. Also, they have a bad habit of scheduling you outside of your availability, despite the claim that a computer makes the scheduling based on your available hours. Personally, I was desperate for a job and they were the only place hiring at the moment but I would have much rather waited for a better job than make this mistake twice! Walmart really DOES NOT care about its employees and treats them like dirt. At least a dozen people quit daily, and the above stated reasons are only a handful of the probably thousands of reasons why! I fortunately am not a cashier, who have a ton more complaints than I, and I also do not work in the backroom as a stocker, which also have their own list of complaints. If anyone is looking for a job, DO NOT go to Walmart, they are awful employers."
bad,"A typical day working there was basically being thrown in multiple directions, even as a Department Manager, and not knowing where you would be from 1 day to the next, and constantly being scolded by managers for doing what they told you to and not what you were supposed to do (either way, they would've scolded you, either for doing your job and ignoring them, or listening to them but not getting your job done)."
bad,Great learning opportunity and experience. Not a company that you would want to continue long term with. Co-workers are hit or miss. A few are bright and intelligent others not so much. Most difficult part of the job would be the ridiculously demanding hours coupled with the lack of pay.
bad,"Open or close the Jewelry department on any given day.  I stock floor merchandise such as shoes, jewelry, back packs.  I provide customer assistance regarding watch battery/band replacement, layaway payments and/or laway setup.  I utilize cash register to execute cash/credit/loan customer payments/purchases.  Have customer purchases a ring, I arrange for ring sizing at no cost to customer."
bad,"This job in my opinion is the perfect job for someone who just needs a little income, and i stress the ""little"" part of that. I find that this position will hold you over to look for something better out of life."
bad,"Everything about working at this Walmart sucks. From the beginning you may think ""this is okay"" a little later on you will notice how awful the environment is. The Management most of all is terrible and careless.They are everywhere and nowhere.You may ask for help and none of them will listen or care. Most of the time you will be waiting for a manager to assist a customer who wants to talk to them, but it will not happen. There is little to no enforcement of policies and management is lax as heck when it comes to giving people stuff for free or close to free. No body ever knows what to do or what is happening around them. There is no guidance. There is however a lot of drama lol. Nothing you learn you will used outside in life. Don't make this your life. Hardest part of the job is not knowing what the h*ll to do. Lack of training everywhere. The employee is treated as low-grade person even when they are the customer. Don't do it."
bad,This place of business was very unprofessional and there is no real room for advancement. Management has no real sense of order and no effective leading
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for. To many managers give to many different directions to all employees so if you listen to one and not the other you will get written up. There turn around on employees to out of this world
bad,"Pros: you receive a paycheck"
bad,"If you haven't been working at this place for over ten years already then it's a terrible place to work. The seniority puts you in a good place for vacations and extra/more pay which makes it seem like being a punching bag is worth it. An assistant mgr literally asked me ""What are you good for?"" Who wants to work for someone that talks to you like that. The managers keep you in the dark about everything, so employees are never on track with what's going on in the company. Heck I had to hear about the new walmart raises through the news..Not my manager. Lastly, managers will pull you from your department and put you somewhere you know nothing about, and expect that work to be done plus your department work to be done in the little 4-5 hours they give you because they cut hours all the time. If you are a student or need only 15-20 a week and don't mind getting shoved around from time to time this is your slice of HELLaven."
bad,"VERY VERY Un-organized.......no professionalism at all...Company needs to get more STRICT on return items without receipts, and beef up security as far as thief , as well as the safety of  employees from angry customers. Higher management need to SMILE more, Greet your emplyees daily with a smile. Have daily meetings that informs ALL employees of of the day to day activities, policies, rules....etc.....Control the staff.....Make sure each Dept has enough emplyees to cover that dept for customer needs when on break or lunch.....Make sure ALL ITEMS that are resaleable has a bar code on them to be scanned/or all items period..... I could go on all day..."
bad,Not a fun place to work with no supportive management all about number. A lot of red tape and politics. there's nobody there that has your back the managers are always looking for ways to fire you
bad,"I worked as a Sale's Associate and you have almost no benefits, they try to over work you, It's hard to advance to a new position even if you work hard. And the pay is not good enough for the job that you do."
bad,"I would not reccomend anyone to work at Walmart where I am currently employed. The Management team does not support its workers and some are treated better than others because of Favoritism. They do not care for those who are struggling to make a living everyday like myself. They are cutting hours and making it difficult for associates to live off of the little money we make. At my store, unless you pretty much become someone who ""sucks up"" to the managers, you will not have the opportunity to move up in the company. It's a dead-end job that requires too much work and not enough pay. Only the Dpt. Managers and New Hires will recieve the so-called raise the company talks about, leaving the other workers who have been working here longer with no raise at all."
bad,"Wal-mart has no respect for your availability time, so schedule suck. Harassed by management, even when your doing a good job"
bad,"Lo típico de un día es que alas 8:00 am dan la junta de comunicación para dar la información de las ventas si se cumplió la misión, también promocionan las ofertas del día, si  hay un cumpleañero te cantan las mañanitas etc."
bad,"Walmart may be operating within the governing laws of the land, but morally they are soulless. From the top down associates are treated with no respect or dignity. Customers are treated so poorly because this is the company culture. Disrespect to the individual is a company wide cancer and it shows in its' inability to take care of its associates and its' customers. All the bad publicity you see in the news about Walmart is just the tip of the iceberg for this soulless retail giants. I've mad some bad decisions in my life, but accepting an 18 month contract to work for Walmart is near the top."
bad,"Managers constantly threaten employees when they complain of any discomfort or injury.  Employees purposely written up for no reason, so managers can meet monthly disciplinary quota's"
bad,"they treat you like your a machine, one week your working 40 hours the next your working 20 or less and sometimes your working for 2 to 3 weeks on"
bad,Disliked this job very much. The management/ co workers were very very unprofessional. When a dilemma came up they would throw it under the rug as if it didnt happen. Management did not care to make sure they had a clean store.
bad,"Loved the people I worked with but didn't like the fact that the company didn't consider why you were absent for whether it was excuses or not excused, also the company wouldn't accept dr.'s notes for absences"
bad,"Its an alright job, somethings there need to be changed. Some of management is alright others not so much. Management talks down to there employees. We go in and fill the shelf's all night. We get hour lunches to they can keep us longer in the mornings even though many of us has asked for our half hours back but we were told no. It would be a good job if they didnt treat us the way they do and just let us do our job and left us alone."
bad,"Management refuses to listen to the problems around the work area, wont let you make suggestions, harasses you for weeks after you've made a complaint about one of their favorite employees, patronizes you for having good ideas that could better the store, there isn't any room for improvement in your position unless you are a favorite of the store manager."
bad,The only good part about working there is that I gained warehouse knowledge. I did not like working there because the people aren't exactly welcoming.
bad,"Poor environment, but a learning experience nonetheless. This company simply does not care about the employee's safety overnight. No security when I worked overnight so there were constant robberies. In addition, the harassment never stopped on a day to day basis from coworkers even after reporting to management several times."
bad,"Department managers schedule you to work in other departments, without adjusting your pay, without notification. Work load continued to increase while hours were reduced. Employees who consistently ""disappeared"" from department during work hours were never disciplined. Core of good workers had to carry the work of the poor employees."
bad,"I completely disliked working here. There is definite favoritism among management toward workers. Some rules apply to some employees, but not all. You can be ""disiplined"" for something arbritury and small if they do not wish you to advance to another department or to the Walmart DC, they show a complete lack of inventive ways to do a job, there is not much listening to concerns employees have, and because I left on semi-argumentative terms, I have since found the pettiness that comes with incurring the wrath of a middle management a-hole with a God complex as I have received nothing but bad reviews and they have so far cost me several job opportunities. I was an excellent worker, however I argued when on e employee was reprimanded for not following a policy while another was given pass after pass."
bad,"Wal-mart sucks. Favoritism is definitely key, pay sucks and they work the heck out of you. I worked three different positions and was treated badly at both. I was a cashier a sales associate and a backroom associate."
bad,A typical day was customer interaction and exchanging money for product. I learned  about how to diffuse trying situations with customers. The management was acceptable in what they did although it could be difficult to get assistance from them. the co workers were friendly and helpful when they could be. the hardest part of the job was the bust days with minimal employees. the enjoyable part was hard to pin down.
bad,I basically did the managements jobs. The management didn't do any of their jobs I was helping the other cashiers as well as having to ask my customers if they can give me a few mins so I can help the other cashiers. The management would wait like 45 to an hour to come to the cashiers. The managements wouldn't give our breaks on time nor lunch.
bad,It's decent and will pay the bills. Just learn everything you can and do your best job. Have fun and move on. Days are short and money is decent.
bad,"As far as policies are concern they are just in books, in fact it had given some platform to my skills but yet working in here is just a miserable thing to do in life"
bad,"Unorganized"
bad,"The managers are very incapable of doing their job and expect for you to zone every department instead of hiring more people. They don't pay you enough for all the bs they want you to do. They make stupid rules that makes no sense and just makes our lives alot harder and slow down productivity! like the fact we can't use shopping carts now! Some of the managers/department managers don't know how to manage! People don't understand how to use the chain of command! And people don't understand how to correct in the corner and praise in public. I haven't been here long but I'm over this job. The only thing good about this job is the hours and coworkers, but everything else is horrible! Including the fact that the store is ALWAYS a mess and nothing is ever in stock. They don't properly train the employees and we were not given a list of expectations, so we're pretty much are thrown on the floor after we complete the pointless cbl's."
bad,they have poor management. they dont provide a secure work place for anyone. they treat them employees horrible. there are no pros about it
bad,"Don't ever choose Walmart as a place to work. They do not care about their employees. There are much better options, such as target, and H-E-B that at least treat their employees with a modicum of respect."
bad,"The management does not understand its employees needs. You will be terminated for asking questions, or asking for a department transfer."
bad,management didn't do there jobs just didn't train people well co-workers did whatever they wanted to do fighting on the clock was almost every day just wasn't professional
bad,Would not recommend working here and management treat employees unfairly. They do not pay enough and do not value their employees. Everyone from the head and under are unprofessional. This company make billions of dollars and only keep it for their self. Please do not waste your time applying here.
bad,"Work was fast and hard. I learned Lock Out Tag Out, and how to dispose of waste and how to properly stock shelves. Some co-workers were ok to work with. Night manager was very rude."
bad,at my old store management would take my associates and give them tasks to do I ran the electronics department and well instead of being able to do my job I was doing all the jobs and then I had associates going to the management saying I wasn't doing my job so they demoted me to wireless sales and then fired me because they say I was rude to customers which was false
bad,I would not ever recommend Walmart as a place of employment. My pharmacy family and I got along well but the rest of the management outside of the pharmacy is terrible. They don't care about you as a person. Wages are below the average pay for the area even though they are billion dollar company. Part time employees do not receive medical benefits. They do not hire full time. There is little to no advancement opportunity.
bad,"Fast paced, dynamic work environment, performing multiple tasks in changing environment all day every day.  Management was unsupportive, unprofessional and disconnected.  Co-workers were amazing, but exhausted and broken for the most part.  The only enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the regular customers and helping people understand the new technology and options available to them with the new computers, phones, and photo equipment."
bad,"Walmart is a big box retailer that tries to capture all shoppers. I was a cashier, and a seasonal cashier. I hoped to work after the season ended, but was unable to because of family obligations. The hardest "
bad,"A typical day is moving merchandise on a belt all day long  for eight hours, nothing learn management always claim to be too busy. some great  co-workers. hardest part of job is being on feet all day.'Most enjoyable is meeting new people."
bad,"A typical day can be good at times and very stressful on other days."
bad,Untrustworthy managers and unfair opportunities. They don't follow policy but expect someone else to follow them. The job it self is good but working with the people it is not.
bad,"Under staffed, military management, bad pay, crazy customers, Walmart had to many polices that they seemed to change hourly,. ultimately causing conflict with customers that they handled improperly."
bad,Working overnight is a blast if you have a great crew besides you or awesome managers there to help you through the night. Walmart underpays its employees and expects a lot from them.
bad,THE HARDEST  OF THE JOB WAS GETTING THE JOB I WAS TOLD & SHOWN HOW TO DO FAST ENOUGH  I liked most of my  co workers The most enjoyable part of the job was building shelves
bad,"There is no such thing as a typical day at Wal-Mart. Multitasking is a huge part of this job. It also requires regular training, that is not provided. anyone who wants to be successful at this job has to be self motivated. I was lucky enough to work with some amazing people. Most stores are understaffed and management doesn't show much concern for the staff."
bad,"Standing all day, ringing up customers purchases is repetitive. Depending on location of store, the people tend to be self involved. Management only knows how to micromanage."
bad,I liked the way everyone made you feel like family. The weekly team meeting were fun and interactive such as playing Q & A games.
bad,This job is not a career. Management is not willing to teach you.Co-workers gossip. management plays favorites. You can never do anything right.
bad,Managers will treat you badly while doing nothing. You WILL get yelled at for no reason by the store manager. Also watch out for bitter old men who have nothing in life better to do than complain. Mostly in produce.
bad,"A typical day at Wal Mart involves trying to avoid talking to the long-term employees, lest their broken and downtrodden attitude infect you as well. The company culture has been completely broken since Sam Walton died and his inept and corrupt family took over. "
bad,"Horrible culture of learned helpless wherein everyone knows that everything is broken and nothing will ever be fixed."
bad,"Its a typical big box company that doesn't care about its employees. Just as long as the work gets completed.  Management would lie on reviews, just so employees couldn't get a full raise."
bad,"My very first time working For a big corporation. I worked in the Bakery, At first the people i worked with were friendly. Then when the store was set up and ready for opening, That is when things started to unravel. People i worked with were no longer friendly. I tried to keep to myself, do my job, And check in with my department manager when needed. They let me go on false reasoning, But i didn't fight to stay or keep my job at the time. I was fed up with the atmosphere they all had created. I then proceeded to look for better work."
bad,"I loved Helping customers and working with my peers. When I signed  up for the position, a set schedule was agreed upon. Since then, my manager had changed my schedule dramatically and it is on conducive to my home-life schedule."
bad,"I was in a micromanagement work culture, which vastly contrasted to my favorite company Boeing.  The work was not hard, but the schedule was terrible.  Some people got a fixed schedule everyday, but mine was different, from early to late from one day to another, it was hard to adjust my sleeping pattern --since I am an older person.  The only enjoyable part of my work day was when I was with customers, most of them were very nice."
bad,"Bullied daily by management, threatened to be fired daily, held accountable for other peoples mistakes, was never given a true opprotunity to advance, had manager put hands on employees, was verbally attacked constantly, very depressing environment, the only plus is that the people that arent management are great coworkers very friendly and genuine, the constant thing that was said that kept alot of people from quiting was that their coworkers were worth showing up for. I did learn alot though about receiving, stocking, hazard waste handling, making bales, sanitation, customer service, managing a crew, problem solving, people skills."
bad,Everyday you walked into this place there was dramatic things going on. In a typical workday you might work in 6 different departments never getting a chance to finish any work. The managers were constantly telling you the opposite of what others mangers would tell you. The management was the worst here over any position I have ever held. There are times you might see a manager screaming in an associates face or just putting them down saying very inappropriate things. Most of your co-workers aren't too bad except that they will hire anyone. It's very difficult to work with people that can barely read or speak English. Also associates are constantly walking out on shift because of the managers of customers. I would say the hardest part of the job is getting thrown from department to department every day and getting yelled at for not being able to get an unreasonable amount of things accomplished. There wasn't anything enjoyable about this job. I found another position as soon as I could and left.
bad,"They dont really work with your lifestyle if you have children , you only get up to 3 call off a year. Its really hard to move up been there for 5 years and still havent got a chance to move up. Alot of the CSS are unfriendly and bossy."
bad,"Not enough lanes open, and not enough people working during the holidays."
bad,"Difficult for place for customer service. Job security, benefits, and advancement was poor."
bad,"At first I though I was gonna make a career out of Sams Club but I was wrong!! They like to hire people with no experience so the people with atleast 85% of it don't have a chance. The politics are immoral and bias. The ""no experience"" employees get the training, poor management, employees are lazy."
bad,I would get to work then i am told everything day crew IMS did not complete so I would have to stock their picks.  Then management tell you to do something outside your job duty and get mad when your primary duty is not complete on time.  The Co workers were all Cons practically and complaining about every little thing they had to do to basically complete their job.  To much favoritism among management to even get anywhere with the company.
bad,"My career at the Vision Center has given me the opportunity to advanced my skillsets in; teamwork, efficiency, verbal communication as well as advanced multitasking skills. I have also gained the ability to effectively implement feedback and behaviors  to receive a specific controlled response from each client  to  get to a resolution as quickly and efficiently as possible to provide the best customer experience ."
bad,I advanced to a CSM within the 3 years that I was there.  I was fired for doing what an assistant manager told me to do.
bad,"Walmart is a based paid job, they not secure with employment."
bad,all of the supervision chooses favorites and belittles anyone they do not like
bad,"Our Mangers are under persure everyday, a very stressful work place. Employees are felt like their jobs are in jeopardy every night. No one is on the same page. A Bad Mangement Team makes it a bad work place. I learned about Inventory thru Wal-mart and was trained on the 960 handheld. Alot  of a good people work for this company. But have a poor living wage."
bad,stressful not enough pay for the people and situations you deal with on a daily basis
bad,i would not want to work for this company again. the only way i go back is only if i have to. you deal with stuck up nasty people. There  also people that don't take a shower and you can smell them for days. The starting pay has droped to 7.60 from 8.40. they dont like to pay you. they dont like people that use there own brain.
bad,"I help to process the register bags from the previous day.  I count the room so that it can be entered in the balance that is done three times a day. I also, once a week get to go through paperwork and enter data into the computer.  I bundle the money. The hardest part of my job is the fact that I can't be as fast as they need me to be because I use my left side of my body primarily.  Also, one of the people I work with blames me about being slow just because of my disabilities and she can't take responsibility for herself.  She knows about my disabilities and still doesn't care.  She is very impatient."
bad,Not the greatest but good if you need a job. You will learn great job skills if you apply yourself. The team work was the best part other than that I would not recommend this employer.
bad,"If you want a place drama free and where you can advance, then don't look at Wal-Mart!"
bad,"Working for Walmart after getting out of the military is probably one of the BIGGEST mistakes of my life. The management is almost nonexistent, they cut hours without telling employees, and most important they treat the lower job titles (sales associates) like garbage."
bad,"I've worked for Walmart for 11 years and of those 11 years, management has acted like a bunch of children throwing a tantrum. They expect their employees to get 3 hours of work done in either an hour or a half hour and pressure or threaten their employees with termination if they do not get it done within the allotted time. They will put more and more work on their employees without any reasonable pay increase. If you make to much, they will find a way to terminate you that way they can hire new employees for cheaper pay. Not a good company to work for."
bad,"Worst job to work at. They don't respect you and treat you like garbage. Not to mention the customers do also, and they wont ever stick up for you no matter how wrong the customer is. I didnt learn anything at this job but to hate people even more. My co-workers were lazy and got promoted because they kiss the managements butt. The hardest part of the job is when I was almost 9 months pregnant and they made me work an 8 hour shift alone by myself with customers with no help."
bad,terrible management they don't care about their employees
bad,"In my time at Walmart my time there has been not what I expected. The typical day is extremely hectic and has many obstacles to overcome. The problem is organization and execution of he job. Management tends to change direction to much leaving not only the supervisors but the rest of the crew in situations that are not necessary and make it more difficult to do the job. The co workers are not that bad, but the hardest part of the day is when after all you do there is still a mad dash in a sense to get the basics of your job done. Management tends to be unorganized and not on the same page when it comes to getting the job done. They give to many directions without a realistic outlook on what the people are capable of doing."
bad,"Never have I worked for a Company that is anti-employee. Hours are being stripped from people already struggling to get by. Benefits are sub par with outrageous deductibles. Management use bully tactics and intimidation to attempt to gain respect which in turn creates an adverse effect. The police are at the store two and three times a day due to the high amounts of crime that takes place on a daily basis. Although it is a fast paced work environment and I have met many wonderful people both customers and fellow employees alike.... I do not make enough in the 4 years I have worked here to sustain myself and my family. I do not receive the support I need from my supervisors, in order to properly serve my customers, as at times when I needed assistance in order to help my customers, I was told flat out NO or ignored entirely. It is difficult to be motivated here when you are being treated so unfairly day to day. Even people whom have given 25+ years of their lives here were fired and treated with no remorse."
bad,"my typical shift working at walmart overnight was fun with some of my coworkers some came to work to be successful and some came to just get a pay check.what i learned was how to unload a truck use a pallet jack and be neat and organized. management some were awesome others well lets just say some were very nasty and rude and talked to u like you were nothing and you were beneath them.my co-workers were great we had fun while getting the work done.the hardest part about wal-mart was trying to fix stuff management was un organized,the best part was being successful in getting task done on time"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers look for products they needed and teaching them how they work if they didn't understand."
bad,"no direction,,lack of mgr training,,the hourly wage is laughable,,not a god place to work in general"
bad,A typical day at work was crazy and unplanned.  You would receive your initial task and then be pulled to another assignment and not be able to completely finish the required work.  It was impossible to finish in the time given.  Then be asked why our job was not finished.    I learned how to handle different customers and co-workers.  I learned how to help and improve on different retail procedures and policies.  From detailing to cleaning to stocking and maintaining shelves.  The hardest part of the job was when we had a lot of work to do and not enough help or the policies and procedures do not fit the corporate standard for the particular store.  The most enjoyable part was the co-workers (sales associates)  i grew to love as friends.  and most of them were the hardest working people i know.
bad,"Management failed in their duties, resulting in people being required to perform duties that are outside their area on a regular basis. Disagreements with management or any superviser of any size resulted in a verbal warning which makes advancing within the company literally impossible for an entire year."
bad,"Typically a day at work was extremely frustrating. Management was terrible, some stood and stared at the ceiling, others would harass the people that were actually trying to work but say nothing to people who talk all day. Some of my co-workers were fine but others did absolutely NO work, or actually SLEEP. Normally I would not have cared but because it was a job that relied on us working as a team it was infuriating. If they didn't do their job it still had to get done, which left me doing more work to pick up their slack.Usually, managers would assign me to do things that were heavy while guys would be doing departments that were easy or lightweight. The hardest part of the job was probably lifting heavy furniture boxes up a ladder and putting it in top bins that were over ten feet off the ground, also management would ignore the need for a second person to do these jobs and the times when I came close to falling off of the ladder due to their negligence. Also, there was mold and roaches in the backroom, when it rained the smell of mold would be so strong that it would give me headaches.The worst is that the pay did not reflect the amount of work that I did and the third shift hours meant sacrificing any life that I once had. The only good part of the job was the feeling I got when it was time to leave."
bad,"Do I have to write anything here? It's Walmart. You know what to expect. But I'll write a review for completeness."
bad,"This was not all that bad a place to work. But, I have a hard time giving the company a 3-rating. The workers I worked with were excellent guys. We would switch off on who would go and drain the vehicle, and who would put the oil back in. If there were too many vehicles, we would discuss how we should go forward. I really liked talking to the customer and trying to help them get the best deal and best service possible."
bad,"I am a cashier hours are 7 am to 2 pm 4 days a week, check customers out in several areas at the front end.  stock shelves when not busy, & clean work area.  hardest part of job is trying to help people that are rude to you, best part are the nice people that always come to your line & have nice tings to say about anything."
bad,"get to work ready to do mods then I get sent to freezer or stocking ,never my actual job ,some of the best people I met in my life.the worst part of the job was dealing with incompetent management. The best part of work was a meager 10% discount"
bad,"Company orientated only. Its all about the money.  No insurance is available. In four years I have seen over ten management members come and go. The company is going down hill quick."
bad,"The company is a sweat shop in disguise. Worst pay rates for anyone who is not management and the overall feeling while working here is depressing. I would never recommend working here unless you are having a hard time finding a job. Then again perhaps its just better to be broke. The company and management are cruel. I actually witnessed a manager tell and employee "" you cant do anything about it now, grab a coffee and finish your shift"" The employee had just told her that his aunt had passed away. Completely inhumane, and there are multiple cases of this type of behavior."
bad,They dont really treat their employees very well they are all over the place and expect people to do jobs that they shouldn't be doing. The hardest part was trying to make it up the mountain in the snow and people kept quitting so there was less people and more expected out of everyone else.
bad,"Everything about working for this company was horrible from day one, the management team was a joke.."
bad,this job wasn't for me. worked here 2 long yrs! lol  i met some cool people. But the managers don't stick up for you at all.
bad,"Tire&lube. Service vehicles, change coil,replace batteries and serviced tires.Nothing hard about this job but you have to pay attention to every detail."
bad,Wal-Mart sucks to work for they pay nothing and work you as hard as possible with no regards to how good your performance is.
bad,"Being at Walmart is a bit overwhelming. There aren't any benefits and the pay sucks. I pray that I can find a job that see's from their employee eyes. I'v e been at walmart for two years now making the same pay, part time. I need a full time job that will support me and my six year old child. The hardest part of the job is how managment doesn't acknowledge their employees good deeds but fire them over petty issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is having some sweet customers and workers."
bad,the management team sucked. no sense of direction no purpose to even be there
bad,I work as a csm and its the most horrible company to work for.There is extreme favouritism. Assistant managers let associates they like get away with anything. Some associates do nothing take multiple breaks and leave their station whenever they want while others are overworked to pick up after them. If you file complaint against any favoured associate you get a lecture and they will team up and imply you are lying. That has been my experience working at walmart.
bad,I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart and all the people who influenced me to this day.
bad,"A typical day in garden center is moving nearly everything around and lifting 40lb bags of mulch all day."
bad,"I was to stock and keep the stationary area organized, help the customers, as long as I did not move from my station and could not get off work when the doctor said that I had walking pneumonia and had to take off work."
bad,"walmart was the worst place i have ever worked for.the management were rude to you when asking questions.would not listen to you if problems arose. all in all i don't even shop there now. i worked alot of hard working and kind people. the lazy ones got the royal treatment,hard workers only got the blame for if something went wrong."
bad,"Job code for one area but they have you working every department. Promotions are based off who you know and not what you know. Not a family oriented company. Was once told by the co-manager that the only way absences are excused by a doctors note is if you leg is hanging off, wheelchair bound, neck brace, can't walk or talk. If the doctor writes you out for a respitory infection, its not excused at walmart, they just simply don't care, Management sets double standards. Hardest part of the job was the whole shift because your pulled everywhere then get wrote up if your job is not complete. most enjoyable part of my job were getting to work with some amazing associates. great people."
bad,"only those who become ""friends"" with the management team would progress. discrimination was not present unless you are male with a long beard and long hair which i am. co workers were both hard working and some did nothing expected people to pick up their slack  hardest part was putting up with incompetence from management and a few of the coworkers most enjoyable was lunch time there was no room to enjoy this dead end workplace. work was easy and non stimulating. i learned never to work at a place like this ever again unless completely necessary"
bad,"I had a terrible manager,they would never give me the hours promised and we did more than we should have for the hourly rate."
bad,bad place to work if you are a family person. you will not have a set schedule. they do what they want to do to their employees.
bad,"Pretty much you get treated like dirt, your work schedule can change a lot, so you have no personal life. You can work up to 60 hours a week and still get no overtime pay. Upper management makes you treat your hard working associates like dirt. You are the pretty much the person who goes into a porta-potty and the upper management are those pricks that stand outside and lock you in and tip it over"
bad,"I had a poor experience at the Wal-Mart Cooperation:"
bad,"Initially the store was very fun to work with.  When a new store manager was brought in, it was clear that this individual did not have a clue as to what they were doing.  Orders to restock inventory were being rejected leaving out of stock issues in many departments and department managers were ridiculed by upper management because they couldn't keep their inventory flowing consistently. Before the new store manager came in department managers had an opportunity to try new ideas with merchandise and build exciting shops in their departments, but with the new manager in place the outside vendors were cut out and the ability to build those higher demand shops was no longer available.  Everything became by the layout only and no creativity was allowed outside the requirements of the minimal expectations. As the restructure took place the value of customer service decreased.  The job was enjoyable with the team members, but the upper management really had no clue about the task loads that the sales floor had to deal with on a daily basis.  Overnight stocking crew was like a skeleton crew so that department employees spend most of their day stalking shelves rather than focusing on creatively merchandising.  All in all, this is a good job people who don't like to think outside the box."
bad,Go to work run the phones do the price changes stock the fright do 5 to 10 notes management gives you and try to help customers be the only one in the department gets ruff sometimes
bad,"unload trucks, then take freight out onto the sales floor, stock shelves, very hard work!"
bad,"I enjoyed working for Walmart during store-set but since then, the level of management and organization has dropped dramatically.  There is no effective training for new employees.  All aspects of the management seem to be reactive rather than proactive."
bad,"They make you work outside of your specifications, horrible management team, don't know how to treat their good working employees with respect."
bad,"You need no experience to work here."
bad,"This company is money hungry! They cut corners and they don't care about their employees at all! Most of the management sucks now, all money hungry villains! I seen people get written up for not being happy enough while they unload trucks! Please, work somewhere else for low LOW pay! Your families will thank you!"
bad,It was a great place to start with when i started then a couple months down the road it started to decline. I unload full trailers for for most of my day and management there expects way to much out of one person. No matter the size of the truck and it dont make a difference if you have enough people to do your job or not the management team expect everything done in a hour. They dont give out thank you's or great jobs. They respond to just about everything with you could do better or not even a response at all. The most enjoyable part of walmart is the chance to meet everyone and interact with new people and customers.
bad,"The management staff will make ridiculous expectations of you and harass you, it is sometimes natural to happen at least once a day. I have been verbally harassed and accused of several ridiculous things, and had trash thrown in my face. The company also tried to keep my bereavement pay, supposedly because the 3 days I used were not back to back. There is nothing you can do about any of these things because management will always save each other and screw over anyone just because they're having a bad day."
bad,I have learned various areas of customer service. I have learned different types of technology due to the changes that come along with the territory. The hardest part of my job is the managers and co workers the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers because there is never a dull moment and they are the reason I enjoy my job no other reason.
bad,"I worked really hard With people that hated their jobs and hated who they worked with .Hated Management, hated the customers . It was an unpleasant environment. With no advancement ."
bad,"A typical day a wal-mart consists of menial repetitious tasks performed on a set schedule.there is almost no chance of full time hour unless you know someone in management. The management is  good at insulting you in the nicest possible way as not to draw attention to themselves. management had no concept of daily operations beyond the company set perimeters.my co workers where unprofessional, disrespectful, and.uncooperative the hardest part of the job was getting through the day without  telling someone off. the most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,"A break every 2 hours?  It is sometimes 6 hours before I would get a 15 minute break.  They don't care, they lie about ""Walmart Rules"".  I unloaded trucks for hours, sometimes 7 hours without my lunch break that I was supposed to get after 4 hours.  They don't care about meal exemptions.  "
bad,The supervisors were rude and didn't know how to respect any one under them. Would not give me the days off that I needed off for court and other appointments that I could not reschedule
bad,"Typical day consisted of preparing coffee beverages and serving them. At the time of my employment this particular shop had two owner who were at each others throats. They began a law suit over the store which made the work environment very tense. We were made to essentially choose sides between the owners. At the end of the law suit several employees who did not choose a side, or the winning side were let go, including myself"
bad,Come in get your register assignment for the moment ring out customers and so on.Learned how to cash checks and do returns.Management was ok.Loved my co workers and there really was not anything hard about the job.The most thing i loved about the job was working with people and my co workers
bad,"I would come in at ten at night. we would have a meeting and were told what departments we were working. The store 5280 wasn't run very well so there was tons of confusion and blatant favoritism with management and a high turn over rate. "
bad,"Walmart management employs threats of punishment as motivational tools.  Favoritism is the order of the day, and if you are not among the favored, the best you can do is put your head down and hope to not be noticed.  And the pay is not commensurate with the workload in any way."
bad,I was a backroom Supervisor But this is probably one of the worst places to work. You do not get compensated for the amount of work you do. Too many managers and each one tells you something different. You can get promoted but you will not get paid well.
bad,"good coworkers"
bad,it is okay... this job is for someone who do not have kids... i recommend this job for 18 year old-25 year old.
bad,I have worked both second and third shifts for this company. In short they do not care about what you would like they just want you to work and deal with whatever they say. Managers are awful and the store I work at has changed store managers 3 times. Overall a bad company to work for.
bad,"The cutbacks are terrible. They cut half the workforce and still expect the same amount of work to get done on time."
bad,"i loved my job and what i did for the company, but felt very under appreciated for the years of service i put in to the company."
bad,"The store manager was disrespectful, You get very little for doing a lot. All I was ever told was work faster, faster faster. Also if you hit a deer on your way to work, get, a flat tire, or there is a hurricane you will still get corrective action because Walmart says those are unexcused absents, even if your just late, They must have a 24 hour notice."
bad,I thought the company did not value their employees as a whole. They were not able to compensate me to my abilities.
bad,"Walmart gives some flexibility of schedule but that is it.  The pay is close to minimum wage and the hours are few if you work during the day."
bad,"Bad place to work, management is dishonest and nasty. no advancement that i saw and not a friendly enviroment at all"
bad,"working for wal-mart was a horrible experience. although it taught me a lot of basics and skills in retail. the bad part of working at walmart was management! they have no respect for the lower salaried employee,. nothing was every in order or in tack, workers dont have the motivation nor dedication to do their job it was just a lose lose situation. customers have no sense nor respect it was just terrible."
bad,Compensation levels are too low. Poor management and expectation too high for starting employees.
bad,Not much to say they make money and we scrap by and then after holiday they toss you aside no room for advancement unless friends with upper management.
bad,walmart does not care about anyone but them self's. The will be there for you only if it will benefit them in the end.
bad,I loved my job but I hated my hours. I used to go in for 4 hours sometimes.
bad,A typical productive day was at least 14 hours long. I learned a lot about myself while there including that I was unwilling to compromise my people values for money.
bad,"As one of the few dependable employees I noticed that MOST department managers were unqualified, unable to handle the stress, or unproductive. Salary managers seemed to care more about saving their own job instead of making the job better for employees and customers. They plotted against each others jobs and never communicated with each other or the people under them and caused a huge chaos that turned the people actually living in the area away to the other Walmart. Hostile working environment due to lack of management. Even corporate didn't try hard to fix the problems. Employees had no real voice until management had no idea what they were doing and barely then. Pay was terrible for the amount of work your doing and they hardly give raises and if so 40cent every year was normal. Chances for promotion are slim if you have a care about your job and don't want to deal with the unfairness of the job. The sales associates were cool managers weren't."
bad,Walmart is too big of a company that they allow people to walk all over others to climb up the ladder of management. The management doesn't have enough upper management to support them or in other words they don't have your back when things happen. They are more concerned about them selves and their own job.
bad,"Typical Day at work was touring the store and gathering notes for associates. Having daily/nightly meetings, distributing their notes, and following up. Cash office management, inventory management, daily. Hiring, firing and mentoring of employees and teaching them to be the best they can be."
bad,A bit out of my way to be in school and work in this position at this particular Wal-Mart. Better off choosing a different Wal-Mart or a different company altogether
bad,need to be more under standing when people are sick no matter how many times they are out.when the doctor tells them not to go to work.
bad,"Wal-Mart Inc. is a fantastic retailer, however, they are less than kind to their employee's. When they claim ""flexible hours"" they actually mean ""we will schedule you at random, and for whatever hours we see fit"". Benefits are supposed to come into effect as of 180 days employed within the company, however they will most likely either let you go, under the pretense of ""down-sizing"" a location just before you make it to 180 days, or they will keep you on and refuse to issue benefits citing ""paperwork problems"". If you have a problem with a member of management or a supervisor, whether personal or professional, it is best to just accept that they are allowed to do as they see fit, as using the ""open-door policy"" will undoubtedly lead to the subsequent termination of your employment. I gave two (2) weeks notice, and the management chose to file me as ""terminated"" (using the 'pink-slip'), rather than ""voluntary resignation"" (left an employer after giving a full two weeks notice)."
bad,the management is terrible they are disrespectful and unfair
bad,"The will keep you as a temp worker forever to avoid giving you benefits, or work you 39.5 hours a week. You won't feel valued or appreciated."
bad,"Time to leave. This environment is toxic and Wal-Mart is a fat cat, who does not care about it's employees."
bad,"Work as a team ,have a plan B when short handed.  Make things work. I like the management and get along with everybody! There is no hard part of the job I just need more hours in this economy. I enjoy just going to work everyday and being productive."
bad,"clean, sale, register, and answer questions. I learn wal-mart sucks. Mangement avoids work, does not answering questions, and plays favorites. Co-workers  are pitted against each other from day one. Hardest is pay and employer and employees attitudes.Most enjoyable part leaving"
bad,"I liked my job, liked the people I worked with and enjoyed helping my customers."
bad,"Reverse racism, poor job etiquette, no one was treated fairly."
bad,"I learned a lot however, I did not enjoy the job itself. My favorite part of the job was interacting with customers. I also enjoyed having the variety."
bad,I had difficulty in the beginning because of a serious lack in the on the floor training. I completed orientation and I was thrown in and expected to know what to do immediately. The pay was not worth the work involved and the management proved to be lazy and inefficient. I would not work for a walmart again.
bad,"Constantly having new job requirements to an already full set, including working in departments that you were not trained to work. A definite atmosphere of ""every man or woman for themselves"", and being in more situations than not where we were severely understaffed by up to over a hundred employees."
bad,"Worked as cashier for over year before being promoted.  Overqualified as cashier, but not young."
bad,a typical work day was working a full shift with in unloading freight with a crew of about 4 avg. What I learned is that managment nor fellow crew members where not eager to help me learn anything new that I needed for my job. Mangagment was the most unhelpful as we stated our concernes and gave our input when asked but all they did was take it under advisement and that was as far as it ever went. The hardest part of my job was the lack of team spirit as some didn't want to do their job and wagged behind and others wanted tell everyone else what to do while going off themselves and doing nothing leaving the rest of us to pull for the rest of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was recieving my paycheck to save up my money and move on to something better.
bad,"Would not work here again, Very bad to long term associates and Managers show favorites when promoting."
bad,Difficult with night shift hrs. High turnover rate as a result of the hrs and low compensation. Since there are issues with staff it is never the same from one day to the next as far as attemtpting to accomplish ones tasks. You may have to asssit customers that are unfriendly due to the late hrs and less registers available for purchasing product. Hardest part of the day is accomplishing ones tasks. Difficult when you more than likely will have to cover more than one area in one shift.  The most enjoyable is ( at times ) assisting the customers who can be friendly at such a late hour.
bad,Incapable of working with employees changing schedules especially around holiday time and especially with single parents with no family in the area.
bad,"Not enough Employees, stressful work environment. Worst possible Company to work for. Hourly workers are at poverty level, under paid."
bad,"a typical work day would consist of uncertainty, you may get shifted throughout the store for lack of staff, I feel I was underpaid."
bad,I'd highly advise anybody to stay far away from this company. unfair conditions and careless unprofessional management. Not a good company to work for.
bad,"It started out as a decent place to work until they promoted this man into management in our department that was much too immature, and disrespectful, both to me as well as all the other associates. There have been a great many complaints logged against this man in regard to gross misconduct, but the matter had never been resolved. As I would eventually find out, the management for Walmart Inc. are people of very questionable integrity."
bad,"I started working as a cashier in August 2010. It was my first time working as a cashier and working at a retail store. Working as a cashier and helping out at customer service was a great experience. I would not trade the experience I gain and learned at Walmart for anything. Over the years while I was there we had management and co-workers come and go. The workplace change a lot for good and for worse. Every workplace has it up and downs but at the end, things change at Walmart. Things were going down hill alot, because we needed help out in the front. Far as hiring more workers. The hardest part for me was learning different procedures over again. Once they change the systems over again and learning procedures at customer service. But eventually I learned it all, it made the job more easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and developing new relationship."
bad,Hardest part of job was standing in one spot for long period of time and you had to deal with mean customers
bad,"Been working at this dc for 3 months. Mgmt doesn't care abt their employees (at least in this dept). Difficult to make production. High turnover. Mgrs have to make monthly quotas for write ups, so they can be very unreasonable when they haven't made quota. I wouldn't recommend orderfilling to anyone. I currently work as an orderfiller at this distribution center. Since I started, I have been actively looking for employment."
bad,Due to several shift changes and permanent removals of my supervisors in my time working at walmart who all demanded various wants and needs throughout the months inside the store I learned that any foundation I attempted to build couldn't be made. Co-workers where only interested in self preservation and outside of worthless bantering I couldn't connect with most while I also tried to assist newer employees it became impossible to please the newest supervisor that lended to greater difficulties. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I completed my tasks while also improving the area I was assigned too. The hardest part was attempting to accommodant the almost random demands of the constantly changing supervisors with almost impenetrable wants.
bad,Typical retail environment. Management coniving. Incompetence all around.
bad,"cleaning up after people zoning appearl,folding clothes,putting out freight, picking clothes of the rack putting clothes out on the floor. That this can be a tough job a times. My co- worker's are great. The hardest part of the job is doing the samethings over and over again. And having to work really crazy hours and trying to get better hours. Being with my co-workers."
bad,Walmart has gone the way of a summer jobs. Advancement opportunities are very slim and are most times offered with minimal pay raises of .50. The climate is very hostile and there are no standards for treating employees with any respect.
bad,I was not trained and they trusted me to open and close the dressing room with NO experence.
bad,A typical day at work was assisting customers with there needs. Checking them out at register. And keeping a clean neat area. STOCKING as needed. My management was ok. There really wasn't a hard part.The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers.
bad,"At first it wasn't so bad, but as the weeks went on I came to realize a lot about the way things worked. SOME managers are very rude and do not try to communicate with employees. They do not work with availability. They do not appreciate the work you do as a person. You are replaceable to them. I will never work for this company again in my life. You cant even get overtime WHEN THEY FORCE YOU TO WORK MORE HOURS IN YOUR SHIFT!"
bad,"Pay is low. Upper management is disrespectful and does not care about the employees. They typically have you doing your job as well as 2-3 others which you have not trained to do. If your department is busy and you're alone, they will not help you."
bad,"Management is totally bogus. Work tasks are not accurate, not to mention that the store is way understaffed and is not what they portray working for Walmart. The store I worked for was OK but in my opinion the managers are way to demanding for what you get paid. "
bad,"I did my best to carry out the duties required for my position. I was late somewhat due to BiPolar but am now on medication so I am now able to function on a better time frame and schedule. I tried to get along with everybody and the managers are not the best in the world. When there was a problem, there was never a manager around."
bad,"Ever since Wal-Mart joined its vision center and pharmacy under Health and Wellness Department the professionalism in pharmacy went down the drain, because now district managers are not pharmacists they have no training ( required technicalities) to run a pharmacy. They are making pharmacist's life miserable. They are only profit oriented and killed the real sprite of beautiful profession of pharmacy."
bad,"They have more rules than a prison, pertaining to what you can and can't do, wear, say, etc. Though they have multiple managers on every shift, and at every imaginable level, there is a complete lack of communication between them. Not only on a single shift, but between shifts as well. No one knows what the other is doing or how to do even the most basic tasks. How can you manage and instruct associates if you, yourself don't know how to do the associates job? The company policy on sick days is set up to require you to voilate their policy in order to use your earned sick time. You must miss two contiguous days to get paid for one day, yet you are only allowed 3 call outs. So in order to use your 3 sick days, you must miss/call out 6 days. Automatically violating their policy, which results in a ""coaching"". In short, they micromanage incompetently, and they treat you as though they own you for the absolute minimum wage possible. All while preaching to you how much they care about their associates."
bad,"My experience working for Walmart was not a pleasant one. At my time of employment, we had a tyrant for a store manager that made the assistant managers lives so miserable that the assistant managers would then take it out on the rest of the employees that worked in  the departments that they were all assigned and oversaw. I understand that some people like to give ridiculous goals to set in order to get more work done out of their workers, but at Walmart I did not feel like this was being used as a strategic approach to get more work done because it was like that in all the departments for one and for two every time goals were not met, you would be ridiculed for not meeting the insane goal they had set for you and your department. I also while working there had an issue with a fellow co-worker and it took me reporting the issue 3 different times to 3 different people including the store manager himself for any action to even be taken. They then went on to moving me around to all these different departments while they were figuring things out with the problem co-worker even though I wasn't the one that was the problem and was actually the victim in the whole thing. This all lead me to not feel safe or comfortable in the work environment which lead me to my decision to resign from working there."
bad,I have been working at Wal-mart on and off for 6 years they have no loyalty to there associates amd the managment doesnt show appreciation the the associates
bad,"I started out as a cashier.  However, through my hard work and efforts, I became a Customer Service Manager for nearly a year.  I soon desired to be an Assistant Manager. Of course, I had a bachelors degree and had taken all the Global Management training modules they told me to do.  But management soon turned the tables on me.  They allowed things to go terroribly wrong.  They begin hiring thier personal friends children with no degrees right off the streets, making them Assistant Managers without ever working a day in management.  "
bad,Needs to improve in Customer service and managing coworkers. Managers needs to be more sensitive to the needs of the employee.
bad,"Wal-Mart has turned into a faceless corporation. They pay their employees poorly, and treat them poorly. There are no benefits, and there is no chance of a raise unless you are friends with someone higher up in management. It's become all about who you know. "
bad,management causes problems for workers by not knowing wat tasks to give and appropriate length of time provided to complete task. management does not provide the necessary equipment to perform job task.
bad,Typical day at Wal-Mart is planning what needs to be done then assigning all tasks that need to be done and following up on completed projects.
bad,College job that wont work with your college schedule.  They want you to drop out of school to work for them.
bad,"Clinic is closing."
bad,"No matter how mildly I word the very bad things that happen at this employer, this site keeps blocking my review saying that it contains inappropriate language, so I will just say STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY IF YOU VALUE YOURSELF AT ALL!"
bad,A typicle workday would consist of 3 meetings about daily and weekly productivity. Things I learned to be a tough supervisor and learned what it took to make sure my employee's productivity was on goal. I honestly thought that the management team had one concearn and that was money and didn't care about there employee's or the employee's family. My co-workers were great and wouldn't have changed any of them and they were some of the hardest working folks I've had an oppertunity to meet. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I got to be a leader in doing a career that I loved being around cars. 
bad,"The values displayed at walmart are simply enough just garbage. they have no consideration for you as a person. they use you as cheap labor. they jerk you around on the schedules. the managers are 2 faced and rude, and retaliation is rampant. I gave i my 2 weeks and they tried to get me fired before my last day. they also wiped my availability without my consent."
bad,"Assisting customers with their exchanges and returns"
bad,The job itself is not bad. Unloading freight putting it onto pallets and bringing it to the floor so overnights can stock. The management is horrible no one listens. There is no communication.
bad,"I worked overnights on the floor stocking shelves. My first day on the job consisted of being handed equipment and told to do a job that I was unable to do, due to lack of training. The manager gave me no time to ask questions and disappeared. I spent nearly an hour trying to find him, only to find out he was asleep in the camera room. A coworker kindly helped me out. The breaks were probably the only thing I looked forward to at work, simply because a group of coworkers always brought cards or dominoes and that was what we spent our break time doing. The hardest aspect of that job was my constant fight with management, they had their minds set more on times rather than the health of our customers; I say this because after a few months working there, I was stocking groceries. Part of stocking groceries consisted of rotating the stock (placing the old stock in the front and the new stock in the back) I was disciplined multiple times because I refused to shove the old stock in the back just to make room for new stock. Despite multiple attempts to talk to the other managers, none of them really seemed to care about the situation. I was soon let go due to ""taking too long finishing my task"" because rotating the stock took too long. I would NEVER recommend anyone work at that Walmart again."
bad,Do not work for Wal-MArt work all the time not family friendly
bad,"I enjoyed working and my coworkers, but the management were rude."
bad,I encounter more kindness from angry customers an a day to day basis. The management team at Walmart changes with the wind. They come and go with in a year or less. I think that because the management team changes so fast they seem to have something to prove.
bad,I love my regular customers that come through my line every time they come in my store.
bad,"One of those jobs where the actual job wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the people. Very few managers that deserve the title, company policies and methods of task completion change everyday and usually you don't know they change until you're in the office getting wrote up. Lack of communication between shift change managers. Rules only apply to associates they're looking to get rid of. Pay is actually pretty decent, one of the only perks."
bad,"i liked my job till they changed my hours and my job. management does not help you with your needs. open door policy is not recognized. you are not recognized, unless you do something wrong."
bad,"A typical day at work would be stand, zone, help customers."
bad,"After having worked for this company, I realize that they are all smoke and mirrors. They present a warm environment to the public. Yet don't treat their employees very well. Everyone seemed nervous about keeping their job and not getting fired. Not the best environment to work in."
bad,Help people with kiosks
bad,Its a horrible company to work for with no businessstructure
bad,Not a friendly environment. Staff is unorganized and workers do not do the job that is required of them.
bad,Nothing that anyone who has worked here hasn't experienced. They definitely don't want you to succeed in life.
bad,"the pay was not good, the distance wasn`t good for me and it was an over all crazy situation for me"
bad,Must Do 10 Or More Skids Per Shift.
bad,"Not a good place to work at all. Managers dating employees.Promotions are not based on your qualifications. Its not what you know ,its who you know.Must I say anymore?"
bad,The co-workers all worked against each other and all talk about each other. Never wanting to help each other.
bad,"Great plan by Sam Walton/Walmart, but very few managers capable of executing it."
bad,"I did not learn anything i hadn't already known,management is lazy and doesn't show any care or effort for their employee's they talk down to their staff and make them work shifts that are not planned without employee's approval,co workers feel more like slaves then employee's i was their foor 2 years and they did tell me i was one of the best employees got employee of the month 2 times but they never showed any sort of appreciation always talked about advancement but when i wanted to talk about it ( they didn't have time for me )"
bad,"Even though being a cashier is one of the easiest jobs in America, it isn't so at the Walmart I work. I don't know about other stores but my facility is chaotic and poorly managed. Walmart has so many policies that are there to protect the associates, but they are hardly practiced within my store. Instead of working together to run the business the six assistant managers there each do their own thing and more often than not end up contradicting each other which stresses and confuses the people working under them. It's frustrating to have someone tell you do something and then another comes and tells you to do the opposite and just keeps going on like a power struggle. As a cashier I'm supposed to be up front at the registers but most nights I'm stuck in the freezer section of the store stocking two departments worth of merchandise and being pressured to get it done within an 8-hour shift as well as rotating the products and zoning ALL BY MYSELF! The worst part of it is that they force you to do work you're not supposed to do without proper training and reprimand you when it's not finished or done how they want it, then lie when asked questions about compensation and job description but quick to coach or write you up on something trivial. Bottomline is I do not enjoy working at that specific Walmart and abhor the company altogether."
bad,"My particular Wal-Mart had major problems with the quality of it's people at all levels. Most employees would pride themselves for being high/drunk/or gang affiliated while at work. Management turned a blind eye to all of this and basically took a ""see no evil"" approach to it."
bad,"Wal-Mart was not the greatest place to work, they did not like to promote their employees and some where treated better than others. Some of the management where stuck up and made us employees look bad in front of the customer when we enforce the rules. they also where rude to their workers who didn't understand what they wanted or where belittled in front of a customer. But there where the few coworkers that where fun to work."
bad,"clock in, help customers, clock out"
bad,a typical day at wal mart is constantly staying busy and always helping fellow employees and customers
bad,"when i first started working for Wal-Mart, i loved it...really only that it got me into shape...but after the dreary years of back breaking work, i was feeling a bit over loaded with work...as were all my working comrades. literally was the hardest job i have ever had....ask around, it is verbatim to the T."
bad,If you are a hard working looking to better yourself this is NOT a job for you. They promote based on how well you suck up not on your abilities.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to be creative.
bad,"Short staffed, late on breaks and lunches, no support from the management team except for my immediate supervisor. i would trust my peers who i worked with. Time management was always a main key to my position. i was a strong cashier, little supervision needed, i was able to run the front end of the registers/cashiers. I was often paired up with a weaker cashier that needed extra support. Learned how to run the front end of the store, before a cashier, I was a stocker who pushed out freight and put it on the shelves, came back with very minimal to none overstock. Helped merchandise displays and various end caps. Also knowledge of the back room and using a gemini to track merchandise. My most enjoyable part of the job were the few people that I encountered with, I took their friendship and their constructive criticism with me."
bad,Co-workers and management were rude and disrespectul. Rules were applied unequally. Threats and bullying were an accepted management style. Little opportunity for advancement. Management frequently ignored company policies. Any complaints were met with threats or retaliation.
bad,It's Wal-Mart what do you expect. Bad pay bad management stupid customer's
bad,clocked in went where ever they needed me and did my work.management was all for them selves couldn't get a straight answer from any of them.co workers were great they did anything i ask of them.the hardest part of the job was asking management a question and getting no answer.interacting with the customers and outher employees
bad,"I've worked with this company for 5 years. The management team is so disorganized. One tells you one thing, the other tells you something else. They're throwing each other under the bus, and use the lower level employees as pawns to further their own careers. You are nothing more than a number to them. They play mind games to try and convince you that Walmart takes priority over all else. They don't like independent minds, they would rather have drones. The employees are overworked and under appreciated... I could go on, but I'd rather not give you a wall of text."
bad,"great coworkers, pitch in to get job done. too many times been told they will layoff people if we cant get the job done. the employees are not valued, nor appreciated. helping customers my coworkers is best part of the job"
bad,Never met my manager until the last day i worked there.
bad,I worked for the company for eight years. The company made it well know that if you were not Hisanic or a Female your chances for advancement were limited. I spent way to much time at work as a manager. You are salaried and the amount of time required to get the job done is extreme.
bad,"Typical day at work: Clock in. Sit through a fifteen minute meeting with coorperate BS. Clock into task management on ""My Guide."" Downstack frieght and stock shelves for the rest of your first four hours. Take an hour lunch. Finish up freight within two hours after break. Zone and straighten up for the last two hours."
bad,"Everyday we started at 4pm and eneded at 1:30 am. Monday- Friday. I learned very little there, and their training program is virtually non-existent. The chain of command there was quite sloppy, and few people know what they're doing. Only 2 of my co-workers were interested in being team players. The rest were only interested in goofing off. Every part of that job was difficult, due to improper training. None."
bad,Sometimes itwould get frustrating from on night supervisor saying to do things one way and then maybe the next night the other supervisor wants it dne another way. No consistancey at all.
bad,I always had something to be working on but if one manager tells you to do something then another will come behind them and tell you to do something different. It was hard to stay on one task because management didn't work together to inform one or the other who was working on what. I worked 5am to 2pm i was classified as a part time associate but i was working full-time hours. I tryed to get my schedule changed because i had no one to help me take my daughter to school so i needed to come in at 7am and my manager told me she could not do that. thats a few of the hardest parts of my job because when i started working there they told me there a flexable with hours for parttime employes and thats what i was. The most enjoyable part was the people i worked with in the bakery i became close some of them but others did not like me.
bad,"A typical day at work is clocking in going to your department finding the list of work to be done for the day, starting the work getting pulled off to do something else then getting yelled at by the same manager for not getting the assigned work done..."
bad,"A typical day at work was extremely tiring, sometimes it took on the form of slave labor. I learned to be very careful where you were placed(anyone applying for the job, needs to research the job position extensively, to make sure that they can even perform it). Management really needs to take into consideration, that who they manage, look to them for leadership as well as kindness. My co-workers were on the same page, they were good chaps. Hardest part of the job, was EVERY DAY, quite grueling, but in years time I could breeze through the P90X workout like a boss. Most enjoyable part, was clocking out and going home."
bad,"A typical day starts with setting up the floor with pallets for the freight that is about to be unloaded. I didn't really learn much because I have warehouse knowledge and assist a career class about it. The one thing I learned, I would say is how a big company is operated day to day. I work along with some of the best co-workers I know. We can joke around but get our work done correctly. Management on the other hand isn't that great unless you count 5 out of the 12 or 13 that are there. The hardest part I would have to say about my job there would be knowing how much more I could make at another company for my experiences. Now for the most enjoyable part or parts of working for this company would be my co-workers in the receiving area and break time."
bad,When it came to working at walmart it was an ok experience. The conflict came when personal matters with my daughter and attendance came into play. It was a very hectic work enviroment and it was very stressful. Direction was given by one member of management and then another direction by another member of management.
bad,Unfortunately working for this company will stress one to the max. The management team disrespects associates on a regular basis. They demand the unattainable because they themselves don't understand what is necessary to get the backroom done accurately.
bad,The entire experience was miserable. The employees were worse than the managers. Pay sucked for all of the work that we had to do. Yeah. Not an enjoyable or rewarding endeavor.
bad,"not my ideal job , dont like the structure of production. only 2 20 min breaks for ten hr shift. ."
bad,Walmart just isnt the career choice or home for me. Much larger chain with alot more employees and more hours. Not the best mgmnt team I have worked for deff could use improvment and more advancment oppertunties offered would be helpful
bad,"morning meeting with everyone, mgt and assoc. then team meeting with all merchandise supervisor and co managers. i learned alot about keeping stock working a gemini and ordering stock. i had some great co- workers and associates."
bad,I worked at walmart for over a yr without a raise. Managers have little to no exp. I have no benefits for me and my family.
bad,Employees do not matter. Most management treat subordinates like trash. Company takes bonuses away by reducing hours. Employees do not have the proper equipment to do job properly.
bad,Enjoyable part of the Job.
bad,the people are rude and have no compassion.
bad,-A typical day is on floor or standing next to cash register
bad,"I loved most of my customers, I had a lot of problems with scheduling, I would close the store being off at 12:30am - 1:00am then need to be back to work at 5:30am to open the store, I had talked to management about it and it got better for a while then went right back to the old schedule."
bad,Day-to-day:
bad,"I did not feel that the ones who worked the hardest to ensure that the store was stocked, and met requirement that needed to be met when management came in of the morning were treated fairly.Those that had skill to get the job done are worked the hardest and the pay does not meet the the level of work that is given. You are not paid enough to do the job especially when you work over nights and then you are timed like you are in a factory the pay shoyuld at least match what is being worked.The people at nights work the hardest lifting heavy freight. Stuff that takes at least 8 hours to complete.You are not treated fairly. I don't feel that management necessarily has anything to do with this, However I do believe it starts at the top where the store is being managed by hoime office . I also feel that if management want a productive work force they should work with their employees."
bad,It was a job. Management would take customer word over employee
bad,there was nothing good about working at this walmart. the manages never listened to employees. management would sometimes be rude to customers. store was constantly robed.
bad,Walmart was a very unfair work place. It was the type or job that if you no management you could get away with anything. I've worked for them for a little over four years and I seen so many people come and go. You have whole familys working there and that's not good at all. I don't have anything go to say about this job.
bad,I would not recomend anybody who has children to work at walmart they do not hold family values like they did in the past.
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers for the most part we were close like a family. There were a few people that came in and chose to cause trouble rather than fit into the environment and try to get along with all personalities. Store management was ridiculous and needed more training. The hardest part of my job was being yelled at constantly by patients and then by frustrated co-workers. I learned a lot about pharmacy computer systems, the inner workings of a pharmacy and how to handle sick people in a gentle way. Helping other to feel better was the most rewarding part of my job and the one down fall was that I was always working and missing out on my family time."
bad,"I stood at a register, and checked out customers. Never got my breaks just all around terrible job."
bad,They make you feel as if ur a special needs worker. low pay and management is spoiled.
bad,been there for three years and still have not got 9 dollars an hour and you do so much for little pay.... management is not so good
bad,As a D/C Manager your job is always on the line. You must work a minimum of 12 hours a day. You are treated as a number. If you are tight with the General Manager chances are you will succeed.
bad,changed tires and oil
bad,"The management was for the most part pressured as a result treated associates poorly. Not giving breaks when needed and locking some in facility. Not giving ooportunities to advance, due to discrimnation toward women and minorities."
bad,Not good working environment. Management doesn't manage anything but hiding from their employees.
bad,I was hired as a cashier during Cristmas Rush. I had eight hours a day. It was great. I did all my tests and training in advance of the other cashiers. I was gaining a repore with the customers. Then one day my lower back was starting to bother me and I mentioned it was from a car accident 6 years ago. The next day I couldnt find my name on the schedule. They had cut me. There was no explanation. The entire week I had four hours. They squeezed me out.
bad,Every day I would get yelled at over very small things and some of them I would not even do the things they yelled at me for when confronted about these situations they would just shrug about it and walk off..
bad,A typical day at work would be a boss telling u to work faster and harder and not getting told you are doing a good job. Management sucks!!!
bad,"after working for four years with this company, i had realized advancement was impossible unless i sold my soul."
bad,I would not recommend this compay to my worst enemy
bad,"enjoyable, speaking with and helping people--possible to have a set workday and time though"
bad,I worked different times and shifts. I was at walmart for 9 to 11 hours a day. It seemed like management was only for themself. I didn't have a set schedule and I worked every holiday and weekend. I was getting paid in pennies and worked to hard. The enjoyable part was when i was off. i had issues with all the co-workers. no of them would help me work on a car or any other task given. I was alone to work on the task. i did complaine and got wrote up for it.
bad,"loved the customers,got along great with the associates.very poor management"
bad,it states that it is all about people advancing but it has it certain associates that they want to advance
bad,Wal-Mart was the worst company i ever worked for. They always wanted the associates to do more then what they were getting paid for.
bad,"Being a third shift stocker is not worth it at all. You get paid $7.95 and its extremely fast paced and difficult. The only plus is that if you show up and work you will keep the job, its secure."
bad,"Typical day was always a constant battle. Management was not considerate of their employees, the all mighty dollar was what was the most important. Co-workers were great always trying to help me out. There is no enjoyable part of the job."
bad,Management sits in the office except for 3 times per day when they walk the floor to point at what needs done. Associates work hard and for little pay! Sam Walton would not agree with how these stores are run these days.
bad,"I worked at store 895 in the bakery, and now at another store down the road in electronics. At first, I liked it (in the bakery, but then around day three or so I was fed to the wolves."
bad,"If you have a doctors not, it doesn't matter, your absence still counts against you. Managers don't care if you have a good, legit personal reason why you can't come to work, you still get a write up. If you're a good hard worker, you get nothing. If you call off all the time and don't do your work, you get praised ans raises etc. All they care about is making money not about associates like it used to be before Sam Walton passed away."
bad,"A typical day depends on what time you start. If you work in the morning you would do whatever the supervisors say, at night expect to finish whatever the supervisors didn't and clean the departments by folding clothes, picking up and doing returns. The bad about it is that if you are cross-trained in anything else you will most likely cover those areas' lunches/breaks or to cashier since there are most likely cutbacks in all stores. On top of that you are most likely to be expected to get your area(s) done to perfection (unless your supervisory staff is forgiving for these things.) The best part of this job for the most part is my co-workers. Since I work in a large area and there are multiple people hired for the department-they are the best part!!!"
bad,"I worked here for 21 days, because their system is so crooked it took them a complete day to fire me. The management is so greedy you wouldn't see anything except dollar signs in their cheap suits. I was fired because of a company policy; if a customer asks you ANYTHING you must stop whatever you are doing and assist the customer, which is fine with me except that my job was supposed to be in the back at the loading bay and they had me working the front store so often that I would be asked a question and it would just chain on to another person and another to where I never did my job because of the previously mentioned policy."
bad,"This job wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for management. They show everyday how little they care about people, unless they are customers or friends with the associates. Hours are sporadic and get cut on a regular basis. Promotions are hard to come by unless you are friends with the managers, no matter how much experience or expertise you have."
bad,Failed to advance employees up even after they proved their worth.
bad,"Wal-Mart just was not the place for me. I have never worked in retail before and working for the largest retailer in the world was on a much great scale than I thought. Without that background, it was very difficult for me to adapt to the work days. Management communication wasn't always up to par as well. With a lack of communication is makes the work environment hard. Working 14 hours a day on your feet was the hardest part of the job, after the daily demands. The most enjoyable part of the job was the schedule (Assistant Managers worked 3 days on & 3 days off) and the pay."
bad,Meeting lot of different types of people. Everyone is friendly. Fast paced at times.
bad,Of money. The amount of money the company makes is enough to pay every employee well instead they choose to go the. Cheap route and pay as little as they can and overwork you
bad,Too much abuse from managers. Not a fair place to work in and very abusive towards their associates. Didn't really like working there but I dealt with it until i got pregnant and the lay me off. I went back to school and I graduated. Currently looking for a job till this day.

Inventory- order my outs from the previous day. Making sure my invoices get paid. Conduct conf. Calls ,,,Make sure my schedule is in the systém."
bad,bad place to work too many managers meaning to many people to answer too
bad,"Typical day was putting freight away, doing useless ""counts"", zoning the shelves and helping customers. Didn't want to spend too much time with the customers! If you did you got ""coached""."
bad,"very busy fast paced work, but management is very hard to work for. sometimes there is just to much to get done in eight hours"
bad,"a place where morality is low. You are overworked here, i would need about five pages to tell you whats wrong with this place."
bad,"I worked int he back room at Wal-Mart on an inventory control team. My co workers were great but the job at times was demanding and compensated very little in return. We completed daily stock operations, pulling and refilling stock throughout the day."
bad,A typical day at work would involved heavy customer and associate interactions.
bad,I worked with walmart for two and a half years and the first six months when i worked in waukegan illinois walmart was awesome the managers cared about their employees and strived to make it a good atmosphere for all. as well as they understood about family obligations. the walmart i worked at in virginia beach virginia was the exact opposite with no room for advancement i worked at that one for two years and struggled to change availabilty could not move away from being a cashier where as in three months in waukegan walmart i advanced to jewelry and if i hadnt needed to move back to virginia for family reasons was working on becoming a department manager(in six month) where is the greatness that i know walmart can have. save money live better my hhhmmm. How can you live better when your employer is unwilling to work with you. Even customers complained about the management at the store i worked at and said they avoid that store and only came in when absolutly necessary.
bad,"If you want to be degraded, dehumanized, bullied and abused, then Walmart is the place for you. As a distribution center employee the money is just good enough, the hours are nice, and the work is tolerable. Walmart's only concern is profit, and their management philosophy reflects this."
bad,They definitely don't care as much about the employees as they do their management. They try to bow down to management but the employees are on the bottom of the food chain for sure.
bad,it was is a OK to work there but i need something new management team has no communication and a lot of favoritism goes on
bad,Somewhat a decent place to work. Easy to learn various departments.
bad,Managers dont care about workers. Even if its health issues they dont care and want you to work.
bad,I work night shift at Wal-Mart as an Inventory Assocaite. Everyone I work with is miserable with their jobs. They are not understanding of any life outside of the store and expect you to devote all of your time and eneregy to Wal-mart for very poor pay for a trillion dollar company.
bad,Very difficult to advance and extremely demanding of employees.
bad,They do not care about their employees. It is all about the bottom dollar.
bad,The management was rude they give you hardly anytime to finish work in your area and they are not on page with each other at ALL.
bad,I would not recomend Walmart to anyone. Especially not a family member or friend. They don't care about their associates just the bottom line and how to make the CEO a richer person.
bad,"As a salaried member of management extreme daily stress, work/life balance is not good, potentially work 15 to 16 hour days regardless of what company program is, upper management (store mgr, especially) has unrealistic expectations and very disrespectful. Outside support to correct horrific management approach not available from market level. Continuous threats are made concerning job security. Famous quote from one such manager, ""You can't hire and fire fast enough to save your job!"""
bad,The store at the location I worked is for the workplace political croud. If your intent is to work and go home for your social and family life this is not for you. However the store manager has changed and maybe the store attitude has also.
bad,overall this company doesn't give incentives or well planned guidelines for training in a department that a employee is given. I believe that a company should give a solid 2 weeks of training within each department.(HANDS ON TRAINING).
bad,but its a job i wouldn't make it a career out of it
bad,They are not what they used to be threw standards have changed. You are not seen as a human being but an expendable chess piece. Even vetrans are expendable. No matter how hard you work or how long you have worked.  walmart would rather be out with the old in with the new.
bad,"You’ll be at the mercy of all you’re incompetent coworkers if you’re a stocker. Seriously be as slow and as unproductive as possible, and act as retar ded as you can be. The minute you show you aren’t a retar d and can work, all the managers are going to assign harder work for you as well as shorter time expectancy. Also many people will try to throw their responsibilities on your back. In short the best aspect about this job is that you can call out any time you want if you have to points to do so."
bad,"Myself and others that worked there with me don't want to work for a Walmart company ever again,the management was terrible and they preach team work but don't let you work with anyone when teamwork is due. The management doesn't listen to anyone ideas or consider your work problems"
bad,Treated really well at first. Told how to do the job in the most primitive way and then expected to meet alot of criteria that i was never told prior.
bad,"No way to advance, managers are not friendly, and there's no role models to look up to. If you're looking for a job to start at, don't work for Walmart because they will kill you on the inside."
bad,"not family friendly or understanding when unexpected emergencies, such as illness or death arise. Don't do a lot of promoting from within. Expected to work even when injured at work and tried to coerce company dr into making me and others return to work before healed and when he thought safe to return"
bad,There is only inclusion for certain employees. A fair amount of misplaced company asset tools to employees that have access. They are unwilling or unable to provide necessary equipment for certain employees to advance within. Management does not follow through on providing information that is pertinent to for employees or customer service. Training appears to be for certain employees
bad,"My ratings are for store/region purposes. This has been my experience, at 3 out of 4 stores, in 2 different states. No respect for what’s right, if it threatens upper management that’s been in the wrong. Favoritism runs rampant. Promotions are based on favoritism rather than experience and knowledge. Raises and pay are done with same. Associates are targeted and fired if they don’t fall into the favorited category. It just hasn’t been a very positive, and growing experience, for me."
bad,"Go in. Do your work. Clock out. And go home. "
bad,I love being a cashier.I loved all the customers .Front end mangers were the most disrespectful people I have ever met in my life .Managers care about themselves only
bad,"- Customers will lash out because of items behind glass and rant all the time."
bad,"Entire life is driven by bean counters. I was let go for not filling enough prescriptions despite my manager assigning most of the counseling to me. My numbers were not comparable to other pharmacists, yet I was always assigned to less busy shifts. No one informed me at my hiring that I would have to game the script count to survive."
bad,"A typical day was rough because any number of things including the workload of cleaning the restrooms at inopportune times for people to use. "
bad,"Walmart in Peace River has gone downhill in the last three years, due to the fact that that they have a huge staff turnover.  This happened when new management took over and got rid of a lot of longstanding people just to reduce the payroll.  They also started offering jobs at -14.00$ an hour."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone especially if you are doing night shift. They pin everything on the night and the store owner don't even care unless its about money or his job on the line. He favoritism woman super hard so good look getting higher up. Never take janitorial position they want you outside pushing carts in, picking up all the trash outside, try to over work you by putting you on stocking when you doing your job or after. The pay is not even worth it you get paid the same amount as a stocker  $11.50 when your job is way harder and nastier. Let alone the day time get away with so much stuf. That if they don't finish, they will throw it all on night shift to make your job harder. Also this is the walmart near thomasville road"
bad,"Your requested schedule means nothing to them.  There are never enough people working because everyone that works there quits very quickly.  "
bad,The higher up the management chain the worse. There is favoritism and their expectations are ridiculous. The pay is horrible and their annual  raises are almost none.
bad,You always start part time in the job. You can work up to full time when a full time position opens up. The jobs are always changing. You might have a position one week and without warning demoted to another.
bad,I experienced a lack of caring on the management's part.  I experienced work that was not respected and never complimented.  I experienced that the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know other employees.
bad,"I worked there for approximately 5 months.  What a degrading job it turned out to be.  I'm 67 years old and just wanted to make some extra income and the store was right across the street.  I really tried hard but my body had a very hard time.  I roughly walked 8 or more miles a day in the store when I was working.  My knees were so inflamed and hurt so bad one day I told a supervisor and all she could say to me is I'm sorry this is how this job is.  I went to my orthopedic and he did see the inflammation and gave me some knee braces to wear.  They helped but my knees hurt so bad.  They expected you to get reshop from the whole story and reshop it with no TC or nothing.  So you have to walk all over the store just to find things and then you have to guess where they go.  This meant alot of walking.  I was told by several manager that we weren't allowed to use the TC's.  So how do you really do your job?  Then after 3 months of not getting a schedule (yes, I had to beg for a schedule every week), I decided to write my resignation letter and leave it at that.  I figure if they can't give me a schedule they won't miss me at all anyway. "
bad,This was my first job and I was shown multiple skills in different areas of the store. I started off as a cashier and that was great because I learned so much about how transactions work. Then moved to pharmacy where my career really took affect.
bad,The Company is changing for the worse. If you don't stack up you are just going to be thrown the side. You will constantly be told what you are doing wrong but will not get any ideas/insight into how to get better.
bad,Walmart is a place where change is every day there. If you are not good with change this is not a place for you. Do ready to work in 3 different departments with less pay.
bad,"Management lied constantly,  had favorites they gave special projects too. Expectations were unattainable. Everyone in management were all on different pages, nobody had the same objectives"
bad,The most enjoyable part about working at walmart was having fun co workers. They unde rpay and under value their assosciates and play favoritism very loudly.
bad,The management is a complete joke they don't care who they hire all they care about is the job getting done and if you cant fulfill the job they will just replace you like you never mattered they don't take enough time to teach you how to do it they will just get another replacement for the job because its fast. Walmart dose not care about thee employees.
bad,Tienen mucho q mejorar con el trato al empleado. Y pocos beneficios para los empleados.
bad,"Not sure how it is at other Walmarts, but at my location it can be extremely stressful.  If you have a disability, you are not treated fairly by managers and customer service managers.  I have been put down and disrespected for my disability.  Nothing would be done because there are no witnesses.  If there is, they won't step forward for fear of retaliation."
bad,"Awfully poor experience working for this company. Smaller departments always get better schedules if the closing times are different from the store hours, which is the best part. From personal experience: higher management (ASM) is not your friend; they have it out for you. They did not support me in any struggles I come across regarding customers and were always missing. The pay was awfully low for the work load given to me. There is also very little room for advancing and even then the pay does not amount to what you would get with any other company. On top of that, the benefits are sad."
bad,Managers are awful don’t return phone calls. They refuse to work around personal issues. You can’t ever find them and they never give you a straight answer.
bad,"Treated like a tool.  Harsh work environment.  Playing favorites is a way of life. From the start of the day until the end of it, you will feel used and unwanted."
bad,"Walmart was the worst place that I have ever worked in my life. I would not recommend working for a company that is so dishonest . We were told that we would transition in to a HR role but instead over 600 of us was laided off, they also changed the severance package right before the  the layoff.They outsourced the job to India but they are saying the job went to Texas , to avoid having to pay the employees. Worst experience in my life."
bad,"I worked here for 9 months. I was a food sales associate making 12.50 and then became an Online Grocery associate making 14.03. The atmosphere and the people there are so bad I literally tried to kill myself. I was in a mental hospital for a month and I took a leave of absence. When I got back they made me work through the holidays without extra pay, and then they fired me for poor attendance (because I took a leave of absence). Apparently suicide doesn’t qualify for a leave of absence. Everything about Walmart is disgusting. Don’t work here."
bad,I've never I mean never worked in a place that was so  unprofessional. I would never tell anybody that I know to work at this warehouse. I gave my registration to them because every time you turned around you either got a step or a point. It wasnt just me
bad,The company favored and they got what they wanted. They had a lot of people just walking around. Their mean to the other   other employees. Although you because you out with the task time
bad,Management don't care about your problems or other issues you might be having with other coworkers all the Managers stick together and they tell each other everything its not a good company if your wanting to have a good relationship with your bosses no room to advance you get stuck in your one position and it could take years to move up definitely not worth your time
bad,"I worked at walmart for 3 and a half years, it was a big mistake I even stayed that long. It's a good job for students but that's it. I was underappreciated and over worked. I was fully trained in 5 departments and was paid the same as someone new. Management was horrible and hours all over the place. They took away our employee discount, and cut our bonus down to nothing. The attendance policy is insane,  they really expected me to kill myself over a retail job??"
bad,The store i was at was ran horrible by people that didn't know what they were doing. You were expected to do someone else's work if they were slacking. The worst managers by far
bad,"The people you work with can be cool, but management sucks. Expectations are ridiculous and want every person to do the work of two, all the while randomly cutting hours so there is no one at the store to do the job"
bad,It’s my second retail job in Canada and if I want to compare Walmart with my previous job I would confess I made a mistake choosing this job. They schedule you only if the store is busy and don’t care if you are unhappy. They put minimum associates possible to do the whole works. My previous job was way better in every way. To sum up if you have another option don’t choose Walmart.
bad,Walmart is the worst place ibhave ever worked for the employees are stressed the management is bad I remember wwhen I got hot oil in my eye i was told that noone could leave to take me to a ready care so I had to drive myself
bad,"Punishment before proff or even investigation "
bad,Do not apply you will regret it. They give you a raise then cut your hours drastically. Management are continuously lying about everything for no reason. People are losing their jobs daily because of management politics.
bad,"we were always short handed, had to multitask severals jobs, management could of cared less about anything,hardest thng was trying to get everything done before shift was over, my most enjoable part of my job, was i met some really good people in my department"
bad,"Working for Walmart was horrible, managers don't care about their employees, employees are seen as ""disposable"", way too much favoritism, if you're not one of the store manager's or dept. managers favorite,  you won't make it there"
bad,"I have worked for multiple Walmart locations, and enjoyed my previous experiences; the Portsmouth one where I currently work is a toxic, hellish environment with incompetent, vindictive management and a cliquish atmosphere that is suffocating and frustrating. Woefully understaffed, associates overworked and unappreciated, and Portsmouth, NH is the lowest-paying Walmart location in the area. There is a reason I am working so hard to find something ELSE."
bad,"This role is a typical grocery stocking position with what seems to be atypical processes attached to it.  Work volume to staffing volume is not consistent and often times leaves an imbalance which causes frustration and stress among the staff.  "
bad,Lack of respect for the individual. Associates are treated like a number. Management believe that you are indispensable and reminds you of it everyday.
bad,"I worked at DC 9193 for 22 years, and i was wrongfully terminated by a manager and HR stated i had a day off, then just to fire me on the supposed approved day off. Then they denied my day and pay the day of. This place has poor management.  What a joke, favor other associates, my manager was promoted because she was bribing the GM, she lacks all management skills. rrally  a"
bad,"This store will suck your soul out of your body. They only advance people who would make them look good on paper. Ignoring the employees who care, and who show excellent management skills in favor of people who would make the staff more diverse. They expect you to break you back for no more than minimum wage. If you value your health and sanity stay far away"
bad,My experience with the manager I had was a disgraceful relationship.  Always made you feel as though your a liability not an important piece to keeping this company on the up and up.  Never showed appreciation.  Made sure you knew you were beneath her.
bad,From the top management level in the store on down there is a dog eat dog mentality. At the end of the day you leave feeling discouraged and defeated. The work life environment in the store is very negative.
bad,"On a typical night , with inproper staffing, i looked forward to going in and helping associates achieve what they think is impossible to achieve. Gave them reassurance and possitive feedback, and kept them optimystic. I learned something new every night, but mostly learned that things are possible to achieve when you work together as a team and remain possitive. The hardest part of the job would i beleive to be equality in the store alone.  Upper management was bias to one sided stories and didnt allow a chance for someone else.  The most enhoyable part of my job was seeing associates be successful at the end of the day and that i couold help them get there."
bad,"Management is so weak. They don't have even good management skills. Even some managers have discrimination policies. Moreover, senior associates especially those are close to managers behave rudely."
bad,"To many managers, who are never on the same page about anything. This is the most chaotic place I have ever worked. Keeping any area organized is made impossible by improper management and absence of caring and work ethic"
bad,"Would not recommend, Management is very strict and if you are not working at all times without taking a bathroom break or drink break you are heavily criticized."
bad,"Its the worst job that I have ever had. When I had issues and couldn't work my way around my challenges, once I finally found methods that worked for me my manager freaked out about it and told me I need to do it the right way even though my way wasnt hurting anyone it was actually helping the team. I was always frustrated because the managers (plural) would yell at us and push us everyday and we would have meetings about how we were doing everything wrong."
bad,"In my personal opinion Walmart needs to fix a lot of things. You can’t call out for being sick without getting a point, they don’t accept doctors notes. Some managers want you to be a suck up just for them to like you. Most of the employees are fairly nice, the environment is just not the best."
bad,No of the managers are on the same page. The lied to cover there butts. The back stabbing that goes on to cover there self. The are a shellfish company and managers . I would not wont anyone to work there.  The have no humanity.  If you get sick your screwed.
bad,"If you get hurt they will blame you, and do everything they can, so you dont go to the hospital just to save face. Your just a number not an employee."
bad,Working for Walmart sucks. No work life balance. You trade your soul for Walmart but they don't care about you. On a management or hourly level it's all about the shareholders.
bad,"the position in the garage was definitely tolerable, but as a whole you are treated very poorly by Walmart management. your treated like a liar and a thief, and promised so much as far as chances to get a promotion or even full time all to be yanked from you then they hire a few more part times to fill the gap you were supposed top be getting full time to fill"
bad,"Poor attitudes and management, over worked and under paid no support from management treated like second hand leftovers. No raises for anyone who don't have a job title"
bad,"They provide no stable schedule unless you force the issue and they change company policies yearly.  The pay is completely different in most areas and the hardest physical jobs pay the least. If it keeps you from being homeless take it. Otherwise, take any other job that is legal and doesn’t risk your life."
bad,A very unfriendly and hostile work environment and no chance of advancement. A company that does not care much about their employees but only their customers.
bad,The management did not care about you. You would constantly be talked down to and belittled. The customers will treat you like trash and if you get over that you will get fired for one reason or an other in 3-6 months
bad,I worked at Walmart before they changed their minimum wage. I was given a department to manage for 4 months with the conversation being had to prove myself then I would be promoted. Only to have management bring in someone from the backend of a different store for me to train for the management position.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart the culture is amazing ! My manager was very attentive & was a role model to us , I was treated fairly hours was okay & pay"
bad,"Managers were awful didn't care about my breaks, were always late in addressing concerns from customers. I never felt like a priority. This job was one of the worst expereinces i have had. I just liked assisting the customers"
bad,They have restructured everything. The hourly employees are expected to do 2 or 3 people's jobs. Management does very little. Academy stores are a joke. It's very difficult to move to a full time employee. It's close to impossible to get benefits for part time associates. You can only get 5 points in 6 months any more and they fire you. It takes 6 months to work off a point. Don't work here.
bad,The store is very  Horrible they don’t treat the employees right like they should favoritism as well not enough teamwork or encouragement it was up to me I’ll close the store down for abandonment that’s my personal opinion I rather be honest everybody deserves a fair chance but not at that place for the 5911 was a Nightmare
bad,"Treated employees terrible, thought nothing of cutting hours even for employees that had been there 20 plus years.  Had no problem having people work tons of hours during holidays then cut full time people’s hours substantially,  always changing the rules."
bad,"I’ve been working there for almost 7 years, haven’t gotten  a raise since 2014."
bad,They are a good temparary job to have until you find a better job. They only care about the money they get from costumers. They will force you to miss hollidays with your family and will run you into the ground.
bad,"my honest review at this point of Walmart . well its not an awful place to work if you don't plan on life happening at all outside of work if you plan to never be sick have car or medical issues or to ever take time off because your children or spouse are sick this company has a sick policy of no more than 5 days in a 6 month period and they will not let you qualify for any kind of medical leave till you have been with the company for at least a year so when someone like me (who has multiple sclerosis) goes in blindly i end up losing my job for essentially having a medical condition but with no grounds to do anything legally because of the stupid policy they have you sign off on in orientation i'm pretty sure that protects them in some way but its absolutely ridiculous because other than that attendance issue i was basically the perfect employee stayed late came in on days off cam in early swapped shifts was never short on my drawer did all the things so ill leave it up to you to decide "
bad,For the most part they don't train you and then they send you into the field and tell you that you are not good at what you do instead of trying to encourage your help you it was the worst job I've ever had I am so happy that I do not work there anymore
bad,I was fired for taking time off for my mental health. I lost 2 family members in the same day and when I returned to work I was fired for that reason and was told I couldn’t come back for 3 years.
bad,"Corporate bullying and breaching of hiring contracts. Potential employees are promised certain work schedules when hired for part time. This was a part time second income job for nights and weekends, as I had another employment Mondays through Fridays during the day. During the holidays a threat by coroporate was announced that any employee of the company that did not open up their hours 7 days a week from open to close would have a reduction of hours, breaching my hiring contract. I was not going to  open up my hours to Walmart as they paid much less than my day job. I would have to take a cut in pay. I left Walmart and went elsewhere."
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart is stressful. Although the you have to constantly be on the move, I have learned a ton about using many different tools and working methods at Walmart.The management at Walmart was poor and often used certain scare tactics that are very unprofessional for any work place.The hardest part about the job was dealing with managers who used provocative language to push us, but it was not the right way. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting to work with people who were great coworkers."
bad,"Poor management- Some associates work so lavishly that they don't care at all and management does not try to improve the equal work for everyone. A few associates are hardworking and passionate. Unfortunately, they also got paid equally with lazy associates. No appreciation or incentive for hardworking and passionate associates."
bad,I stayed because of my associates for the years             Fun times overnights get blame game for 10000 pieces of freight with 16 people and zone with customers
bad,"Walmart was the worst job I have ever had at 18 years old.  The final straw was an obnoxious customer was trying to flirt with me and my manager said it was because my shirt was too tight. She then preceded to go in the back and grab a men's polo size 2x and ask me to put it on.  I was around 115 llbs so the polo was more like a dress, I put it on top of my clothes and she said I was ""crazy"" in front of customers because she wanted to send me to the bathroom to change into it. Then she told me I owed her $5. I walked over to some bank ladies that I had befriended while working there and they encouraged me to quit and told me I could do anything with my life and I did not need this job. On my break I threw off the large shirt at the CSM counter (Customer Service Manager) and I quit. I have never left a job on the spot and do not intend to do it again. But the manager was so nasty in her approach blaming me for a weirdo customer that purchased products (cotton balls and tape) to only hand me at the end and leave ""to protect my breasts from the nametag clip"" I had on my shirt. Another time I was told by a manager that an elderly woman said I was ""too friendly"". The manager told me the feedback and said that she was probably wrong but maybe I could stop being so friendly and focus on the speed. What an absolute lie to say that they cared about customer service in the training. Also, the only source of positive reinforcement was a competition on who could ring up the most products the fastest. They had me work until Midnight and come in at 5am the next Morning then when you work"
bad,It was very race oriented. An it was not right. They need to remember it's US LITTLE PEOPLE that run the company while that walk around all day...nooo
bad,"The management places production over the welfare of hard working employees. You get written up for anything, for example: clocking in at 4:46 instead of 4:55. Turnover rate high, so this is not a full-time job (company culture)."
bad,"If your a student then go for it, its a job after all. But if your looking for advancement or good management look else where cause you won't find it here."
bad,Management has no idea what they are doing and will spread you through 10 departments and chew you out when you assigned department is not up to their par
bad,Hr lady is a big phony. Company Management is all about their bonus. You as a team member will get your hours cut . Walmart treats you bad and then want you to do the Walmart cheer. Walmart continually takes things from you. Only thing good is the hourly rate . Benefits are not good. HR and management are selling their souls for this Company.
bad,There is little to no work life balance. Little to no support from co Managers. The time you put into work is not valued at all you can work 12+ hours a day and 9 days straight without them giving you a single thank you.
bad,"This company is awful. They parade around that they care about their associates. I can say firsthand they do not. Management is horrible; they will sit in the office and bad mouth associates all day while work piles up in the back and on the sales floor. Hours are cut constantly. Zero, and I mean zero, overtime. Hard-working associates are picked on and made to feel worthless, yet lazy time thieves are overlooked and keep their jobs."
bad,"If an error is made Walmart does not have any policies to suspend no matter how good your work has been even with customer accommodation. No 2nd chances, you're just terminated."
bad,"Upper management wants marionettes, not people, running their stores. Managers pick and choose what benefits they'll allow you to have and for how long. A pay differential I was told no longer existed, still very much exists, and cost me over $20,000 in wages."
bad,"Walmart just doesn’t care about its people , they throw money at managers to clean up theirs stores and then dispose of them as soon as the job is done"
bad,Favorite fake lies dishonest retraining store manger rude lies fake not fair nasty sexiest gross racist doesn’t care and lies contstanitly breaks promise never helps always point a finger
bad,I am very upset with my company and if they continue they way they do things it's going to be more of a sweat shop then job they don't care about their employees just their monet work there for a month and see
bad,"I've had to work extremely hard to get to the position that I'm in, whereas others simply were friends with upper management. This job is completely based upon friendships, rather than how hard you actually work."
bad,"WAlmart favorite quote is the customer is always right. In turn, they forget about their employees. Treat your employees better and everything else will get better"
bad,"When i first started working there i had no problem everything was great. I did my job i got paid the amount i should be getting it was cool than everything changed we ended up getting a new managers they we're terrible at there jobs they showed favoritism if they don't like you , you will get harassed to the point you either quit or get fired plus walmart does not care about their employees at all ."
bad,"Management very unprofessional. Now does not have a store manager. A lot of managers have been fired, including store managers for abuse of power among other things I refuse to reveal. Pay start off is decent if you're just looking for a start, but walk on eggshells and have another job on stand by at least because you WILL get fired even for being a good employee. TRUST me on this."
bad,Was a good place to work until they start over working you. And use to to there advantage don’t help you if you don’t understand a job task. Don’t probably train you.dont really care about you as a person.
bad,Managment needs to be on the same page. Management needs to listen to associates ideas. General managers need to be more available to all assiciates and provide honest feed back to associates and not give them the run around
bad,This was a good company with great benefits when I first got hired until they changed everything.  They will overwork you and under pay you. I had 3 job titles for over three years with no pay increase. No recognition or appreciation. In fact managers customers and associates were trying to get me fired. The customers threaten you and are allowed to get away with abuse. This should not be tolerated
bad,u better be mentally tuff..or u will most certainly blow Someone away or  be blown away  ..at the management they make so much $$ but they are almost All On the endangered species list for liying and treating assoc like scum. so if u are on the edge All ready...dont wrk for Walmart.
bad,"The Managers do not care about the employees, their well being, if they're being overworked, or if the employee is getting the hours that they asked for or not, all they care about is their quotas being filled so they aren't reemed by the GM in the morning for overnight Asm's, and it seems like most of the day employees don't care, they don't do their jobs and all of the worked just gets heaped onto the overnight stocking team. 1/10 would not work their again"
bad,"I've been employed with Walmart for over two years, worked at several different locations including a Distribution Center. In my experience there has not been a team in the work force; management has treated hourly employees as their mere ID number; and the turnover rate is high. Instead of fixing the problems, Walmart has found it easier to just get new people."
bad,"If you don’t know management personally then don’t expect to be going far in this company. Empty promises of full-time and benefits that never will happen. People talking behind your back, not wanting to do their jobs so then you have to do it. Management targets and favorites people. Other than that, Coworkers were amazing and the customers awesome. The experience overall was one i will not forget"
bad,"I didn't like working for Walmart, the management is horrible. The schedules are all over the place . The managers change  your days off last minute like they switching outfits "
bad,"Everyone’s experience is going to be different, mine was less then ideal. I’m the company’s constant change in policy’s and programs mixed with my locations management team made for confusion, lack of communication and overall just a toxic work place"
bad,"When I first started my job, I truly enjoyed and got promoted pretty fast. Over the years I watch a company transfer from a company that worked with you to a company that demands one person to do 4 person jobs. They have become a company that you are a number not a person . They will fire you n have you replaced by the end of the day."
bad,I would never again work for such a horrible company.  You do things their way without questions or you are targeted for termination. I was targeted for asking questions and asked for reasons why things were done the way they were and was told I wasn't a team player.  I wasn't being difficult I just wanted to know how they came to their decisions on procedure.
bad,I think it would be a better job if they cared more about their associates. If they gave more to the associates. They forget that we are the backbone of the company and without us it would be no Walmart. If they would stop making the associates feel like they were so replaceable.
bad,Awful hourly pay rate with 10 years working for this company. They cut hours from good hard workers and give more hours to new low paid employees. The more experience you get over time the less you will get ( $$ and hours ).
bad,Unsatisfactory and poor I did not like the supervisor manager and co workers they did not have very good attitudes and made me feel unsafe and unwelcomed
bad,"Every day going in, at least at the store I work at, brings another level of stress into my life. I constantly dread going into work. And I am not a person who doesn't like working, as I actually do. The only reason I would suggest Walmart would be because they pay better than most places in the little town I live in."
bad,the hardest part of the job was like holidays because the customer was really disrespectful n they were really rude what I learned was patience because you need a lot of it
bad,"Autocratic, ""my way or the highway"" management. FROM THE CANADIAN TO MEXICAN BORDERS.  These people will be in a world of hurt if a real trade war breaks out between the US and China."
bad,If u bring lunch giving them rides down to keep your mouth close y’all succeed in company or have relative working in management so sad sad if management is not going by company policy never work leadership start at top effects everyone
bad,Bottom of the minimum wage. Overall coworkers were rude and bullies. Work is physically demanding on feet all day and bus service doesn't cover hour requirements. Can't pay rent on wages let alone eat. A LOT OF FAVORITISM AND NEPOTISM.
bad,Management does not care about there employees. Runs the store very poorly. Management has no organization skills to run a big store. New management and store has gone downhill 99%. Would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,Lie to you right off the bat. They claim that the employees are the main focus of the company. This is false. Customers run that store. And it doesn't matter if the customer is wrong and completely out of control.
bad,"I think the management don’t know what they are doing "
bad,"Not a very good place to work. They don't really care for their associates or their health. They also claim they don't accept ""doctors notes"" when they are valid taking an associate out of work. Overall not someplace i would recommend."
bad,"Benefits worse than 2018"
bad,"I have had a bad work experience working here.The work schedules are unstable. Their biggest problem is that employ unqualified and unreliable applicants as managers in order to save money. This strategy has led to many good employees quitting as the work environment has become extremely toxic.They employees many part time students to perform duties that would be normally be performed by experienced professional to further save money. This culmination of bad business decision making has led of mess company and chaos,and total disorganization also has extremely high expectation of their employees (meaning that they expect the world from you for minimum wage)"
bad,Short and simple. Most managers can't manage their way out of a paper sack and anyone who isn't upper management suffers for it. They will say there's opportunity growth and some rare managers even try to get you into a better position just to fail due to managements incompetency. Great business model. Clearly working out for them.
bad,"Associates would not speak english on the floor or any work area. Uncomfortable place to work. Management had no idea what they are doing, and sat around in their office most of the day."
bad,your life is undesired . you go to this job you are going to break and hurt. have fun. they care little for you. your just a number. they treat you with little to no respect.
bad,"Can't say I'm a fan of this company. They seem far more concerned about money than they are their employees. Hired for one thing, forced to do another. When my personal diagnoses stood in the way of this, I was fired. Don't plan on working for them again."
bad,"Very hostilic work environment in most of the stores true meaning of ""more for less"" is fewer associates more work load Assistants not able to do there jobs because of freight market managers store managers and human Resources are hostile, condescending and rude to managers, associates"
bad,"I have never worked somewhere as horribly managed as this. Sucking up is the only way to get by or else the managers go out of their way to make your job a living nightmare . Even the higher management don’t step up when you go to them, instead they suggest you revert to the manager you have the issues with. The attendance policy is also a joke and is solely why so many people never last."
bad,"Travailler pour cette compagnie est d’emblée avec le fait d’accepter de se laisser marcher sur les pieds. Un client te manque de respect devant un supérieur et celui-ci aura l’AUDACE de te dire que le client est roi et chacun de ses caprices doit être répondus. Walmart préfère DE LOIN garder un client arrogant, méchant, impoli pour satisfaire son besoin de faire des ventes plutôt que de traiter ses employés respectueusement. Les associés sont des snakes et c’est la meilleure blague qu’on m’ait faite de me dire que walmart etait une grande famille. En effet, je dois maintenant consulter à cause d’eux. "
bad,It's was terrible .. I learned everything very quickly was good at my job  . I got pregnant like 3 months later n when I got to be 5 months pregnant my Dr. Gave a note to give HR not to pick up over 20 pounds.. n then got placed on leave for 2 months cause they said I couldn't do my job then I made a fuss got to go back for the last month before FLMA ...Human Resources is a joke..
bad,I was employed with walmart for 10 god aweful years. I held supervisor roles and salaried manager. The company only cares about numbers at the expense of their employees. If you know the right people and dont care about having a life outside of work then you can go far. I dont recommend working here. If you shop there you can see how miserable everyone truly is.
bad,The work environment is tense and very much under appreciated by under management and customers. i wouldn't recommend anyone to work there no more then part time.
bad,"Employee's are favored and backstabbers, and no one believes in answering the phone to assist customers when they call, including management! They don't care about the employees or the customers, only when Corporate People come into the Store! Loss Prevention will watch People Eat, and drink items in the Store without paying for it, and will Not say a word to the Customer! Customers are STEALING BOLDLY!"
bad,"If you are looking for just a job, something  secondary, this may be an ok place. Walmart policies and management is TERRIBLE! Employees are not valued. They don’t except doctors notes for illness related absences. (Even if you have the flu.) You have to work all holidays and upcoming/following days. PTO is nearly impossible to accrue. Management is VERY negligent"
bad,"This is not a good place to work. The distribution center is full of favoritism. If management don't like you, you will not move up in the company no matter what your skills are."
bad,Just not for me. This job was not good for my family and the time I wanted to have with them. Management was a joke really and no ine wanted to hear any feedback to help the job.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Walmart to my worst enemy. Walmart in my opinion,  believes in brown nosing to move up in the company. They treat their associates with little or no respect."
bad,"Straight to the point, this company does not value its own workers, they are a disposable resource, they don't have a name and life outside work does not matter."
bad,"Bluntly speaking, it was a fecal show."
bad,They dont treat employees fairly they are very disrespectful. They are constantly changing dress code. And they also overwork you for what youre paid.
bad,Management (some) are horrible they the see you as a major player in the company.They treat you like you’re easily replaceable. You may meet some great people there but overall it’s not somewhere you want to stay very long
bad,"Associates reflect mgt. Meaning if management is decent it would be seen as Associates are happy or content. "
bad,I worked in the wal mart in Plymouth mass has a stocker and the mangers there werent that great i feel like they didnt trust there employees to do there jobs some of there employees were very rude and don't deserve to work there like one old woman told me dont ask how she is doing like i really care anyway but i was trying to be nice but people today really need to learn how to respect others when they really dont in a big company like that i will never go back there iv found a better paying job and better people to work with
bad,I worked there 11 years never missed a day of work.. was a good respectful and hard-working employee.. but no opportunities .. I think personally that age had a lot to do with not being able to be interviewed for any management positions..  that place the harder you work the less they care about you
bad,"Walmart is a soul sucking company to work for. They put the company over its employees. No holidays off ever, if your sick it’s your fault your fired. They beat you down until there’s nothing left then toss you like you never mattered"
bad,"This company only cares about the $$$. They set unattainable goals so you can't get bonuses. They keep adding more work demands and less auxillary help to get the work done. It's a super high stress job and the only thanks you ever get is your paycheck every other week. Also, there is no company loyalty. They fire people at will for completely made up reasons. It's really a terrible company."
bad,They expect to much out of one person working together was not incuriged. Favoritism was a big problem . The hole 10 in a have year s I was there I was treated poorly by Management .
bad,Everyone is looking out for only themselves and no member of management values any associate. Management is only concerned with the current hot initiative and has no desire to improve sustainability. Pitiful staffing (under staffed).
bad,Management is awful. Very hard to get and keep a good schedule due to what they call “business needs” Great start out job if you want to work like a dog and get 0 rewards
bad,"High turnover, but some people love it. Some members of management are good at their job, but there are others that take pride in making the job worse. The same store I worked in has management members being charged with serious crimes."
bad,"The DC is awful! Unattainable goals, rude management, minimal paid time off, no holidays off or extra pay for working holidays. They get you in the door by offering a higher base rate of pay but it's not worth it!"
bad,Not paid nearly enough for what they expect.  Customers are the nastiest creatures on this planet.  They rate on the same level as some of the creepy crawlers in the food side of store.  Wouldn't wish this place on anyone.
bad,"omg, they always put the customers first even though most of the time they are wrong and it is annoying. The people who tell you where to go are most of the time rude you will get blamed for what WalMart does by customers and they will want you to fix it like you own the dang store. I hated it thereafter they wouldn't move my station when I asked them to over and over also when you're sick they won't let you use your doctor's note and will fire you over it."
bad,"greeting customers, collecting payments, using scanning devices, answering to customer inquiries, accepting customer returns, and counting the money in the cash drawer."
bad,"Stressful, overworked, underpaid, always looking over your shoulder to make sure you are doing things properly."
bad,"This is a company that expects you to bend over backwards for them when they make it obvious how expendable you are. Management is a mess. They do not  accept doctors notes for any reason (I had surgery and missed 3 days of work and it was held against me). The only positive thing about Walmart is that they pay decently, HOWEVER the amount of mistreatment you have to endure is not worth the paycheck. Worst year and a half of my life."
bad,"Good old boys/girls club. If you don’t have long tenure at Walmart, you won’t feel included as a part of the group. They also expect you will move anywhere for them and they don’t observe remote working although they have video meeting technology (Zoom)."
bad,"please do not work at this place trust me after a few months you will understand why. I got threatening by costumers, managers are racist and sexist. I will not recommend"
bad,"Mismanagement Accusations and no appreciation. "
bad,"Management steals ideas and calls them their own. When you call them out, they make your life terrible. Nobody held accountable for poor production. All I learned was what not to do."
bad,"After almost nine years with the company, half of those being in a management role, Walmart decided to close my shift at my store. The options for placement were horrible and they made NO effort to help us find new roles. It is obvious the company cares nothing about dedication and loyalty and I decided to take my employment elsewhere."
bad,If Wal-Mart hired better management teams to follow what WAL-MART says it stands for then it would be a better place to work. But that is not the case they play favoritisms all the time and if u are not in the click with them then u won’t survive if u not strong enough to handle the mess but I was and i quit wen it was enough for me my prayer is that I hope they treat the new people who apply and work for them better in the future
bad,Working at Walmart is a waste of time for my level of education. There is a lack of advancement opportunities especially for those with college degrees. The company is run poorly and is severely understaffed. The funny thing is they expect you to do so many things and get away with paying associates such low wages.
bad,a typical day would be us as the unload team spend any where from an hour or more setting things set up then towards then end of the night asked why things are not done sooner.
bad,Don't. Just don't work there. Save yourself from a nightmare. They treat people poorly there. The managers keep more mess going on there than a little. The work-snitch/manager-wannabes will LIE on you and REPORT every little thing you do to advance themselves. Work for TARGET.
bad,"Good management lacking; policies on attendance -clock- in are changing without adequate communication with employees.  Some employees are bullies without consequences. If you complain, you are more likely to get picked on.more.  Some employee teams are great with bonding and friendships.  It depends on the Department,and department supervisors.  After 4.5 years, I watched morale go down terribly.  Attendance and point policy is needlessly complicated.  Subtle levels of ruthlessness."
bad,They are always hiring but i didn't get trained and not much equipment to work with which is crazy because it a big company and shoud have alot equipment and it well know company that make alot of money and when i work there no one at the office only like two day or later in the day most of the training is video which i think it should be hand on then videos which i think hand on is better i learn better like that.
bad,It was a job to get me on my feet when I moved up here but had no desire to stay for as long as I did. ...............................................
bad,Men advance a lot quicker than women. Men's ideas are put into practice and women's are laughed at. Men get full time and all the hours while women are told to remind the managers.
bad,Walmart is a very terrible place to work  I was in the hospital with kidney stones and basically got fired  management does not care about their employees well being
bad,"Horrible management, all they do is talk trash and be hypocrites! They don’t care about anything. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME THERE. All the stuff that’s said and mentioned in the interview is a lie. You barely get your fifteen minute break... you barely get to go to lunch. They’re not reasonable it’s corrupt and freaking sick! Hate it. Hate it. Worked in the rain, extreme heat because nobody lazy behind would do it!!"
bad,"The department managers are treated horribly sometimes. There is NO holiday pay. They will not allow even a minute of overtime most of the time. One store had bed bugs and home office did almost nothing, last I saw they never even treated it correctly and tried to avoid talking about it."
bad,"Management threatens your job everyday. Instead of holding individual managers accountable, the punish everyone with having to work extra days with no compensation."
bad,"third shift is the scapegoat for every single thing that goes wrong at neenah walmart. we are expected to do EVERYTHING with 3-4 people. and with the company restructuring, they were hiring 70 dayshifters to replace us. so.... we were apparently working 20 times harder than they expect dayshift to work, and were still told every single day how much we suck and need to work harder and faster. it's an unfunny joke. i've never been happier to leave a job."
bad,"I would not call them managers, they are just bodies in the building. The store manager acts like she is high school and tries to fit in with assistant managers and they have select favorite associates. If you are their ""pet"" you basically can walk around all day with air pods/earbuds in your ears all day and do nothing and nothing is said to you, but if management doesn't like you, you get all the work to do, work other departments and when your work isn't done, they want to hold you accountable."
bad,"Horrible place to work, forget about you’re social life you get to work every single weekend and you have to beg for any Saturday or Sunday, management is really bad, managers or people who’s been working there for years treat you like trash , they don’t care about their associates."
bad,I hate how he managers talk to people  I been working for Walmart three years this the worst years of them all I wish it get better they have favoritisms that’s not right
bad,"Management was a joke. We at one time had awesome managers, you had a problem with working a certain day? They would fix it for you. I had a problem with not having a day off for the weekend at one time, the old mangers helped get me a Friday off so my other coworkers could have Saturday and Sunday off mandatory. Then when those managers left and new ones came in they changed it back and i complained i hadn't had a weekend off in over 4 months and they did nothing to help, just tokd me that management has to do it...so i should have no problem doing it. Mangers are just poor and do not help the hard working employees. And they will over work tou if you do your job right and fast."
bad,I hate Walmart. I worked so hard and in the end I was disappointed on how they treated me. Management is terrible and they care not one bit about their employees. I can say that I learned a lot about retail and can take that knowledge and move forward with my life and do better.
bad,Local ótimo pra se trabalhar a empresa muito certa com suas contas a serem pagas.sempre tudo conforme as leias.
bad,"The job was great up until about three weeks in. After this, bullying & mobbing by several co-workers, even supervisors. It's an extremely unfriendly environment for Christians (you are mocked openly). One co-worker threatened my person. I was taken away from my dept & no disciplinary action taken on bullies."
bad,"La gente que está a cargó no es profesional , ni tienen ética."
bad,"Walmart any where in the world is a bad place to work, once you get hurt on the floor they don't care about you, never work for them. i did't like it there."
bad,I always wanted to work at Wal-Mart cuz I thought it would be a great job but I was wrong. The managers were rude and did not give direction. The other associates were always trying to make sure I didn't get my job done so I couldn't take their job. Other than that the customers were amazing at times.
bad,Don’t do it  you’ll hate it and yourself. Worst couple of years of my life.  Management sucks  they don’t care about ur life  they will work u like a dog and you’ll get no appreciation
bad,"They don't do benefits well, advancements are promised and not delivered, raises are irrelevant in amount, things are generally unorganized, and the atmosphere is depressive and trapping."
bad,Just like every retail job the management is more concerned about the all mighty dollar and not the employees.  The Walmart that I worked at removed 12 tills and put in self serve tills putting people out of their job.
bad,Just can say a survival job! If you are looking for a job that lets you pay your bills absolutely is the one. In this job most of customers are treating you like a slave and get advantages of you if you don't know how to deal with them. Always you are going to be short handed because when who join the company very soon find out the pay is not enough in compare with other retail stores and they leave in a month or few months.
bad,"If you want to work for someone who does not appreciate you then this is the place, you will be abused,over worked and everyone complains about the place."
bad,"Es una empresa mala con sueldos malos y horarios muy demandantes, el ambiente entre asociados es muy cordial y amable ademas por los tiempos tan elevados se vuelven tu segunda familia, lamentablemente los sub gerentes son nefastos y con un ego subido ademas siempre están acosando a las asociadas los sub gerentes hombres no todos pero de la sucursal en la que estuve los 2 lo hacían y la sub gerente mujer era nefasta e ignorante, es muy mala empresa para hacer carrera pero buena opción para salir de un problema en lo que buscas un buen trabajo."
bad,"Uncaring, sleazy, cheap. Will always try and find a way to rip you off, whether it be through taxes or the classic ""well hire you part time, but work you 39.9 hours a week so that we dont have to give you full time benefits"""
bad,"Worked various positions over four years and actually preferred cart associate. Management ignores the position, so little oversight but also no help or coverage. Sadly I think the company expects people to show up and do as little as possible to collect a check. The harder you work the more unapperciated you will feel thanks to the pay scale and flat raises. my last 3 years"
bad,I worked for Walmart for a Month and on my 2nd day of training I was put on the floor. I received little to no training and was told to figure it out my self by multiple staff members including my own Team leaders.
bad,"Typical night involved pulling out pallets of products and stocking aisles. We work from 10pm to 7am with far too many items to stock. Computer system often orders too many items making associates constantly have to send back entire boxes of product. Managers typically blame overstock on employees not stocking the item when the item slot is full. One manager consistently yelled at new employees forcing them to leave and never return."
bad,"What a joke.... Toxic ,filled with catty small minded humans. Rumor mill , back stabbing , lack of professionalism. It's a job to get you by that's about it"
bad,"I have worked in customer service for nearly a decade and have never worked for a company as terrible as walmart. When you first start, they promise you all these things and opportunities they are going to give you, that they are flexible and laid back. It's a total lie. They are unreliable, and every little thing will be held over your head. Staffing is a huge issue, partly because no one can make a schedule, and partly because they can't keep workers. It is extremely stressful, and they don't care about their employees. The attendence policy basically holds employees hostage. You are allowed 4 call ins, and any more than that and you are fired. You can aquire paid time off, but you get it so slowly that it's not even worth it. Good luck if you ever need to take a leave because you don't have enough time to cover if you get sick, because you will be denied and you will get fired. Management is a joke, and no one is ever on the same page. Save your sanity, and don't work for this company."
bad,Manager really really bad actitud racism always look bad to hispanic people they dont like latin people. No hours just 15 hour a week to latin people.
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone as a first job as management leads by intimidation and does not follow their own company policies and procedures.    "
bad,"Walmart is a joke of a career in my opinion, they pay spine breaking associates who will risk their own health and well being for minimum wage, These are good hardworking people who deserve better. I am a former employee whose seen it first hand, you’ve got management who’s stuck in this deluded state of mind where they all act with a condescending tone and a sense of entitlement like if everyone there is in High school  and the management team are the jocks bullying their way and stepping on the little people (Walmart associates), you could almost say they’re kids with way too much power and very little supervision from their higher ups, they’ll talk to u how they please because they feel Untouchable, at the end of the day it’s your word against theirs sure you can go to hr or to corporate but if there's no solid proof your complaint will get tossed like yesterday’s salad. But seriously guys I really do mean it when I say it will feel like a negative environment. I could go on and on but for now take this warning and think about it."
bad,Loved working with the customers but the management was lacking in experience. I would love to work there again but not while the store is u deer their current situation
bad,Would not reccomend to anyone.  It is the only job I have ever left without notice.  Breaks lunches are .never scheduled.  You may or may not get lunch or break.  Too many chiefs not enough Indians.
bad,"Walmart is nothing like it used to be when it started. Work load is ridiculous, 1 person for 3 departments, they are extremely racist with minorities."
bad,Walmart is a super streesful and to be honest a hostile type place to work.  Managers are do nt work well with there employees and show a lack of empathy.   They have poor customer service and have a high turnaround on All levels from associate to management because if these issues.
bad,Nothing Burger most are looking for self-advancement and I'm not concerned about other people. Some managers think that they own you and whatever their lifestyle and Company ideas are that you should be following lock stuck with them
bad,"This place doesn't create a really good work environment for there associates. They pin too much stress on associates, who don't need or deserve it. They expect you work until your work is done and then later make you leave early for staying late. The environment around some of the managers is very toxic and doesn't allow people to voice concern they are are label as undermining management"
bad,Bad managers not understanding at all stretched you to your limit and got no help or assistance when i started new expanded fresh position. very little training and the zone manager was always helping another section of the store while i was struggling to keep up.
bad,I did not enjoy my work experience at Walmart. Management was not available when needed. I was consistently scheduled outside of my availability. Employee morale was low due to a lack of leadership.
bad,"Management treats associates unfairly, no support system if you need it and they don’t work with you on the days off you need for your personal life. Management has no regard for their associates and they do not treat you with respect. Been there 4 years and I can’t get the hours I want or the days off I want to spend with my husband and our kid. They claim seniority gets first pick when I reached mine and they refuse to give me weekends off and don’t respect that my husband works 3rd shift, they do not injure by your work availability"
bad,"No work ethics, all management cares about is making themselves look good. If they can make you look bad in order to make themselves look better they will without hesitation."
bad,"This may not be for all Walmart’s, but they really need to be mindful of who they put in management. They have no concerns about their employees and it’s not Family oriented as they would say."
bad,"Management is terrible, they don’t care about the employees,  they let the  DM’s get away with everything, Overall they don’t care about the employees"
bad,"Management always had the employees due more tasks and job traits. A lot of employees were under stress, as well as lack of sleep due to irregular schedules. No holiday pay or having the holidays off."
bad,"Mindless job, loved the associates I worked with, management was clueless."
bad,"When I started, I had a department manager for 1 week. She was transferred and I had to be trained by my coworkers who I rarely saw due to the department being understaffed constantly. There is no organization. I saw upper management once a week at maximum, and was rarely told what needed to be done. Although I was part time, I was regularly hitting the 39 hour mark on my schedule with shifts that ended at 10pm and the next starting at 7am."
bad,"I worked for two Wal-Mart stores, both lacked employees for the job. The management was awful, never on the same page and quick to ignore issues when they ocurr. The point system is awful when your job exposes you to many sick individuals daily. I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Had to leave because of unfairness. Out on FMLA and husband got sick then I got sick. Came back to work to reduced hours. 20 + year dedicated associate reduced from 40 wk to 18 hrs per week which made maintaining home impossible. Forced out of my position by store manager. Plus work duties increased.
bad,It seems like the best and most hard working employees get treated terribly and the worse ones get the praises and Accolades. Poor management. Very stressful place and low morale.
bad,"Work overall was ok- managers pick favorites though. We had a new supervisor come in halfway through my time working there. Told me I was ""half a person"" and ""didn't do anything anyway"" while I was cleaning the back room while he stood and watched me. Told the manager over him about it, who said he suspected this supervisor would say something like that and he would talk to him. Nothing was ultimately done, instead I was coached for efficiency.Not long after, an employee from a different area of the store grabbed me while we were on the clock, on camera. I spoke to his supervisor who advised me to leave it alone because""it would be a bother to open an investigation""  I left shortly after."
bad,"Management is terrible. Hours were cut dramatically. No benefits. There were chances to advance in Walmart, but only if you were friends with management. Many times we were understaffed, and had very angry customers. I do not recommend working for Walmart unless it is your absolute last resort!!!!"
bad,They work you to the bone and dont care. You would go to management but nothing would ever get done. They could care less about you and what you had going on.
bad,They do not stand behind employees. No paid holidays. I was told it was full-time. They don't even have full-time. They give you dirty ripped vests to take home and wash. A measly 10 percent of purchases.
bad,Walmart was the worst place ive worked I told my managers what needed to be done for me to complete my job and the ignored me for months and tried getting me in trouble for the problems I told them needed to be fixed.
bad,It was ok when i worked there but managenent wasnt really good with there emplyees and there wasnt any team work there and i wasnt really empressed with the job there
bad,Walmart didn’t care about their employees at all they got treated bad and the managers dont care about anyone’s health a typical day at work is getting yelled at for not doing things right or trying your best when your in pain
bad,"En tan solo dos años vi como corrieron a mas de 50 persona de solo mi area y poco mas de 200 de otras areas. Solo tiene el renombre, pero el ambiente laboral es super pesado y las personas que ocupan los altos rangos no son nada humanos."
bad,"Very stressful, management wants this this and this done but we don't have enough people, they don't replace people who leave and they expect you to stay over on bad days but then take a long lunch to keep you under overtime."
bad,The company will over work you and under pay you the management abuses their power and 85% of the employees slack and get away with it which makes you have to pick up the part and if it incompetent they try to fire you even though it wasn’t your work they do not approve many vacation days and they want it is 6 months in advance
bad,"I worked at Walmart on Hwy 29 for about 6 months. The management is what’s wrong with the store. Also there are WAY too many managers, and 90% of them don’t do their jobs. Management promotes the people who are friends with them, not necessarily the people that actually deserve to be promoted. Favoritism is ridiculous there. I worked at the fitting room and in apparel, but you are always pulled to do other people’s jobs like cashiering. If they would actually give the cashiers hours, they could avoid that problem. Management also will lie right to your face about everything, even small, unimportant things. They do offer some benefits, but they aren’t very good. Employees get a discount of 20%, but when I worked there, you couldn’t use it on groceries. The training is decent on the first couple of days. If you still have training videos left to watch, good luck trying to get off of the sales floor to complete them since the department managers usually won’t let you. And if you don’t do them, you can potentially get fired. The hours are pretty great in the beginning, but once you get past the 90 day mark, they start cutting hours. Right before I left I was getting 15-20 hours a week as opposed to the 35-40 hours a week that I was getting at the start. The turnover rate is pretty high, also."
bad,"Lugar Ruim de trabalhar,nao tem beneficios ..muita cobrança em cima dos funcionarios e nenhum incentivo para querer crescer na empresa,nenhuma preocupaçao com funcionario de tratam como um objeto,refeiçao na empresa mas é horrivel."
bad,"You will be expected to work the hours you say you can work and they will sometimes try to schedule you outside those hours. They have a point system so of you get sick dont bother with a doctors note ( they dont accept them). If you work overtime, you will receive regular pay there is no overtime or holiday pay. They will also give you full time hours but hire you as part time so you will have to work a year to get medical benefits. The discount card is not very helpful unless you are paying full price for merchandise and your total is at least S200. Certain people can come in and change postions whenever they want ""others"" will be told to wait 6 months."
bad,"Would not reccomend it for any one  e cause mgt creates hostile work environment at DC 7067"
bad,When I first transferred to the store everything was okay then the csm am other manager start changing there mind on how we are suppose to take care of customer some associate could do whatever they want other if they did something little bit wrong they were in trouble over all I wouldn’t work at this store
bad,"I was so excited about working for this company but quickly realized that Walmart use modern day slavery/sweat shop tactics. extremely stressful environment, constant retaliation, constant write up. breaks are unethical to say the least you get two 20 minute breaks for the 12 hour shift. the warehouse you are locked in, no phones, no fresh air, no gum, no candy, no chapstick, no hair on shoulder, etc.  you feel extremely unappreciated as an employee watching my peers being missed treated and chased down while on breaks to return to work."
bad,"The entire time that I worked there the department was understaffed. On my third day of training, I had to handle a truck delivery by myself. After I put in my two weeks notice I was pushed out. They made up reasons to not have me around for the next two weeks."
bad,"After being trained in so many different departments they refused to give me a pay raise or let me have the title of one of the higher paying positions I had been trained in. Then they started changing my schedule randomly and I would miss shifts, they then called me ""unreliable"". Prior to a new company policy that would have gotten me the raise in pay based on all of the areas I knew how to do, they pulled the ""unreliable"" card again after we had already supposedly straightened it out, and I was fired out of the blue."
bad,"This is the worst place to work ever! Beware... Favoritism, racism, inconsistent hours, poor upper management! I was a front end manager and upper management would Never help..."
bad,In all honesty Walmart has went down hill. They got rid of the door greeters. And more and more people are losing their job because of the computers. They need to have registers back and people working. Not all people like scanning their stuff when it's easier with a cashier. All lanes are always slow. We shop at night so we don't have to wait an hour after we shop to check out.
bad,"Working at Hellmart™ was the opposite of a commercial for Old Spice."
bad,Lowered hours so much I didn’t qualify for quarterly bonus half my coworkers didn’t work but looked busy so they never got in trouble but if I sat down after doing the majority of the work I would get yelled at and they threaten you with loosing your job every so often just a garbage company all around only care about numbers and looking busy don’t pay attention to the real workers and even when they do they still treat you unfairly
bad,"Horrible place to work at management is terrible , job security not good they will terminate you for no reason. This place is good for retired people or unless you are a manger higher in the company but so far of me working there I was stress out working there, no team work involved schedules Are made horrible have you working by yourself. I would never work back there ever in my life"
bad,bad management and very busy w little staff. they like to schedule you for very long hours and they want you to work to death until they can hire your replacement a week later.
bad,Retail overall sucks and the people at this walmart are intolerable. They think they know everything and the store manager sheesh I wont even go there
bad,The manager was never around they pointed me for having a very important doctors appointment that I had informed my manager about a week in advance! The store is very disorganized the registers are so out of date customers get upset because the associates are rude and very impatient! I absolutely hated my job there and I know a lot of others that are unhappy as well! I do not recommend working there! It’s like a playground for these associates they gossip about personal things that were talked about privately with the MANAGERS!
bad,If you can ignore the imbalances and keep your head down you’ll be fine. You’ll do even better if you’re a yes person. Document everything and emails are the best form of communication so management cannot ignore or pretend to never have know about your questions etc.
bad,"Boy were to start, low pay to begin with. Managers some the most incompetent creatures; just work here for 5 to 10 years and you'll eventually move into this position. All employees at this Wal-Mart hates the job; big red flag. No holiday day, nothing good to really say. A few co-workers I do enjoy being around, other than that. I would not work here."
bad,Great Job just whatever you do don't feed into the negativity and drama surrounding just ask for your tasks and continue working until your shift is over don't make friend don't fraternize and don't make any enemies with the managers. Stay professional at all times you never know who your talking to and who within the store is actual Walmart corporate personnel.
bad,Majority of co-workers are rude and disgusting people that like to instigate fights. Management didn’t do anything about those co-workers. They expected too much..
bad,"Favoritism, and management is always right the associates dont have a right to complaint about managers. If you have a complaint you have to do it with with the main office."
bad,"Fast-paced, stressful, very little recognition for work, favoritism, quality benefits. Very focused on change. Of course to keep up with the ever-changing retail environment. Often times changes and communicated well."
bad,"50% of management has “Attitude” problems which drives associates out of their jobs, you have a position as supervisor, Department manager or assistant manager then they will view you at the same level as themselves and not look down on you as they do with a basic associate. Benefits “Suck” PTO is “Disgusting” work 41.5 hours to get 1 hours vacation time within first 1-2 years of employment,"
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to be employed and a great way to go nowhere in life. Management will not follow company policy and associates never know how to do their job (or even try). For example, the location of St James avenue recycles nothing and uses chemicals they aren't allowed to because with no system of disposal, they are poured down the drain. Walmart also takes advantage of its disabled workers and it is sad. For 3 months straight this company made violations giving me close-open constantly every week calling me back in to work without an 8 hour period off the clock. I gave the company open availability 7 days saying only that i couldn't open right after closing. They continued to ignore my availability forms. I have never dealt with a company like this before. My wife and I left and she sold her Wal-Mart stock. We hope to never darken the doors of such a twisted circus ever again...Even if it saves money."
bad,I've worked many places in Pueblo and thought this huge corporation would be different. They do not appreciate hard work and do not reprimand people who don't. They will let you do all the work and expect more while some employees just do what they want. Which means they don't even pull their weight. So let's just say those employees are getting paid while we do their job.  Don't get me wrong there are some management that care but nothing they can do. They aren't even happy themselves. This place is not worth the stress. If you are a hard worker this place doesn't deserve you.
bad,"Before you apply at Walmart ask anyone who has worked there what life is like. The responses will most likely be negative. They used to offer good benefits but no longer. They used to offer vacation but restructured so employees get less and have to earn it throughout the year. This means that no one starts out with vacation, everyone tries to apply for time off at the same time, and November through December are basically blacked out. They expect great output from employees, but the work environment is anything but motivational. More like work harder with less."
bad,"I will never work at Walmart again. Management is biased, takes out their stress on you, and expects you to do their job for them. You’re constantly getting yelled at by customers, management, and people act like they’re in high school. Also it’s not safe"
bad,The worse place I have ever worked by far. Management trampled me and I had no way of fighting back the situation just went from bad to worse and I watched everyone around me get fired then I. Terrible place to work would not recommend it.
bad,Unless u like stress and lots of it rude customers and constantly changing schedules its not worth it they give u a paper to fill out about your availability they don't go by it u will have days where u work later then u put down u can be hired on for full time there's no promise of full time hrs u will do good to get 8 hrs a day and really good if u get 40 hrs a week
bad,"You get paid for exactly what you do. Simple job. Can be laborious if you work in recieving. Very childish culture like high school. Management sleeps with employees. Rumors all the time. Targeting is an acceptable culture. Imagine life’s rejects under 1 roof. That’s Walmart. It was my first job and I gave 5 years to the company, eventually went on to try a different field. Stable job everyone there had tenure 10+ years, which should give you the idea that all bad habits and antics have been marinating for decades. If you’re an ambitious mature individual this job is not for you."
bad,"They hire anyone with a pulse that hasn’t completely burned every bridge with the company. I got hired on the same day I interviewed. If you work hard, have common sense, and don’t slack off they’ll reward you with even more work. Maybe a promotion, with barely increased pay and even more stress."
bad,"I have worked here for a year and a half up until I was terminated for another associate came behind me assaulted me and I defended myself. The work is easy but Walmart is not a company you want to work for. I made a couple of good friends with co-workers and I got respect from everybody in my dept. This was a job that was getting me through college so it was no big loss there. Plus now they are cutting hours majorly. I normally was scheduled 37 hours a week, and then it dropped down to 5 hours a week. I was looking for another job anyway. When I started they worked around my schedule and the assistant manager who was overseeing my department at the the time was awesome. He understood I had a life outside Walmart AND worked around my school schedule.  Ironically enough I got fired around the time he was set to leave Walmart."
bad,Managers are rude. Their not considerate of others availability.  Rude.Store manager always has an attitude.  Threatening employees with being fired if their not available to work out of their availability window.
bad,A typical day at walmart is get to work and scan as many grocery items thru the till as fast as possible.  Sell those Mastercard applications...Make sure you take your breaks but if we forget to relieve you too bad you should let us know. This company makes it look like you can climb the ladder and get regular raises but you have to have 100% in everything or you get 10 Cents an hour.
bad,"Worked for Walmart for 5 years, I never received full time therefore I couldn't get medical benefits. It's a dead end job. They tell me I was a great worker but got shot down 8 times when I tried to move up in company. They would bring in other employees from other stores rather than promot within the store. They request for you to do more than what is in your job description. Overall it's a horrible place to work"
bad,"Depends on your shift be coming in at 5 a.m. going to pick people's stuff until people start coming into the store then it's bad getting through trying to pick everything before 2 p.m. people decide to leave on time with a whole bunch of stuff still being picked then the kidnapped people from different departments (some time) are they take you from dispense and make you pick then dispense all day"
bad,walmart is a bad place to work. i hated working there. they do not appreciate their works at all. only advise to work there for a couple of months and then leave as soon as you can
bad,"Mainly worked overnights, making sure that the stocking was done and the store was recovered and was ready for business the next day.  Took care of customer and associate issues on a daily basis."
bad,"The only job, I actually hated going to every day. The first shift, I actually had a good manager. Who cared, and understood our frustration, once I switched shifts. No more caring managers."
bad,As far as im concerned walmart ruined my life by lying about me saying i stole from their company when i didnt  and ruining any chance of me ever getting another good job again
bad,They never want you to get overtime but get your work done befor you leave that make for 12 people with 3 people or less. In almost every depment. Also get in trouble if clock in to early or 10 min late. They want take all break get job done to wich almost impossible.
bad,I have worked in 3 stores and in all three stores the management team was disrespectful angry and took delight in being rude to associates.  Half of them are under 25 and I don’t know how they got through middle school I’m sure they are not college graduates.
bad,"I had a 5 month stint with Walmart as a 'Setup Associate' working to remodel one of their stores. It was not enjoyable. A supervisor made it a hobby to make fun of the remodel team, the regular store managers also berated the team. Worst part was when the remodel team had to work near active welding sites, without eye and breathing protection."
bad,"Company is not enjoyable, very stressful"
bad,Awful. I work there part time because i still go to school. They don't care about that and only care about the hours I work. They give me unrealistic scheduling.  A Manager will tell me I'm one of thr fastest workers but then another manager will have me retrained for no real serious reason.
bad,"They try to get as much work out of you as they can. Then have alot of handicapped people, people with disabilities working half as hard for the same pay .Manager LIES to us like there is no tomarrow!"
bad,The worst company ever don’t care about their associates I was fired after 19 1/2 basically because of my health issues. Working here is a huge mistake a total waste of time
bad,"Your work day is 8 hrs of wk and 1 hr of lunch.  You not only are expected to do your job, but others as well, plus more work they want you to do in a certain amount of time. "
bad,"Walmart is a very stressful place to work, you’re overworked with little help in each and every department.  It’s hard to get days off and management is poor and doesn’t care about their associates"
bad,"The worst management  ever. You would think # 1 company  on the Fortune  500 would have managers with experience,  professional,  and with integrity, but they don't.  They are pathetic  !"
bad,North Jackson Walmart is honestly the worst job I've had. They need to start at the top with the store manager and clean out management. They don't care about their employees like they say they do. They schedule me during classes and give me points for it. So then I miss out on MyShare. They don't care about your availability or well being. I've watched employees get hurt and expected to keep going. Don't dare slow down production! Not to mention getting talked to like a dog.
bad,"cooked cleaned putting up heavy frozen boxes of foods in the freezers"
bad,"Awful stay far far far way..dead end poor management, unreal expectations. OK they will give you hours and then make you cut them later in the week ASM's never follow through and do what they're gonna say awful life work balance find another place to work"
bad,"I am currently in the Walmart twice a week, Lines are out the doors with two registers open and 19 other staff people walking around doing nothing or just socializing, I literally watched a supervisor step over a pile of spilled food in one of the aisles and was the spill was there the next day to, same food same aisle. Place is awful. and no help to anyone, they offer 13.50 and hr and full insurance so realistically your making 7/hr., Walmart is a lazy person job or where you just hang out"
bad,"I could envision Wal-Mart as an OK place to work if the management is good. If the management is inferior, then it’s going to most likely be a negative work experience."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to go to work at the Walmart corporate office.  Managers create and allow unnecessary drama to fester. Overall,  the pay was decent.  The work environment was hostile and mentally exhausting."
bad,"The job is awful and management doesn’t care about employees, it is mostly politics in there. Customers steal all day out of there can’t leave any belongings unattended or they will be stole"
bad,They new policy is designed to get rid of people. They put so much on one person and then it it doesn't get done in the time. It a real stressful environment.
bad,Its was okay for awhile. Then u start to notice that management has favorites. If you arent going to be their pet then it's not a place for you. No one there is treated the same. If you make them mad or if you use the open door policy. They will know and will hold it against you. Some of the associates that work there are friendly. Some wont even talk to you unless they need something.
bad,Es una empresa seria y si te dan las prestaciones de ley en forma y tiempo pero es muy bajo el salario y es mucho lo que te explotan
bad,Walmart was like a task master and the harder you worked the less they seemed to appreciate you.I worked for them for over 5 years and worked my way up in pay slowly and was unceremonisly fired for a bogus reason so they could hire someone for leSS $ I did receive  unemployment because it was an unfair dismissal.
bad,I worked at Walmart for 5years and didn't get one offer for advancement. They would higher people off the streets with less experience and have me train them. Was expected to do more work than physically possible. Job was threatened on an houly basis by different managers including the store manager. Wastold to ignore customers
bad,The company makes alot of irrational choices after all the waltons passed .They nolonger have there core beliefs. RESPECT WAS AT THE TOP OF THE CORE IT IS NO MORE.
bad,Very unfair work environment. Very poor management. Not a very ethical place. Stressful and unreasonable environment. I dont think workers are paid enough for how they get treated.
bad,"Management was very cliquish. They never gave compliments, but they were real quick to tell you how terrible you are then ask you to work harder. They don’t care about your personal life. Walmart comes first. If you cause too many waves in their way of doing things, they cut your hours. God forbid you have to take LOA for something serious, oh like maybe 2 heart attacks. It’s a nightmare working with Sedgwick to keep your job and if you don’t come back to work in an amount of time suitable for them, you will have to defend your job with everything you’ve got. They string you along about promotions and then give it to the ones that kiss the most butt. They do not defend you to customers when doing your job, instead they will undermine you and reprimand you in front of customers. Worst 4 years of my life."
bad,"Never enough hours, except for the ""favorites"". No true confidentiality.Too many managers that don't practice respect for the individual. Corporate is only concerned with profits, not people. People are being replaced by machines and robots. They expect you to do the work of 3 or 4 people with no extra pay or appreciation. Most stressful job I've ever had."
bad,Your schedule can shift wildly if you have open availability.  Even if you have core hours you can get scheduled outside of that.  Walmart as a corporation does not care about the store/employees and the lack of needed employees at critical times can be maddening.
bad,"My manager, and the store manager are both clueless pawns, I'm pretty sure he was promoted not because he was the right person for the job but because he had 5 years with the company and will bend over at any time to please the impossible tasks asked of him and his team."
bad,It’s a job. Management is horrible. They say they are understanding but really not. They always say you putting us in a bind. It’s difficult to get days off. There is a lot of favoritism
bad,"I am looking for better job. I did not recommend Walmart to anyone, and as soon I will find another job they will see my two weeks notice at once."
bad,"The management does not communicate. Store owner shows no appreciation. She does nothing but sit in the office. Time limits for activities are unrealistic. You get no overtime, holiday pay, time and a half. Noone does their job and the ones that do are tasked with their job plus picking up behind everyone else. Store manager plays favoritism with employees. They never approve requested days off when they're "
bad,"Management shows favoritism to certain employees. Very hard to advance if you aren't one of the ""favorites."" "
bad,"From the store manager, to the assistants to the shift supervisors and the department managers. All of which are being told to do one thing by another superior and in turn it makes every day a shitstorm. No one knows what they are supposed to really be doing because no matter what you are going to be constantly be yelled at by someone."
bad,Not good. Cap2 has the most work to do with the smallest amount of pay available while managers sit on their a**es and demand more and more out of us.
bad,"Do not trust walmart management if they tell you that you will always have a job with them that your job is secure as long as you want it, That is a lie walmart does not care about it's employee's or customer's its all about the customer's money that they care about after 15 years of services I was laid off along with over 100 employees people who had been their for 30 years, 20 years, 13 years, 10 years and mind you every single one of us wanted our jobs none of us wanted to to be laid off but since we believed management about not ever losing our jobs they laid us off like we we're trash."
bad,Walmart is totally not a company that work there employees fairly. Worked for the company about 16 years. I was injured at work where a pallet fell on me and injured my cervical spine. It took me well over three years to fight to have surgery.
bad,"My experience working for the company was horrible.  The management sucked.  There was too much micromanagement and not enough communication.  They let the customers verbally abuse you while they just stood there then ""coached"" you if you said anything.   I tried to switch departments and my manager prevented me from doing so.  I hate I wasted so much time here."
bad,It was work but managment needed to be completely changed a whole new set brought in. And better pay would be an incentive to work hard not more threats to get fired or to get wrote up. The assistant manager's need to get replaced completely with fresh managment. The store needs lots of help.
bad,"Good for some people I suppose but theres only so far up the chain u can go and most people are promoted before they are ready with barely any training so they dont make great managers. This is a workplace that if you're liked you move up. If you're not, you're stagnant"
bad,"Awful store manager and not reasonable at all. If you have a death in the family too bad, if your child is deathly sick and you need to call off you’re fired."
bad,Working at Walmart was a horrible experience.  Management is not trained for their positions but are expected to know everything about them.    Also big pay per hour doesn’t mean big check.  The more you are paid per hour the less hours you are allowed to work.
bad,They was always late getting breaks.  They made you wait to go to the bathroom.  You could never find a manager. Something was always wrong with the registers.
bad,The people were great but it's hard to get used to the nights with 5 nights off in a row. Would happen every week. Was not worth the trouble for 11.85 an hour.
bad,"I will NEVER work at another Walmart again, even in a life-or-death situation. Never. They don’t let you move up unless you know somebody or you’re considered a “favorite.” Regardless of your qualifications, knowledge, pride and eagerness to learn, they will still give your earned spot to someone who will inevitably screw it all up. The pay is nice. But it’s not worth the aggravation, stress and mental abuse this place will give you. Tread carefully. They will screw you over at any chance."
bad,I left walmart because i felt as though they did not care about me as a person or an employee also there's no paid vacation and no paid sick days unless you have earned the pto for it but in order to do that you must work 40 hours a week which very few people get so good luck with that.
bad,Company always restructuring and getting rid of positions to compete with online. Got rid of overnight crew and door greeters. A lot of turn over or ppl that have been there for over 10 years
bad,"I was lured in with higher pay and less hours. Except that Corporate Walmart didn't honor my wage for the first 3 months, made me sit through remedial training for my position, and denied me full time status (lag in benefits), and EVERY employee option since my Orientation has been screwed up (including my p.o. box addy). Consider very carefully before you jump on board. Walmart is a corporate employer that doesn't know you as individual, doesn't care about you as an individual. You are cattle: ""Welcome to d'herd!"""
bad,Not for people that really want to work they don't train you in and your not giving the right tools to do your job they say they are gonna do something and it never gets done
bad,Management has there own sort of agenda unrelated to actually getting numbers. Managers have free reign to lie as they see fit to suite whatever goals they have at the time.
bad,"walmart used to be an enjoyable cool place to work, you could really Support your family from it. but every since the founder passed away it has went to Total hel Its more of  control/ Slave corporation now. I tell anybody run away, if you have to make it temp. walmart is the new fast food job for teenangers now."
bad,"Terrible work culture, work-life balance practically non-existent, management tries to dictate everything including personal life aspects."
bad,"This is the worst company to work for and the store in Monroe has very poor management. I went to upper management with my concerns for harrasment with one of the night shift managers and nothing was done about it! I was disrespected, and under constant stress. If you need help, forget about it. They stuck me in departments that I hadn't even been trained on, and reprimanded me if I took to long to get the merchandise stocked by spending ""too much time"" trying to assist customers. Everyone is just there to collect a paycheck, no one in management cared about the people working the floor, they just wanted as much work done as quickly as possible, and that was the only thing that mattered to them, not the customers, and not us."
bad,They also say they were flexible with your schedule but NOPE. Also very poor management. Should pay the cashiers or customer service people more......
bad,"I was constantly forced to work overtime, they constantly changed policies on how things were handled, and the management micromanaged everything including departments they did not understand whatsoever."
bad,Unfair practices need better store policies more communication with thrre employess attendance policy suck they could be more pay competitive this store never have good bouses.
bad,"Not a very good place to work unless you are the bosses favorite.  After 17 years I had to transfer to another city and I was fortunate to find a store,  but since I was not the store managers first pick or his golden child I was treated unfairly.."
bad,the store managers always rush the workers and some of them are very mean. they expect us to do so much more work then we have time for. my co workers go out of there way to be unplesent and most are power hungary as well.
bad,"I worked at the Walmart in Spartanburg (Dorman center) it was quite possibly the worst job I ever had."
bad,Company is not the same as when the Walton's ran it. Needs a complete overhaul to bring it back to what made people like working there. Prices are getting ridiculous.  Taking away name brands for the company's products is ridiculous.
bad,Through 9 years it was the same with every store. There is so much favoritism and telling you one thing and doing another. I felt like the company didn't help with moving forward into the company.
bad,"This job was so stressful I hated my life and went to the doctor for antidepressants and anxiety meds. "
bad,"Te asesoran por cualquier cosa por ejemplo si llegas 5 min antes, nunca sales a tu hora, a veces ni te mandan a comer, cuando vas a RH a pedir ayuda terminan regañando te a ti y ni hablar de prevención si te ven con basura sin marcar te la cobran asi sea basura con logo de otro super o diga seven eleven igual te la cobran con algo similar o mas caro."
bad,"Use to be a nice place to work, not any more!"
bad,"Poor Management "
bad,They are changing and eliminating jobs so they can create lower paying ones. It’s very stressful. The company implemented process but Store Managers will not follow it then when the store is bad  and the market manager comes in or regional we assistant managers get in trouble because the manager wants it there way.
bad,"My employment at Walmart started off good. As time went on however it progressively got worse. I started to realize that for a company that invasives a positive work environment, it is highly lacking in the positivity."
bad,"My time at Wal-Mart started out great! It was enjoyable. Management was approachable and friendly. There seemed to be room for advancement. That changed.  Managers would lie to my face, make promises the had no intention of keeping and make unreasonable demands. I saw managers swear at and belittle associates in front of others. The environment was incredibly toxic."
bad,They treat you like trash and everybody there is two-faced and I'm trustworthy. Only work there if you're in desperate need of a job but why you working there make sure you keep looking and get out as fast as possible
bad,"I had bad experience at store i was working for them for 5 years and they showed so much favoritism if you were not trying to give them the time of day they would try to help you with the point system,"
bad,Terrible work environment company profits over everyone corporate says to do job like this at store level never followed so it was as sees fit for higher management
bad,"Very depressing and too much favoritism it's like management plays games with you....they hire other people for positions without interviewing them ,they pick and choose who they want"
bad,You just watch some dumb videos which had nothing to do with the department I worked at. Totally understaffed! My supervisors would get mad at me because I could not do the work of 3 people.
bad,Terrible place to work the management is awful they do not care about there employees the benefits are terrible... really just a terrible place to work in general i do not recommend it
bad,"Always horribly understaffed, managers are pathological liars, will always schedule you outside your availability and favoritism is a huge part of the agenda. Got written up for something a customer did and got a verbal warning for doing something my manager told me to do to avoid being written up."
bad,"You are allowed 4 and a half call ins. If you cannot cover the time off once you hit 4 1/2 points, no matter how small the time is, be it 5 minutes to 8 hours you will be let go. I had a doctor's note after I ripped a muscle in my knee. I was able to cover all but 10 minutes with PPTO. They kept me for another week and then let me go. I had been a full time associate for two years."
bad,"Pays ok once topped out and your in super great shape to perform your pull bonus. Very very demanding physically and even more do mentally if your in the freezer. I spent along time with the DC and personally I over performed my self with an 145% average for the year three years straight, it honestly has ruin my body in unimaginable ways. If you choose this path to work here it can be a workable career if you do exactly the following. Stick to yourself strictly but cooperatively, DONT pull higher than quota at least until you understand the super extreme physical demands, and just remember don’t ever get sick enough to use the benefit LOS, which in turn slowly makes you replaceable at a higher rate than one might expect, and simply keep with the mindset your always wrong unless told otherwise. This is all coming from a person that isn’t mad or judging based on a personal experience but more a person that understands we all can’t be doctors and lawyers but still need to make 30k a year. These steps are honestly straight forward aand simple if taken within your own judgement. It’s extremely important if you wish to stay employed for a length of time. really"
bad,"The attendance policy is unfair, the atmosphere is depressing, the management is messy and full of inner conflict (drama). The store itself was just a very unprofessional environment. BUT, even with that being said, I did acquire interpersonal skills from communicating with customers that I can apply to future careers."
bad,there is no communication customers can say and do what they like management will turn a blind eye you'll most likely end up doing responsibilitys  outside of your job qulifactions
bad,bad management not recommended !!!! !!!!! !!!!!! not a good place to work management does not care about you that treat you bad I would not recommend it
bad,Would not recommend working there. High expectations and low wages. They are trying to push full time people out. Brought in Flex positions. Part time and flex sometimes get more hours than full time.
bad,Was miserable for the two years I worked there. Management was awful and disgusting.
bad,"Poor management is the norm, managment makes a good salary but aren't trained to cover service areas, i.e paint, selling licenses, cutting keys, scooping fish."
bad,"They fired me when I had surgery. Manager told me to call in and I wouldn’t get a point. She lied, gave me the point and then fired me. The other manager who was with her that fired me gave me a smirk whenever I looked at him while I was fired. Managers pick and choose who stays, they drop peoples points who have called in multiple times in a week yet fire someone for having surgery."
bad,"They are good for if you really love to work, but they are anything but family oriented. They don't care if you have an emergency or if you are extremely sick. If you miss 5 days and no overtime to cover it, for any reason at all, you will be fired."
bad,"Once a company with a culture that cared about people, no more. While salaried managers are paid decently, it's still not enough for the 60+ hour work weeks, the cancellation of days off and vacations, randomly changing work schedules, and a toxic culture with no support. Hourly employees are paid poorly, with company leaders such as the CEO refusing to invest in a living wage. Competitors can do it. Other cultures can. Walmart can, but it refuses. And when senior leadership makes comments to employees belittling their knowledge and skills, and says things like ""I'll feed my kids before I care about feeding your""... there is no way anyone should work here."
bad,I don't not like working there after six months because the management only care about themselves they never wanted to hear what you had to say about any of work. they never took into consideration that people had families to care of.
bad,"When you first start everything seems great. The people the job, everything. Then it all goes downhill fast after you’ve been there a while, it takes forever to move up if your really good at what you currently do. Management aren’t there for the associates, they are there to get the largest salary possible and will use anyone they have to as fodder to get there. However, not all stores are the same, it can truly depend on who leads the store."
bad,The management was horrible and so were the employees always mad at the world they all think you owe them something would never work for Walmart ever again
bad,Walmart fires associates with 20 years or more bc they do not want to pay Vacations . Won’t let you take Vacations . Manager lies and says you don’t get notes done and writes you up . Open Door is a joke . Manager spends all day in his vehicle smoking cigarettes and talking on cell phone . They are a bunch of slave drivers . Work you to death and spit you out .
bad,I never felt like a human being working there.  The bathrooms were never cleaned always disguising.  Management sucked and don't listen to your needs.  Slave labor rewarded with low wages
bad,"Fellow assistants were miserable and always negative store manager doesn’t know how to speak up for right, she goes with the flow. Everyone is not held to the same standards and policies, a lot of favoritism."
bad,"I worked in the first walmart Manufacturing Plant and the management was incompetent at all tiers. The pay was more than fair however PTO accrual rate was impossibly low, and associate would have to work 41 hours to gain one hour of time off. The job in itself is fairly easy and does not require a lot of labor. There were many discrepancies in their policies so you were never fully aware of the rules. The insurance is expensive and not very good. We received no paid holidays or any type of premium for working holidays either. I would not recommend anyone to work here unless you strictly need the money, it is not a place I recommend to retire."
bad,They care for the customer more than the employees as they are treated badly. They don’t care how hard you work or if you get a break like your supposed to get
bad,Would love to find a better company that values employees and gives more recognition upon employment..alot of turn over no job stability. Which lead to unavailable hours..
bad,Management was awful. Only favorites got promotion. Management does not respect or care about their employees. Pay isn't worth working there. Amount of hours most of the year is barely any. Not a good place to work if you have family. It's like the employees are prisoners and management are the corrections officers.
bad,"Far far too many people are ""in charge"" for the size of my shift's team.  One Assistant Manager, two supervisors and a slew of self-proclamed ""senior associates"". All of which have their own ideas of how things should be done and nobody is on the same page."
bad,"Expected to stock 15?? hours of  product in 8 hour shift was a normal night. Have been threatened to get written up if work was not completed. Very unreasonable expectations!! pay was $11.50hr, 40 hours a week, take home was $650 every 2 wks."
bad,They do not follow any of their written policies concerning breaks for pharmacist. We have been told to work 12 hour shifts ( even pregnant pharmacist) and that we were not allowed to take any kind of break outside the pharmacy during this time. We had to eat while we worked.
bad,Wal- Mart has change so much and there upper Management doesn't know how to talk to there associates as well as not having mentor for there associates
bad,Management will not lift a finger. Asm’s and Co’s Sit on there butt in personell all day. Store mgr.is very rarely in store. The good ole boy system is still alive and well between Co’s and store mgr.Store mgr. yells at associates on intercom and over the radio. Working for this company was the worse and most stressful time of my life.
bad,It was a very difficult place to work because no one wants to be responsible for their job or position. Management is lazy and does not stand up for their workers at all.
bad,Not good job is hard management doesn’t care not paid enough. No fans. Hot box  sweat box no chance for advancement. Managers don’t care and don’t listen. No pto building
bad,I worked for 3 different Wal-Mart's. I moved and was able to get transferred to keep my job. Most of the managers were good and understanding. The last bunch i worked for were not.
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their workers.. simple as that.. they over work you and under pay you.. They expect you to do 20 jobs and not even including the one they hired you for. I've worked here since 2015 and I'm hoping every day something else comes through..
bad,"This is hands down the most terrible place I have ever worked. The managers are all out for themselves and if you aren’t willing to kiss butt, you won’t get anywhere"
bad,Managers don't know what they are doing all the time. Nevermind that no one knows what they're doing. No advancement possible! False hopes and dreams offered here.
bad,It’s not somewhere I would want to work again unless changes are made management is very unprofessional they don’t work with you for school just terrible overall
bad,The job was slow paced all I had to do was put products on the self. Management did not care about the employees and would find any reason they could to have an employee fired.
bad,"I was trained as a jewelry associate. Which also encompasses shoe stocking. Checking in freight and processing it isn't that difficult. When you are expected to do every piece of freight and wait on every customer It gets to be too much. Many times I was told to focus on freight and not pay attention to customers. obviously customer service should be number one priority. Without the customers we wouldn't need to order in any freight because no one would shop there. Dealt with many disgruntled customers. It just seemed that no amount of effort was ever enough to please management. Also there were so many managers around it was actually confusing. You could get told what to do by 4:00 or 5:00 different managers. So it got to be difficult to decide which tasks I was actually supposed to try to accomplish. All the while dealing with actual customers. I wish it was more focused on customers, I really liked my job. I got two pierced people's ears. That was really fun."
bad,"Not only did I receive employee of the month my first month, I went over and beyond to do my job but had a problem with the staff, went to managers with my problem and they basically laughed at me!!!! Moral of the story believe every bad thing about Walmart and how they treat the employees 🤷🏽‍♀️"
bad,Been there almost 20 years and have seen more benefits taken away than added. People with no pharmacy experience making within $1 after a couple months of training the pay of the “veteran” employees.
bad,Hope that all Walmarts arent as bad as the one in Ukiah California. They over work you and are  understaffed with little to no support from management.
bad,"I started out working at Walmart with excitement, but as I became more and more under appreciated, I also grew more and more mentally exhausted. The upper management pick and choose who they favorite."
bad,"Not a good place to work and poorly managed. "
bad,talked a good talk but in practice was sorely lacking. store manager constantly undervalued employees and had unrealistic expectations. was constantly looking for reasons to fire people.
bad,"Management was okay, in that other managers were cool but mine was absolute garbage. The job itself, CVT, was whatever. I did not mind going into work and moving boxes around and stocking shelves. However, people are weird. You mind your business, people will call you rude and start drama. You are outgoing, people will get jealous of how happy you are and start drama. It is a very frustrating workplace because associates are weird and will talk negatively about you no matter what you do."
bad,"In the three years I worked for Walmart, I watched as as any Manager who truly cared for their associates was terminated, demoted or worked to death.  The open door policy is a complete joke as implementation is at the manager's discretion."
bad,Would not recommend anyone to work there. Favorites got opportunities that others were more qualified for. Very unappreciative when u go above n beyond for them
bad,Not all Walmarts are created equal. There are great stores out there. Management is the biggest deciding factor. If you are lucky you get managers who listen. If not you look for a new position or job depending on how bad the situation is. Bad management at a Walmart is poison in the blood of the store. And it will destroy a store.
bad,"I can honestly say that working at Walmart was one of the most horrific and unprofessional position I've ever been at. They do not care about their employees; I felt unimportant, unheard, and down right replaceable. Not that any employee is not expendable; but as unimportant and ignored as they made me feel I would never recommend a position at any Walmart chain. The management was very unprofessional; having a lack of care about their employees of whether or not they felt comfortable in their position or Department. As well as did not even try to fulfill any request for transfer or time off."
bad,"I’ve worked for Walmart for a year now and from what I’ve gathered here is that they lack communication, schedule past your availability and the management sucks .. wouldn’t recommend working here if your planning on going to school."
bad,"For a company that makes as much as WalMart does you would think they would care a little more about their employees. The culture is bad, the management is bad, the pay is bad. Just bad over all."
bad,"When I first started at Wal-Mart 5422, it was a joy to be apart of the team. The management team there now cares nothing for the Associates that gets the job done."
bad,"Work for Walmart for 11 years with no job security, bad benefits and poor management, bad making decisions company restructuring leaving hundreds of Co managers jobless"
bad,Walmart e-com: Poor management- Extreme workload- No work life balance- Min benefits- Pays at least 30% below the market value. They lost all great product managers that they had in 2018.
bad,"management does not respect employees,"
bad,It was ok when I first started but after a while the managers started to show their true colors. Best part was how the floor associates bonded and tried to make a better work environment and I enjoyed the nice customers that respected retail workers
bad,"I worked at Walmart 2 separate times between 2015 and 2017. Both times I was unfairly let go for ""miscommunications"". Management is very bad, communication is awful, hours are not flexible at all."
bad,The overwhelm you with work and blame you or not completing it. They hire inexperienced supervisors. The don't pay properly. They adjust your schedule without telling you. They lie on you to protect themselves.
bad,Wal-Mart is not the same Wal-Mart that when I first started working for.  The company is more concerned about money and profits than staffing it's stores to be able to provide customer service.
bad,"Have worked there for years. Then they bumped new hire pay to what we were making, slashed raises, and told everybody who was already on payroll to deal with it. They actually expect to pay their people the same as new hires, yet get the same work ethic and productivity as somebody who's worked with them for 30+ years."
bad,"The only good thing about working or Walmart is that they pay for you to go to school. You have to go where they want and major in business. They make it hard for you to switch every six months like they claim you can. You don’t get holidays off, even if requested before the schedule is made, like they claim."
bad,While it started out well enough things slowly went down hill. They seem to expect you to be super human doing the job of a whole crew alone. Not very willing to work with you or to give promotions.
bad,"You get to see a lot of people during your shift, but the hours for part time are always the worse, such as closing hours, they try to keep you there until very late for cleaning and taking out garbages ( not only yours also the cashiers that didn't do their job) "
bad,"I have worked for several Walmart’s in 2 different states. All have high employee expectations with inferior management. The training is a joke. Understaffing is routine while the bar is set high. It’s normal to be yelled at by a supervisor for being unable to complete tasks even when they acknowledge the staffing issue. Management serves only that purpose. They will not offer assistance or guidance, just personal conversations about your performance. Even when it’s not your fault it still somehow manages to be your fault. Want lousy hours, high stress, and mediocre pay? Walmart is for you."
bad,"It was a okay job it paid my bills but it's not a secure job poor management ok hours rude customers some good looking females to work with ""some"" not all"
bad,Walmart is a Great company to work for I've met a lot of great people there over the years...it's alot of changes taking place ....However it's so many new changes taking place it's hard to keep up with changing times it has become difficult to keep up with all the new advance technology changes taking place in Walmart
bad,I tried to go to cap two. Tried to relocate. I was told no. Over and over. Can't move up. They just run you ragged. Bad place to work. Management does nothing but smoke cigarettes. They take more breaks than anyone.  They fire people for the stupidest reasons.
bad,"I worked at the Coweta ok location and the main chic over the night cashier was horrible she was literally the rudest person I have ever met all the staff knew she was terrible, but they all just looked the other way. The turnover rate was outa this world and all because of one employee."
bad,There is an accepted level of hostility from upper levels of management toward lower levels and associates.  It starts with the general manager and works its way down.  It is an incredibly stressful situation.  You cannot count on anyone standing behind you or Walmart policy.
bad,This was the most horrible I work at .The management team wasn’t good it’s was always something going . It’s was always something crazy going on . people call out some much it’s was becoming sickening. I couldn’t wait to find another job to get out that place. Definitely bad experience
bad,"The managers don't care about their employees, no matter how much they say they do. They treat you horribly, and like you're an inconvenience. The workers that have been there 10+ years are bitter and are not nice to the new people. They act like they're better than everyone and are horrible for morale. The only good thing is they pay more than most other places around, and the health insurance is decent."
bad,"This place could be great, but it's staffed with all the poor attitudes in the surrounding area. Starting with the store manager, she is rude, disrespectful, belittles little, shows no appreciation. Then, it trickles down the line from the. Always understaffed because the turnover rate is terrible. Nobody wants to stay because of her and her minions. You have to be a favorite to get anywhere. The great thing about the company is..."
bad,"The rules for worked time are ridiculous. They don't give you enough time to complete the tasks they give you. You have to stay until everything's finished and if you don't you have to take a long lunch the next day to compensate, and then the next day, and the next, since you'll just end up staying later and later because of the long lunches. Sometimes I would come in at 5 am to open and not get to leave until after midnight because of my 6 hour 'lunch'"
bad,"Management is very poor and that make turnover very high volume.  Improper training. Over work. Staffing issues.. under staff.  There is no team cooperations.  Store 2493 in Grand Rapid, MI is falling apart."
bad,"Not really a good company to work. Poor management and poor communication skills, they really don’t know how to treat they works, they are rude, always say it’s a team but it’s never a team"
bad,"The managers are all rude and strict. They put on that happy fake customer service voice but aren't kind to employees. Walmart believes the customer is always right and they've lost money because of that, they give the customer whatever is needed to remove them from the store in a heated argument"
bad,Its waa 1 of my top worst jobs in many ways. Unorganized management will do everything to make your job miserable when you look like you're having a good day. Management constantly changing.
bad,Changes in the management structure for asset protection made it nearly impossible to be successful.  Store manager was made direct supervisor for asset protection and they have you work on everything but asset protection assignments.  Market Level would come and see what you are accomplishing and would not address the issue.
bad,They say they flexible hours and scheduling but they don’t when they tell you to work you have to work no buts about it they over work minors and rarely give you any time off
bad,"If you are part of the clique, work is easy. If not, they beat you down until you quit. Regular, hourly associates know more than management. They say customers come first, not so...the bottom line is all that matters."
bad,"Department managers are given daily tasks that the management team doesn't allow them to carry out until the extra tasks put on top of them are completed.  When nothing is stocked in your department, you wind up cleaning up anything other associates leave for you while management sits in the ""Ad office"" unwilling to hold associates accountable."
bad,"Walmart got me thru a tough time in my life but I don't recommend anyone work there long term. My store is woefully understaffed, despite the Dailymotion hiring that it done. There is a high turn over rate (154%) for employees and managers get shuffled around without notice. Rules and policies are enforced on a whim.. overall, save yourself the trouble. Don't do it"
bad,They play favorites and if you are physically or mentally challenged forget it! They will bend and break the fair workplace laws like no other. Will never set foot in one again.
bad,"I learned a lot as listed, but I would not want to work there ever again. The inner politics is utterly corrupt. Managers commit crimes & regularly violate their own regulations, discriminate against minorities and weaker people, and there is a management culture of corruption, bullying of weaker people, and authoritarianism."
bad,"This company is the worst place to work. Find someplace that will care about you and what you have to bring to the company. They don't care about their associates at all."
bad,stressful and irritating job with poor management just a big high school and you have to deal with rude nasty people especially management who think they gone talk to you like your their child and NOT
bad,I liked the pay but the constant people wanting to see you fail and doing thing to make you fail was very frustrating. I liked the people who wanted to see me  win but it populated by people who are sad with their lives so they project their frustration to making you fail.
bad,The managers never have schedule enough staff to give the store the coverage that it need. They mostly hire kids who show up when ever they want to to make the poor staffing even worse. The managers do not care that there is not enough people to cover all the tasks that need to be done each day and expect the few people that are there to cover everything and get it all done and complain  because somethings just are not completed .
bad,I learned to work hard and at long hours. I'm a very hard worker and I also learned to work smarter not harder. But I made pretty good money even though it is hard work.
bad,"Employees are treated horribly by management. They give you very high and unreasonable tasks to complete by a certain time. Even when there is not even enough employees scheduled to complete it. Then when you can not complete those tasks due to the lack of people they tell you that your horrible workers and need to push harder. When there is a problem brought to managment they do not even try to fix it. Overall, it's a extremely stressful job. I dont recommend working there."
bad,I hated it. They never knew what was going on. Never knew what area I was going to be in. They won’t understanding I broke my foot. So I took an extra 15 minutes to finish my task.
bad,"It was good at first.  Then, I got to know people.  Most everybody was cut throat, no team work.  Nobody's on the same page.  Management was rude and very disrespectful. There were a few good assistant managers, but the manager was awful."
bad,"Management only cares about themselves. Barely any team work. The attendance policy is ridiculous, they have no type of sympathy if you're sick, child sick, nothing! If you do intend to work there don't make it permanent, give yourself one year. Trust me! Also the only day Walmart is closed is Christmas, like we don't have a life and family, also no holiday pay and they don't offer over time."
bad,No upward movement unless you know people. Bad management and not enough pay or hours. Not a job anyone would want. Will not go back. Dont even like shopping there anymore
bad,In my experience with Wal-Mart I have seen close to one hundred people either walkout or get fired from Wal-Mart. It is rare to see an associate actually like working there.
bad,They throw to much at you at once and expect you to know what you're doing without training. They expect you to not ever get sick or have family emergencies. They take hours off you're check and they discriminat.
bad,Well.. have you ever put a hot pocket in the microwave for the allotted time it specified.. and when it’s done it’s still cold in the middle.. but you don’t realize it’s cold u till you’re already half way done eating it and you’re to lazy to get up and reheat it.. yup that’s Walmart... I mean for real.. if idiots could fly that place would be an airport
bad,"A relatively easy (as in everything is pretty much straight forward) place to work, though it can get hectic due often to poor staffing/scheduling.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the very poor management."
bad,Theres a reason for the turnover rate. Management is terrible and never available. No HR that you can ask questions about your benefits. No training for the Supervisors. Pay is very low for the work you do. If you make it 6 months when the benefits kick in you have senority. They have discrimination issues. They dont care about their employees. Employees are miserable. If you go to supervisir with an issue their ccx response is i dont want to hear it. They cant keep employees. The worst place ive ever worked. They cheat employees out of weekend overtime by making saturday their first day of  the week. Very stressful place to work.
bad,Managemnet works you way to hard for the amount of pay you compensate. Some of the higher ups arenunproffessional and perverted. Not somewhere id recommend working at at all.
bad,"Every store you work in is different. Corporate says you should go from one store to another an every thing should be the same. However, that is not the case. Every sore manage takes the manual, throws it out the window, and runs their store the way they want to run their store. Some managers are better than others. Unfortunately, there seem to be more bad than good."
bad,A  typical work day not always satisfing. How to give great customer service . Poor  management. At times  stressfull always got the job done. Best part was the people I worked with!!!!
bad,General manager cares only about himself. There is no training upper management always lie about the work schedule to floor management and associates to make the work harder DC 6048 is by far the worst place to work in America.
bad,Speak up about a favorite of management and you will lose your job. Management will lie to cover eachother and then even at corporate levels disputes fall on def ears. Coworkers were the best part of that place
bad,"Targeted by supervisors/management."
bad,"I would not recommend working at this retail establishment unless you can handle the hectic environment. Sometimes you'll get scheduled for a day you have previously got approved for, and you'll still be required to show up for work ."
bad,I have made it up to Management and if you do they expect you to become a bad person and treat great worker bad and you become a slave I can’t deal with a place like this
bad,"The Wal-Mart I worked for was terrible. To start, MANAGEMENT is terrible. They really need to get rid of the rotten apples. No communication between the employees and managers.  They dont reward hard work at all. Please, work somewhere else. Only reason I stayed so long was because of my awesome co workers."
bad,there was never enough staff to operate daily Management never helped out when we asked for help as well as Management not answering us when we need to speak to them about issues
bad,"Overall the company may be great to work for but my experience is with the Arroyo Grande, Ca (2556) store.  If you are a  store manager favorite you will succeed, if not good luck."
bad,If you have a family don't t expect to ever take a summer vacation or go camping over the Memorial or 4th of July weekend. Holidays are mandatory.  And don't even get me started on the points system.  You get 5 attendance points. Every call in is one point. If you call in the day of before or after a holiday it's 2 points.  If you are late it's a half of a point. If you use all 5 of your points you're fired.  So don't t get sick or get hit by a car and if your kids are sick alot and are too young to stay home alone from school. Well you're sorry out of luck.
bad,"Co workers are good people but management doesn't know what they are doing,  soo. As a new manager shows up they bring all their buddies from another store.  Maybe 3 people within 7 years got promoted within, other than that the manager never gives opportunities.   Job is secure but workload is beyond unreasonable .  Managers aren't trained frankly some are uneducated convicts  on power trips. Harrasment is allways happening.  Set schedule so good luck, I was. Always told ""what's more important school or work"""
bad,"Empresa tinha tudo para ser boa,o mal é a gerencia e a direção"
bad,"I work at Walmart currently, and I'm one of the few people in our understaffed team that actually works. Because I do my job, don't kiss up and go home I'm the target my team members turn to when they mess up. My supervisor knows who's really at fault, but discards that because of blatant favoritism. Any and all achievements are followed by asking why I don't do this constantly. To that I have one thing to say: ""I do. But when you notice it is only when you're trying to kiss up to the manager."""
bad,"I originally enjoyed my job and made it an ideal work place. Then new managers came in and made it so they wanted to work me down til I had nothing left. Outside of 2 managers, I could not trust any of my management team without being thrown under a bus. Even worse, I had an LOA and they tried using that against me to go to areas that I didn't want to work in. Walmart management is getting worse and worse every year and needs to stop making their own rules."
bad,A typical day as a Grand Blanc walmart cart attendant includes: being the only person to cover the parking lot five out of the eight hours your working.
bad,Walmart would be the last place I’ll ever work at! I would never work there again... co workers weeds very  unprofessional everyday after 4pm I am left with 5 carts of garages & card board. Plus the work I had to do. Never get any help and workers at the deli were snitches and told lies. Very bad place!!
bad,"Very stressful, rude customers and store manager was a jerk.  When I worked there it was low pay.  But at least I had insurance.  Wish they cared about there employees as much as they care about the almighty dollar"
bad,"Very stressful job. Customers are almost always rude, no one had the patience or confronted you in a respectable manner. Management was awful. Did not care about their associates, were not willing to aid in personal problems knowing how pressured you could be.  Treated very poorly and di not receive the payment we deserved."
bad,Shopping at Walmart sucks what did that mean for the work environment? It also depends on how well you deal with customers if you don’t have problems with customers asking stupid questions all day every day you will do well
bad,To many managers have there favorites. With there new system unless you work all hours. I use to get 30 hours a week but since they started this new system many people have quite because they have kids or other obligations in life besides Walmart and they began to not work at all around your hours leaving you with under 20 hours a week which after 11 years not acceptable. So was forced you might say to find a new job so I did not lose my home and could pay bills. Personally  I see a fall in the kingdom there with all that is going on. Been there many years so were others and this place is just going down hill every year  I was there.
bad,"Walmart isn't what it use to be. You have managers that aren't even a real college person they are just someone who was a nobody . "
bad,Management it crazy horrible when it came to the cashier the sucked booty... They acted like just because you got that yellow vest on and call yourself a csm then you can treat people with no respect.
bad,I quit because a coworker made a racial comment to me and they did nothing. Asked to meet with different managers and they never followed thru. The man still works there and I never got a proper apology.
bad,I do not recommend the East Syracuse Walmart to any one to work at. Management treats you good for your 90 day probation but after that they start jumping on you and treating you like dirt. I worked here for 2 years I wanted to move position but keeped getting empty promises from management. If you want to be stuck at a dedend job this Walmart will be the one management really needs to be swapped out they treat everyone poorly. I finally had enough so I quit on the spot. Don't work here.
bad,"Your basic a slave work horse. They fire people to save money then keep a few people to operate abs stock the entire store, it doesn't matter what Department you work in, you will pull freight to the floor and stock every department so they can save money by not hiring more help.  So customers needing help in a specific department will wait longer just received that help because if you work in hardware you could be stocking groceries on the other side and when the customer calls for help they have to wait for you to take your freight back because you can not leave freight on the floor. before you can go help them. then you get yelled at for not having the stock put up fast enough then when you finish stocking on the grocery side then you have to go stock on the other side of the store. Maybe 3-4 people stock the entire General Merchandise side of the store. Not to Mention constantly having to stop putting up freight to help Customers find an item that you have no idea where is but you are not allowed to tell the customer that you don't know you have to just walk around looking for the item which takes more time and we receive no education along the items but we are not allowed to tell the customer this the customers think we have been trained on the products we carry in the store. We are basically told to lie to the customer to save face for Walmart"
bad,"Never met my managers, very confusing first few shifts. Aggressive customers, late hours, no overtime. Don't work here. They don't care about their employees at all."
bad,"They schedule you on days you told them you cant work, they make you juggle so much work on your own with no help, managment screams at you in front of customers. This place just isnt worth the stress unless youre a robot with no standards that is fine with not getting respect, but has to give respect no questions asked."
bad,Coworkers were awesome. The customers were ok. But management was horrible. Store manager didn’t even like to help customers. It was disgusting. They were always worried about mess and who was talking about who and saying what about each other. They should go take management classes at Delgado Community College.
bad,Do the job of four people to pick up the slack of the below average workers they refuse to fire. Fire you if they think you aren’t working fast enough. They’re decent about working with you on your schedule.
bad,This place is a suck hole that looks for any reason to write older seasoned employees up so that they don't have to pay them and they can get rid of their full time help.
bad,Horrible place to work if you are trying to be a manager. No work/life balance you are there when they tell you or look for a new job. Store and market managers are hard to deal with if you like swallowing your pride then this job is for you this is not a career move and if so I'm sorry. If you work hard they beat you down but if you kiss butt you can go far. Nothing really good to say
bad,Pay you based on your previous work experience. Management was always switching and a lot of manager's do not know what they are doing and are full of themselves.
bad,They dont care about your family or your life outside of work. The flexible schedule they talk about is a lie. Most of the management is a joke and only care about theirselves. They promote people that dont deserve it and that have no idea what they are doing. They are constantly changing policies and how hours are given out so its hard to keep track of what's going on. If you have a family and want to spend time with them Walmart isnt the place to work....
bad,"This job hired on the spot, which should have been my first red flag. The management isn’t focused on my department enough, my coworkers are either all leaving, getting fired, or actively looking for other jobs. The higher-ups don’t seem to understand the environment we work in and continue to make changes that we can’t adjust to without more staff, but the only new staff we get lately is high schoolers who only work when they want to."
bad,Worst store ever management is always rude & they fire you for the mosr ridiculousl  stuff  ever . Also they favorite people and delete points of only people they like even though they passed their points 3-4 times ridiculous
bad,Walmart cares nothing about there associates after 8 years i make what a new hire does low hours very poor management no respect for what you do expect you to make walmart your life and forget the rest
bad,Wal-Mart a multi-billion company only looks out for itself and cares nothing about its employees. It's one of America's biggest corporate monsters. It loses customers everyday because of what it is and not what it used to be.
bad,Worked in produce. We had a 95% turnover rate all the way to assistant manager. They were often actually cruel and engaged in illegal activity. They promoted based on a buddy system and it had nothing to do with attributes for success. They often promoted literally the most inept person at the job and watched them fail and let it fall on the employees under them.
bad,"I can easily see Walmart being the next Sears in 20 years. constant budget cuts, lack of benefits and poor management will drive this company to the ground."
bad,"I was a greeter and assisted customers. It was a friendly work place, but all the new changes make it hard to find another position in the store. all is said."
bad,I worked here Part-time. In the 3 years I worked here I had gone through 4 different midnight managers. Each manager acted just like the next. There is ALOT of Favoritism and not enough equality. End of story!
bad,"I worked in the deli, I don’t know about the other departments, but do not do deli. Worst decision you can make, everyone gossips and no one does any work, there is no management to watch what people are doing. So if your co worker leaves for 2 hours they’ll get away with it."
bad,"carts, truck unloading, stocking, upc reading, one touch processing, clothing processing, frozen dairy guidelines, overnight general merchandise guidelines and processes."
bad,"I don't know what you expect here, its Walmart. everyone knows how terrible Walmart is. they don't care about employees and they take advantage of low income areas. its well known. I would never go back to working there and I would never recommend it to anyone I know. they are not worth it."
bad,"Be lazy and do less to nothing get Rewarded. Have Pride in your Job, work hard, give a darn about what you do and the customers and you get punished Managers lie cheat Steal and get away with it. Yet fire and coach everyone one else NEITHER one is RIGHT!!. Stay far far away"
bad,"Why?  The lack of personnel creates a much more for less environment! Most of the management  just likes to delegate rather then help out! So, the burden is put on the employee(s) and always being short-handed means what? You get the picture and it is not a good one!"
bad,Walmart doesn't do enough to look in to the backgrounds of people they hire. I had to work with hostile gang members who constantly threatened me at work and when i stepped forward to talk to management about this I was blown off. I decided to take my leave.
bad,"Uma empresa grande não significa uma grande empresa."
bad,The stress level was really high dealing with employees and customers. Unloading trucks at midnight while feeling tired already from stocking and pulling palets of stock to the floor.
bad,Make sure that Walmart is your last option. It was nice when I was new and then as i had been there for awhile it got worse and worse. The Management does not treat you like a human being. You are just  another thing to boss around and make do the things they do not want to do.
bad,It is Walmart and it is always ran poorly. Dealing with rude people all day but it can also be easy at the same time because everyone knows where the products are because it’s walmart.
bad,"Learned a lot about price changes ,mods, costumer service from my peers. They don't train you it's all learned through a software .when asking for help from management they say look it up.when you're behind on work they also do not give help even though other departments that are more important to them get most of the help. Favoritism is huge and very obvious. High turn over rate and or assistant managers and department managers leaving Walmart all together. Co manager is very rude and disregards people's feelings. Many times yells at employees on the sale floor . Hard work for some that aren't favorites gets unnoticed. Also you get talked down to alot .Beware do not work for this location !!!!"
bad,"Extremely poor place to work and declined immediately following Sam Walton's passing. Was once #1 place to work, now probably one of worst. Was terminated for having ethics and morals and standing up to Store Managers lies."
bad,If you don't drink or smoke before getting this job you will after working there for 30 days or more. The management team is full of bullies. I've worked with the company for 8 years and every day that you go in you're worried about being picked on and your job being threatened.
bad,"Unable to provide enough staff so that customers don't have to wait for service.  I love working for Walmart but I'm expected to do the work of 4 people and I am only one person. I work every weekend as well as 12 hours a day and have sacrificed family time to be a Walmart associate. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers. My customers are family to me Promotions are based on WHO you know, Not how hard you work, People who slack get promotions if they know the right people."
bad,they don't care about you.i passed out one morning from being super sick and was sent home and told i would have to talk to my manager about getting it waved and i did.they fired me immediately after for having to many points in a six months time.if you are sick or any thing pops up and you cant be at work or have to leave early.well that's points against you.
bad,"Working here isn't very great, very under appreciated, never thanked for anything. It's basically a pay check and not much of one at that. Management is completely worthless and could care less about most employees unless your in the ""click"""
bad,This particular Walmart has some of the worse Management imaginable! Management is extremely rude and distasteful and do not treat their employees fairly. There are exceptions to the rule and there are a handful of management who actually care about their employees and show a little bit of class but for the most part this Walmart has some of the most sorriest excuses for managers I’ve ever seen.
bad,"As someone who has worked for this company many years, I can say that things were much better 10-12 years ago. Over the time since then, the company has undergone such a transformation.Unfortunately, the change has been terribly negative. Poor worker protections, mismanagement, non communication of corporate direction, making hourly associates use their personal devices to perform work related tasks, have all contributed to the decline of the company."
bad,"If you ever wanted to feel like cattle or just another number you've come to the right place, all of the discouraging posts made about this place are completely true! It's a last ditch effort"
bad,Culture is not conducive to cooperation.  Management does not always provide the tools or resources to complete the work assigned.  Goals are not well defined.
bad,If I could rate this a 0 I would management doesn't care about what you go through. Rules change everyday. If your sick or kids sick they don't except doctor's note so just go in there sick and see what happens.
bad,Management was very poor. No communication and if there was it was a lie and to help out management and not the associate. I witnessed first hand being in hr. When someone decides to leAve Walmart they change how many points you have from being absent do you can't collect unemployment. This just happened to me and I thought I left on good terms but apparently I didn't. I had to relocate because it was too expensive to live in California and u was about to become homeless. So I had to move back to Washington. When I applied for Unemployment they denied me saying I had to many absents and that u didn't give notice. Needless to say I won and will never so at Wal-Mart again and not would I recommend anyone to work there. They are completely unfair.
bad,"For all the work that Walmart wants you to do you would think they would pay you better! Starting pay is ridiculous & even worse for the employees that have been there 5+ years. No room for advancement unless the managers like you, which of course it’s all about favoritism. I mean they literally treat you like scum!"
bad,"management is corrupt and they lie about everything. If you raise concerns, they try to find a reason to fire you before they address the situation. the only thing good about working for this company is the fact that they offer a higher wage for easy, entry level work that anybody could do."
bad,I did not much enjoy my job on a day to a day basis. Management didnt seem to be the best. We also never had the proper equipment to do our jobs. Do not recommend.
bad,"Constantly changing production culture pushed out senior associates,  overtime almost all year around,  15 and 20 min breaks you had to jda and be back in area which took 2 minutes minimum so you got like 12 and 18 min breaks."
bad,Inconsistent management and continuously implementing new policies that prevent workers from improving their quality of life. New employees have long waiting periods to earn vacation time.
bad,I learned how to drive a forklift. My management was absent about 3 days a week and had to take over for him. A typical day at work would involve me waiting to be told the manager did not show up. Most enjoyable part was because employees I supervised when the manager was gone.
bad,"I was a cashier/customer service. I did both of these tasks but I was never labeled as customer service rep., which means I got paid as a cashier and not as customer service. Secondly, the work itself was easy but the management always seemed to try to look good to others and not protect their employees due to dangerous or misbehaved customers. Most managers were not educated and walmart is the wonderland to all uneducated people. Anyone and when I say anyone I mean every person could become a manager/supervisor at Walmart. I hated working here and I even hate shopping here as the staff is not professional at all. They also hire you part time, but give more then 40 hours so they don't have to pay you or give you benefits."
bad,"Up to this point in my life I worked under the table. High pay, good people, good hours. Working the warehouse at Walmart though almost destroyed me ever getting an on the books job again. Later in life I would realize that working on the books wasn’t that bad. Eventually leading to a job I stayed at for more then 4 years. If you have to work here for a small time then do it, it’s money lol but let me sum up my experience. "
bad,The pay is laughable if you have real life bills. The raises are supposed to be at least once a year and it’s a few pennies. Management is always too busy to sit and talk if you need to. Store is filthy bcuz janitors don’t clean properly. When customers are rude the manager will side with the customer. Hours are not consistent from week to week so don’t tell creditors you can pay them on a certain date because hours aren’t guaranteed.
bad,This is one of the worst companies to work for. They will work and work and work you when it's  convenient  for them and benefit them but have no problem not giving you hours. For someone who is Full Time and only getting 10 hours a week? And management is useless they can't run that store. They do not no how to do a thing. They don't know how to mix paint make keys sell a gun activate a phone work in photo do pickup or  run the front end and do not help when lines get backed up or there are no carts but have no problems yelling at the CSM'S who do way more then they should for as little as they get paid. It's a shame that Walmart has become such a terrible place to work. Management thinks they are better then you but can't run a store? Also one of the managers goes to work with alcohol on his breath but they don't do a thing. If you want a job with no hours and being degraded then this is the place for you otherwise don't waste you time or energy because they do not appreciate a thing u do it's never ever ever good enough for them.
bad,"In this situation it is not the job itself, it is management. At this specific location their is favoritism at an all time high. If you are not in the favorite crowd you more than likely will not receive a promotion even if you are very deserving of it. Also they act as if they are more important than your family and your duties with them. Overall a very bad location to work."
bad,"Within the pharmacy, new management was just put it and is excelling with workplace requirements but greatly failing with managing the ridiculous behavior of the staff. I have never worked with such rude and unprofessional individuals in my entire life, to both myself, each other, and our customers."
bad,Associate moral is low. Pay is low. No pay raises. Can't miss more than 5 work days total in a 6 month period or you get fired.  Discount isn't offered for everything. Lots of drama.
bad,"Coworkers are sometimes awful but usually pretty nice people. Management sucks. Pay sucks. Customers suck. Work is boring and repetitive, but stocking shelves is a decent workout."
bad,Must be a friendly people person . Walmart was a cool job for me I made a lot of friends but wanted a better job opportunity. Walmart is great for a 2nd job .
bad,Overnight shift is worked to the bone every night. The morning managers are rude in spite of this. Low pay. Also physically in pain but health benefits are not affordable.
bad,"I am a student, I have been targeted by members of the management staff for cutting my hours to continue my education. I don't feel welcome or wanting at walmart. if you plan to just use walmart as a stepping stone in your life they will trip you every step of the way."
bad,Poor Management and poor upper management. zero work life balance. Management under appreciated and expected to sacrifice personal life for the good of the business.
bad,Walmarti. Is  a bad company to work for. There's. no sick days or paid vacation days . And very short breaks within a ten hour shift. And they don't have holidays off. They don't give  you nothing but write ups.Took our sink days away.
bad,"Was basically fired without just cause when I injured my wrist and couldn't work in department, was encouraged to not go to the doctors to have it looked it... to probably avoid a workers claim. Management played favorites, "
bad,"Walmart requires a very specific type of person, especially in management in order to be successful. Their expectations are unrealistic unless you are willing to work more than your scheduled shift. It was a tough business and required an intense amount of specific managerial finesse that doesn't always account for the human aspects of work. I learned a lot about what it takes to manage people and merchandise for good and for worse. I appreciate the time that I spent with the company but I am glad that I have evolved in my management experience."
bad,Terrible place to work for. The pay sucks and they will never let you get more than 30 hours. Most of the night crew hid out side all night smoking and doing drugs. The mangers did not believe me. Got tired of busting my butt while these  people were messing around all night started slacking with my work cause I was fed up and they fired me.
bad,"Find a better place to work all Walmart cares about is more money. And if something goes wrong your guilty no matter whos at fault , it's never the manager."
bad,"Pésimo apoyo de parte de RH (Mayra), el peor gerente está en Walmart Valle real (Salvador), despiden a los buenos asociados y dejan a los que roban, hacen trabajar tiempo de más sin pagarlo y en cajas hay bastante robo por parte de oficina administrativa, no hay crecimiento laboral, no respetan antigüedad, ni en puestos ni en aumento de paga. ""NO LO RECOMIENDO!"
bad,i worked for walmart for a year in that year i was a new mom going to college i told them i could only do 20 hours a week and they consistently scheduled me for 35 to 40 but refused to make me full time when i asked. i was routinely asked to clock out for a lunch (before my six hour mark of being on the clock) to only stay on the sales floor and work through my lunch. i was always told i would get my lunch later but hardly ever did and only when my direct manager was there not when the gm was there. i was given no training on products that  the customers were asking about and what little training i got was for taking out the trash or waste management that was not in my job description. the only thing i enjoyed about the job were my coworkers they were amazing people to work with but still not enough to make me stay for minimum wage without benefits.
bad,"Some good, hardworking people work here and some managers recognize this and uphold respect, fairness and dignity to these associates. It is the store manager and ""aligned"" ASMs who tamper, abuse, and outright create a poisonous environment and culture in order to keep the full potential of associates capabilities down to grunt work. Regional management need to look at this....but they won't. As long as the store keeps profiting....nothing is wrong."
bad,"With Walmart on a daily basis, I would walk in and start stocking shelves and then i would zone the area and make sure everything was full and pulled the front and looked nice management was ok not the best place I worked at."
bad,"Managers care little to nothing about the employees only about making their quotas, have little to no problem refusing employees their breaks and yes this is true had one manager who constantly tried to refuse me my breaks, and when told I was going for my breaks told me ""I dont care get back to work"", managers have no problem disciplining employees for things that they themselves do constantly, employees are under constant threat of losing their jobs over even the smallest of things or having their hours cut to the point of being unable to support themselves or their families, provided they got any hours to begin with, have had my hours cut down from 23-27 a week to 12-13 multiple times during my employment with walmart"
bad,"most management needed working on, didn't get my breaks on time, on top of not get any assisted about a customer question or concerns  or if I needed any chance for the cash register their nowhere to be find"
bad,"They will cheat you out of hours and wages, but the workers make a friendly environment. It’s close to the bus stop and college, so it’s never slow but sometimes too busy"
bad,"A typical day at Walmart feels like a little bit of my soul dies with every breath I take. The management team there has no to minimal concern for their staff. Corporate keeps trying to find new ways to hurt its employees and proclaim that its ""helping""."
bad,"Cutting hrs pushing good employees out the door bad management, favortism,the skills of your supervisors is questionable unfairness, vendictive behavior open door policy a joke"
bad,"Walmart doesn't cross train, nor allow you to learn new task on your own.  Management constantly wanting more, with little to know help. Poor scheduling"
bad,"Walmart is very much a poor job atmosphere. They treat employees poorly and as disposable. Job pays minimum. long hours, brief breaks. terrible management."
bad,"some of the people i worked with we fun to work with "
bad,"I have seen more adverse policies here than any other place I've worked. Each store is different, and depending on the Manager, policies change overnight. There was huge turnover at my location. Once the manager changed, turnover dropped."
bad,"If you enjoy working with the public that may be the only benefit to this job. Unkind environment to work in, and its unfortunate to say that management is not too kind either, as well as the little pay with no room for growth. A good seasonal, or temporary job for students, but it becomes mentally draining, and physically trying. This workplace would not be recommended to those looking for a permanent position."
bad,Wal mart makes rules on the fly. Their always making easy work hard. Once you reach a certain pay their trying to get rid of you. Worse place ive ever worked. They cut hours from december-march then try to force ot on you when they want you to work. Management sucks half of them dont know what their doing. Production is insane sometimes its impossible to meet their goals. We had a hurricane hit ga and if you didnt come to work you got written up. Id never suggest to anybody to work here.
bad,Poor management. Too much favoritism. Low pay for all the work we do and not paid right.Too much gossip going around and managers don't take care of bullying.
bad,managers lacked at their job. workers were useless very few workers knew what they were doing always left trash everywhere didnt always put the right merchandise on the right shelf.
bad,"Management changed a few times during my employment, most of which were unprepared and ill-equipped to handle the position. more negativity and bickering among associates than i was prepared for. schedule changed randomly and without notification."
bad,As a current associate I feel that Walmart is ran poorly the management team is really rude and unfair about how they go about with certain situations and they need to be handled differently
bad,when a plan is made when you first walk in it never is done. Don't expect your bosses to back you up when customers are in the wrong or yelling or cursing at you. You are in the wrong. No one is to breathe or you will be asked what have you been doing this whole time while the whole time you got your list completed and they don't even look at what was completed at all.
bad,"Find a better place to work. This company is terrible and treats its employees like barn animals. The management is practically non existent, incompetent and totally disorganized. Management does nothing to help or make you feel appreciated. Walmart is constantly understaffed so you will be doing double the work for the same pay. They don't care about their employees one bit. They prey on desperate people. The pay is terrible. They blast terrible music all day long. Half the people who work there are insane and will drive you insane."
bad,"The managers were ignorant, barely did anything, and pinned the blame for anything bad that happened on my department (CAP 2) regardless of our involvement. We were overworked, understaffed, forced to take longer lunches so they could avoid paying us overtime, poorly trained, told us none of the rules or requirements (dress code, expected completion time, etc.) until after you violated them."
bad,"Only the young and innocent promoted. They want to make you into a robot. Quotas are the pits. Just like factory workers. They don’t trust their associates. They want to micromanage. "
bad,"Stressful, not many people offered help to anyone new or struggling. Iearned how to work alone, management was beyond terrible had no communication skills at all or were just flat out rude to employees. Hardest part of working there was actually wanting to show up because of fellow employees or managers with attitude all the time. I enjoyed most was clocking out knowing i worked the hardest i could that day/night."
bad,"Walmart pays poverty level wages (i.e $12/hr after a year and a half).  You are not provided with the tools to do your work.  This slows you down and adds frustration to your job.  While my direct manager is excellent, upper management is incompetent and works in an environment of fear."
bad,"The majority of management has no concern for the things that happen on a personal level as far as their associates. I understand that they (management's) concern is always going to be work, but if you don't show some compassion for the associates then you will never get the 100% the job requires or wants from them (associates)."
bad,I would never work at walmart again. Nobody teaches you nothing they just want you to do a job and not train you correctly . unprofessional and do care about how they treat others
bad,"a typical day at work involves me unloading trucks. I am expected to do 8+ hours of work in a 5 hour shift every day. If i dont complete it I am always being thrown under the bus. I am a college student and I am denied all of my school days off. I have competitions and grades that i have to fail because i cant get any school days off. No manager ever helps me, and at this point i have given up."
bad,"This company is not for the feint of heart.  As a department manager you are the person primarily responsible for your department.  Anything that goes wrong is your fault, and you will be severely admonished for it.  Salaried management is nothing short of catatonic in their reaction to problems that arise, and it seems their only job is to listen to department managers tell them what is wrong and what is needed of them and then do absolutely nothing, only to return in a rage when nothing changes.  "
bad,I cannot go into all this because I have had PTSD after being fired.  I was treated unfairly.  I was given the opposite hours I asked for on purpose.  I was told lies all the time.  The managers were nice when they wanted something from you some even gave you the hours you wanted.  But when management changed everything changed.
bad,"Some employees would be on their cell-phones taking calls on the floor while on the clock and halting progress, Department managers could become Assistant managers over ANY set department even if they had NO experience in it, we had bad scheduling, complete lack of equipment and management outright refused to order more of what we needed to the job and would single out and target associates that they wanted as work horses (Shifting an unfair workload) I would NEVER recommend Walmart to anyone to work at."
bad,"I can only speak for the Walmart store I worked at which was brand new and which I helped open. As a new Supervisor for 2nd shift the store manager advised me it was the most difficult job in the store.  She was not kidding.  They were unable to provide me with sufficient qualified team member to unload incoming trucks in the 2 hours demanded.  Instead of supervising, I found myself throwing the truck every single shift.  The store manager was constantly in our earpiece yelling.  As month 6 began, the ""good people"" / diligent workers they did have began to walk out.  The final straw for me was when I threw over 31,000 pounds of freight (I checked the BOL to confirm this) in just 3 hours and was screamed at for not getting it done in 2.  Apparently 5 tons per hour is slacking . . . good riddens Walmart - I do NOT recommend a supervisory position there - a kickback management job, maybe - if you know someone. No other way you will advance from sup. where they have actually been overheard saying; 'Burn them and turn them"". A hostile wok environment is fostered, not the 'One Way' you learn about in classroom training."
bad,"The managers ask far too much from the people that work there and do not give them the proper man power or equipment to get the work done.  For my job it includes unloading the truck or trucks we get 1 or 2 depending on the day,  processing claims apparel, stocking furniture, housewares, bedding, hardware, sporting goods, auto motive, garden, and stationary.  and if we finish with that which we are expected to do every day, we also start doing hba pharmacy cosmetics paper pets chemicals.  all of this is done with 8-13 people usually around 10 if we're lucky.  Customers always have questions on if we have something in stock but we are not provided with the equipment to check if we do. Nor do we have keys to get certain items off the shelf for customers.  We are asked to work more than 8 hours in one day but if we are scheduled for 40 hours we are forced to cut time on another day so overtime is not received."
bad,"The jobs I've worked at Walmart were very simple and easy, but the lack of schedule making made everything stressful. They made me basically take on three workers' jobs by myself. I was able to do it since I'm very active and good at my job, but it's very straining and stressful to take on so much responsibility especially when you never get any type of appreciation from all the work I did. Of course the customers were not in fault for my bad experience I had because Walmart did not want to hire more workers to help out all the customers we would have on a daily basis. There was only so many customers I can attend at a certain time before they'd get ticked off and leave. Overall, the work, the co-workers and the experience was the only things I enjoyed at Walmart."
bad,"Stressful , short staff, let customers walk all over them let stalkers stalk employees managers watch your every move but the enjoyable part was all the friends i made there"
bad,"A typical day  is never exactly the same."
bad,"I was a out side hire, thrusted into a world that was foreign expected to work at a high level, though was thrown into a sink or swim situation. I personally over came that opportunity. Though I was all ways seen as a outsider."
bad,The Walmart store I worked for has poor management skills. They either overwork you or don't give you enough work. I worked full time and was never offered any benefits either.
bad,"This job can be a great experience if you are in a well run store in a great region. "
bad,"Simple job, but the horrible management, combined with poor attitudes of supervisors and department managers makes it a very difficult place to work. The carrot on a stick routine gets old fast, and the unreasonable requirements for advancement/department transfer are a joke."
bad,"The management at our store is not professional at all. After working there for nearly 5 years I am compensated at the minimum rate.  What they did was raise the minimum rate, give the raise and then raise the rate to the minimum.  Not recognizing us for the experience that we bring to our job. They took away holiday pay. "
bad,The job started off good. My direct manager was great. The store manager was a bully and they didn't care about there employee's. My hours was cut so bad I couldn't pay my bills. I was promised a higher paying job that didn't happen .
bad,"Bad working conditions, unrealistic expectations, expects 1 person to do five peoples amount of work in less than half the time, managers are to strict and are doing things that they are not allowed to do and are getting away with it."
bad,"A more organized company than most, but a focus on cutting costs and streamlining leads to over work and under staffed. There is no flexability for the unforseen, i.e. someone call out sick. There is too often a skeleton crew that can hardly get the daily tasks set for them completed, and yet are always required to take on additional tasks every day. It is stressful and horrible for morale. The training is often skipped or rushed the emphasis being on completing a check box and not on understanding the job and how to donit correctly."
bad,"Only work here if you have to. They give you the run around and say one thing and do another, management was the worst . Did not like to work with there employees, however the discount was a ok thing."
bad,"Hey everyone, I know i will get slandered for telling the truth! heres a funny fact and not a joke, as a worker of this particular store i have been reported wrote up more times for doing my work than for not doing work which was never! True fact! I am now 2-0 d*mned if you do d*mned if you don't."
bad,After working for a company for 14 years you’d expect some kind of upward mobility. Not the case with Walmart. I gave a huge chunk of my adult working life to a company that doesn’t care about its employees mental health or safety.
bad,They treat you poorly.amount of pay dosent evan cover rent food and utilities.some managers treated employees they didnt like so bad that they quit.always had to watch your back.if you weren't a favorite or in a click .you worried about having a job
bad,"The management will do whatever it takes even breaking osha compliance and upper management is never happy with any level of productivity and always want more out of employees even if they are performing above average."
bad,"No effort to gain opinion of anything.  Stocking all day with only 2 breaks and 1 lunch for relief.  Management only interested in sales, nothing more.  No enjoyable parts of job.  Decent benefits, though.  management neither gives nor seems to care about any opinions offered.  No flexibility regarding moving departments for any reason.  Company is profit-driven to the exclusivity of anything else.  Any personalization, in my department in any case, is not only not encouraged but is not really allowed at all.  Poor hours.  No allotment at all for sick days or emergency absences, and any personal issues must be worked out regarding days off.  Too much back-biting and backtalk from employees.  Not a pleasant place to work at all.  It seems any suggestions are made to be disagreeable to management in any case at all.  No room for growth at all.  Transfers to other departments not really considered.  Hours can be cut at anytime with revenue-loss considered sufficient reason for cuts.  No variety in scheduled tasks.  Helping customers is very limited to yes or no answers.  Domineering management, mostly.  No help in operating some equipment.  Ordering seems excessive in most consumer products, at least in my department.  Little or no conversation with other employees, even in same department, is frowned upon.  Very surpressive atmosphere in which to work.  Would not in any way recommend others for employment at Walmart, and would try anything to get out of it, even if offered more pay."
bad,"walmarts associates are mostly good hard working people. however, the management team was mostly rude and obnoxious. constant yelling in the docks about ""faster, faster!"". compensation was a low wage. no perks at all no decent benefits. the only discounts were on food around thanks giving."
bad,"Used to be a family oriented work place.  Now just a number. Work is hard, they make you do jobs that you did when you were younger and stronger, because nobody stays there.  Many people have quite because of management problems brought on by higher ups in Walmart.  They have shortened our breaks and taking away incentives."
bad,"There are productive systems in place here for success, however, upper management at nearly every store I have visited is poor. The benefits were great!"
bad,"I worked as a cart pusher for two months at the Crawfordsville, Indiana Walmart, and wow. I have never seen anything like it. They had 3 cart pushers in total for the whole time I was there, and I was shocked by how they hang you out to dry. I worked every weekend day from Friday-Sunday on shifts like 3:30-10:15 or 4:45-10:30 (both pm’s). I would have to work until 11 on school nights and I would have split days off. They expected you to clean and wipe the carts down as well as sweep the floors in the register area when obviously they had maintenance there to do that. You didn’t have time to catch your breath there since the CSM’s (customer see managers) would be up your bum either complaining how bad of a job you were doing or something else that you did wrong. I walked into my store managers office and asked her if they would hire another cart pusher and she said that I’m complaining too much and I need to vent somewhere else. The cashiers would yell at you for not helping them with carry outs when obviously you do not know if there is any or not. I couldn’t believe how easy Cap 2 had it off. They had 10 people putting up products each night and then they would walk around for 2 hours just messing around. I found my time there to be wasted and I should have never tried getting a job there. There was one time where an employee threatened to kill me and I had to call the police since the management wouldn’t. As a high school job or a job that you have to take, it wouldn’t be that bad. But I felt like I wasted my time since I had no free time or time to do things since I had"
bad,"management was awful, they didn't take into account of what goes on  in a persons life and would not accommodate hours to work with your life style. however most of the front end staff where friendly."
bad,I have held many positions within this company and had many different tasks to complete each day. This is not something to answer in such a manner because it depends on what position you hold.
bad,"They expect you to give 100% until the job is completed, while only giving two small breaks, 20mins and 15mins. These breaks also include your travel time from where ever you are in the warehouse to the break room and back. You are expected to work anywhere from 8 hours to 15 hours a day."
bad,"Didnt like this job.  Poor management. People were somewhat friendly, and were nice. Pay was okay not the greatest. No benefits were offered when i was offerwd the job."
bad,"They cut the associates hours, and want the dame production completed with less employees available to work. They announced a salary raise, but they did no ñt gave a fairly raise to the associates with more years working there!  Managers just care about their bonus, because if the store safe in employees, their bonus is higher.  Lack of leadership skills, just push the associates for productions, bad work enviroment,(gossip, preference with some employees than others). Did not treat employees fairly!"
bad,"At Walmart your just another person to them. They have managers and supervisors that shouldn’t be. Also, tip do not make friends there you are on your own. People that work here are addicted to drugs and are always moody. I’ve worked at Target and they do drug tests but Walmart doesn’t . On the other hand,  people at Target are more friendly and mature. On Nov 2018, I got assaulted by an associate in front of a camera but management told me I would get fired.  This happened in Burbank Walmart, California “Please!!  do not work for Walmart”, even if your unemployed. Futhermore, they use you for different job positions that pay more but don’t pay you and use you. Walmart should be a temporary job not a career."
bad,"This is not the place to be working, they will do nothing but use you until they cant use you anymore and then when theyre done using you theyll throw you to the wolves. Not to mention the bullying by management and them to not do anything about it. Just save yourself the emotional rollercoaster and keep looking the pay isnt worth it."
bad,my hours went from 30 or 40 hours to 15 hours a week. Constantly yelled at. poor management. always stressful with little to no help but was expected to have my job 100% while others were  walking around or standing around. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"A typical day was covering every other department but your own, management was ""micromanagement"" style, workplace culture was ""no teamwork"".  Human Resources employees were rude most of the time."
bad,Never know what your hours will be working  from day to day.  Managers will hide in back office instead of dealing with cust complaints regarding staffing of store.  Managers make sure they get a weekend off but hourly employees have to beg for one.  If they get the weekend off they are threatened with possibility of getting hours reduced for rest of week.
bad,the staff is really nice but the managers are terrible. it is a hostile work environment. personal lives of workers are not considered at all and managers are always changing. it is an unsteady workplace that allows no employee to feel confident that they can express legitimate concerns. i do not recommend working there at all!
bad,"Corporate culture held back otherwise compassionate and productive managers.  No real direction in their initiatives, and oppressive in their policies.  A typical day at work meant having a billion managers and no employees, so you got pulled 15 different directions.  Wasn't given a chance to do my job well because I lacked tools and resources."
bad,"Walmart is a great place to work , but the management is the worst I have ever seen, they treat the employees real bad. The best thing About Walmart is the customers being able to help each and every customer."
bad,"The Walmart DC is a terrible place to work. The pay is good, that is the only good thing about Walmart, other than the %10 discount card they give you. The management is poor, they mandate you almost the whole year for overtime because they are so behind. You hardly have a life outside of work. The hours are long and hard and they screw you over time and time again. There are no lunch breaks, even for a 12 hour shift. They tell you at the last minute that you have to work overtime."
bad,Management team up against you when you were not a favorite also the way they change schedules last minute without letting you know your supposed to work you thought your day off was.
bad,Wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone in Woodward. Co-worker would get me in trouble saying they did something and finished a job when I’m the one that done what I was asked and finished my job. When I start a task I finish that task or more tasks before I took my lunch.
bad,"on a typical day in the DC you could be responsible for moving anywhere from 5k to 10k cases of product from dog food, to paper plates, to lawnmowers and tvs. direct managers understand you are human and do everything possible to make your day a little easier, but upper management continues to demand more and more from you. They expect you to meet that production regardless of the weight of the product or conveyor line run speeds. The job breaks your body and the high turnover rate and poor upper management with crush your soul. never. ever work for Walmart"
bad,I was promised a career with advancement opportunities instead I was placed in a store with a manager with several dui's and blames everything on everyone else but himself mentality.  According to policy with his history of DUI he should have been fired long ago but for some reason he is still around..I just couldn't take the constant threatening of our jobs and always cursing an yelling at us diringbout daily managers meeting after 3 years of taking nothing but abuse from him and working 70 -80 hours a week and it still not being enough for him (I slept in the parking lot on several occasions because it was not safe for me to drive home) I finally left the company aglfter several attempts to transfer out of that store with no success.
bad,"at Walmart you have constant fear of being fired, you cant be slow, you cant speak out or you will get in trouble, they cut everyones pay so often its hard to get by, they lock you down with rules so strict that its hard to say a single word without repercussions, this place was super uptight and its their way or the highway."
bad,It doesn't matter what you do as long as you don't steal you will have a job all managers hired out of company you cannot get promoted for working hard once you master a position they keep you in that position
bad,"The job was not a friendly environment to work in, too competitive did not work with my schedule, management was horrible, and they had no overlap, if someone called out there was no replacement. workplace culture was not followed. the most enjoyable part of the job was lunch because you didn't have to be in the building."
bad,"Absolutely no communication throughout leadership and management making the workplace hectic and chaotic. My co-workers were lazy and ""incapable"" of completing task forcing me to pick up behind them"
bad,"Walmart is a terrible company to work for. Yeah the pay is 11 an hour but once you get to working, you realize quickly it isn't worth the headache the managers cause. If the company cared about investing in the younger generation instead of holding onto their older partners then it wouldn't be too bad."
bad,Hated it co-workers are very poor in customer service nobody likes helping customers unless it's in their own department very rude employees. always felt like I was doing more then I was getting paid for
bad,"I worked for this company for 4 years (Assistant Manager) and the only thing they care about is getting the job done no matter if u have the staff for it or not, they dont care about their people. You can die today and they will say ok John Doe gone so we have hurry up in feel that spot. Trust me because I've seen it happen twice."
bad,They lie to get you to work for them. Promise you hours then after a few months cut them. You get a yearly raise between 5 and 16 cents. The health insurance is unaffordable for most assoicates. You don't get proper training in the department you are to work.
bad,Nothing to say really its been someething else .. And tbh ...... Its not organized at all and the staff and i mean all staff has bad and poor judgment
bad,"Management isn’t really great in Walmart. When I worked there I was basically running the bakery, I could do everything but decorate cakes. My manager expected me to do more than I had in my job title. Over all they are very lazy. So if you’re a hard worker, you’re going to get stuck with everyone else’s job."
bad,"Management does a poor job of scheduling as per customer demand, when associates or customers complain about it they basically just blow it off and move on. If you have any type of concern your managers pretend they care for a moment and you never hear about it again and nothing changes, even if you go above your store manager. As CSM you do your job, and everyone else's, while you're doing yours."
bad,WalMart in our area is a very high school like environment. It is kept this way purposefully by management. If you don't play their gossip games you will not have advancement possibilities nor will you be able to move departments.
bad,Were basically staffed minimum asked to help out whereever and whenever needed. Work in our depts never really gets done and we are made to be accountable for it.
bad,"If you are a student, don't try to work here. The hours suck. One week you could work 24 the next 8. Not enough money to pay bills, but they want you to have an open schedule"
bad,The management is awful and the work environment is terrible. I regret ever working there. I had nothing but problems with fellow associates and management.
bad,Walmart is okay but don’t give the upporunity to grow with the company and the mangerment are horrible and they pick and choose who they want as mangerment
bad,"In order to get head in Walmart at  location I work  at  black mail  management. Relative in management , Right Color of skin, Fraternizing and Favoritism  Dating Etc."
bad,I would not let any one I know work here. Advancement in this company by favoritism and not by work or skills. The management where never helpful and expected work loads that where ment for multiple people to do to be done by a single person in a small amount of time. Employees where not paid well and not listened to and at times made fun of.
bad,everything that I started at walmart for in benefits in 2003 they have taken away. from the 401k and sunday premium of $1 more an hour. On top of that most people at walmart make $10000 below poverty level.
bad,They can tell you one thing but would take every opportunity to make you look like you don’t know what  you are talking about to a customer which I feel makes you look like a liar in the customers eyes
bad,"Stressful difficult environment management communication is poor ,the training is not helpful.Most people are not happy there.Would not recommend working there"
bad,"Worst management I've ever worked for.  Alot of pettiness and hatefulness on the job with immature coworkers and management, who also happens to be retaliatory if you request an open door with a problem.  Like I said, worst employer ever."
bad,Manatement want greatest . Not enough hours to support a family off of didnt like fact they act like they are doing you a favor by you being there. Liked people worked with.
bad,"The walmart that I worked at was terrible. I dreaded going to work people the people were extremely rude and didn't care at all. Many would refuse to work, leaving the few who actually cared to be overloaded with work. The management was terrible- they would fire and get new managers all the time. There were two managers who were good people, but the rest were rude, and terrible to work for. The hardest part of the job was being pressured to do a job you know you can't do. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you clock out and go home so you doing have to be in such a toxic environment. Even with the nice pay, it wasn't worth it."
bad,"Rude, Unhelpful Management,Low Pay and High Turnover. The wal-mart I worked at had a new store manager every three months. That left it opened for the department managers to do whatever they wanted. Including cussing at and belittling the workers. Walmart also will still instruct workers to work off the clock to meet your time goals. The have very poor training and often have problems with there pay system that leaves the workers waiting up to a month after their pay date to get paid."
bad,"Si bien los jefes son exigentes y demandan bastante, el ambiente con la gente que compartes dentro de tu sección es grata."
bad,"Typical day would be truck unloading, stocking and filling, binning over stock. Management is a quack, went through 8 managers in 8 months and every manager was rude. The last set of managers were beyond cruel. Tells you one thing, then fires you for doing as they tell. They would be mean and make fun of you in front of customers and when going to a higher management they would look at you and tell you that they had no idea how to handle the situation. I would NEVER recommend walmart to work for at all and I have not been in this walmart since! I have learned a lot of things, most enjoyable part was meeting new people and interacting with new customers daily."
bad,No teamwork as a SUPPORT MANAGER for the 3rd shift 9pm- 6am I was the only manager there no other manager at the store barely any employees to stock the store. Manager was very hard on all employees very difficult to work for.
bad,"Bad management. Poor customer service. "
bad,"The company and management will use and abuse you until there is nothing left. Your soul will die a slow and painful death while working here. You do get a 10 % ,discount but you cant even use it on food."
bad,"Management are very hostile to the workers over night. They constantly talk down, degrade, curse, and threaten the workers. Overnight management do not have any respect for people and that includes customers."
bad,"Walmart 'a aucun respect pour ses employés"
bad,Essentially the worst company to grow with. Awful benefits for part-timers. Closing shift and overnight are always forgotten. This is not a place where hard work will pay off.
bad,I don't care to participate in this type of interrogation as Walmart is past history for me. I consider my evaluation of Walmart to be personal. What does this have to do with anything?
bad,"If you want a job where you are heard and are looking for advancement in the company, look elsewhere. I worked here for 3 years only to be fired for pointing out and reporting one of my co-workers after he messed up a customer's car."
bad,"Good environment all around. Bad management skills. Some seemed not to care. Very few actually cared. Not bad pay but to much stress, management yelled too much. And took anger out on lower associates."
bad,"The prevailing culture at Walmart is compliance achieved through intimidation. You constantly have to or are reminded to, watch your back. Even the computer messages you receive when you punch in and out are threatening. Recent message seen: check to see if you have CBL's to complete.  ""YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE"". It's extremely stressful. I've worked at other Walmarts out of state, but they were not like the West Charleston Store #3473. There is also a tremendous amount of favoritism and nepotism at this particular location. In addition, management does not provide the basic tools and supplies to do your job. They are also never around when you need them. This Walmart is the worst I've ever worked at."
bad,"The job itself wasn't exactly terrible, but having to deal with some of the most lazy and brain dead people on the face of the planet was. "
bad,this place never seemed to amaze me some nights I would be the only cashier and have to check out customers for the whole store with no help. I would feel mistreated at times.
bad,"Training is bad, and Management is just as bad. A lot of favoritism with upper management. They expect you to do you job with very little training regarding your own area"
bad,Would not recommend anyone to work for walmart. Poor management and employees lost customer service skills and gained attitude. Walmart does offer decent benefits only plus of working there
bad,stocking the sales floor in the grocery department. proving excellent customer service and cleaning the sales floor for a safe environment for the customers to shop.
bad,"Poor management within the company is driving associates out of the store. Most associates within Walmart are good-hearted individuals, yet those put into management positions are not fit for the job and do not know how to properly respond to most situations."
bad,"The pharmacy atmosphere is usually chaotic. No one wants to wait on the customers,  so those who don't object get stuck out front. Coworkers are lazy, management has no idea what is going on. The new scheduling system is a joke. Never enough employees there to cover all the customers. Be prepared to never see your family or have any time outside work. Company likes to work employees 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 days in a row, and because of the way their work week is arranged, none of it is overtime. They make a big deal about ethics, but Wal-Mart is one of the most unethical companies."
bad,"place shopping carts block off comosmo"
bad,"Not a career path unless you are part of the Fortune 500. I mean come on its Walmart they stopped caring in 1992. it took 10 years to really see it but take a look now. does your cashier look happy to serve you? Does the quality of what you buy seem to be improving? "
bad,Corporate is always changing things when they get bored. Corporate is such a joke. They have no idea how people actually work.I bet those people would not last a day working at Walmart. The pallets are not stacked right and sometimes the pallet comes in slanted!! The people in the warehouse do not know how to stack they put the heavy stuff on top and the light stuff on the bottom.This company does not treat adults like adults but kids.
bad,"The amount of time I worked there had felt like a waste as management did not care for its workers Or customers, I will never work with Walmart again."
bad,Wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. My experience they really don't care about their associates well being. You are just a body to them. Wouldn't work for this company again.
bad,Do not work here. Do not waste your time and energy. This place will break you until you have nothing left to give. It’s a constant struggle with people yelling at you for doing something wrong almost every day.
bad,"Management policies are constantly flipping back and forth, they always bend over for the customer even when the customer is clearly wrong. Clear seniority structure within the company to the extent that employees that have been here longer take 15 minutes breaks that last 45 minutes, yet nothing is ever done about it no matter how many times you bring it to managements attemtion. Salaried and hourly managers are constantly fraternizing outside of the workplace and showing favoritism to each other, all of which violates walmart policy."
bad,Overnight is tough! No backing from upper management. I have to run the store by myself multiple occasions. I would also come in in off days to help management out and couldn’t keep my overtime.
bad,Very stressful and lacking good management and equipment to do the job. Nothing is consistent. There are very few fully trained workers so their workload is doubled.
bad,"good overall . i love working there. i regret why left that lovely place, i had my own customers come to me only.Basic Math."
bad,The hours are very inconsistent. Day shift one day night shift next. Other employees clearly do not like their jobs and are highly unfriendly. They tell you during hiring that if the department you are in isn't working out you can move to another department but when you ask to move they don't let you.
bad,"They teach their managers to lie. To the employee's, to the customers, to the vendors, to the suppliers, to anyone. The culture is built upon lying and cut throating each other to get ahead."
bad,"I was never respected by my immediate supervisor, despite my endless effort to overachieve or impress my superiors with my knowledge of the job, skills and effort."
bad,"-Shifts are 9 hours long."
bad,The company hands down changes for improvement that actually hurt the company. The home office doesn't realize this because each store preps for visits so the impression the higher ups get is that these programs are working when they really are not.
bad,"Out of my 3+ years at Walmart I only had one good manager that taught me important lessons & values, most of the other managers including the store manager don’t know what they’re doing. Very unorganized"
bad,"My experience with the Florida city Walmart was horrible.  There was a lot of preferential treatment for positions,  and culture.  You were promised opportunity for full-time hours and progressive movement and instead received aggressive behavior and discrimination of culture or whether or not management was fond of you."
bad,I prefer not to answer because it is entirely to much to type. But just know the money may be great but the atmosphere and culture of working for them sucks. Alot of favoritism and unfairness.
bad,I was fired after 14 years for being late... 45 min drive each way and had a transfer approved since Nov. 2016.very poor management and a very hostile working environment.
bad,I worked there for over 5 months and my family was hospitalized and I got fired because I had to be there to take care of them and I could not get my points waived to keep my job
bad,A lot of micromanaging by upper management the pay is not that great tremendous amount of responsibility underappreciated I suggest to anyone not to work here.
bad,"description says it all, hard unfulfilling days dealing with abusive management. perhaps it was just the one i worked in but i would not recommend employment"
bad,"As a part time associate the job was great. But once you become salaried management the job becomes a nightmare. There was little to no understanding of family time. As an ASM you would be kept in the dark, given questionable direction, and when seeking to clarify would be told upper management didn’t know why they were giving you orders but that they came from the market manager."
bad,"My manager was rude to me on several occasions. And Whenever I didn't know what to do, I was told to just stand around. That's ridiculous, you can't expect the store to run, If your hiring people to ""Zone"" (pickup t-shirts) and you've only got 3 registers open at the front. Which Iv'e seen for myself. You guys never gave me an opportunity to move up, but instead, the girl that walked up and down the isles on her personal cell phone all day, is my manager. The person that doesn't care about their job get a higher position than someone like me, a hardworking kid willing to go above and beyond. This work experience that I've had with you guys is something that I will never forget. And you guys really need to change something. I can't even get a job at another one of your stores, but I see people walking around on their phones all the time. Anyways, I hope someone actually reads this."
bad,very unstable environment. low job security with uncertain future. management is rude and does not care about drivers and their needs. its all about them and their loads....also they seem to hire only one type of drivers and lack diversity. better off somewhere else.
bad,"If you are just looking for a place to work and not worry too much about getting work done, this is the place. If you do work hard there isn't much compensation for it or notice of it. The pay is definitely below what's expected of you to do."
bad,It’s not good money at all and they treat you like a slave. They are always open and super busy. It’s a easy job to get hired at but they have you do EXTREMELY too much for the pay.
bad,Working at Walmart wasn't too bad at times. A majority of the time they set unrealistic goals and expect them to be completed by the end of your shift. Not everyone is able to do the work of 4 people and they have yet to understand that.
bad,"When I worked there the only thing that was good was if you to college you can have your job back when you finish for the semester."
bad,"There was no work life balance as a manager, if they call you, you must answer or expect a nasty remark when you do talk to them. They have you working more then 50 hours a week with no compensation. And when working over nights 8 pm to 8am they had no care if I needed to take over watching my son so my husband could go to work they would still try and keep me till past 9am"
bad,Hours are never consistent. Management doesn't care about its employees. You have days that are slow and then you have days that are busy. Management doesn't pay attention to the demands of the store needs to make sure customers are helped in a timely manner.
bad,The managers for the front end are horrible and they do not pay attention to their pagers. The hours are inconsistent and they schedule you unexpectedly so you never know when you'll have to work
bad,"Walmart is suppose to be a family place, most people was out for their selves a lot of management didn't keep anything classified when you had one on one"
bad,"My father died and my mother was diagnosed with untreatable stage 4 lung cancer all within the same month, 4 months later I was fired. "
bad,The new direction the store is going is causing everyone to leave. Just don’t go there because the pay raise they gave to entry level also means less hours and more cuts to everything else
bad,"This was by far the most brutal, unforgiving, demanding, strenuous job I have ever had. Almost NOTHING is EVER good enough for these people. They pay measly wages and expect the world of their employees. I cannot imagine a much more difficult, cut-throat culture than this. Management had good and bad people in it, with some people nicer than others just like any other place. My manager seemed like a nice person personally, but you know VERY well that corporate is constantly on her tail demanding more and more and more and more! There is no pleasing this company, no matter what!"
bad,They aren’t family oriented people. Always wanting employees to do managers job without manager pay. Yelling all the time and stressed all the time. Hateful and worried only about their money and wellbeing. Literally the worse cooperation ever
bad,Walmart distribution center. Long hours until you get close to overtime. Then they send you home. Hard to get a full 40 hour week. Health insurance is too expensive. You must earn your vacation and sick time with hours worked.
bad,management sucks not enough organization   too much favoritism don't care about your family and don't take doctor excuses short stuff all the time its
bad,"NO fair opportunities for advancement clear discrimination and favoritism, no room for growth i was at walmart for 3 years and i only got promoted one"
bad,"long hours, no set schedule, belittled by management i would not recommend   this corporation to anyone.you are considered a employee and a body not a person"
bad,I worked extremely hard at Wal-Mart. Working more hours then I should and I never got full time. My manager was very unfair to me. Never would approve my vacation days and always wanted me to work.
bad,Very stressful not getting issues resolved. The company is supposed to be team work oriented. Not so much. Most of the time the customers are friendly and helpful. There are a lot of equipment errors. Running out of supplies to perform the job.
bad,"Horrible management,  no structure , never a manger around when customers need help , cashiers always leaving,  managers only care about the people that they like to go on breaks etc"
bad,"In my experience at Wal-Mart, management was always watching you. They would come walking around every 5 minutes to check to make sure you were still working. They'd throw you in 3-4 departments because the store was always understaffed, they'd give unrealistic time constraints on when you should be done with a given task, they over work you and don't care. Training is done on a computer instead of on the floor,"
bad,"Scan a pallet and take it to the right lane to be slotted to go out to the stores or dc."
bad,"i love working with the public however the lack of management is what really turned me away from walmart.  The management is very unprofessional, holds conversations in inappropriate places, is not respectful of what the employees does for the company."
bad,"When I worked here they were constantly changing managers. They had unrealistic expectations for the staff. They were understaffed, like there were more managers than employees! This place just ears away at you and you start feeling depressed the longer you work there."
bad,"Walmart was literally the most toxic work place I've ever been at. I'll never go back and I tell everyone I know to not shop there and never, under any circumstances, work there!!"
bad,"The job wouldn't be so bad if the store manager knew what she was doing and wasn't so belittling to her employees. I've been in retail for 10 years so I can deal with rude, but she's on another level. But with Wal-Mart, If the store makes money, your complaints mean nothing."
bad,"Did not have the correct tools to due your job."
bad,"New store management is evil witch. The ones that are nice, cannot wait to get out of there.  I have been with Walmart for 7 years in Deli  I finally cannot take any more.  They pay well but you better forget about your outside life and watch your back.  Heard every Walmart to not customer friendly and associate friendly anymore."
bad,"the customers alone were terrible and the managers really did not care about you or your problems and you were always treated like dirt by both managers and customers, i would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"They treat people like if there not humans they don't let us take our lunches and breaks on time "
bad,Let's just say the people I worked for and the manager I had did nothing and all the managers support wanted to do was get everyone in trouble not just me. If your scheduled from 11 to 7 am Christmas eve and or Christmas night you are required to work. Where as working Christmas is optional for day staff. I found the inviorment on overnights is just way to stressful. First place I have ever had to stock 8 pallets in a night by myself might I add. I do not recommend Walmart and or okotoks Walmart to be specific.
bad,"i learned people are very rude some times"
bad,They are very strict at walmart they are pushy tbey only  gave u 3 call outs if you made a mistake they didnt care they still blame you for doing on purpose etc they dont care about family either.
bad,"Come in and evaluate what needs to be done, and set priorities. Before starting i make sure to clean the stockroom so the day goes more smoothly. Check over others work to make sure nothing has been missed or left undone before i arrived. If i'm finished with the days work, i break down and clean various areas of my department. Clean up, make donations and leave information for the morning shift on our whiteboard about anything that may have come up."
bad,Walmart isn't  the best place to work...let it just be a stepping stone for you...Poor Mgrment! The workers are nice...I  like meeting the people.....
bad,"Several managers were often rude and very condescending. Customers were allowed to be very verbally abusive to employees and policies were not followed for returns, making employees look foolish in front of customers. There were almost never enough cashiers scheduled, never enough people to run customer service, and never enough people in the lot to gather and bring in carts. While CSMs did not make the schedules, they were blamed for long lines and carts not being in. It was very difficult to get a response to calls for help up front and several employees were very rude about it to us, even though we were just doing our job. We'd also be given multiple responsibilities, while our other CSMs would be trapped in customer service or on register, so you'd have one CSM trying to do propane (outside), jewelry counter, cosmetics case (several aisles away from the front end), kayaks, answer cashier questions, get change for registers, fix self-checks, and help in customer service, but they’d still get yelled at by management over the radio for not watching the lines. It was constant, non-stop stress."
bad,it was a horrible place to work for. they did not care about you just getting the items to the floor. they forced all managers to work 60+ hour weeks and when asking for time off they made you feel bad
bad,Management doesn't know what they are doing and the people have to pick up the slack.  Can be forced to work up to 14 hours a day and mandatory overtime on scheduled days off.  Your hard work will not be acknowledged and they will write you up for every little thing they can.  Impossible to reach production standards.  Constantly talked down to by upper management and management alike.
bad,"When you walk into Walmart, you will clock in at the back. The managers at the store I worked at were rude and unprofessional. They asked you to clock in early, but you would get an occurrence (a bad mark on your attendance)  that they would refuse to take off. You could work really hard and still you aren't doing enough and you would never get praised, only asked to do more. They would make you cut your over time on your lunch so they wouldn't have to pay you for it. Management would throw you under the bus if it meant they wouldn't get in trouble. All in all, a bad place to work."
bad,"It’s an ok job, but not the best. It has its ups, but it also has its downs like any job. They rarely offer overtime, and very few people get offered 40 hours a week."
bad,"Worked for this company a total of 11 years and have seen them becoming worse and worse with work practices and poor wages. They give the same raise percentage to every employee whether you are hard working or a slacker; and with the pay bump, new highers make as much as tenured employees who have been there even 5 years. They do not care about their employees well being, only about the work agenda and making money. It is not a healthy work environment for anyone wishing to move up in the company. There is no real work structure, constant miscommunication and no proper traing for employees. They are just thrown into the mix sink or swim."
bad,"Don't work for Walmart. Walmart is a terrible place to work. No upward mobility, managers are rude and selfish. Some associates who are favorites get away with sub par performance. If you think about working at Walmart don't."
bad,"Management is the entire issue with this place. If the management was as nice in every store as it is in those in Arkansas things would be fine. "
bad,a few of the managers are great..others leaving you wondering how they got in their position and held it for that long of time. quality does not exist. I have been with this corporation for 5+ years and have never received a cost of living raise...unless you count the $300.00 bonus that Trump and the Government gave the Walton kids..
bad,When I worked directly with my manager it was great but the store manager was a very poor manager. His attitude was very nasty and that spread throughout the entire store. I did not like that I could not get a set weekly schedule. I never knew how many hours I would get or on what days. It was difficult to plan a typical week.
bad,Walmart gave me almost no training in my department then continued to expect more from me as the days went on. Luckily the other employees helped me with the proper training since management couldn’t be bothered.
bad,"Lack effective communication in management skills, unfair  treatment to staff, favoritism, racism, lack cultural training in management, no work life balance. ect."
bad,"Walmart is just good for a first start of having your first job or a part-time job. It's so much going on with the entire company itself to the point the company doesn't get involved with the employees, so basically you're just a person who works there."
bad,The walmart culture is very negative.  Associates are in constant fear of their jobs being eliminated or hours being cut. Benefits are constantly being downgraded and associates are expected to work above their pay grades.
bad,Would not recommend it if you wanted to pursue anything else in life or have time off to do anything .Management is terrible they treat their associates like you’re not human they don’t care if you’re sick I have to take care of the  elderly.
bad,"Bad experience, as temp job is fine not for a career. Management doesn't differentiate between good hard working associates and others, treat them all the same."
bad,"Worked there for 10 years and in the end it was very laxed. We had associates with over 15 absences but still kept their jobs. It was almost like we had to say pretty please come to work and do your job."
bad,Walmart only care about making money they don't care about the employees are their customers. Walmart is all about getting the consumer money and not paying their employees a dime to make a honest living off of.
bad,"As a Remodel associate there was a lot of good hours and overtime opportunities. But working in receiving as an unloader was a lot of different issues. Coming into work it was always demanding. Both managers in the back would crack the whip and blame the employees for their mistakes. All employees felt like the managers were riding us and making us do things that weren't in our job description. There was a major shortage in staff because of poor management and awful scheduling. There was nothing to look forward to coming into work at all. And they underpay for all of the labor they force you to do. Look if you need a place to get your foot in the door this is it, but a long term career here is not recommended at all."
bad,Doesn't care about you or your family. No matter how long you work there. Could be 2 months or 15 years your still just a number.  And vacation is earned by how many hrs you work but you can't go over 40 a week or your getting wrote up and you only gain 2 hours for every 40 hrs you work and only after 6 months.  And most positions are part time so don't count on a full paid vacation because your sick days are included in that also.
bad,"I have never worked so hard for a company and yet treated so unfairly.  They never see any of the good that you do for them, only the mistakes you made."
bad,I Did Not Like My Job At Walmart. The Managers Are Horrible And Can Careless About Your Life Or What’s Going On Outside Of Work. I Would Not Recommend Anyone To Work There Unless You Really Need The Money
bad,Although they offered good hours it wasn't worth the stress and drama that came along with the job.  I don't speak poorly of the WHOLE company just the store location I was hired at ( LEE ROAD in ORLANDO FL)
bad,"Walmart deli is an extremely hard position to work. The expect alot for little pay. I would not reccommend working in the deli department"
bad,"At Wal-mart, you are paid way below the average in order to make products cheaper for customers. They constantly change things in the effort of making customers happy, that end up not only aggravating customers but making things twice as hard for employees. Paid time off is based on worked hours and the ratio of worked to earned is very low for non-management employees. their insurance is very high for non-management and they encourage you to seek insurance through government aid program, again, in order to keep prices low for customers. They are extremely uncaring when it comes to illness, offering an insanely low, 8 outs per rolling 6 month period and will often make you work sick even in the fresh areas where working sick is a health hazard. There is zero consistency for hours and you could be working till 10 pm only to open at 6 am, the next day. If you change your availability to suit the shift you want and stop the bouncing shifts, you may not work as often as you like as the scheduling is done largely by computer. The management team is next to useless for employees, as they are slow to act and they rarely communicate with each other. On a few occasions, people were fired for doing their job, but because customers raised a stink.  A quick talk with my fellow coworkers quickly shows how broken moral is as very few people want to work there but they are unable to find work elsewhere.  However, they are not without their good points, they are decent at paying out if you have an injury as long as it isn't due to negligence and after you have been there for several months"
bad,"ive worked there for 15 years, i havent advanced yet. need to listen to associates more. a typical day at work you go in do your job and go home. ive learned alot about customer service."
bad,Switch in management has swifted the culture of the company.  Not an equal employer when it comes to gay employees.  Employeed for a very long time with them.  New management comes in and everything changes
bad,At the current rate that Walmart culture is devolving and the rate long term employees are leaving Walmart will turn into K-Mart in a decade. It is not too late for them to turn this around but it would require the corporate will to do so. When you are forced to give a fantastic worker who has been with the company for a decade a $0.17 raise then you have a problem.
bad,"Walmart is a cult-like environment. With management, it's Walmart or bust. I had 3 different supervisors who all told me different things to do. Some of my coworkers were no help and threw me under the bus a few times."
bad,I was the only person certified as a mechanic and I was making 8 dollars the hour no breaks no paid benefits hated the staff attitude towards employees no respect and not a good place to works
bad,"They're really rude , strict , uptight , and have high expectations for what the job really is. One feels always ""on guard"" working here. Even when you think or know you're doing your job right, there's always a fear of getting in trouble, getting wrote up for something you didn't do on purpose."
bad,"poor work ethics and no respect between others, only when needed. unless youre a favorite within the store, you wont be treated the same. you have to be part of the company for 20+ years to be respected."
bad,"When Sam Walton imagined the store we now know as Walmart, I'm sure he did not mean for this bitterness and money grubbing to become instilled into the upper management. Too often I was reminded how if the boss wasn't happy, ain't no going be happy kind of environment I was a part of while working there."
bad,"Management constantly swaps sides of issues depending on who is present that current day. Company policies mean nothing or everything depending entirely on who is present that day. Thanks to this, it creates a violently toxic environment with customers getting their way one day and completely shutdown the next for the same things."
bad,"Management treats you badly unless they like you. There is no area for improvement unless they like you. They show little integrity and honesty. Management only cares about themselves. They ask how you are doing out of protocol, they have no actual care for you."
bad,The hardest part about this job is the lack of teamwork. No one seems to want to help the cashiers when help is needed on their end. The next hardest is the lack of pay and hours
bad,management has their favorites they by pass rules regulations and everything if they want too. there are plenty of people who work there who don't get promoted because management gives stuff to their buddies even if they don't qualify for it they will also make up stuff just to get people gone even if you haven't done anything wrong.
bad,"Ok pay. Hours sucked. They stick you in the freezer which was -20 degrees. They don't give you an option to get out of working on the cold side. They have mice, and it smells like gluteus major up in there...  😣"
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart, I had thought i was back in high school. There is so much drama, and gossip it is basically a playground for grown children. Most members of management have not listened to any ideas I presented, and they just do what they think is right. The most I have learned was how to drive a forklift. The most enjoyable part of the job, is assisting the customers, and being left alone to complete my tasks. The hardest part is a direct supervisor who leans on a cart all day, and watches another team member do tasks, then takes all credit for it. I was also working full time hours but they had me labeled as part time."
bad,The management is horrible! Employees are rude to one another its just awful. NOT enough pay. Bathrooms are nasty all the time it's just bad I would not recommend working here to anyone!
bad,Everyone I talk to including myself has had to be put on anxiety medication after started working here. The only decent part of the job is the pay and only working 3 1/2 days a week.
bad,This place will do anything to save a dollar. Take it out of there employees and could care less about your ideas or needs. Would not recommend anyone to work for this company
bad,it was ok some good team some not i will not worked her no  more they need more help in team work and more smiles and freely team sometimes it was good sometimes no
bad,"would never work there again in my life, was treated very unfairly from two different Walmart's I've worked at. would never recommend working there to anybody."
bad,"every bad thing you have heard about working at walmart is true"
bad,WalMart places untrained individuals into management positions with no prior skills. Most enjoyable part of the job was I got to be outside a lot.  Attendance policy is not reasonable.
bad,I liked Walmart at first but they are not very Professional they are always late on break missed lunches. You only have for stikes. No pto ni sick days.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart would be having little to no coverage, While being employed through Walmart I learned that it is not an ideal job short term or long term, at least a my location I didn't have the best management either there would be multiple occasions where I would call for assistance and none of them would show."
bad,"My time at Wal-Mart was the worst of my life. Constant stress, low salary, poor management. Associates are constantly pressured to do overtime with no compensation. Health insurance is only available for full time employees (which you have to go on a waiting list for) or part time if you have no sick days for a YEAR. I don't know what else to say. Just awful."
bad,Management makes it a very stressful atmosphere to work in. The company no longer cares about their employees or their customers. And don't want to be bothered with either one.
bad,It lacks communication with eomployees loor management and the supervisor to the store has no care in the world for those who have sick children I wouldnt reccomend to nobody
bad,"Walmart used to be family oriented and was a great place to work. Now if you are not in a click with the management team you are very expendable, even when you do your job correctly."
bad,"I enjoy working with my coworkers that's about it, because a typical work day is sometimes stressful because you have to deal with all of the customers and a lot of attitudes with little to no help from management. The work demand is high with very little pay."
bad,"There was too much favoritism. If you didn't go with what they wanted they would find a way to get rid of you. it was very hard to move up. the assistant managers wouldn't be on the same page and you would never get the ""right answer"" for any questions that you had."
bad,management has no idea what theyre doing. no benefits you ge written up if you work overtime. all in all just a very bad experience. they promote lazy workers and punish the hard working ones.
bad,"It was had it's ups and downs but what really made it worst was the lack of management control and the way of speaking to a person, and not like a thing or NOT A SLAVE."
bad,Its like a tornado  and home office does not help at store level so the store manager can do what ever he or she wants to do i dont like it i soend more time at work then i do with my kids
bad,This is a place that hires mostly college kids.  No one was professional.  Management called me a liar when i disagreed about a write up.  I was told to just sign my write up and get out.
bad,"Loved my position and customers.   The toxic company culture of management made it unbearable at times.  I had six different managers above me, telling me to do six different things."
bad,"without a doubt the worst job i have ever worked.  Was promoted to Support Manager within months but came to realise its all politics.  Management brings in people from different countries to work as management for cheap and with no experience.  Extremely racist if you are not one of their own."
bad,Here's an easy way to summarize Walmart Singing Hills Sioux City Iowa management is something that is lacking majorly the associates are overworked and underpaid the management is demanding Perfection when there is no such thing as perfection
bad,Working at Walmart always made me feel like a commodity to be squeezed for as much as I was worth. Workers were always expected to give 100% with little tangible reward and the threat of termination was explicit and ever-present.
bad,I would recommend Walmart to people because I don't believe all the stores are the same. I just don't like the idea of showing a receipt before leaving the store and proving I purchased the items
bad,"I enjoyed the people at Walmart. Really nice people. Great computer in the pharmacy. "
bad,alright if you only want part time. pay if only minimum  and you get no appreciation for the work that you do and way too much drama might as well work in a factory
bad,"I enjoyed being a cashier and the people.  For the most part they do not make you full time, most no one sees that unless your in management.  Standing 6-8 hours, constant lifting over the register sometimes over 50 pounds is just physically something I am no longer able to do."
bad,"Worked there for over 2 years, lots of management turnover and several employees quit due to scheduling issues and favoritism. Was forced to move from my current position to another without choice but then later placed back in the bakery."
bad,"Walmart doesn't care about you. They want cutthroat people in management and people that are only out for themselves. "
bad,"when i first started. the management was amazing, everyone was good at covering shifts and there was a lot of nice teamwork. months in they started putting in a new scheduling system which made everyone part time and rarely get past 20-23 hours a week. Many coworkers left and good managers too do they got replaced by random replacements. Was not what i expected"
bad,working at Walmart was good for the first 3 years and then the work just got to stressful nobody should be going home stressed and angry because of management the pay was good but management was the worse.
bad,Management has no idea what they’re doing. They overwork you and unless u kiss their behind u got no future there. They use you whenever they need you but when you need something from them they don’t help you.
bad,Foi meu primeiro emprego fui muito bem recebida me ensinaram o que era preciso para um caixa
bad,"Not good no stability or equal opportunity   , no dr notes are for use unfair wages , a lot of favoritism no Appreciation or incentives   poor medical"
bad,Working there is hard. You have to know everything about every department even if your only taking care of one. Management doesnt accurately answer your questions unless they like you.
bad,Hated it it was awful the worst pace I’ve ever worked in my life all of the managers are rude in ethical the job is very cut throat every man for himself
bad,This company is underpaying their associates. They are not organized and this is a place to work only for a short term period to obtain experience and to look for advancements elsewhere.
bad,The job titles are pointless because an employee will be assigned to do multiple things they are not entitled to do. As a “people greeter” I did not spend one day actually greeting customers. Instead I was usually assigned to do freight and run a register when needed. Management was very rude and demanding.
bad,"Everyone, especially retail workers know the stress that working with the general public is like. Now times that by 10. I got hit by a car once in their parking lot on my way to my shift and when I told them I couldn't work because I was emotionally unable to, they gave me a serious attitude about letting me go home because I wasn't in a medical emergency even though they also don't want you crying in front of customers (I was a cashier)."
bad,"Pressure to get merchandise to shelves, by management, was overboard in most instances. Had to stay until job area was complete. No overtime hours were paid. To balance your work schedule to 40 hours per week, If you had 1 hour of over time, for example, you would punch in an hour later than your scheduled time and in order to attend the shift meeting, a regular scheduled daily meeting was held, net result was the employee would sit in the lounge for an hour before being allowed to punch in and not get paid though they were on property and ready to go to work. This happened more times than I care to remember and to many employees. Working over-night shift was not for me. It really screws with your body's time clock."
bad,the hardest part of my job was never knowing when i was going to work next. some nights i would work until 11pm and i would have to come back the very next morning at 7am
bad,"Most days I worked on autopilot. I worked returns so that alone was stressful but the management is what made it unbearable. Most managers  either spent the day joking around, or were breathing down your neck when you're already doing what you're supposed to be doing. Some just run and hide from you or blatantly ignore you when you go to them about a problem. There were days I didn't even know what CSM was working despite being there for a solid 3 hours."
bad,"The work load of job compared to pay is simply bad. "
bad,Most employees are friendly. Can't believe Management. Not enough employees. Some departments are very challenging. Management goes beyond availability. Not flexible.
bad,"fast paced yet stressful"
bad,"Busy and stressful place to work that is very short-staffed.  Learned a lot about working with different personalities and about how to put up freight while helping customers get the items that they need for work or home.  "
bad,The short time that I was there I had about three new managers.  And a typical day at work was just making sure that the dressing rooms were clean and that I answered the phones.
bad,"Benefits are worth it if you are full time. Otherwise, its a job you will likely end up hating. Management enjoys terminating people, instead of working to properly train or assist employees with hardships. They prefer to terminate and allow failure, instead of use resources and time to ensure or boost the success of most employees. I would not recommend this business to anyone to work, as turnover is high and the work culture is insensitve to its most valuable assets."
bad,"Despite their best attempts at appealing to a broad area of potential employees I constantly hear nothing but bad things since leaving there. Equipment is constantly breaking down, management does not listen to their employees on how to improve business practices and overall do a great job at making employees feel unwanted because of the high turnover rates for new employees. Its a better place to shop at, but terrible to work at."
bad,This was an absolute terrible place to work. I don't recommend for anyone to ever work there. I worked in the pharmacy and the managers would not give me the hours I needed and did not view me as part of the team but just as a number.
bad,Walmart is a very stressful place to work. They put unrealistic goals on the stockers. And never notices anything you do above and beyond your job. They glorify Walmart as a whole but behind the seens  they pick and glorify people in their click that do very little if everything
bad,"I never felt I mattered. Very cold management team, unless they needed something. Assistant managers switch every 6 months and we very seldom saw them, yet they were in charge of evaluations. Lots of gossip and back biting, could trust very few. Management never pleased nor did they give compliments when deserved except to a hand picked few."
bad,"I worked there because I was waiting for something else to come along, this was not the best place to work, the pay was horrible, but it got me by for the time being"
bad,I worked almost 8 years at walmart and i never had any problem until the last month there when new CSM was hired and she was a total witch. She told lies about me to management . I was never treated so badly at work until she was hired. She makes it miserable for some select cashiers. Needless to say management took her side and i quit. Some of the managers and assistant managers i worked under were bad.
bad,IF you enjoy starting your work week on a Thursday Friday or Saturday...And running the EAST coast every week then this is the job for you...And when you come in on your day to come home with 3 hours left...be prepared to go back out...You get to share sleeper trucks with other individuals who most of the time may lack the hygiene that you may adhere too...Fuel and clean your truck for free...then sign up...I was there for 28 months....The GTM does not like Truck Drivers.
bad,management will hire u and tell u can get all hours u want but in fact if u work over scheduled hours u will get wrote up a lot of favoritism in the store where i am
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work as a whole. They don't care about the employee only results and they do not teach you how to properly achieve results only chastise if you don't achieve them and if you do, you never hear about how good of job you do."
bad,"Worst job I ever had. They promise you the moon and give you scraps. Hours are all over the place, no full time, no overtime, no raises, no benefits, no reason to stay."
bad,I was frequently taken advantage of because of my willingness to help. It was one of the most unorganized organizations I have ever been a part of. However I am glad this was my first job because now I will just expect more out of my jobs to come.
bad,nothing was ever good enough. pay sucked. management sucks. employees dont matter to the company. they make it clear you are unimportant. just an awful awful workplace.
bad,"Management at Walmart really could use a lot of HELP,,,I struggled with management not being very understanding with my heart problems because I was hospitalized and they do not except doctor notes... not even FMLA was able to help the situation"
bad,"Very low level situation. Managers are way over worked and don't care about you. Often don't know what they are talking about, just regurgitating something that someone else told them to say. Crazy to believe this place is so profitable when it is run by such morons."
bad,"Need a job, apply at Wal-Mart. Anyone can work at Wal-Mart, don't expect much though, the pay is low, the benefits are non-existent. No one will listen to you."
bad,working here it seems like they try their hardest to get you hired then turn around and try to get you to leave/quit the job. they worked me full time hours on part time benefits
bad,"was fine at first then the store i was at did a supervisor rotation and became awful the new supervisor was not that great, dont know what more to say."
bad,"When i first started working i really enjoyed working there then they started forcing other peoples jobs on me, i was basically doing the work of 2-3 people while others (favorites) got to slack off. I tried talking to the store manager but he was always ""too busy""."
bad,I worked at for a little over a year and hated it. It was one of the worst places I have ever worked. The management team is very rude and disrespectful. They have no idea how to treat people. I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone. The store manager is the worst and cant even acknowledge you exist when speaking to her.
bad,"keep it as a part time and don't bust your behind working there it wont count for nothing hard working people never gets promoted only lazy people, jerks gets promoted and uncle toms"
bad,I have been working since I was about 12 and Walmart is by far my least favorite place to work. Management does a terrible job at communicating with employees and you're made to feel like a lowly worker instead of part of a team. There is no work culture here.
bad,I worked to negotiate hours according to school and pending wedding. Walmart refused to adhere to the hours set and refused to adhere to their promise of giving time off for my wedding. Laughed at my face when I complained.
bad,I'm sure there was a time Wal-Mart wasn't a hollow work environment but it isn't anymore. Employees are expected to jam 12+ hours of work into half that time with very scarce allowance for overtime. Management can't seem to follow standard procedure on a regular basis and only seems to care when corporate is breathing down their throats. Often times they also cannot perform some of the basic tasks of your job or answer questions you or customers have and can be found usually walking the floor with their face planted firmly in their phone screens.
bad,besides the lack in actual training and information you could be yelled at for almost anything as long as you were trying to do your job right but if you slacked and did the bare minimum you were fine.
bad,"Walmart is very fast paste to work, with low wages and very stressful. They treat their employee unfairly. The working hours always changing for employee. They are only close on Christmas. Where I worked I enjoy working in the Automotive department, it was fun and I was learning new things everyday. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unhappy customer."
bad,"The upper management does not support the employee, when middle management involves themselves in getting their jobs completed instead of what higher management wants done.  Middle management talk to employee as they are children."
bad,They have the worst team of managers. They are unorganized and there are too many managers meaning they never tell you one thing. They don't coordinate with each other and they will constantly stab you in the back to make themselves look good.
bad,"If you are just starting out in the workplace it's a great place to learn about retail, and what customers expect.  The culture preaches integrity and respect for the individual, both of which I have seen very little."
bad,too many hours long shifts felt it would be really hard to advance here no flexability always seemed to ask to work extra cause never enough staff to help just did not like the job
bad,Venda de pneus como numeração aros etc . aprendi a fazer funções de gerente no germinan como negativos contagem de mercadorias 5 semanas .
bad,"I have worked for this company for 17 years. I've seen it at it's best and it's worst. Since going into management I've learned a lot but work/life balance is non-existent. While working to save people money so they can live better, I'm neglecting my own family. Upper management can make you work as much as they want and call it ""a business need"" so it's perfectly fine. All while NOT paying you overtime nor compensating you with extra PTO for working extra days. I have met some amazing people from all walks of life but management at Walmart can be consuming, at least it has been in my experience at my store. Others may have a different opinion."
bad,"Its a spiraling abyss of a job that sucks you in and never lets you go, it starts out nice they give you treats and tell you how important you are but as soon as you feel settled in, BAM horrible employees, BAM terrible customers, BAM no manager support, ignorance is rewarded and determination is ignored. It feels like the better your work ethic the more you get screwed over. I feel sorry for the good people whom get trapped here, because a lot of times there is no escape."
bad,"On a day to day basis, i didn’t learn anything and the management was HORRIBLE. There was nowhere to grow or advance and only certain people were given manager positions."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Lies about hours and “promised pay”. Lots of guys that use slurs openly, Managers don’t care. As a woman, I highly suggest you stay away."
bad,"If your looking for a small after school job with no move up potential for a job where you don't desperately need a specific number of hours than this is definitely the job for you. Your hours are irregular if you don't have a higher up position, {truck unloader, inventory control, personal shopper, management.}"
bad,poor management. understanding and good work experience to take throughout life. not a place i would personally like to work permanently. nice coworkers
bad,"Pay is low for the work, employees are overworked and expected to come in sick and during dangerous weather conditions. Not 100% sure, but I heard the pay rate went up since I've been there?"
bad,"While I worked there for three years I never enjoyed it, maybe some of the people. The schedule came out three weeks in advance and was so hard to get changed if something came up, so if you had to take off for something you had to put in the request at least a month in advance and then hope they saw it or else you had to just call in that day. I had so many times my family had a gathering and I couldn't go because I had work, my sister even got mad at me because she told me a week before the event and I was scheduled to work and couldn't go. But as long you can manage to get the request in a month or so in advance and remind them constantly they may try and change it?"
bad,Every day was stressful and rushed.  There was no support from store manager and it was had to get an assistant manager to assist in the office.  There was a huge lack of training from cashiers to management which made our jobs harder and frustrating.
bad,I did not enjoy working at Walmart. The team member would leave me alone to do all the work on the floor and I had no directions as to what was required. They always gave me query about my natural hair and overall it was dreadful
bad,"Walmart is...well, strictly an awful place to work. It's kind of cult-like, if I'm being honest. Every day starts with a rundown of how the store is doing and how you're expected to singlehandedly save the store. Then there is corporately-mandated stretches, followed by a chant of ""1, 2, 3, Walmart!"" There is nothing more humiliating, in my mind, as it shows that Walmart thinks of it's employees as soulless drones...which does accurately describe the management. If you accidentally stayed one minute past your corporately-provided 15 minute break or your one-hour lunch break, the management would treat it as if you were stealing directly from the company. The work is massive and thankless. I was stationed in the grocery section, and would regularly receive three or even four palettes worth of merchandise to stock in an eight hour period, with the management and the company expecting you to finish this task as if you were Superman, as the game. I was told that I was expected to unseal, identify, and stock items at a rate of one hundred and twenty cases per hour, which is patently impossible. The company was nice enough to give us a lunch periodically, such as burgers or fresh fruit or even pizzas, but fequently, the weekend donuts are the day olds no one wants to eat, the pizzas were burnt beyond recognition, and the burgers were provided by the kind managers who wanted to reward us for a job well done. But the kind managers were few and far between, as we were stuck with a manager who would often shriek at us for more than five minutes for daring to stumble while hauling several"
bad,"most of the managers that work  there are lazy, do not help when asked. the store manager has no clue how to manager a store."
bad,"The management at walmart is terrible."
bad,"It's an ok job just for the check. Management is horrible I feel like they don't work with you on very serious situations, they are for themselves...."
bad,"Worked very hard for the company and got paid out for no reason at all. Never had even one discipline with this company. Confused.  Worked at the Sarnia, Ontario location. After four years with the company they told me we needed to talk. They then gave me a severance letter with no reason for the dismissal. I later found out they had promoted someone of the opposite gender the same week they had let me go."
bad,Although the management did not care for loss of product or even if employees attended work they only care of the overall money they make that day and if it beats out the year before's overall total
bad,"pay was not good, not enough hours, hired everybody in as part-time, hot environment to work in, very poor management, disorganized, company does not care about employees."
bad,"Some support managers need to be educated in their manners, and some new people who became support managers need to be humble, and educated further in manners."
bad,"The hardest part is poor management, you look to them for direction and they dont really provide any, so you're left to make decisions and worry what the outcome may be."
bad,"The managers will micro manage you to the smallest detail that seem petty, dont apply unless you wanna be bullied around by over paid bullies! Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere."
bad,Work is easy management can be very poor based on location. Customers are extremely rude most of the time due to the rumors and stigma of Walmart. Co-workers are for the most part very receptive and fun to be around again it’s all based on locations some locations are really bad and others are ok due to where it’s located.
bad,"horrible, worse place I've ever worked at! management is horrible and rude! and so respect for young lings! and no freedom of washrooms! got flipped at every time i went to use the bathroom and flipped at when i helped costumers and that was my job as a costumer experience sales floor associate."
bad,"It's so stressful. There is not enough staffing, so you are left to try to take care of customers on your own when you need a csm to come approve something on the register. Then the lines start to back up. You are left to apologize to the customers and feel completely helpless about the whole situation. "
bad,I was a cashier and the environment was horrible. The manager were never around when you needed them. The customers were rude. The only positive thing in that place was the co-workers in the same situation were nice
bad,"My day at work was frustrating. I worked in produce where we were and people had physical limitations. I was expected to do a lot and some people where ask to do a little. I took pride in my work, but some people where not cut out for produce. The management never really looked to see the type of environment that was going on. I liked the people but I could understand the culture. A difficult place work."
bad,"the pay was dirt, you were treated like dirt. need time off? forget it. Walmart will deny every attempt, they would want you to do one thing only to complain about you doing it how they asked a minute later. never working for them again"
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart is exhausting, when you're hired you will receive limited training so hopefully you're a fast learner. 1-3 days (cashiers may receive more)days not weeks depending on where you are....this job doesn't pay holiday pay anymore!! You won't receive any sick days, personal days are very limited. You receive a 10% discount card after 90 days. The most enjoyable part is you will meet some amazing people (customers)."
bad,They treated me very disrespectful and didn't give me a proper training. I was a cap 2 and they had me working the computers for 4 days then they put me on sales floor and didn't go through the aisles with me so I felt unwelcomed and kind of stupid because of the way they attempted to train me.
bad,A experiência ruim de se trabalhar nesta empresa tem fama internacional.
bad,"If you're thinking about working at Walmart, don't. If you do work at Walmart, my best suggestion is to find another job. The pay is garbage for the work you do, upper management (store manager, market manager, regional manager), threatens to write up/fire the entire assistant manager staff every couple months, and then they force you to work 12+ hour days with no days off because the ""store wasn't up to expectations."" I developed depression and anxiety working in such an abusive environment. Do NOT work here."
bad,So they work you like slaves for little pay. Do not care about their employees. Picks favorites and will let you go for no reason at all they do not pay over time at all
bad,They don’t take dr excuses so don’t miss work and you can only miss 3.5 days in the first six months  besides that was decent place to work until I missed to many days
bad,During your first ninety days they will do everything in their power to find every little bit you've done wrong so that during the final day or so as a probationary employee they can fire you before your full benefits kick in.
bad,"poor hrs if they r not bussy have to go home.not enough hrs, poor wages.not aa fix schedual, dont trust on employee'whole thing is that cant survibe if you work part time"
bad,"I worked at two Walmarts and both had the same problems. There was poor management, the customers treat the employees awful, and there was no consistency."
bad,"They should hire a high school principal and/or guidance counselor to work there. Horrible management. No respect. I ended up quitting because I was discriminated against for being a female doing a ""man's Job""."
bad,hmm???? i miss the people i worked with . the joke working there is slaves with pay. The Sups talk down to you. Even if you do your job it does not count.
bad,"Most of my work was done independently which was not a problem. Now, the interaction with the management was not professional all the time and certain were over looked until it lead to an even bigger issue."
bad,"I used to love working for Wal-Mart. But now that I am an ""old timer"" they are trying to find any reason for me to be In the office with management.  "
bad,"a lot of work to do, no help, stressful environment, horrible management."
bad,very stress place to work for they took a lot away from the associates.Profit searing bonus  I had a set scedaill just befor I left they were getting rid of that there was never a great job for anything
bad,"Hours change every two weeks. Must deal with some quite rude customers.  Management our not there for therir employees. Must be ready to work totally different shifts with low pay,"
bad,Your hours depend on each month sometimes you will be worked to death and work 50-60 hours a week other times you will work less than 30 hours. you have to earn vacation time. Pay is the only thing worth working their. Lots of favoritism. Poor management.
bad,I would nver recommend anyone working for that company. They do not know how to treat their employees at all. Worst place to work. Just down right makes you feel less about your self
bad,The corporate office is cutting positions and managers from their stores in order to make their other hourly managers do more work for less pay. They are replacing hourly managers with 3rd parties and offering those displaced workers a pay cut and no severence unlike their salaried managers they laid off eaier this year.
bad,I would not recommend anyone work at this company if they could help it at all. Do yourself a favor and Run the other way and look for something else entirely.
bad,I would have stayed there but poor management was the reason for leaving they messed me around when I had to take 2 personal days and I even switched my day's off to cover the personal days
bad,"Management was very rude and overbearing. Intended working there for a long period of time, however, I went on maternity leave and came back and management was unable to work with my scheduling needs."
bad,"Initially was a great learning experience with promising prospects, however over time conditions gradually deteriorated."
bad,"I had this job very early into joining the retail field and that was by far the worst decision of my life. The management was mean, they didn't train me just put me on a register. They singled people out and had favorites. The customers are always in a bad mood because of the service they received elsewhere in the store."
bad,"A typical day is coming in never knowing where u will be. All the work could be done by second shift in your department, in that case they want u to either do returns all night or zone the aisle for 8 mind numbing hours."
bad,"The entire reason I left was because of a CSM (customer service manager) who was three times my age, but had no decorum or maturity. She did not like me, and that was quite obvious. She called me names like 'the beast', and always found a reason to talk badly about me (and my mother who also worked for the company), and even talked behind my back to my closest friends. When I approached upper management about it, nothing happened. I feel like I was forced into leaving due to the hostile work environment."
bad,"Walmart is what Walmart is, a gigantic joke. This company is too big for its own good anymore, and therefore has a hard time keeping good people, all the while keeping the dregs of humanity working there."
bad,Stressful and in the middle of culture change. More management than workers. Deciding whether to be an e-commerce company or a retail company. Can be a good starter position
bad,they clam to pay more money but only say that to only cut hours so that most people how work there need some type of gov assistance so long story short they say more but its really less
bad,The job itself was very nice. I enjoyed meeting new people and being able to get everything I needed to do done. The management was very poorly chosen. They did not value their employees and the turn over rate is extremely high
bad,I have no plans to ever work for Wal-mart again. Plain and simple. I'm not sure why i have to type a long paragraph about it but i worked there for almost 3 years. I regret i wasted my time there. It was the most miserable years of my life. I left there take a job with lower pay but i didnt care i just wanted to get out of there.
bad,"Grateful to receive a job here, but over time it's become quite depressing.   Some levels of management are very disrespectful to hourly salaried employees."
bad,"The employees were almost, if not the same, as bad as the customers. So that's saying something for sure. I was harassed by a csm, told the GM, and he did nothing, reported it up higher, still nothing, and she literally followed me to the bathroom."
bad,"First of all, i would rate them no stars."
bad,"As an employee, Wal-Mart did not provide comprehensive training for new employees. This was compound, when these employees were given unrealistic expectations and goals, relating to their job performance. In addition, the lack of Management involvement or participation in helping complete goals and objectives, are reasons for the high turnover rate within the company."
bad,"Management disrespects cashiers and they definitely do not respect college students' school schedules. Whenever an associate had an emergency, management would tell that associate that they still had to work."
bad,"The management was horrible. Retaliation is rampant. Discrimination amongst associates & management is extensive. No  rotating with the schedules,  along with management changing schedules for preferred associates."
bad,"Fast pace, cut throat, no place for advancement. lack of support, Always pushing up production levels with no compensation.  Production level is now at 100% no more 95%, yet the trailers they get in half the time you can't even make 75% let alone the new 100% standard. its top out pay isn't bad at $21.25 an Hour."
bad,"Very stressful because short staffed and paid holidays taken away.  However, we do receive a bonus every 3 months.  I need to make more money to pay my bills and no advancement is in my future."
bad,no one works as a team. Management is horrible and can't handle their jobs. they expect too much. reward lazy people are hard on the good workers. just no teamwork
bad,"Company doesn't care about you. They only care about the money. Don't waste your time trying to excel here, you'll only be expected to continue doing more work for less pay, while also doing the work of other associated who are incapable of doing their own job."
bad,managment is a joke pure lack of comunication bad ideas for set up and over bloated egos of uppermanagment. the only benifit is a few employees who are friendly.
bad,Walmart was once a company that was proven to be job secured but since the new CEO's took over that all have changed. Walmart doesnt give a work/life balance to its employees at all. They only have one day out the year to be off with their families and thats on Christmas. They wouldnt even allow Thanksgiving to be a part of that. Walmart grades its management staff on and unfair grading scale to deteremine whether or not we remain managers.
bad,Very political and advancement challenges. Hours are extremely long. Management turn over is very high. Not a family oriented place of employment  on all levels.
bad,I worked here breifly and it wasn't a fun job. The management are terrible to the employees the pay sucks. I got fired for calling off when my son was sick.
bad,the overall experience at Wal Mart was nothing short of horrible. Micro managing managers who always came off as holier than thou because they had their two year degree in business management.
bad,"Get prepared to have no life.  Decent pay but it’s not worth the sacrifices you will have to make with your family.  If you are not a internal hire get prepared for the lack of formal training all together, it becomes dog eat dog and no one wants to help you out.  You will have to learn on the fly and will prob never meet the expectations of your store manager who will always want more. Other reviews are exactly right, they want more with less. They will cut your hourly wages and want more with less. Therefore you have to pick up the slack and stay late until job is done. Others are inaccurate, get ready for 14-16 hour days at the minimum, and you will still get treated like garbage and that your life means nothing to them or your store manager. “Your salary now” is the slogan so that means your but belongs to them. It’s honestly a joke. They don’t follow their own policies and don’t respect you at all.  Also get prepared for the daily threat of termination.   Now hourly associates get treated like they are kings and most are lazy as heck but most of the time they are just happy they came to work. Their call out policy is the most lientient I have ever witnessed and they still complain it’s not good enough, remember that’s hourly not salary. As someone else said maybe go in there for a year or two get some experience and get out but if you want my recommendation, run, run hard and run fast. Your life will be better if you never work for this joke of a company. Now i only wish I could find a way to not shop there, but you really can’t beat the prices. I wish I could because after"
bad,Wal-mart is not for full-time college students. They will put you in the system as a part time employee and give you full time hours meaning you are not entitled to benefits.
bad,Fired from my job while on family medical leave. I had to be out because of my son's health and when I returned from leave they had taken my job position away from me and accused me of wrong doings and fired me four days later.
bad,I felt like After 3 years and me learning new skills I couldn't move up. Once I started making 10.20 a hour. i only got 4 hours a day and worked 3 days a week. I felt Like I got over looked because I was black.
bad,"No comment at all, time for a fresh start with new boss and new co-workers. The hardest part of the job was  not being able to help all patients, did what I could but high co-payments are always bad news."
bad,Walmart doesn't really care about there employers if you haven't been with the company long they don't care n you don't matter at the time I was there I was going through s family member dying of cancer and it was hard and they wasn't working with me
bad,"Very stressful place to work,no appreciation at all. They fire people without a good cause, management is bad. Have nothing good to say about this place"
bad,"Do not work for Walmart, use it as an ends to a mean only if you have to. Do better for yourself. The company does not provide adequate compensation for the work they assign. you will often times do work 5-6 dollars above your paygrade, and then someone elses work on top of it,"
bad,My manager CB was a good manager the OPS Manager PW was not good some managers there can learn to put theirselves in your shoes some would gossip about the agents sometimes you think you telling something personal and confidential and the manager would repeat it to someone else than everyone in the center knew about it when come time for firing they have favoritism the ones they liked they let them stay and erase their occurence
bad,"To much favoritism shown.. Management was horrible at best... Easy work however.. I loved the interaction with customers. Of course this all varies from store to store, but I would expect it."
bad,The computer gives a calculated estimate on when it thinks your stock work should be Done and the managers pressure you to do so. That time for not include pulling your own freight which can take time depending on where you are in the store and how much you have to pull.
bad,great friends can be made but you're treated like retail is the military most unfair company i ever worked for. would not recommend to anyone unless desperate for a job
bad,"Walmart is a great place if you don't want anything in life. They will pay you better than many retail chains, but still not great. They try to automate as much as possible, so be ready to use seemingly outdated computers to get jobs done. When I was there, they were rolling out computers to track your current task completion, which was annoying and inaccurate at the time. I haven't been there in years now, but judging by the fact that all my previous managers have either stepped down or quit, and that my old coworkers saying I got out at the right time... I'm not looking to go back to that."
bad,In the beginning I was very excited to work there. It was a fun and relaxed work atmosphere. Then they started changing policies and it became a very tense place to work. We were seriously understaffed and they expected 10 people to stock the whole store. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I use to love to go to my job, however things have changed so much number and percentages are all that matters now. You are coached if you cannot make them, it very stressful place to work, you never know when your job or you will be eliminated. People use to matter , it was a family. Now that more years you have in feels like you have a target on your head."
bad,at Walmart I have experience unintelligent management unfair treatment and none consideration hard days at work and no thank you not even a great job 😣
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. Such a high rate of turnover! Benefits are terrible very negative working environment!!  Work your butt off for twelve hours a day and get wrote up for the stupidest stuff!
bad,Not a good company. doesnyt care about employees. not good with off days for whatever reason and not flexible with scheduling. fun place to work though
bad,"The company is constantly restructuring procedures and management hierarchies without giving any one plan enough time to prove or disprove its' effectiveness before starting a whole new restructuring plan."
bad,Walmart will be a better place to work if they can stick to their values.  They have lost their way and they no longer value people.  It's hard to advance at Walmart. There are too many layoffs and store closings. These make the work environment stressful.
bad,If I'm off work I walk back into a mess once I come back. I don't have any help in my departments. The staffing and management are terrible. They don't help out the good workers if they need help. Managers have their favorites who they only help in the store.
bad,"A terrible work environment, management argue about what needs to be done in front of guest during the time the project needs done instead of going over it before hand."
bad,"I worked for walmart for almost 2 years. The manage mentioned does not care about their employees even they sometimes act like they do. They care more about making miracles on the job happen, numbers and profits."
bad,Very poor workers only 4% of workers are enjoyable and helpful other than that management is very poor and rude terrible at their job and treat their associates badly.
bad,Bottom of the barrel when it comes to jobs. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone even if they are starting out. Depression will set it once you are there.
bad,"I was yanked to perform in one Department after the next depending upon who showed for work.  The hardest part was being in the middle of a project in my department and then being yanked to fill in the front end as a cashier! The management did not know what the other had previously instructed us to do so we were always told something different by different managers all day long! I learned Walmart is managed poorly and they don’t care if the employees are happy, underpaid and overworked!  The workers are from a diverse background but most are living paycheck to paycheck and most are impoverished.  The only enjoyable part of the job was the comradeship the long term employees had, but they were few and far between as most quit for betterment after working there a short time! Walmart was the worst place I’ve ever worked. After the holidays each year our hours were cut and we could barely pay our bills!  We begged for more hours while we watched them constantly hire new workers!  It made no sense to harm current employees and hard workers this way! The only raise was a 2% cost of living raise amounting to .17 cents a year."
bad,Don’t expect to be valued.  Expect long work hours and favoritism.  Expect to put years of service in but be told you’re not good enough even when you’re never coached and have the best following of associates.
bad,"If you have the skills but want respect this isn't the job for you. Its dog eat dog competition, especially the high up you go. If you want something to pay the bills this is for you but, don't set your expectations too high!"
bad,"If you wanna work for a company that is cut throat and doesn't care about you, then this is the job for you. They preach all about family first. WRONG!"
bad,Need to have a lot better managers and upper managers . need to pay the employees alot more for what they do for the jobs and better benefits for the employees.
bad,Was a good paying but horrible job. managers dont care about you at all. any issues were shrugged off like nothing happened. Couldn't move up unless you knew someone in the higher-ups
bad,"Too much to do and not enough time to do it. That is how I would describe this place. Constantly faced with unreasonable time quotas and an ever-increasing workload, nearly every day was very stressful. The work environment is tense. The workers are, for the most part, unhappy and it shows. Shouting matches among staff, shift-leads, and management are not uncommon.The backroom working conditions aren't the safest as trucks are often overfilled, pallets are stacked too high and the backroom is almost always overstocked. The risk of getting caught under falling boxes is very real."
bad,"lets be honest this is most basic and common place to start when leaving High School. Walmart has and always will be horrible work place. The hours are random, management will side with customer no matter how wrong they are, and will base promotions not persons ability to do the job but on their age and how much they like the person. Overall its horrible and  expected amount of work in set time is unreasonable."
bad,"no comment, only a job not a career, don't expect holiday pay and management team varies but not a management group to promote team moral. hours are not always available."
bad,This walmart was the worst. I worked 3rd and it was ok. I had a new manager almost every couple a months. Bad management all around. It wasnt as bad as the day shifts though.
bad,I pushed carts into the store for customers. I wasn't given the required staff to perform my job in a effective manner as well as not being trained properly. Lastly I found myself in a frightening experience when I'd work late at night when people would threaten vocally and visually.
bad,"Work at Walmart is stifling and insecure. The only reprieve is the other associates and some managers when they aren't being stressed by managers above them. Walmart is a place of hierarchical abuse of good people, e.g. the managers and workers who aren't lazy. The employees are either mistreated and earnest people or lazy and similarly mistreated people. There is a wrongness and the lack of union ability hurts many good employees, but unions would also protect the bad ones. Walmart is a complicated issue."
bad,"Walmart boasts their ""family"" atmosphere. Its not true . Associates are penalized for anything but especially family issues.  Associates are not given clear instructions setting up failure."
bad,"As soon as you punch in you immediately are on the go (liked that because time flew by).  "
bad,"Extreme expectations, low pay, bad management. Stressful work environment and constant 1 day schedule changes that were not conducive to a good work environment."
bad,Gosto muito de trabalhar lá mas o feedback não é bom
bad,"Only pharmacy to be open during category 3/4 Hurricane"
bad,"Worked in the Distribution Center. The pay was above average, but the company is unethical and corrupt as is possible to be. Safety issues can be reported to higher and higher positions of management, only to have them swept under the rug, or never get resolved."
bad,Company does not care about anything but profit. Hours were not allowed to exceed 30 per week and could not be paid more than 13/hr. Shifts were inconsistent and wouldn't last more than 5-6 hrs.
bad,Unhealthy physically and mentally. poor management lead to me and one other co worker always doing all the work because other workers refuse to do their job. There were rude and not easy to work with co workers. One co worker was always drunk and the others were lazy. I was very unhappy working for Walmart. They cheated me out of my benefits because they refused to put me as full time even though i was working full time. They do not pay time and a half for working holidays. They do not care about their employees.
bad,"The position unhealthy.  You are expected work with out  having your days off, no lunches audit is frowned upon if you leave on time.  there is no work life balance."
bad,Walmart sucks like really really bad. They say one thing do another and you always leave unhappy. Its not worth it. Run away! anything else any other job
bad,"Management has their pick of employees if you didn't fit in you got the worst job to do "
bad,"Walmart is a friendly place to work. I learned from that walmart that "
bad,"You get a thick skin for stupidity. The hours are horrid, the pay is average at best, advancement is nigh on impossible, and they never tell you all the ways you can be fired, they just terminate you."
bad,It's a very stressful and competitive job for a single parent who is in school and trying to get her degree. I would not recommend anyone to Walmart because their management team does not give fair opportunity to all associates.
bad,Management doesn't care.  Garbage people working a garbage job. Brick Walmart. been here 7 years and there is no respect. Need to get out as soon as possible.
bad,"I knew from the start I didn't want to be there so that was half my dilemma, but with the pay and being straight out of college I still went for it as a career step. Hours are long, higher management usually does not care only if they are being benefited otherwise you are really just a number and replaceable. One of the reasons the turn over is so high and morale is so low."
bad,Horrible place to work lazy management that knows nothing about what they are doing or how to operate the store or how to situate the merchandise only promotes people who they are frienda with
bad,"Lack of appreciation, not compensated for the work, horrible management, unprofessional. Overall the company wouldn’t be such a problem to work for if you were able to stay in your department and get your job done. You are constantly pulled in other areas and punished when your work is not done."
bad,"if you like to be scheduled whenever Walmart wants and want to have no life then apply now You will get coached/yelled at constantly, berated for not working overtime and NO pay raises so enjoy"
bad,Low salary combined with poor managers. They manage time poorly and often dumped extra tasks from other departments even on days when schedule was already tight.
bad,"The job itself isn't hard but the overall management of everything ruins it. They don't have enough managers who know what they're doing, and the schedule is absolutely terrible."
bad,"What can be said about walmart that hasn't been said already by someone else, somewhere in the universe. I would say is like getting paid to go to high school- and it isn't worth the aggravation."
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for a year and have never felt undervalued in my life. The management team is a joke and is not efficient in encouraging employees to do their best. Customer service comes before associate well being and there are no supports in place to help associates when dealing with hostile customers. "
bad,"Worst job ever. Management is incompetent and doesn't understand we are people too. The only thing that has been good is the hours I work but they hang that over my head as a threat to change it if I don't get something done. The ""one best way"" is a joke and clearly the person that put that program together doesn't do my job on a daily basis. I have been there a year and I just got a raise to minimum wage!! GO ME!"
bad,"As long as you brown nose, don't ask questions, and work everyday you will do great. Don't expect your time time off and work well past your scheduled time. I wish I had left a long time ago."
bad,"Management of the loss prevention team was dishonest, rude and unprofessional. Work environment was dangerous and full of racial tension. Not a recommended place to work if you are white. You will be ridiculed, tormented, and threatened because of the color of your skin."
bad,"really enjoyed the people on nicer people anywhere ,My first 4 months were great 40 hour a week but they were opening a new store after the store so we help run the old store and transfer everything to the new one ,after that hours really got cut ,did get called in to work all the time but was very hard to get clock in after u got there ,I always had to close the jewelry department on Saturday nights and be back to open on Sunday morning ."
bad,"As one of the little people on the overnight shift, the store was as far from paradise as one can get. The work was tedious, and the management at best disinterested, and at worst amazingly incompetent and adversarial."
bad,"a typical work day for me consist of working 8-10 hour days, getting blamed for other shifts not completing their tasks. Asking to stay over your shift and then being asked to cut the hours at the end of the week. management does not know how to treat associates fairly as well as with respect."
bad,Only certain standards are enforced. Managers have too much lee way. Asset protection has too much power. Managers show too much favoritism and do not follow law procedures correctly.
bad,"The management sucks,it's understaffed, the employees are over worked,we barely get breaks,lack of communication. Management is very unorganized. Told when we can go to the bathroom. Treated with no respect."
bad,"atendimento a clientes , preparar mercadorias para o sala de vendas, bater metas ,fazer exposiçao e criar estrategicas de vendas arrumar depósito ,e manter 5S"
bad,Hard workers get in trouble saying we're not working hard enough even get written up for it while poor workers are left doing little to nothing with no consequences. lots of favoritism that makes people that do deserve the position don't get get it cause there not liked.
bad,The managers are stuck up and dont care about the work or the customers. They yell at the employees in the middle of the store. Everyone gets mad at the smallest things
bad,"When I first started working for the company, all of the managers seemed positive, nice, and friendly. Then, after I'd been working for a couple weeks, I realized that it was just a front and once you had started the job, they didn't care about being nice anymore. They yell at you constantly, no matter how hard you are working. Nothing is ever good enough for them. The harder you work and the more you give, the more they expect out of you. They make you stay after (and accumulate overtime) and then make you leave early to cut your overtime at the end of the week. (Pretty sure that's illegal, but I'm not sure.) The managers do NOT care about your personal life or about you as a person, they care about getting a job done, money, and their bottom line. Horrible work environment. Started looking for a new job after one month of working here. Everyone else on my team is currently looking for a new job as well."
bad,Walmart was not meant for me.  I hated working there with a passion.  They had poor communication.  I never went in my break on time  they had be doing everything else except what u was supposed too.  They were always abort staffed and very stressful.  I worked there as king as I did because I needed the money.
bad,"Management would expressly state that they expected one person to do the work of five in order to keep crew size low. Many women I worked with had children they never got to see, and were never put forth for promotion in order to keep them at part time so they would not have to be provided benefits. Many coworkers had to get a second job just to stay afloat. Heat exhaustion from having workers pushing carts outside for an extended period of time was common. Inflexible work hours meant that a doctor's appointment you had scheduled a month ahead would have to be cancelled lest you lose your job."
bad,Working at Walmart truly is depressing as the managers are generally quite racist and treat their employees as robots instead of human beings. The money is good though.
bad,"I worked for 2 months, biggest mistake of my life. Put in the hole big time!. Was promised full time hours because U needed full time worlk, I'm a single mom ad ca barely pay bills and rent. When you needed help  I t took a very long time to get it. Managers were horrible. It seem to bother them to ask for help.  I got a meal  variance because a manager sent me to lunch early. I got in trouble they didn't.  So, I guess everything happens for a reason. I quit a few days ago and now have a better paying job and full time work!"
bad,it was a very good place to work until last 2 years when they changed GM manger ... now its a mess very stressful always afraid of losing your job . I was a orderfiller the gm was giving us errors that wasn't ours and raised production rates .
bad,Regular workers stood around while temps did the work. I was hired for one thing and when I started I was put somewhere else. There is poor management also. Everyone should work as a team.
bad,I did not realized that working for a millionaire company is not as rewarding as I thought it will be. I will not recommend working for Walmart because of a low pay rate.
bad,"Terrible job one good manager. "
bad,"Treated the employees unfairly and poorly, unfair hours opportunity, impossible to gain full-time employment, necessary to work a second job or need state assistance to make ends meet, cutting hours of full-time employees down to 30 hrs or less per week."
bad,"walmart was a good company to work for when I started in 2001, fast pace, always something to do or somebody to help, always a chance to advance, most enjoyable part was that you learned something new every day"
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work, and I don't mean one specific place. I have worked at more than one and they are all the same. The promote from the outside, they don't care how hard you work."
bad,"A typical day at work was always stressful.  Disrespectful by all members of management barking orders over the walkie instead of communicating respectively in person.  Management was not fair and consistent with all associates and plays a lot of favoritism.  The hardest part of the job was I was not only expected to work my position, I was also expected to work the CSM position, the Support Manager position, trying to do 3 to 5 associates jobs at the same time as doing my own job that I was expected to do."
bad,Working at Walmart is a stressful job where the employers do not care much about their employees and the employees back stab each other to get to the top.
bad,Jobs are not secure and the work environment stinks.  The culture is one of back biting and management never appreciates anything you do.  They say you go anywhere within Walmart but don't fall for that line.  They continue to make it harder to want to come to work
bad,Managers made up own rules and each only followed rules they wanted to. NO COMMUNICATION WHAT SO EVER. You'd here completely different things from each manager.
bad,"This was not a place I would choose to work. Many internal issues and very bad management,inconsistent schedules and constantly using us as test people for always new and untested computer systems."
bad,i would never think about recommending this place of work. Management is awful they dont treat you right.  i worked there only 8 months because of how stressful it was d
bad,"Not much to say, lazy employees and lazy managers. I have worked there for 5 years+ and it steadily got worse and worse until alot of people could not handle it. People leave and they hire immediately but not as much and try to get less people to do the same amount of work of half of what they just lost. Its truthfully really sad, the energy is very negative and sad."
bad,"Upon being terminated I was not given a chance to correct the issue, instead immediately dismissed. After almost 9 years with the company I should have been treated with more respect."
bad,"It was a good place to work, we know what is expected of us and we are able to stay busy accomplising task, it is fast paced and the days are 9 hours, they are not flexible with schedules."
bad,"Management was always rude and miserable. The company will write you up if you have to take off, even if you were in the emergency room.  Company could care less about you. They would not work with my injury and would frequently write me up because of the injury affecting my work. They said if I turned in the Drs note they still would not transfer me and I would be out a job."
bad,"It's good to have a job, but the hours are not guaranteed and it is almost impossible to get full time.  They don't consider any of your past experience when promoting from within."
bad,"Management is very poor - created a hostile work Environment/Harassment Favoritism/Dishonesty"
bad,management at the store i was in was very poor. ill not indicate names but simply state that there was definite favoritism.  no advancement opportunities and getting yelled at loudly for not getting 5 peoples jobs done by myself.  certain persons are given everything and others are abused beyond beleif
bad,"It was hard for me to put in my two weeks before quiting because it was over the phone. So in a result to that i was ""Terminated"" for missing days even though i told the Manager i quit! Now it's on my job record."
bad,"managers made the job hard and not worth anything, so disrespectful towards everyone and everything.  This would have been a great place if managers were more trained on social behavior."
bad,"As soon as you get to work they expect you to know exactly what is going on. You have to do things a certain way, or you get yelled at and written up. Things change without notice. They pay  horribly, and the hours per day are not worth the drive. Management think they can walk all over you and treat you and which way."
bad,"The managers were nice enough, but would assign tasks with little to no information or training.  For example, I was handed a pallet jack and told to get the freight and unload it.  I had to ask where the freight was and where to take it to unload it.  I had to further confirm which of the three freezers the freight was located when the reply was freezer.  Additionally, I was told to wait for a coworker (who was schedule to show up in 30 minutes) to arrive to assist me, but to start the task immediately.  Most tasks were assigned in this way, and frustration was presented by the most experienced coworkers when questions were asked."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and do not get sucked into this world of Walmart. If you are not in the so-called ""click"", then they are out to get you. You will lose your relationship as well working with Walmart."
bad,"walmart wasnt a bad place to work, its very fast paced, time consuming. The worst part of walmart by far are their managment team members that are in the front of the store, some are good and some just use the title and let it consume their heads."
bad,Walmart employees and management are cosumed by drama and are always talking and making rumors about other associates. I would not recommend working their unless you really need money.
bad,"Horrible experience working for this company.  Managers not experienced at all, lack of communication, lack of benefits packages and long and stressful hours."
bad,"If you want to be over worked under paid and under appreciated the you will love it here.  promotions are baised of ""teachers pet"" not work performance. On the bright side itsalmost impossible to get fired"
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work, where they treat their employees incredibly poorly and the management doesn't care about you at all. The management is incredibly disrespectful and demand nothing but absolute respect from you. They expect more work from you than what they pay you for, and they force you to work in positions that you weren't hired for even if you don't have the training for it. All around Walmart is a terrible place to work that should be avoided if you are looking for employment."
bad,It is a just a job. Pay and benefits aren't great. Management always seems to be on a power trip. they always seem to be understaffed so they work everyone to the bone.
bad,"Managers do not really care about what you actually do at work. Despite all the hard work, they will notice what you failed to do. They are bias and do not give you enough recognition."
bad,If you are good at your job they expect you to do everyone elses job also. If your coworkers are supposed to be doing the same thing as you and they don't its okay because they never do but if you don't you get coached. Bad mangers who do not know what they're doing. only a few good workers that actually will help out.
bad,"Was only there a couple of weeks.  Asked to get moved to a different area where they gave me no training in the new area.  Management comment I ""was lucky"" to ""still"" be part of the team.  No support as a part time student.  No wonder there are so many positions open."
bad,"Walmart puts up a lot of barriers when associates ask for time off to adjust to a major issue such as becoming a foster parent to a grandchild. They try to discourage associates from accessing benefits such as a leave of absence, which is greatly needed when taking on a 2 year old foster child. They will fire you if you reach 9 absences in a rolling six month period, even if those absences were due to taking a foster child to his medical appointments, or babysitting them when they are sick, or when their daycare is closed for a holiday. Management  bullies associates and keeps them constantly in fear of being fired."
bad,"Lower level associates cannot live by the slogan of walmart, save money live better. They barely get a discount and treat them like slaves, without proper training."
bad,"Gossip is rampant here,I saw it constantly from all positions,"
bad,Overworked for low pay. Stressful work environment and completely undervalued by upper management. Difficult to get a vertical promotion. Employees have low morale due to upper management.
bad,"With ignoring days you have with your family and other obligations, the schedule was all over the place. In addition an injury I had and had to take time off was ignored, and stayed on my rechord. It was only AFTER I let management know I was going to have surgery that I was let go. The products at WalMart are poor at best."
bad,"worst place i have worked for, they do not care about their employees, i started in the 30 hour range and now been dropped less than 20 , they limit your discount , only give you small person hours earned , no benefits until you have worked there for 1 year, career wise i do not recommend walmart to anyone"
bad,"in a typical day the associates at over worked and not given enough time or support to do the job that is asked of them and are punished for making decisions that are the best thing for the costumer.  Managers are changed so often that there is no constancy in leadership.  as an associate you are told that one project has to be done and nothing else should take priority and the next day by the same person told that something else is more important but theat both things need to be done at the same time and then are left to your self to figure out how to get it done,  then be told that you did it wrong."
bad,"Horrible work place culture. Hard to get approval for appointments and vacation time before it is lost. Sense you are looked at as just a disposable warm body. Poor training on changes, Management does not know how to follow policies."
bad,Walmart is a hard place to work for. The whole store is under staffed and they refuse to hire help and they cut hours. Low Morale. Expect too much out of each person.
bad,"Terrible management never allow you to book off time unless its 3 weeks notice, how am I supposed to know what I'm doing three weeks in advance rude managers that don't care about anything at all. This is the major Mackenzie location"
bad,Learned a lot that helped me advance into my current position at SSDC however there is both a ceiling in pay and advancement within a store. I would not re
bad,No consistency as far as co workers and management are not on the same page. There is always a shortage of workers and management expects you to do twice the work.
bad,"There needs to be a new team for management. Managers there are childish and unprofessional. The job itself isnt bad, it's the work environment that's hard to deal with."
bad,When I first got there it was great a lot of standing around and begging people to let you help them check out and doing other peoples work. When I got hurt it was all down hill from there and than let me go due to attendance which I was never told the new rule. I was told something different when I started from the HR Manager.
bad,There's alot of favoritism in Walmart and there's alot of racism as well certain drivers get what they want all the time if you see a injustice and you call them out on it you  will be black balled meaning they will starve you out the roc which stands for regional operations center is the main reason of all this
bad,Just another big company showing you. Paying new minimum wage and now I giving you benefits but expecting you to work 39 hours. Here you are just a number and no one cares about you. You have an opinion it doesn't get hurt even if you voice it to the highest power.
bad,"Managers do not schedule enough help to satisfy it's so called customer service. Managers see how busy we are and run the other way so they don't help out. Will only get time off if he wants to give it. Give suggestions but if they don't think of them then no considerations or explanations except ""1 best way which totally is bull. I best way should be the quickest and easiest way without breaking rules."
bad,"Frequent lack of communication from management and employees. Inconsistency in providing equipment to employees to work effectively. A negative working environment. I would still recommend working here to help a person maintain income and find bigger and better opportunities. I learned to differentiate between what is right and what is expected of me. The hardest part is to be assertive and direct to get the tasks done, yet also be approachable as a friend and co-worker. I enjoy working with great people who have good work ethic and giving excellent customer satisfaction."
bad,They got rid of me from this place for helping customers. I cant explain enough how much this place sucked to work except for the fact they have fired at least ten other people i know were fantastic customer service and sales people.
bad,"I left K-Mart for Wal-Mart because of the instability of the K-Mart store's closing. After the first few days the employee's and management were very negative all the time making me feel for my job security, while giving them every effort that I could to complete the tasks they had given me. There was no support from the management when I had a issue dealing with the store's employee portal and time clock issues. It is a horrible place to work!!!!!"
bad,If you apply to work at the Walmart in Boone NC do not expect to treated as they promised. Walmart will work you full time hours and then some and put you in the system as part time. Then come insurence time you cannot get insurence through them because they do not provide insurence to part time employees.
bad,"Cleaning restrooms and buffing floors"
bad,"Day starts clocked in, and the manager starts yelling at you to do exactly what they want you to. This continues until they are not in immediate proximity. They blame you for everything that happens."
bad,A typical work day could be different any time I came into work. I could be responsible for doing stocking the baking isle or working in the dairy freezer to stock and zone milk. I've learned how to be quick on my feet and always being ready to complete a task in a timely manner. Because the workplace culture is so fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
bad,This place is horrible. No increase in pay. The management sucks and they have took away lunch breaks. They are making it hard on associates to do their jobs.
bad,"They don't care about you, they just want you to be there slave. if you have any problems outside of work they will tell you that they don't care about that."
bad,Low pay for high expectations . Expected to bend over backwards for minimal pay. No room for advancement other than a 30¢ raise after 3 months as long as you finish a never ending list of computer based learning programs
bad,not a very stable hours or good pay job and its also not a very secure job either in wouldn't recommend it at all I really enjoyed working with the people I worked with
bad,"unrealistic expectations from management"
bad,I did not enjoy working at Walmart management was very bad and other employees made being there difficult no one wanted to teach you more things they just wanted to keep you and one place
bad,"was let go because of lies that my department lead lied about me to the manager of the store, wish they had cameras in the bakery and deli area that way they would know that what she acused me of never took  place. Not a good company to work for. Too much favoritism and nepotism. Manager let me go shook my hand and told me I was not banned from the store, we can let you go but we would still like you to shop here and give us your money, don't think so"
bad,Upper management does not care about their employees or their customers. Work schedules always suck. We are always understaffed even on the busiest of days.They is no consistency in what they do at this Walmart. I miss my old store manager from 6 years ago. When work equipment breaks down it is like pulling teeth trying to get them to have the equipment fixed. They will not provide me with a walkie talkie to better help the customers when they need assistance throughout the store. Many days I had to do all the team work all by myself for several hours because managers don't have a clue how to make better work schedules.
bad,"The Walmart store I worked at was in a rather poor part of town, and due to working out in the parking lot hazards to safety were everywhere. Whether it was angry customers posing a threat either with aggressive driving in the parking lot, or direct threats of physical violence made it an incredibly stressful work environment."
bad,This job is a unruly work environment people talk to you how they please never listen when you tell them what’s wrong and what you can do to fix the problem
bad,"bad environment to work and very unclean. A very stressful work environment. They ask you to do too many things at once and when you don't get them done, it reflects on just you badly."
bad,"The stress and the demanding amount of hours and the lack of people that you have to accomplish all this work with is not realistic."
bad,"Huge lack of communication between management. Almost no benefits if you work part-time. Cashiers are paid decently, but most other hourly employees work much harder for little more pay. Management tells you to work in ways that can be physically straining on your body, even though all the safety videos say not to do those things."
bad,"this was an okay job to have for your first job & you learn quite a bit"
bad,"its hard now to get full time. Whenever they feel like it, they cut your hours back with no explanation, which causes you to loose your benefits. And they refuse to accept doctors notes for missed days, using it as an excuse to terminate someone. My son had asthma and seizures. Some days I could not make it to work, but Wal-Mart didn't even want to be bothered with notes from the ambulances or doctors. :("
bad,"I only work there because I couldnt find anything else. The pay was terrible. I worked like a man. I stayed dirty, and the pay was terrible. My manager was great. But other than that, I didnt like it, and I dont like shopping there either because I know how they treat their employees"
bad,Can be very fast paced and stressfull at time. Can also be a fun place to work. Lots of interaction with members of the community. Will usually be willing to work with you on scheduled work hours.
bad,"This place of employment is an ""every man for himself"" atmosphere.  I worked at two different stores, and there was no difference between the two stores.  Getting management to respond to associate calls was impossible.  I felt like management didn't really care about my concerns or feedback.  Everything pretty much falls on deaf ears."
bad,I would never recommend this company to anyone. The main problem I had was the other employees. I got let go due to an employee continually telling the managers that I was not doing my job. When I was in a different section than that employee.
bad,"I've worked here for 5 years and every minute is miserable. Bad management, demeaning treatment from management and customers alike. Oh and the dress code is humiliating."
bad,As a part time cashier you are given 40+ hours and scheduled back to back shifts! I hated life working for Walmart as my management team did nothing to motivate or help their hard working staff. Long hours sore feet horrible customers. I left because I have more to offer to a company than just being one of the hard working mules who will be worked to death then replaced!
bad,"Very poor store manager, lots of favoritism, easily work 80-85 hours a week being a salary employee well store managers work 40 hours."
bad,Favoritism was a huge issue and ultimately why I had to resign.  And they say they work with school/personal schedules but that’s not always the case.
bad,"They do not care about your personal life. Never get any holidays with family off,  Management expects too much with poorly staffed stores.Attendance Policy is very strict with no room for deviation. They do not care if you're sick. It's a point system. You exceed your points, you're terminated."
bad,sweat job treat you like you owe them not family orientated sam walton would be so sad to see what his company is treating his family like they do attendance policy is bad to not have a sick family member like i had there cause they do not excuse any attendance isssues
bad,"Management is incompetent. All decisions are made by home office types who know nothing about working in an actual store. The management blatantly does their best to screw their employees and then punishes them for lacking team spirit and productivity. What do you expect? When you make someone do the work of 4 people, pay them a slave wage, and then cut their hours after the company bonus hits, that is no recipe for productivity."
bad,"Wal-Mart would be a great company if they learned to take care of the people who take care of their customers. In my opinion, there are far too many horrible managers. They don't have respect for the individual because they don't give fair opportunities for promotions. They give the promotions to their friends, some of which are not qualified because they don't even take their own assessment. Managers have also been known to remove people from positions to give the position to their unqualified friends. They do not act with integrity, even though there is a no retaliation policy, they still retaliate. If employees use the open door policy, they may lose their job or their position because of management retaliation. Many associates have experienced these behaviors but are not willing to speak up out of fear they will lose their job or be retaliated against. So, no I will not recommend Wal-Mart as a place to work."
bad,Started out with a good one who wanted to help out everyone then got a horrible one who was only concerned with her bottom line. People quit left and right and they ran off anyone with a different opinion
bad,"It's an OK place to start your career, but don't plan on staying long.  In my experience, loyalty is not rewarded.  Get out as quickly as possible."
bad,management targets associates. low pay benefits suck. its very difficult to take time off. management is constantly on your back. the only good thing is that you get a discount.
bad,In the last 14 years the company has made some decisions reversing the tenents that Sam Walton had built the company on.  Associates are not valued for experience or loyalty because they can be replaced by part-time associates for less salary and benefits.  There is a huge amount of pressure to produce more with less resources many times causing management to create an atmosphere of stress and fear for job security.
bad,"fast paced, no paid time off, management sucks. They had me working nights and me a full time college student so i was never getting any rest, when i aked for a new shift i was denied."
bad,start part time only 20 hours or less a week not enuff pay always short not enuff workers management dosent care if you have help or not  benefits arecok
bad,"This was a terrible 5 years. The only decent thing about it was the benefits. Management was terrible, I hurt myself at work and was tricked into opting out of workman's comp. Management was very unprofessional, they were on a power trip with their cliques, favoritism, and politics. Don't work here, it will suck the life from you."
bad,"Walmart was the worst job I ever had. Although benefits may be good, only if your full time, associates are not treated fairly. There is a lot of favoritism that occurs amongst management and employees. Personally I believe that taking care of your associates is just as important as taking care of your customers and the management was not on top of it"
bad,working over night is very stressful. you will be given 20+ hours of work to do in a 10 hour night. during the holiday you are expected to put your work before everything else which is a major issue for me.
bad,I leaner that walmart is not my thing. The hours were weird. I didn't really like how the management treat the workers including me. I did like some of the workers they were very nice.
bad,Upper Management did not understand how most departments worked so the expectations were not realistic. My direct Manager though understood what we could and could not get accomplished.
bad,"This is the worst place to work, your job is not secure, production is ridiculous, the managers basically bribes to keep your job. they barely have work for you to do but still put you on production."
bad,"Not recommended."
bad,company does not enforce its own mottos. it is constantly changing.  management teams are not supportive from headquarters down.  insurance is not preventative care.
bad,"Most managers were were vile people, calling lower workers by intelligence slurs. Creating hostile work environments, stealing and bullying."
bad,"Underpaid, little hours even when considered a full time employee. Not a great job if you are trying to support a family. I was in management and had to step down due to the lack of communication and being underpaid for the position."
bad,Typical day would be getting cussed at and yelled at by department manager and other associates. I learned that there should be more abilities to have a sounding board for issues when management does not listen. Management is poor. Workplace culture is supposed to be you have respect for other people. This store does not carry that culture. Hardest part of the job was the hours. After working there for over five years and still getting night shifts when new hires and younger people were getting the early hours. I enjoyed meeting new people and making sure the customers were taken care of.
bad,"Poor management, lack of shift hours, hostile work environment, no excused sick days with doctors note. They have a points policy that does not excuse legitimate doctors notes and any days are counted as points."
bad,"would not reccomend this hole to anyone - good co-workers absolutely abhorrent management in Goderich, ON - expected to do the work of others who are lazy........."
bad,company schedules you to work whenever after you accepted the position based on the schedule given. they do not fairly compensate employees and did not offer any benefits.
bad,they want you to do other peoples job work after your shift all weekend all night 30 minutes for lunch and no breaks have work in other departments besides your own
bad,Be to yourself. Management picks favorites so it's best to just stay profess as possible. They have no understanding for time and attendence involving pregnancy.
bad,everyday as a orderfiller consists of scanning boxes and tots to be orderfilled for the walmart stores. the most stressful time of the day is when the lines go down or the shipping boxes fall through. I learned from working with walmart to have patients and to treat other with respect. I learned from the mangers to not down your employees in the way they do. the breaks are nice but not long enough
bad,"Higher Management is run by intimidation, treated poorly with no respect. Treat the people who are good workers very poorly and doesn't hold associates responsible for their actions. Lots of favoritism among management and associates."
bad,"Too many upper management people telling you to do different things. Pulling you off task youve been assigned to, to be put on another task which makes you behind on all other task. They dont even tell other managers when they do this and at end of the day you have several managers upset that your task arent all done."
bad,Get out as quickly as you can.go go and go away from Walmart.  the company is set only on greed and do not value family or work life balance.  working on Thanksgiving day and Christmas eve
bad,"You will never see your family.  You will never get a lunch or even 5 minutes to decompress.  You will be forced to work 6-7 days per week at 12-15hours per day.  If you are in a good store, your management team will constantly be pulled to help other low performing stores and you will never have the support you need while still dealing with completely unrealistic expectations.  Nothing is efficient.  Nothing is staffed.  You never have the technological resources required to do your job.  Would most definitely NOT recommend!"
bad,"Wal-Mart is truly the pinnacle of corporate greed. No need to say much here, as the truth is short and honest."
bad,My manager in the vision center was wonderful but the store manager is a jerk. Honestly all mangers out on the floor are. They work you like dogs and fire people for stupid reasons. I would not let my dog work here.
bad,I  was a part-time employee working full-time hours with no benefits and no paid time off. I was over several individuals and I was underpaid and overworked. You cannot have a life as your schedule varies from week to week.
bad,WalMart is not a place to work if you have a family. Management is horrible. They do not care about you or making sure you have the stuff you need to properly get your work done.
bad,"I rather stay quiet. this section requires me to write up to a minimum of one hundred and fifty characters. So I will just say, if the manager's at Walmart have it out for you and they do not like you for some reason, I will not state my specific reason even though it's against the law to discriminate. You will be a chosen target for them."
bad,"It is a busy store. Lots of customers making messes all over the store. The associates were great people. The management were bullies. But if you kissed their butts, you were okay."
bad,"Poor management at WalMart. Too many non-technical,  at senior management level. Very hard to get promoted unless you are in their network. Promotions are not based on merit."
bad,I did not like working for Walmart even tough I'm a people person. the management was poor and people were always calling off so they are usually always under staffed.
bad,It's a very stressful  work environment. They don't pay enough for the job you have to do. They don't staff areas enough to cover job duties. They will just add to the ones there to pick up the other jobs they won't add . I do 3 jobs in addition to the job I should be doing. The management is horrible they hire or promote people that is not  qualified for the manager role.
bad,"so cresce quem puxa muito saco "
bad,Just don't do it. The stress of dealing with management and customers not thinking you are doing your job will enough if awful. And you have to pick up the slack where ever it's needed in the store.
bad,"There is nothing typical about a work day at most Walmarts, Not all but most. Management not promoted based on merit or who is best for the job. Its about who is liked, who you brown nose too, and if you're willing to say yes to anything even if you know its wrong or is against your integrity. "
bad,"My 5 years with the company has shown me that Walmart has no care at all for its associates.  They update policies only for the sole purpose of termination and after the termination has been completed they revert back to the old policies.  Also they do not follow their own policies, for example, I worked in the automotive section and it was policy that any technician that worked on cars cannot stock in grocery and my techs were still made to stock when under staffed.  They do not have any regard for your personal life when it comes to family emergencies.  They understaff and overload the working associates with other poeples' work with the expectation that the work be done by the end of your shift.  The communication from management to supervisors is EXTREMELY lacking, almost none at all.  I urge anyone looking for a job or even pursuing a career to stay far away from Walmart."
bad,"Walmart promises rapid advancement and insurance options, after working there and got my 90 day raise, being told I was doing an amazing job and was one of their best cashiers, my pay back was cut hours because they didn't want cashiers full time."
bad,Management is a joke.  Personnel only care about getting their job done and not the customers.  Graveyard managers are worse.  Its get the job no matter how its done.  If you injure your self while doing it God help you cause they wont do their job to ensure you as an employee are properly taken care of.  Its more about the money than its employees.
bad,I liked working with the cashiers. Management didn't respect the cashiers. People weren't very happy. People always called off.  Easy work environment. I liked closing the store at night. i enjoyed collecting the money from the registers.
bad,"I have worked for Walmart for over a year, and it was great for about a month. Management covers there back more than helping you, and forget about getting tools to help you work. Every morning we fight for tools and no one cares about you. Benefits are so horrible, the only reason I have it is for tax time. Moving up is rare, but if you do move up you need no experience in what your doing. You might work the most and go over the top, but the person who talks all day long will get the management position before you do. I will say there are good days where customers and co-workers are all good but mostly bad days, bad weeks, and bad months. If you apply, good luck, but keep looking for a better job."
bad,"While working at Walmart I enjoyed greeting and working with my co-workers. However, the managers were very degrading and always talked very negative about us."
bad,This store really needs someone to come in and get rid of all members of management that still play favorites. I know for a fact that a associate got promoted for sleeping with a manager. In the boneyard. But they all still work there and i don't. Walmart is great. Just not store 3533.
bad,I did not like working there some managers are okay most are terrible and do not care about there associates what so ever the store manager is very good
bad,A long stressful day.and a lot of nonsense. I would only recommend this job if you are in absolute need of work. This is not a company where you want to make a carrier. .
bad,I liked some of the co-workers but for the most part hated the job. To me they did not pay well enough for the work provided and could care less about their employees. Most of management just like to be hard on the workers while they set in the offices doing nothing. I will never work there again.
bad,"Terrible, unprofessional assistant managers, lack of pay increases on a yearly basis, no paid holidays, and terrible scheduling. They don't value educated people."
bad,It was a stressful job. Management made great demands but would not provide the resources to do the job correctly. They expected things from the employee that they would not do them selves.
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart is a stressful, and unrewarding. The pay is not very good, but at least it's income, so if there are no other options it helps pay some bills."
bad,"they work the good workers to death and let the bad workers get away with murder. "
bad,Job for summer time managers are not the best and dont think about the workers. would not recommend this job to no one. nothing else to say about the the place.
bad,Ok to work for if you need part-time and no benefits cannot get full time they only give minimum hours and no chance to move to better position or get full time
bad,"Training was mostly done solely through computer courses. The shift supervisors for the individual departments were more helpful than management themselves, who acted as if they ruled the store."
bad,"The more work I did the faster my supervisor wanted me to go to get more work done.   I still haven't gotten fast enough.  My coworker slops her work, so I have to pick up the slack.  I've told management, but they don't care."
bad,"Management refuses to follow your availability and refuses to give you hours when you really need them."
bad,"Strong favoritism culture, unrealistic job expectations, uncomfortable and frustrating work environment. Management targets individual associates no matter their job performance."
bad,They don't care about the employees or the customers.  The top priority is how much they can make.  Equipment is faulty and old but won't be replaced since that effects management bonuses.  They work you through your breaks and lunches.  Tell you your not allowed to go home when your scheduled shift ends then make you cut hours of overtime during your lunch break.  I was terminated for a bs excuse after I had to contact the ethics department.
bad,"I dont wish to explain anything about this to you at this time. I like cheese, tacos, pizza, enchaladas, good movies, racecars, dogs, running around in circles."
bad,I enjoyed my direct co workers but other than that the supervisor was rude and disciplined me in front of all the other associates. it was humiliating and made me sad.
bad,"Some of the workers treat you like family but most are out for themselves. Management lacks communication with each other, which in turn, miscommunication with employees is prevalent. Back stabbing is the norm."
bad,"When I worked there they did not care for peoples mental disabilities. Even with a doctor's note they will do as they please in terms of making you do things you are uncomfortable with."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was the customers and having the ability to help them. This is the only good thing I have to say about the company."
bad,I was constantly being bounced between stocking shelves and checking out customers. I had to beg for someone to relieve me for a break or I would be in trouble for leaving the area unattended. At least my department manager was nice.
bad,"I had the opportunity to do some traveling with Walmart and its not a bad company to work for. I would not recommend the North Conway Walmart to anyone. Its very back stabbing and very much a cliche store for the Walmart stigma. Management is very unfamiliar with basic human reasoning and unfairly and very poorly treats some people. Anyone that raises concerns and/or questions anything is severely punished and driven out of the building. Management constantly fosters hostile work environments and continuously refuses to be objective and fair in evaluations and has the ""my way or the highway"" mindset. Again, great company, just a bad management team makes for a bad location/store to work for."
bad,No matter how hard you work you were never good enough. You always had to reach a new higher standard even if your dying from how hard you have been working.
bad,Managers didn't know how to talk to employees. It wasn't a job that you would be happy to go to. You had to work holidays and didn't get compensated for it.
bad,They are very strict to the people they didn't like but the ones they were buddy buddy with got away with pretty much anything. The only enjoyable part working there was the CUSTOMERS.
bad,"Management is poor. They tout excellent safety procedures during training but it is not present on the floor. Very low team morale. I have seen managers storm out of the building out of frustration with they're own higher-ups. The deal with injuries poorly and I have heard of a number of times where management blatantly lied to the WSIB, if not at least twisting the words of their employees."
bad,"Working there was a mistake. Nobody cared about anybody else, especially when it came to management. Nobody was really an expert in any one area because everyone was bounced all over the store."
bad,they dont listen to you they dont care about you... they help the people they like had a few issues with them i stay there because i have my friends plus i need to take care of my son.
bad,"A piece of advice for anyone considering employment at Walmart: don't EVER suggest improvements to the way the company operates. To do so will be viewed as criticism and that is never tolerated. Everything is perfect at the world's largest retailer and your role is to do as you are told and smile. If you can do that and leave your brain at the door, you'll go far at Walmart."
bad,"Wal-Mart is for  retirees, high school students and lazy college students.  If your a single parent or collecting unemployment this is not a job for you not sure how they except you to pay your regular bills plus insurance for a car, child care, and the like."
bad,Rated so low because after a while the position I was in got treated worse and worse day by day to the point we were overworked and had only two people at one time running a whole parking lot full of carts on each side.
bad,"Walmart is a fast paced environment, production in most areas is challenging and it gets very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter, The most enjoyable part is that it pays very well for this area."
bad,"The Shrewsbury, Mo Walmart has to be the worse Walmart ever!! From Co- Managers to the Csm all have poor attitudes, poor communication skills, poor work ethics! They treated the associates bad, especially if you were a cashier or worked apparel. They have the worse turnover rate which is why they're always hiring!"
bad,"A typical work day consist of shoveling massive amounts of BS, realizing everything you have been told is an lie. Rules constantly changing to benefit the company. Management gives zero f**ks on how their associates are treated, you are just a number here...seek work else where..all benefits have all but disappeared, health insurance is a step above not having anything. Pitiful excuse of a multi-billion dollar company..."
bad,"fun place to work, learned many things about deli items. Got in trouble for not taking my required break before my fifth hour of work, but i was the only associate in the deli so i couldn't leave to take a break"
bad,"A cashier position at WalMart, in my opinion, is an excellent first job. It introduced me to the workforce and I learned to communicate with people who were not my peers or friends/family members."
bad,Do tonight environment not those safe place to work great place to work fast pace trying to get work did on time and be on your way out of the door I'm just staff sucks no experiment
bad,Wal-Mart is extremely cut throat. Poor management. Management has favorites. Fire anyone at will.  Will only approve of days asked off if you threaten to call cooperate on them.
bad,"I hated my time working for Walmart distribution. The managers don't know what they are doing half of the time, they often play favorites and are very conniving. There were two managers that I liked while working there. They do not care about you, or your family. The pay is great if you don't mind missing everything with family, including most holidays. I worked there for a year and hated every single second."
bad,Working at walmart was great but it has it's days the customers are great but they need new employees some of them need to come to work with an smile.
bad,"Uma empresa agradável,foi muito bom trabalhar lá."
bad,"The reason I left was the managers treated me like I was dirt, I got actually physically pushed around the store more then once and I did not like working here at all."
bad,"After working there for two and a half years I was still stuck in the same position. All in all I worked hard, got along with everybody, and most days showed up to work early. However when a promotion came along this other girl received it and she had only been there for two weeks. In the end it is really all about who your friends are and not how hard you work when your there. Oh and my friend lost her son to cancer, but they refused he bereavement time. They didn't want to have to cover her shift."
bad,Not a place you want to work for long.  Very hard to work for a not very friendly.  Pay was good but they dont care about there employees/  very busy all the time and hard to get things done.  Must follow all the rules all the time
bad,"Never enough staff in any department in the entire store ever. Always short staffed. None of the jobs are challenging however, the flow of customers supersedes the staffing exponentially"
bad,"Walmart discontinued most full time jobs because of government regulations.  Now most jobs are part time.  I also found management to lack skills.  Upper management is often assigned a department they have never worked,  therefore it causes issues until they learn the products of that department."
bad,"Constant complaining from customers, most of the managers don't stop and listen to what you have to say, it usually takes forever to finally get benifits."
bad,Is coming to work getting your work assignments for the night you come in. Put up items to the shelf that has ran out. Management here sucked the most because they don't know how to talk with their employees. Can't complain on the workplace culture. Getting what can't fit on the shelves back to the storage area by restacking it to one pallet to make sure nothing falls off and hurts anyone when do so. I enjoy new faces of people and giving a helping hand when they need it.
bad,"Cleaning and getting a cash drawer for my register "
bad,"This job sucks. when I worked there they only paid 8.25 an hour for a job that was very demanding, physically exhausting, and overall very tedious. There is no chance you'll be promoted. The company is just too big to address your concerns, and you're just a number to them. time off is .. somewhat easy to get, but calling in sick sucks because of their automatic call system. "
bad,At work I was always happy. The best part was assisting customers and I learned how customers always comes first. The hardest part was when I had to help the order associate to push the carts on the sun during summer. The most enjoyable was the good benefits they offers and having a good management. The culture is to show good customer service.
bad,"Alegre con ganas de aprender algo nuevo"
bad,"too many bosses and not enough communication between the management team. There is never enough employees to fulfill the needs of the public. Therefore, customers become annoyed with employees, and in turn employees do the same."
bad,Management can sometimes be very unprofessional. I love the position. associates are very nice. People over you have their picks and chooses... no job should be like that.
bad,"Working at Walmart was the worst job I've ever worked at. The upper staff was very unprofessional. You only moved up if you wee personally known. If I could give a ''0"" rating I would."
bad,Working for walmart was the worst experience of my life. What I learned most from working there is the harder you work the worse you get treated by everyone. I was confused when people started tell me to slow down because nobody wants to work that fast they all just want to get the bare minimum done. It does not matter how good of a job you do you will never advance in the company unless you are good friends with management unfortunately that's the way it is. The hardest part of working there is most of your Co workers are anger and depressed because thats how everybody gets after working the first month. Unfortunately there really was not anything enjoyable about my few years I spent there but I did get to meet a very few good people I would call my friend. It would be a good starter job for a high school kid or a collage student but not a career.
bad,"Wal-Mart treats employees not as people, but just another blue vest. In my 2 years of working there I never felt like an individual. Management tends to bully employees. Although they speak of Wal-Mart being a ""family"" they (management) will not hesitate to throw you under the bus, so to speak, to make cover up their own mistakes.  I cannot speak for all Wal-Marts, but this definitely is the case at store #3309."
bad,al principio muy buenos conmigo pero me ponian hacer cosas q no eran compatibles a lo que yo tenia que hacer
bad,"The ONLY redeeming quality of this job is the amount of money you got after probation was quite a lot. The work atmosphere was extremely toxic, backstabbing co-workers, incompetent managers, no hope of a raise, and literally working until you pass out just to get up and do it all over again. Don't work here."
bad,"Only worked at Walmart for about three months. However the ,majority of management were easy to get along with, helpful and compassionate, my coworkers always worked together to accomplish a common goal. Customer satisfaction."
bad,"I worked with great people setting modulars, including my supervisor. Management was usually more concerned about getting freight worked with a light third shift, so we were used as overnight stockers on two truck nights."
bad,Managers were horrible wasn't dependable over all worst place ever to work. Didn't train you they would throw you into a job not knowing what to do. They wasn't fair at all and are very crooked I wouldn't recommend anyone work there at all.
bad,Over worked an very underpaid never enough staff .give you plenty of hours but they don't pay enough an no type of benefits you stand in one place for hours
bad,"Its a job nothing more.  The management makes it difficult to enjoy working there.  Work is not shared equally, blame gets passed around since no one will ever own up to their mistakes."
bad,"Let me just say that you have to make sure you live for nothing but to work and putting up with the good, the bad, and the higher ups. Also make sure you keep your wits about you when it comes to safty and always have management put everything they promise you in writing."
bad,"Largest collection of liars I have ever worked for. I would never let kids work for Walmart unless you want them ruined for life."
bad,Walmart sucks big ones because they hire unwanted help and feel it's OK to bully that unwanted help and fire them for no reason but other than that it's soooooo great.
bad,"Typical day of work was to stock merchandise, assist customers with fishing license, purchasing rifles or ammunition, customer service, ringing out customers of their merchandise. Managers in my area were horrible also, mentally abuse, rude, did not care about employees, and unfair."
bad,"Typical Work Day: Work your [certain body part] off, hope for a lunch break somewhere near the middle of your shift, try not to think too much."
bad,"Wal-mart stores are horribly managed, it is not about service at all just money. The leadership and company itself do not care about staff or staff family life. Staff is made to work crazy hours during holidays without any incentive. Leadership only become concerned about condition of store when upper leadership (regional manager, CEO, etc.) visits. Turn over constant!"
bad,"I was attacked at Walmart by one of their stock men while I working there.  A manager witnessed the incident, but did nothing about it.  Their employee attacked me, and they fired me ....probably because they didn't want to experience any liability."
bad,"I like the job and my co-workers, but management is very disrespectful to the hourly associates. They do not show appreciation for their staff and do nothing to increase moral. Equipment needed to complete tasks are frequently unavailable."
bad,Assistant Manager was insulting and crude. Over worked employees and refused to ever give over time. Hr could write you up if you get just 10 minutes. Pathways was a joke and a waste of time. I'm glad I quit that place
bad,Absolutely the worst job I have ever had and I labored in construction. The managers are an always revolving door who scowl and blame the exhausted underpaid hourly employees for all the store's problems. The pay is ridiculously low with inhumane raises measured in pennies rather then dollars. The whole company be shut down for abusing America's lower classes. Walmart is an American disgrace.
bad,"Job is quick paced and management prefers quantity over quality. Supposed to be customer oriented but was yelled at frequently for spending to much time helping customers. Management is rude, not helpful, intimidating and have no idea what they are doing."
bad,Management is more concerned with meeting artificially inflated quotas to enhance their bonuses. Typically assigning tasks totally unrelated to the employees job description. Older workers are moving freight and younger ones are sweeping floors. Transfers to other departments is non existent.
bad,70+ hours as an assistant mgr stocking shelves because they cut hourly associate hours to almost none. Too busy running a cash register to get management duties done. Treats employees like garbage
bad,not a good place to work they don't care about the customers. or even the people that work for them. the CSM make you wait for ever for them to comee help the customers then they think it funny when the customer get mad at you
bad,"Not a bad place to work if it's your first job, in the years I worked there we did not get individual pay raises they just gave all the associates a wage increase so, even if you have been there for a couple-3 years you make the same pay as a new hire."
bad,I find that the workplace culture is unfriendly.  Employees generally do not provide good customer service.  New expectations are not shared with all employees which becomes very frustrating and confusing for all.  Many hours are spent on outdated training materials that should be spent on some customer service training techniques.
bad,"its a joke. management is a joke and so are the supervisors."
bad,"I worked with walmart for approximately 3years. Management is horrible. They will not work with you on your availability and if you need to change it they threaten you by saying your hours may get cut back.They push you even if you are the only one working in your department. They give you false hope of getting help in your department. Whenever the ""big guys"" visit the store they decide to pretend to care about you and your department. Its just not a great place to work in my opinion."
bad,"Greeting customers and puting smiles on peoples faces, plus giving them a great shopping experience. I help our store grow by doing my part. I like walmart benefits they treat us as family. Its also a pleasure to serve someone services so we keep making profits and gaining cliental."
bad,"Made it clear that employees were dispensable, the management was rather rude. Often times scheduled overnights for 7 nights in a row. Not an enjoyable job."
bad,"Poor pay, poor benefits, poor management, poor everything.  It's Walmart.  It only gets the three stars for Job Culture, because the grunts like me that worked there are all super chill cause we are dealing with working there together."
bad,The store manager was always complaining and adding more then usual work loads. The equipment in the store is old and broken had to rig more then half the floor equipment together with different parts. The managers weren't all bad only had problems with two that tried to manage a position they knew nothing about and refused to listen to reason
bad,The only thing good was the benefits and then again they weren't even that great. Management is a joke and everyone that is employed here is treated like they are not important to the company and easily replaceable.
bad,"This company was alright to work for. As a cashier your main responsibility was making sure the customer left happy. Even if they did give you attitude, which was most of the time. Lots of hours for part timers, just because they don't give out full time to anyone unless they've been there for years."
bad,The hours horrendous the pay is horrible and you would be lucky if you have one day out of the weekend to yourself. The only good thing about working at Walmart was i meet some really nice people
bad,Myself I love talking to people getting to know what they're in the store for seeing what's in their cart I'm just a little bit nosey playing with the babies hoping my co-workers out learning new things for the management or my supervisor every job that I have a take something from that job and put it into my new job
bad,"A typical day at work is just normal "
bad,"Not enough pay for the work comparable to other positions in the store, where they do not have to do as much constant work as cashiers."
bad,"Everyday I worked there were a lot of customers and almost no employees in the store, we had one or two people at the customer service desk, five cashiers in the whole store, and maybe three or four sales associates to cover all of the store's departments. All of the managers I worked with in the three years I worked there were rude and didn't care about the employees except two the first six months I was there."
bad,My schedule would say one thing one day and less hours the next i don't like my schedule changing unless i agree to it. Its unprofessional completely.
bad,"They had really bad training. Once you were done with the computer training, they assigned you with people who didn't really train you on the machines. Other employees were not as co-operative. Management did not help much with their employees."
bad,"Walmart was not a great place to work at, the managers did not care about anyone but themselves. they did not respect that I went to school. they would schedule me when I told them I can not work on these days"
bad,"no family values and the company tends to play favorites based on social bias and not on merit of work or success."
bad,"I worked there as an assembler and I stopped liking the job after a week and after finding out that no one knew anything about the position I was working in, I received no training, and the internet program that they use for training told me nothing besides to follow the instruction manuals. The managers were very poor when it comes to personal connections and could care less when I told them that I was putting in my two weeks."
bad,"Scheduling was not the best, nothing was consistent. You had to hunt down management to talk to them, even then they would walk off from you. They never let you finish any one job before giving you ten other things to do. Floor sets had to be done every week, team members were nothelpful, it was always only one or two people resetting hundreds of movies, removing tags for each movie and putting new ones."
bad,"please do not ever work for this company. They ""say"" they are family oriented and have concern for their employees, but they don't. There is ALOT of favoritism and that's usually how people get advancements. The management is not friendly and if you ever need help with something (especially if your a cashier)  No one is ever around to answer a question for you OR a customer  They only give raises of about .25 per year which is so incredibly sad for this huge corporation and they only give you a 10% discount. The discount does not include food."
bad,"The management team are all friends, and they each have their ""favorite"" and those people are the only ones who ever advance anywhere in the company. hard work goes unnoticed. a good job if you enjoy over working, understaffing, and zero appreciation."
bad,"horrible managment, bad rate of pay for being a department manager , no communication , bad hours."
bad,Not the best company to work for everything is part time with no room for schduling needs such as i want mornings only not work till midnight then next day come in at 10 and so on and so on.
bad,"Unhappy associates due to oppressive work environment and favoritism; as a result unqualified associates get promoted; higher ranks depend on lower ranks for guidance in simple procedures.The question is, how does one become a manager when they are clueless about simple register operations. Management instils fear in associates because threats of being fired are a common feature, as a result customer service delivery suffers. Customer first policy is a disaster because there is no coverage to adequately serve customers. Frankly, the most enjoyable part of the job is when you clock out and go home; you can see it on everyone's faces when they crack smiles for the first time on their day at work."
bad,la mediocridad por parte de la gerencia hace de esta empresa un lugar terrible para laborar
bad,Long work hours; management is not helpful and back stabbing. Do not expect to get the proper training. Management definitely needs to be better. The benefits are the best part about the job.
bad,"Poor Managers, unequal treatment. You feel like everything you do is wrong. False Team environment. Poor training. Moving up is not what you know, it is who you know."
bad,"You're a number and not a person. Must play along with all the favoritetism and being disrespected by other staff, management,and customers. Lastly not sure if this is requirement or not but EVERYONE who has a HR  or personnel job is the rudest person you will ever meet. All employee's are treated like poo."
bad,The people I work with on a daily basis are terrific people. Work would be fun and productive if management would let people do what they were trained to do instead of pulling people from other departments to do jobs they don't know how to do. Not good at working with schedules or giving a  consistent schedule.
bad,"I personally did not enjoy my work expierence at wal-mart. At times they overwork you, they do not compensate well for the amount work that is required."
bad,"honestly my only review about this company is do not work there! I step into walmart and i suddenly  become depressed. This is a job that favors people that like to kiss ***** and suck up to managers, they force you to force customers to sign up for master cards and thats what you get valued on. The managers do not care about giving good customer service and since working there we have changed about 5 managers within the department. The only good thing about this job is that you get lots of break."
bad,Customers are always no matter what they do or say. You have to be careful what you say or do. They expect you to do five jobs at once. No matter what front end comes first. So that meant I didnt have time to put out stock or new merchandise.
bad,The hardest part on the job would be to stand 10 hours a day on a mat that you can only wear your shoes off on which later down the road created a back injury.
bad,"Walmart is a very high pressure, unpleasant place to work with very little backup as an overnight stocker with diminishing raises and false accusations of wrong doing on the jobs with very little cross examinations.   You are controlled in everything, watched as if in a high security prison, with very little chance of advancement mostly if you have a relationship with a supervisor in secret.  Under high pressure all the time, never appreciated for how hard you work or your dependability as an associate."
bad,I was threatened by a csm more than once and management did nothing about it so I left. The overall work environment is toxic and I wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,"A typical work day consist of baby sitting grown adults whom are not held accountable for their actions, Being severely understaffed and talked down to by your management regarding work task being behind schedule with your already depleted work staff."
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked I learned what misery and depression really is, the management know nothing about their job or how to speak to people. Every day there was new faces because either people walked out or were fired for no reason. The atmosphere is a;ways tense and you are always rushed."
bad,poor management poor pay lacking in benefits actually was threathened sevral time while working here heavily montoired by different managers heavy work load
bad,They have many incompetent mngrs coming in and out with a very high turnover. Too many chiefs no Indians Do not have their act together miss breaks and lunch constantly and aleawys short employees from such a constant turnover
bad,"They do not pay enough and hire a bunch of older people to work in the rough areas, who will not do the work required, and then give their work to the younger people. The pay is awful and the scheduling is never what you need. It is like pulling teeth to get your schedule adjusted."
bad,"The pay was decent, although my job description wasn't so accurate. The higher ups were rather unapproachable and rude though. Not a fun place to work overall, but I've had worse."
bad,I did overnight stocking the bosses said I was too slow at stocking shelves so there for they let me go after three write ups they said I can have my job back if I wanted to I decided not. To get my job back because it was. For over night
bad,"A typical day at work was extra work to do"
bad,"typical day is high stress level ,unable to achieve managements expectations,  The store is under staffed, and managers are moody and tense most of the time."
bad,Working at Walmart was quite possibly one of the worst decisions I made.  The management wanted work one exactly the way they wanted and if not you were on the verge of termination.
bad,"When i originally started i applied to cashier, but as time went on my manager acted like it was a problem for me to do what i applied for instead she wanted me to stock. which is no problem, just make sure my job is done first. Its just a lot they need to get together. They no longer accept doctor excuses so being sick is out of the question. Request days off and haven't got any accepted."
bad,"i really didnt like working for walmart, they only cared about $, the employee was never a proirity and thats why i left. i would not go back there if it was my last pick."
bad,"I learned how to supervise a large number of associates at1 time. Total store operations remodels,merchandising ,payroll teaching and training all polices and procedures."
bad,We’ve lost so many benefits in the last couple years its pathetic. Not to mention our PAY DECREASE this year was a slap in the face. Management spends their days micromanaging you to the point you can’t  move without getting written up. They make it VERY CLEAR that you are an expendable worker.
bad,"They looked me in my face, & told me i would never leave the back room, and my wage would ultimately stay the same, but ill eventually get a not so great healthcare plan & a stock!"
bad,This place started out great I loved the job not as much some of the management.  No matter how hard you work it was never enough and you had to do better.  Feels like security there is full of head hunters.  If you prefer to be a customer there when you are not working there do not apply there they concider you an employee on and off of the clock.
bad,"Would have been a great company to work for, however, they refused to allow my use of paid time off, and then denied unpaid time off for my cousins wedding, when I had put in for it in advance. Asked me to do it for a third time. Also, got written up for ""being on my phone"" when I was using it to check the time, because military time is difficult to read and we didn't have any other available clocks to see. They also refused to allow over part time hours."
bad,"i loved it here, the company closed so i had to find a new job.i learned how to take great pictures, managment was not that great,a day at work was taking pictures checkking in pictures ect."
bad,Walmart is a joke the managers are jokes and are upset 😭half the time. Everyone is miserable and none wants to be there. People spend more time talking bad about Luther employees and less time working
bad,Management didn't engage and required you to perform tasks without proper instruction and training.     Therefore their expectations were unreachable.
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart is very long and hard, with little to no direction from management. Management is almost never around and when they are its generally to harass their employees. The employees are very un happy and difficult to work with as there is much favoritism and even family working side by side not everyone is treated fairly or respectably."
bad,"this place will drain you of your youth and lust for life. Then one day  you'll look up and realize your been there for 10 years. you hate your life and reminisce about what could have been. "
bad,Management is horrible. Nothing but favoritism. The store manager there is one of the worst. If he doesn't really care about anyone. Most associates there area great
bad,"Went through 3 store managers "
bad,A slower pace of a job. The training was not the best you do more on the job training. Over all it was a ok place to work. There was alot of the merchandise change overs.
bad,"I worked at walmart for 25 plus years . My job in the office was done away with and they no longer had a position for me.  I was let go because any other position  I was given I was going to lose hours,and money. I dont agree with what walmart did to me after 25 years I was discriminated,against. And treated unfairly."
bad,"Walmart was the worst job by far that I have worked at. No respect for employees, Demanding managers all the time. No time to get anything done in your department before being being pulled to a difference way to do something else. A waste of time. Look for a different place to apply for a job."
bad,"The only way to work at Walmart is hourly. Do NOT take any kind of salaried job, they will use and abuse you. Very unrealistic expectations at times. Assistant Manager is the worst job in the company and doesn't pay half what it's worth."
bad,"Do not work here! This place absolutely sucks! no benefits, no set schedules and very low pay. This job will work the life out of you for very little pay and the raises are minimum"
bad,"The people who work there mean well but, aren't the best at meeting the needs of those working under them. To go along with regular conflicts with my schedule, I was frequently asked to postpone my work to complete the work of others."
bad,"every manager or leadership position was poorly chosen "
bad,Worked for them for twelve years. Only make 2 dollars more than minimum wage. Do yourself a favor and don't stay if you find yourself working for them.
bad,"bad pay, inconsistent shifts, terrible managers, and complete disarray make Walmart one of the worst places to work as of 2017.  The only real benefit is the meager check you'll receive every two weeks."
bad,"Upper management disregards and disrespects their associates ... there is a real disconnect between the top tiers of management and their associates.  Associates are under-paid and although they have PTO, they are still penalized for using it."
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked at. Everything from battling management - asking for more hours and you look like a bad guy because you want to work the other thing is with my experiences with Walmart and their training is not very good at all. And when something goes wrong and you report it to management generally they are like ""just fix it"" Some of the other problems that I have noticed that Walmart has is with some of its managers if you were not properly trained on something there has been some managers that will say very vulgar names about you."
bad,"Walmart is the defenition of overworked and under appreciated. They give you an un-realistic amount of time to get work done. IE. if the job in the computer says it takes 4 hours to unload a truck by hand they want it done in 2. However if it isn't done in 2 hours all the managers come in and start pressuring the employees. For example unloading the truck pulling freight out onto the floor to be stocked, stocking said freight, and facing the product, all together per the walmart computer system says it takes 10-12 hours, They want it all done in 8. If you don't get it done in that time there is always a supervisor or manager saying you have to stay late until its done. Walmart gives its employees no sense of accomplishment and I actually felt worse getting of work than I did going in."
bad,"Walmart Neighborhood Market was not good for me because I am in school they were not flexible at all for me and my school schedule, often scheduling me during school times when they had my school schedule from the beginning. I became sick unexpectedly and thought I followed all protocol to my being absent but found out soon that I did not but no one ever even told me how. Walmart is unorganized and management is not on one accord causing chaos and confusion."
bad,"Awful work hours and there is no team work or communication,the benefits at this company are the only good thing about them. The managers are disrespectful and degrading, I would not suggest anyone to work for this company."
bad,The store I worked at had very bad management and the employees where rude to each other and customers. Will never go to that store again and will never work for them again.
bad,My experiences at Walmart has taught me a lot about interacting with customers.  I've acquired exceptional critical thinking skills. I am able to multitask more efficiently.
bad,"horrible, managment is all about targeting certain people. all managment cares about is the money in the wallet, they could care less about the assotioates"
bad,Working for this company was a nightmare. I learned that Walmart allows any person to go into salaried management positions with little to know clue how to do there job. Managers there are bullies. They have poor personal hygiene and ignore there associates.
bad,its and okay company to work for if the management could get on the same page as the associates.this is like a job for someone straight out of high school.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job at Wal Mart was helping the customers find things they were looking for.  Talking with the customers about the different products the store had offer. Management at the company could use more manager training.  Don't follow through on associates issues with open door policy. A typical day at work could include a manager bullying a associate on the sales floor.
bad,It wasn't really a bad place to work. I got along with the employees but not the managers they were always on my behind and grinding me for nothing.
bad,I was only here for six months. I was going to school at the same time as working here and they would constantly change the schedule. Some weeks they would have me on for almost 40 and then cut me back to about 12 for a couple weeks so they wouldn't have to give me full time benefits. They change the hours I worked constantly also. One day I would close at 10 p.m. and then be expected to come back at 5 a.m. Managers are supposed to switch departments to be able to become a store manager so the understand how each department runs but most of them have never actually worked in the department they run so they have unreachable expectations for their workers because most of the time they don't schedule enough people to work in a department a day and expect you to go and finish another departments work along with your own.
bad,"Tem hora para entrar na empresa,não tem hora para sair,não tem oportunidades de subir de cargo na empresa."
bad,"clock in go to my register, go on the sales floor at walmart  you had to be trained to work in every department and I pretty much was  in a matter of months, a manager once told me she worked in every department , before she became a store manager"
bad,"This was by far the worst job I have ever had. They train you to treat your employees like work chattle. They have no empathy for any personal issues including health. They also don't care about your time at all. I worked 80 hour days, some nights getting off at midnight and having to be back in the morning at 6am. It was reminiscent of slavery honestly. I will never work for this company again."
bad,"at least five differnt times I was told If I do (blank) I'll get (promotion) never happened, I got wrote up for complete bull, I had supervisors that where bullying and stealing but no one would do anything, everytime I tryed to push the issue I got coached or sent to another store to be treated like dirt. I absolutely would not suggest the fremont walmart to anyone."
bad,"Management treat their workers like slaves."
bad,Largest retailer in the world. Many opportunities to advance. Schedule is not family friendly.  Pay does not match the responsibility. Healthcare is very expensive and coverage is minimal.
bad,"It's an okay job. Stressful at times. Some customers and employees are great, but others can be very rude. If you apply yourself,  you can definitely advance in the company"
bad,"Be prepared to work until 12AM then come in again to open at 6AM. Management will belittle their workers over the most irrelevant things yet have no idea what they are doing. Customers are primarily rude. Teams are nonexistent, everyone is out to get each other here. Do your work, put your head down, stay in your position. Become the greatest sycophant alive and be promoted 6 times in a year."
bad,"Hours were not that great, management needs work, co-works were most likely the best part, to many bosses not enough communication between them."
bad,The job itself is easy but the management does not help and is very unprofessional as I was let go from my temporary position over the phone a couple of hours before my shift
bad,It's a horrible choice unless you're seriously hard up. Next to nobody knows much of anything about the stuff in their department besides the bare minimum (sometimes not even that much). The management is clueless and care more about the merchandise than the employees. Nobody really cares to do anything ore the the bare minimum to get the job done since nobody is really paid enough to do anything than be there (even that is debatable).
bad,"Great place to work while in school but not a place for a future career unless, you are a pharmacy graduate to become an assistant. You cannot move up in the business ladder unless you've given Wal-Mart many many years as an employee."
bad,Es una pesadilla trabajar ahí los jefes son un montón de despotas ylos clientes te tratan mal y nadie hace nada al respecto
bad,"Walmart was all right I guess. The associates were pretty cool and chill. It was a good schedule and the flex were scheduled for my school because I was going to school. But management and was one of the worst parts also not to mention the working condition that was some signs to severe.. no prom or a proper communication with management and, highly understaffed"
bad,"Go in to work with Spirits up to try to help everyone you can to the best of your ability. Then your informed that you must complete another 7 peoples jobs that may not be there ( sick, absent, or fictional person on their books to look like the store is meeting associate requirements) Or there ( Management that wants to not work so they delegate all there work down the chain). Then do as much as possible of the list of jobs required and then get complains that enough was not completed."
bad,"For the hard working and disciplined only.  Networking is key to succeed.  Hardest part of the job is that there are numerous things to balance all at once, multi-tasking is a must."
bad,Absolutely horrible place to work with horrible managers. This place I so unorganized and unprofessional. Worst mistake ever choosing to work there.
bad,"Regardless of your day, there is always a negative and disgruntled and upset customer to show up to say your hard work was unsatisfactory and claim you gave them an attitude. The reason why is because of management abusing there authority by slave driving there associates and when work is done they bever hesitate to push more work on you."
bad,I worked as a front-end cashier. This was a fast-paced job that killed my legs. Standing there in one spot for 8+ hours with steady work. The pros would be they do have some what of good benefits. And the cons would be the co-workers. They should do more of an intensive check on applicants before making the decision to hire.
bad,"I learned the importance of communication at walmart, because of how blatantly that company lacked it. Management had no connection to the staff at all. They constantly changed policies and procedures with little to no notice, and as a result employee moral suffered. I really liked the people I worked with and the work itself was not difficult, it was just the lack of communication that got me."
bad,Walmart management could work on improving treatment to employees. Most employees feel mistreated and over worked. Employee satisfaction leads to better work ethics therefore better customer service and better business.
bad,I really like working for Wal-Mart but the lifting gets hard some days. I feel like I am treated well and my concerns are listened to and taken seriously.  I would recommend Walmart as an employer to anyone.
bad,Hours are cut management are not for the associate's. work is steady don't get enough credit for the work I do associates are against me. Associates are rude
bad,was a horrible place to work management didn't care about anyone but them selves the other employees were great to work with and they would supply the proper cleaning supplies like gloves
bad,Job was easy no complaints there . The managers on the other hand were absolutely horrible.They have no leadership skills. They treat you like a child a put you down. They don't know how to lead people at all. Its sad that such a big company has managers like this.I woulrker up until 1 minute before my 12 hours just because they wanted to beat the atlanta warehouse! and i wasn't given an extra break or anything. There horrible.
bad,"you have to be a really big suck up in order to keep your job. It don't matter how hard you work, if the upper management don't like you then they find a reason to fire you."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of the manager reviewing the previous day, completing assigned tasks, and if you are a stocker sometimes you complete the tasks way before the required time and find yourself with absolutely nothing to do. Sometimes the managers don't look to see where else you can help. Most of the coworkers are rude and unfriendly, and they do not focus completely on their tasks. During my last day there i was working with a guy who kept questioning me about personal issues, and he was being very rude to me. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock items that were in a plain brown box with no label to help you find where they belong on the shelf. There was nothing at all enjoyable about the job. I learned that they need to have better training for stockers to help them locate where an item goes if there is no label or way to tell where in the aisle it goes."
bad,"While working with Walmart I have learned that management is is very unorganized. Cares little about personal issues within family. Views associates as just that; associates. Not willing to work with personal schedules that involve school or any other prior commintments you may have. While some of the other associates seem to be friendly they will go to management and say anything to try to make other associates out to be bad employees. Overall, working with Walmart is undesirable."
bad,A typical day at work is very stressful. Most of the co-workers are great to get along with. The hardest part of the job is trying and attempting to do your job the way it is supposed to be done.
bad,Not good at pay rate starting. To much favoritism and pettyness. They ask for to much for not enough pay. The PTO policy is not good. They don't have enough coverage. I had to may problems that they didn't get fixed at all. I told managers about it and did nothing. Its like high school in this place.
bad,Management and pay at walmart is not good. you really cant live off at walmart pay unless u have been there 20 years plus. Co workers are nice but no one does what there supposed to do and everyone just walks around. if ur at work just you mind as well work
bad,"I enjoy working with people. Working for this company is very difficult. They do not take doctors notes, once you've messed so many days in a six-month period you are terminated. Being a single mom and having a child with disabilities is very challenging. This company will not work with you regardless if you're dying"
bad,"Won't work with scheduling, doesn't give raises very well, won't tell you when you are hired part time that you will be trmporary"
bad,"Falta de um gerenciamento competente, agradável e organizado."
bad,This place is HORRIBLE. I have never had an experience this bad with an employer. Walmart has never cared about their employees. There are loopholes that they use to perpetuate your failure.
bad,"Management here is a joke. They talk down upon you, about you to others, and even share your personal imformation. They don't follow any of their policies. They treat their associates like nobodies. like we aren't people. like we are wild animals."
bad,Well don't get me wrong Walmart has become a lot better. I was a hard worker. Got promoted within a week of working there just showing initiative. A manager and I had a disagreement about a safety issue of which I was not in the wrong and he had me terminated from the market level which wouldn't allow me to dispute. I even tried corporate and they said to contact my market office. 1/10 would not work there ever again.
bad,"There is no job to work balance, at the paticular wal-mart that I worked for not even doctors notes counted as excused absent, If you wanted any type of sick time off you would have ot go on LOA. The amount of paperwork you'd have to do to return was astonishing and it cost more to leave that way then to just call out."
bad,"At Walmart there are hard working employees and people that take great pride in doing a great job and going above and beyond for the customers. "
bad,"The managers are either young & stupid or old & unsympathetic. Job security is non-existent, if they feel like letting you go, they will. They do not comply with most labour laws, and they are in court right now because of this. Just trust me, stay away, especially if you are a student as they do not think of school as a priority."
bad,"When I first started at Walmart, it was a good place to work, but as the company leadership, company policies, and management on store level has changed, so has the work environment.  What was once an enjoyable place to work, is now a hostile work environment more focused on the money they can make for the stockholders than the overall health and happiness of the associate. I love working with customers, and went into being a department manager because I would have more face to face time with customers, and my home and work lives would be more balanced.  Within a few weeks, the paperwork the company kept making the department mangers' responsibility made it less possible to really spend time helping the customer and making them feel valued because there just isn't enough time to do it all and still go home to be with your family on time."
bad,"Pays is always low, management always acts like they are better than you, and the customers think they own you. Its a temporary job, nothing more."
bad,Cahier and sales floor rep. Enjoyed working in customer service and helping customer. Management is not willing to invest in their people.  They do not support a learning environment.
bad,With the poor work schedules and and inadequate management team I have to say this is one of the worst places to work. Management does not value their associates and will constantly talk down to you like you are stupid
bad,They don't accept des notes when sick and or was in hospital. Besides when I worked they had terrible service. They had most of there employees working in different sections that they were experienced in.
bad,"I was employed for over 4 years at this location. You do not get any addvancement unless you pucker up management's butt! The management wants you to go by WalMarts rules yet they bend them so bad for some employees and not for others. Jobs are suppose to be posted and yet all of them are not. The ones that are not posted for employees to all have a chance are handed to the kiss butt! "
bad,"wal mart treats its employees wrong."
bad,They where chose their favorites if you weren't one of them everything you did was wrong.the breaks where a little to long especially for working over night simply because of you sit still you start to fall asleep
bad,"They are very unsatisfying to work for, they look for any reason to make you constantly work, even when injured. And are very inflexible even with such a large staff."
bad,They treat you like you are a dog they feel like they own you and that you get no say in what you want in your job its an OK job for in between but would not work there forever
bad,"When they say people of walmart are a different breed they werent lying... My evenings consisted of doing whatever work my managers put off doing from the morning a well as my evening duties, not to mention having to cover registers every five minutes. So it is pretty clear to say I never really got much of anything done in a shift, I was the only associate in my department so when the work didnt get done I was the only one getting in trouble. They had unreasonable expectations of sales associates. I was under the impression customers come first as their moto always says but apparently thats not the case, I frequently got told to limit my customer interaction and focus on stocking and zoning. Then right around thanksgiving/black friday I ended up injuring myself outside of work they denied my request for medical leave so I would show up to work with my boot on and they would end me home saying i couldnt fulfill job duties. Needless to say I quit, this job is soul sucking and people wonder why walmart employees are never friendly and always look run down and grumpy, because they are!"
bad,"I'll never work at walmart they were horrible, showed discrimination and weren't nice and didn't care about employees"
bad,"management is terrible not a single manager does their job, only hard working people are the associates which is a shame because they get treated the worst and are the only people that know what their doing in that store. Working for big corporation's like that is never a good idea if your somebody who wants to be respected as an employee."
bad,Working for Walmart was a lesson well learned. It wasn't my favorite job in the world but it played the bills. It wasn't what I expected. But you live and you learn.
bad,walmart was a bad experience for me. the management was terrible and staff was treated very poorly. scheduling was never correct and days off requests were often ignored.
bad,"It started out fine, I actually enjoyed getting dressed to come to work, but after a few months it went downhill."
bad,"Open dressing rooms, go though returns, help customers, answer phone, direct calls to departments and radio calls to management. "
bad,"I did not enjoy this job. Management  treat employees very poorly. I only worked there for a month and then left due to the top store manager refusing to work with my scheduled time off and telling me that he didn't like me and that no one liked me. Claiming that was why I had no friends. That was literally the 2nd time I had ever seen him. He did not know a thing about me, but make these harsh assumptions."
bad,"When I started working for this Wal-Mart I warned them, ""I am a student; I am required to be there 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, and my schedule will change a bit"" they had accepted this and worked around my needs. This was until the new year when they changed the system to Customer First. Now no one will work with me, many co workers are loosing hours and not giving the times or days off they/I need for school. so many people are leaving this company because they are not scheduling enough people and overworking they few that are on the clock!"
bad,I had to learn everything on my own  they had no time to train me. I love working with my co-worker they was very helpful. The hardest part of the job would be that they wait to tell you at the last minute to do things and it is not your job to do but i am a team player i love helping in anyway. Working in home living i real enjoyed work in that area because i got the changes to help people find the things that they needed.
bad,I do not recommend this company as a career. It is hard to move up through the system if you do not befriend the managers. You are overworked and management does not care for you.
bad,I am a cashier and a typical day consists of checking out peoples groceries and bagging them. I have learned that I don't like working at walmart. My coworkers are all pretty good people. My management is ridiculous they need to learn how to do their jobs. The hardest part of my job is going there and the most enjoyable thing is leaving.
bad,Working at walmart was one of the worse ideas I ever came up with. Most of the management does not know how to treat a person. Communication within the company is very poor.
bad,Wal-mat in Heights Houston TX is byfar the worse place to work. Management sucks; They are rude and doesn't care as long as they save themselves. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARE IF YOU ARE SICK. NO MORE PAID HOLIDAY. Very messy. Best thing to do is to keep to yourself or else the whole store will know your buisness. Personal is no professional either.The company as a whole sucks. WORK HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
bad,"Poor to bad Management, company requires open availability yet the hours range from 28 hours to 12 hours a week. Deal with bad customers and continue returned items, damaged products."
bad,"A typical day at work involves filling the cake case for the customers to purchase items, take cake orders and fill them for pick up, answer phones, assist customers and put away stock. I learned how to decorate cakes and to do various jobs in the bakery. There is a shortage of workers. The hardest part of the job is how to get everything done in a short amount of time. As  most of the employees are part time. "
bad,"They tried to make me lift heavy objects while pregnant, regardless of the fact that they knew I was pregnant when they hired me as I told them up front."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a horrible place to work, Management is the most unprofessional and just down right mean people to work with. They do not care about the employee, all they care about that you show up for work and work you like a dog.  Most people are very unhappy working there but have to do it, especially the Seniors supplementing their income and the 45 to 50 plus age group as they have lost their jobs and can not find anything else as no one likes to hire the middle age group anymore.  I know and can testify to that."
bad,"I worked full time at the Enrichment Center . I helped residents with every day task . For an example helping clients with bathing, feeding, eating and just keeping them company. The enrichment center is a facility for people with mental disabilities. I left the Enrichment Center because I was pregnant and could no longer work with clients due to some of their behaviors."
bad,"My over all experience was poor, the management was very poor and unprofessional. I had a lot of problems. i always did my work but i felt like i was being watched for every little detail that was done. i cant work under that kind of pressure."
bad,"Every day working at Walmart is like rolling a giant boulder up a mountain. The workload is endless and they provide no assistance. If you try to do things more efficiently, you are reprimanded for it. The reward for completion this Herculean task, is similar having your liver eaten by a large bird. The next day comes, and it's ""rinse and repeat""."
bad,"A good first job for some. A good job for older people to supplement their income. However, not rewarding or fulfilling for the 30 and over crowd. Pay increases of 2% do not keep up with the cost of living. No accountability for associates who mess up or just going through the motions."
bad,Walmart in Hartselle miss treats employees. They allow customers to treat employees poorly. I know this from personal experince. It's a small racist town. They're where nights i couldn't walk to my car by myself due to the way customers had treated me. It gives me fear makes me not ever want to return to Walmart.
bad,If you are just needing a paycheck not a career advancement this is the place to be. The management and the upper management knows nothing. The morale will forever remain low as long as they do not care about their employees.
bad,Working at Walmart Automotive Care Center was a particular experience in learning how to maintain and manage an automotive shop. A regular day usually saw thirty to forty vehicles serviced without complication. Management very rarely supervise in the shop until a problem occurs. Co-workers are easy to get along with until there is a difference of opinion on how to run the shop. The hardest part of the job was working on busy days with a short staff. The easiest and best part of the job was being able to help a customer and making their day better.
bad,"Met some great friends. There needs to be more focus on the associates and less on spending more money on opening more stores. The managers aren't able to manage due to not enough staff to the tasks, so they are forced to fill in as associate. It goes downhill from there. Unrealistic expectation of and no one to do the job. Then frustration boils over to staff that feels unappreciated. It is literally like a hamster on a wheel."
bad,It is a busy environment to work in. Dealing with different types of personalities (customers). Management sometimes is not very approachable
bad,The General Office of this company is the worst place I've ever worked.  I started out in a store when I was 16 and that was ok for a part-time job.  When I finished college I transferred to the GO.  I hated it.  I dreaded going to work every day.  They lie to you and some managers don't treat their employees well.  There was nothing good about this place except they had a cafeteria with decent food.
bad,The management needs allot of training on how to speak to their employees. Unrealistic expectations from their employees. Constantly changing their request on any giving day and time.
bad,"Walmart does not care about it's employees. How they have employees that have been there for 20+ years is beyond my recognition. My management team was awful; nothing was ever good enough for them. I was one of their more advanced workers completing my tasks on time and asking for additional work, and it still didn't matter. "
bad,Our days at work involved stocking and blocking isle given to us each day. What I learned was how the stocking aspect of retail works. Management created unrealistic goals for someone of my ability. Co-workers were very obnoxious and wielded poor attitudes. The hardest part of the job was meeting expectations in an allotted time. I found nothing in that job enjoyable.
bad,"Long Hours. Tiring, Co-workers are nice. Some of the management team is difficult to deal with. Very strict. Easy to get along with people but hard to avoid people you don't like."
bad,The management will be quick to fire you if you do not fit into there way of running the business.  The upper management DO NOT listen to their associates and make them afraid to speak due to retaliation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with my associates that I was responsible for and form a relationship with them.
bad,"With such low pay, low morale, and lack of management support, I'm not sure why people work for this company anymore. They will soon find they're going to be out of workers and will be forced to pay them more and treat them better."
bad,"Tire, lube, express technician responsible for basic care repair needs, such as tire changing, oil changes, balance and rotating, and minor running issues. Ensuring fast and friendly customer service, while keeping up with company policies as well as customers needs."
bad,Not a good /fun place to be. Most  management member and customers are so rude and disrespectful. No team work .It is like a politics.....
bad,It was fun and I learned to have more customer service my co-workers were friendly the hardest part was opening the bags sometimes the most enjoyable part was helping the customer's
bad,"Not a good place to work you are forced to work every hoiliday and weekend , thanksgiving is not the exception. If you change your availibilty expect to have your hours cut back to 8 hrs even if your are full time and hours are availible. Increasingly only hiring part time. Under staffed , Expect to do the job of two or more people. Unsafe over the years had multipule bomb threats and customers threats were the police had to be called. Rude customers expect to be treated like dirt."
bad,"Don't have much to say. Its only for people with no kids, because the schedule its not balance. They lack of management and the schedule its hard, you can be working one day opening next day you closing."
bad,"Management can be nice, but they don't understand scheduling, especially for part-time workers. Salary is minimum (expected), can get really crowded, fast paced, and often managers act like jerks."
bad,"Walmart treats their employees like garbage, they have no consideration on all extra things they ask their employees do. If you commit one small mistake, they blow it way too out of proportion. There open door policy is garbage store manager never resolves anything, everything is always swept under the rug. They always blame the employee for everything even when the customer is at fault."
bad,"A typical day at work was cashiering on the front end or the garden center and sometimes zoning.  I learned that Wal-Mart is a horrible place to work for and they don't pay enough and I never want to work there again.  Management wasn't very good either.  Never hired enough people and didn't care if they got us out on time at the end of our shift.  Some of my co-workers were nice, others were rude.  The hardest part of the job was being stuck on the tobacco register.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the long lunch breaks."
bad,was okay but im not a retail person had to go get carts and do customer service I like factory work a whole lot better. Helped customers unload or load their cars.
bad,The management doesn't care about their employees whatsoever. You're truly just a number to them and they don't have the proper management skills to run an efficient warehouse.
bad,"I was terminated (without proof) for accusations of gross misconduct. One of the associates who accused me was well known for REFUSING to work in the department that the incident supposedly occurred in. No personal time or sick time after 1 year of employment. Worked 40 hours a week as a part time associate for 1 YEAR, and was refused full time status as management wrote off all the hours as a 'business need'. 1 year, part time associates must work 44.4 hours to accrue 1 hour of PTO (Personal Time Off). 1 year, full time associates must work 22.2 hours to accrue 1 hour of PTO. PTO includes sick time, vacation time, and personal time, whoever the use of PTO does NOT excuse absences."
bad,"how would i describe my experience working for Walmart? well the breaks are short, management fires a lot of people just for doing they're jobs and management will NEVER help you when you need some help when your working. All i can say is its better to work anywhere else besides there."
bad,Too many policies to keep up with too many changes too fast and is a good first job but being a manager in this company sucks.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about this place. Signed for 2 raises I never got, Never got my vacation time or PTO time, Pay is to low and hours arn't that great."
bad,profits before workers.They people put in charge of the tire shop that don't know a lugnut from a gas cap.Some people get coachings for things that other people get by with
bad,some of the management is terrible lots of drama on shift often there is over 16 hours of work and you have to do it in 8 hours. breaks every 2 hours and snacks on Friday the company also offers Rosetta stone and it is possible to become a manager in 6 months
bad,"Walmart has given me an experience that will stay with me for a long time. I created Forecast Process from scratch which involved sales planning of FMCG and NON FMCG categories. Few supply chain projects were part of my job. My co-workers started co-operating after approximately an year and a half which was the hardest part of my job. Convincing them about my work and my skills took lot of initiative. I had started enjoying working primary on FMCG categories. Working on each category separately enhanced my knowledge about FMCG industry. Management did not intervene many times which was required at that point in time. Moreover, it was a long distance that I had to travel from my home to work. It took around 1.5 hours to reach office and even more to come back home. Overall, it was a yearning experience for me."
bad,"Wal-Mart will have you work over time and not pay you for it. That's illegal and somehow they get away with it. Specifically walmart located in Houston, Tx on Hwy 290 $ Cypress Rosehill,"
bad,"Just look into going some where else, the managers are lazy, over reactive, and vindictive even if you done nothing wrong. Just a horrible place to work for."
bad,"I did not find my happiness in Walmart , maybe it's just be , but I couldn't stand the rude customers . The money was good . But ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR ME"
bad,"A typical work day consisted of cleaning different areas of the store at different intervals of the shift. Training was almost non existent accept for what the company was legally obligated to tell you to avoid lawsuit. all though some of the management did their jobs properly without biased opinions and presented themselves in a professional manner, while most of the management where allowed free reign of judgment and in doing so they abused their authority including but not limited to intentionally reprmending or terminating employees for standing up for themselves for unfair or unsafe situations. While allowing personal grudges to influence their decisions as well as lying, threatening, and giving false promises to employees to get what they want.With my co-workers I never truly had a problem that could not be solved with civil conversation.All though monotonous the job itself was not difficult. my co-workers were the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,"My husband did the drywall for the El Centro Walmart, he paid for the materials, the labor, employee lodging, travel expenses, all the costs of his company to do the drywall job for the entire store & they never paid him. Somehow, when they went to court, they were able to only be held responsible for payment should they ever sell the building, unbelievable!!"
bad,"Day to day job was never the same, you'd start on one project and halfway through management would send you to do something else. Some coworkers are easy to work with while some will throw you under the bus for just about anything. Management is non existent when it comes to employee relationships. You're just another number here, if management knows your name it's because you're sucking up constantly. Hours are horrible and they will ask you to stay even longer everyday, if you say you can't, expect hours to be cut to short of nothing."
bad,"What openly promotes itself as a verdant industry of advancement and opportunity quickly reveals itself to be corporate chess on a grand scale. Workers are pushed to the brink by cold and callous management with meager consideration as they stretch the hourly employees across the store to fill in for missing or damaged cogs in the industrial clockwork. The dividing line between the management and the average employee is as vast as the rift between heaven and earth. Two very separate engines push the store to its operating maximum as it pushes mediocre products and service to the masses who, much like management, refuse to recognize the struggle and effort that the average employee puts in. Your hourly employee is frequently the victim of management schemes to avoid taking the fall for an error, however grievous."
bad,"Great place to work,good pay, great management,Advancement possible with hard work.Good policies and procedures, great benefits."
bad,"constantly working with public, learned to work deli, I'm sorry can't comment, co workers r mostly good, not knowing the hours, working."
bad,"I personally had a horrible experience working for Walmart. I was treated like an expendable number."
bad,Not a very good company to work with if you are working under management. I would not recommend anyone looking for a job to apply at Walmart.
bad,"Walmart showed a lot of favoritism that I did not like. It was drama everyday all day. Management team is highly horrible and they talk so rudely to you. My co-workers, I liked them they kept me going all the time. The enjoyable part of my job was having an awesome ring speed that was accelerating every month"
bad,they are go go go and dont care how it effects you or your family. they want you to always be there and expect nothing to happen in your personal life. they give little raises
bad,"A typical day for a department manager at Walmart is being given a list of assigned tasks and requirements that are ""the most important part of your job,"" and then given neither the time, staff or resources to accomplish them."
bad,"I was hired as a part-time pharmacist (evening shift) at the central fill location in Orlando.  The evening shift was appealing because I also own a business and am very involved in other pharmacy organizations so it allowed me to make an extra buck and avoid huge gaps on my resume.  The low level of stress touted during the interview was also a plus.  This is a closed door environment so you do not have to deal with patients and prescribers.  Unfortunately, low level of stress meant a BORING job and with boredom and idle minds comes pettiness.  The people in this warehouse cause much drama among themselves possibly due to not having enough to do.   These pharmacists are only responsible for verifying prescriptions on a conveyor belt at a rate of about 400 scripts per hour.  The goal of this pharmacy is to eventually not need as many pharmacist verifying.   The job itself is a piece of cake.  Unfortunately, the night shift is run by sects of foreign pharmacists who cannot obtain employment in any other realm of pharmacy practice so they assert themselves by nit picking over seating arrangements and lunch schedules.  If you are an african american or caucasian pharmacist who seeks to be more than a pharmacy technician or other low level position, I would not apply. The night shift caters  to foreign pharmacists who don't know pharmacy and who need a job and a few bucks.  Central fill caters to middle eastern and asian pharmacists who are there because they barely passed the boards and cannot work any place else.  If you are a pharmacist with any type of pharmacy acumen, this"
bad,In my own experience i had little training and alot of the employees did not enjoy the job nor did they work at a quick pace they took their time doing a project or getting a product
bad,"I have worked for Walmart most of my adult life.  Always in management,  and I  tried the distribution center.  You work 10 hours, AT LEAST, and get a very short lunch break,  I was written up for not only clocking in  less than a minute early,  but also for clocking in less than a minute late coming from my lunch.  The people that work there are the most arrogant and self obsessed people I've ever met,  and have this false sense of entitlement that is completely unheard of. There's no dress code,  so expect to see people wearing pajamas,  sweatpants,  wife beaters and so on.  The job is not worth the effort,  the money  or getting written up for the nonsense they worry about."
bad,that the management treats u unfairly if u are of a certain race or culture or have a disability or disorder. I really don't want to write a review about this company because I hated working for them.
bad,"I worked with WalMart for 2 years, and really, your entire experience depends on your management team. If they are good, its an alright place to work. If they are bad, you end up hating your job, and your life as Walmart culture tries to make itself more important than anything else you have going on."
bad,"The management does not have a clue what they are doing, I worked in the tire and lube express for about a year and the amount of free tires, oil changes ect. they give out to customers for total bs reasons is insane. No real shop would ever run this badly."
bad,For as big as this company is....they should really treat their employees better.  Customers always thought our place of work was a joke. Very discouraging.
bad,"Walmart was a very good company when I first started there, Over the years I have grown with the company. I have a lot of experience in fresh area's. My job was to over see all of the fresh department making sure that all department were up to company standards and ready for business. I also had to over see inventory every month making sure that each department meet company goals with profit. When I started to move up with the company I learn how to be head and plan for what's to come, always being a head made me stay ready. I had a good group of co-workers and few good leaders. Around the holidays I would cook for the hold store, you would think it would be hard but I enjoyed it. Knowing that I had to still do my daily task at hand. The only thing that may have been a hard time for me was learning all the new system but as I learn them things were okay."
bad,"Management expected more then possible and got upset when the few people we had didn't accomplish what they required. I had one person I worked with that I could trust, the others made me looked like I didn't do my job when I was the person doing my job and theirs."
bad,"En  la linea Gerencial, bajo nivel profesional."
bad,"When it came to doing scheduling and asking your days off well in advance, im saying like two months in advanced, they would wait until that schedule came out to tell you you were denied time off. If they didnt like you, they would give you the worst jobs to do. It felt very hostile and rushed and no one seemed to want to get along. It felt very negative."
bad,"A typical day at work involved greeting customers in the Tire and Lube department. Writing up customers' information on hand held computers for oil changes and tire purchases. Stocking shelves with merchandise and zoning them to present products in a neat and orderly appearance. Covering the Hardware department including mixing paint and providing customers with information both in person and also on the telephone."
bad,"Working at Walmart at starts out great, with promises that are quickly shown to be false. the training was extremely poor and borderline non-existent. They had computerized training, which does very little for actual experience. My first day on the job, they ""threw me to the wolves."" As I was alone for most of the shift. Honestly, the best part about the job was the extremely positive coworkers, they made the days bearable, and much easier to get through. A typical day is very hard to pin-point, as the tasks changed drastically day by day."
bad,"Zero benefits offered. "
bad,"Management is horrible.The few good managers never last long. You're asked to do things that are against company policy, you get treated like dirt and guilt tripped when you report an injury, lazy coworkers who never get taken care of, complaints about coworkers who say highly inappropriate things are never reprimanded. Pay is lousy. How they treat people is horrible. If you're not a cashier, you're most likely working on your own in a busy department with no help and then get yelled at because things aren't done."
bad,"A typical day at the job is full of Drama. I learned how to keep my cool over the phone with abusive customers. Management wasn't the best, just due to the fact that they had promised pay raises, and advances and didn't supply to all of the promises, I wasn't the only employee that experienced this, many employees fell victim, and ended up moving on to better promising opportunities. Co-workers were good for the most part, there is a MAJOR churn or turn over rate, lots of drama among the co-workers and lots of trash talked about the customers go on in the work area. Hardest part of the job was to deal with the abusive irate customers who call because of the fraud going on. Lots of fraud here! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and getting their needs met."
bad,I liked my customers and got to know some of them. I enjoyed my coworkers but the way it was run needs to be revised. The hardest part of the job is being under staffed. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers.
bad,"I worked for Walmart for 4 years. I quickly progressed from temporary Cashier to permaent part-time, then to layaway associate, assisting other departments as well, and then to Customer Service Manager. As a CSM I was totally abused within the store and overworked to the bone. They had us running a skeleton crew of front-end staffing most of the time but complained when customers were upset about lines or business of the store while not hiring enough staff to ensure proper staffing for the front end. On top of this, they constantly ""borrowed"" our front-end staff for other departments as the whole store was completely understaffed- leaving us even less covered. There were several times as well I was asked to manage or supervise other departments as well as my own, and be the sole supervisor on the front-end."
bad,Walmart cares more about their company more than their employees. It didn't matter if you had a doctors note if you were sick they could still fire you. They wanted to overwork everyone and tried to push everyone to work faster every 5 minutes. I did not like the managers or how they didn't do much working.
bad,We were a collections agency and honestly I did know how legit they were with there company and was just not for me I didn't feel like I can get people to pay there bills.
bad,"I loathed working at my store, and so did everyone else that worked there. Management was horrible, and most of my co-workers were extraordinarily rude and lazy. The hardest part of the job was keeping it. The most enjoyable part of the job was... I made a few friendships that stuck after I left."
bad,A typical day at work is attending my customers and processing many transactions a day and ensuring my customers found everything they were looking for. I learned that management in Walmart only care about themselves and not the associates or customers. My co-workers were awesome to work with. The hardest part of the job was not feeling appreciated by all my hard work and efforts. The most enjoyable part of my job were getting to know many people on a daily basis of all parts of the world and building a good connection with them.
bad,Boring job that always played favorites. Management is lazy and the work is repetitive. Management is  very rude to customers. Would not recommend working here.
bad,Would be a fun place to work if employees were paid comparable to the amount of work performed. Very expensive healthcare with very low wages. Company making billions while employees can barely survive.
bad,"Walmart is a great restart or starter job, however i did not see any long term career paths availble for me there. i sought other career paths to allow for growth."
bad,"a typical day at work is stressful the management is unfair,disrespectful and they don't care about you or anything about you"
bad,"There are ZERO chances of females moving up.  After 3 years I discovered Walgreens and gave that company a try and shortly after I went back to college to earn a degree.  I knew this is what I had to do if I wanted a ""CAREER"" and not a J.O.B"
bad,Just wait your turn to get fired.  If the place was half as good as they told us it was it would still be twice as good as it really is.
bad,Very little management. they want you to stay at least one hour after you shift. It is hard to close down a  line at the end of the day. NIGHTMARE
bad,Managers get annoyed when asking for help. Would not work around school schedule. Managers were rude in front of elderly customers when they asked for help to take groceries to car. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL MANAGEMENT.
bad,A typical day of work is filled with me helping customers which I love I just don't like working for a major corporation. I didn't like management as they were condescending. The hardest part is one manger tells you one thing and another tells you something else
bad,"working here was like being a personal slave. "
bad,I found out i have a medical condition when i started working here and now have back problems because they put sooo much work on the overnight stock workers. They don't care if you get hurt or need time off for medical;they will let you go even if under staffed. You wont get benifits until you have been here for a year even if full time. I learned that walmart is a great place to work if you just need something short term but not long. Hardest part about this job is all the heavy lifting and the strain it puts on your body.
bad,I loved my time there I had a very good time learning about all of the different things around me.The workers around me were very respectful
bad,I feel that management at Walmart could use some work. I enjoyed my job but when you feel like you are not a part of the work team it becomes very difficult.
bad,Micro managed. On your feet all day except for short break. Management can talk down to you but when give it back to them oh no! Very one sided. They will Never take any accountability for injuries or accidents. They pay you ok so they think they own you. They like to remind you of that. 50% over turn rate. It could be so much better. No career here.
bad,"Processed sales and payments."
bad,Everton the the manager had no expirance there for did not know how to cowardice employees. The hours became so confusing that many associates quit due to his pour attitude and failure to provide a good work place.
bad,"Training was very poor and short which hinders someone from doing their job well and without a lot of questions."
bad,"unusual practices showing partiality of men and women, unprofessional management not well spoken.right location but more for the customers than the employees"
bad,"Moved to a new town so I had to find a job fast to rake in some money. I was hired at the local Walmart as a part time cashier. I wasn't aware it was part time until they interviewed me. The interview took awhile. You interview with two different people. They ask you the normal long annoying questions but don't write anything down. They take you into the personnel room to interview, with employees coming and going so the whole interview process is very unprofessional and uncomfortable. After I had the two interviews they sent me home and said we will call you. Got the call the next day and they wanted me to come in for the job offer with the co manager. She told me about the pay (horrible pay, only $9.40 an hour), and gave me the drug test paperwork. You have to buy a blue or white polo, they don't provide uniforms, they only give you a name tag and a really hot vest that's uncomfortable. Orientation and your CBLs (computer based learning) take about a week then you get sent to shadow. If you're good they will just throw you out there and have you start cashiering. It's easy for sure, it just takes some getting use to when a customer with WIC or something comes. You'll be an expert after a week on your own. I have been there for 5 months, got bumped up to full time, and I absolutely hate it. Being a cashier is so tedious and boring. Grab, scan, bag. Grab, scan, bag. ALL DAY, for LITTLE PAY! It will get incredibly busy and there will be like 4 lanes open with 50 people in line. They call a code 20 (for register trained workers to come help) but half the time they don't. I wanted"
bad,Hours and working days randomly without notice. barely get raises let alone bonuses. doesn't train well if at all. and will always be expected do more than what is required for at least two workers. with no appreciation. if you don't out do your self every day they will find reasons to fire you. management is uncooperative
bad,"Wal-mart is a hard place to work but you get a good experience from that hard working."
bad,"This is a terrible company for which to work. Pay is abysmal, management is incompetent and overbearing, working here is a general depressing nightmare."
bad,"Every manager is out for themselves.  If a report is made regarding inappropriate behavior, it is swept under the rug and dismissed.  There is a set corporate schedule, but no one follows it which means to get ahead as an assistant manager, you have to be old or single with no family life.  They are not a family oriented company- they  are only worried about how much time you can put in."
bad,No respect for the individual. Retaliation is the norm from the Store Managers. Constantly in fear of losing your job. You're flat out told that you are expected to sacrifice your family life to keep your job and if you want to keep any hope of moving up.
bad,"Working for Walmart is like going to the Dentist, you don't want to do it but you have to. Walmart has a horrible job culture and so much micro-management it's hard to actually do your job. They treat their work force horribly and provide barely a livable wage with passable benefits, and I only say that because it's better than nothing. The worst part about working for Walmart would have to be that the higher up you go in the store hierarchy, the more incompetence is reveled."
bad,Walmart is not a good company to work for.  The company only cares about its bottom line.  To make profit it will cut employee hours and tell you that you cannot work any overtime.  The company doesn't care about its customers as you can tell by the long lines at the registers.  There aren't enough cashiers to keep the lines moving.  There is very little advancement at Walmart.  The pay raises instituted this year have led to disgruntled employees and less time to work than before.  For someone making $9 they cannot afford to provide for their family and pay for the benefits that the company offers its full time employees.  I don't recommend that anyone work for Walmart unless there is no other choice.
bad,"To greet patience and to help them with any health concerns, the management is horrible they talk to you any kind of way as if you are a child and not a working adult that can understand, they also have they picks which is unfair and feel that everyone should be treated equal no matter what. The job was super easy and great to work because you get to make different people and learn new things everyday"
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job was to, see my co-workers everyday and to work with them was a huge reward that was a great team I also liked to make the customers happy. I hope to find a team like this with my next job."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart does not exist; its is an ever-changing environment.  Change, albeit constant change, would best describe this environment, and it perhaps is not for everyone.  "
bad,no appreciation for hard work. only mistreatment for not getting more done. This company keeps its employees in a state of welfare. the cost for low is left for the employees to absorb. if there is an accident in the store the staff pays for it through their bonus. home office does not pay the claims. one Christmas season my store had its best year but because of customer claims we got a $66 bonus.
bad,Management plays favorite and doesn't think logical.  Tries to run more than what they are staffed for.  They over work their employees and expect everyone to be perfect.
bad,"Working at Walmart, Just make one thing sure.....NO TRAINING will be provided. You will be working in other departments more than you will work in your own Department. Very Very unethical."
bad,"Most of the management needs to be gutted. They are by no means lazy, but they are terrible managers. They are uncooperative when someone wants to change their availability. One tries to work 2 jobs, but Walmart managers will throw in an early morning shift, or an evening shift just for the heck of it. I hate this location."
bad,"the management does not care about the employees, Its all about numbers instead of how the job is done. Its all about the appearance instead of quality. The only thing I enjoyed about working for Walmart is the employees I worked with, all of my coworkers are good people and don't deserve to be treated like dirt. Walmart could really use some changes so the employees can enjoy their jobs."
bad,"If you dont obey blindly the store manager, he will cause you problems. The pay is ok, hours are ok. Decent customer base."
bad,"I was constantly overworked and harassed by management. I enjoyed working with customers; however, I did not enjoy the feeling of being berated every time I had a question to ask my manager. My fellow coworkers were fantastic. I really enjoyed feeling like I was part of a team."
bad,"a typical day at Walmart started with, clocking in and going straight to the back room to set up for truck unloading. once the preparation was done we tasked in to the truck and began working in the non air-conditioned backroom. once the truck/trucks were done we went on to other tasks such as: picking, binning, running merchandise out to the floor, stocking, sorting break-packs, doing claims, and other various tasks. i learned that Walmart treats their employees like garbage. management took advantage of us and never gave anyone any kind of opportunity to advance to different areas. most of my co-workers were easy to get along with save for the few rgar treated me like absolute garbage. the hardest part of my job was unloading merchandise in the scorching heat of the back room. the most enjoyable part of the job was earning money."
bad,the only nice thing about working for wal mart is the 10 percent discount. customers can often be hostile and abusive and so can the management. pay is not even enough to survive on
bad,not a good place to work . all hours and no brakes. not a clean place to word . poeple are mean and no one get a long with each other
bad,"Wasn't there long enough, but had problems taking time off because others never showed up and then when over time was available all the managers buddies got it."
bad,"Your co-workers (associates) will help you out and become friends. However, management doesn't seem to know what is going on, and will often blame those under them for common workplace problems."
bad,"Started day cleaning meat or produce compartment. Stocked whole department, Checked for bad fruit.Zoned department. Prepared backroom for tomorrow's truck"
bad,this is not a place to build a career. from my experience they advance people based on if you know the manager well. its an ok job if you need the money. you will gain little to no skills. when you learn a skills you will be the one to perform those tasks with no extra compensation. they are flexible with the schedule except during holidays or the whole Christmas season starting in October. their staff is less than adequate on more than one occasion i have met employees who don't have a GED or a high school diploma.
bad,"The managers are untrained. The employees are rude. The policies go out of the way to make it harder to work. You won't get paid a fair wage for the work you do. You won't get any medical benefits for at least a year, and even if they do give them to you, they are to expensive for your low salary. The only positive thing I can think of for this place is that no matter how little work experience you have or if you have any disabilities that make work difficult elsewhere, they are too desperate for employees to turn anyone down, though when they do hire you, they use psychological torture over incentive to keep you working there by threatening to write you up, even if you have to leave during emergencies, or by telling you that walmart is the best you will ever do in life."
bad,Very rude supervisor. Never wanted to listen to employees always over worked not enough employees and management hard to find
bad,The workplace that Walmart creates is horrible. Employees and customers are constantly unhappy with service or management and division of labor is horrible.
bad,Large amount of work to do in a short period of time. Expecting to fit in online training during business hours. Management always watching. Not an enjoyable working environment. Co-workers not helpful at all. Did not seem to be a team environment. Was instructed to ask for help if needed then got reprimanded for doing so.
bad,"The management team just seemed to order us around with no sense of anything making sense. Many times they asked us to do things that made the job more difficult or without customer consideration. Like every other job I have worked. The management seemed to be handpicked from the moron gene pool. When my daughter was born I asked for certain times off so I could be home with her. The manager responded with a J.F.K, esk speech. It isn't what Walmart can do for you, but what you can do for Walmart."
bad,"There were too many managers; paid too much to do nothing. At the same time, across multiple departments, the staffing levels for the lower level employees were beneath the number recommended by corporate. This led to high turnover, illness, etc. Obviously, management does not care about high turnover, and it's not suprising in an environment where many started from high school and that having a GED is actually considered an accomplishment."
bad,"They only care about bodies in their stores not the welfare of the associate and to be frank they do not care about the customers only the money being made. They have some of the worst employer practices ie management will not respond to calls, they will cut hours leaving employees to cover multiple areas/sections of store, they will fire anyone discussing unionization and wage is not based on experience or performance"
bad,"typical work day "
bad,Overnights zone shelves stocking unloading cashiering training assisting with other associates training in the beauty area
bad,"They barely give you any training, their benefits are the worst than any job I've ever had or have ever heard of, if the customers aren't making your job miserable for things you can't help then the supervisors and managers are treating you horribly.  I remember one day when I had only had 1 day of 'training', they threw me on the cash register.  There was no one in sight I could have asked if I needed help.  A customer got furious with me because I didn't know how to do a certain thing and I had to go hunt down a manager (which are the only people you're suppose to ask for help from) and got talked to and treated like I was bothering them and wasting their time.  To them, I wasn't a part of anything.  I was 100% replaceable."
bad,I work at walmart and was given task to do and a time limited and i did it under the time limit and i climbed up the later fast to be a supervisor.
bad,It was a good learning experience because i got to interact with people and I learned how to deal with people in difficult situations.
bad,"the hours were unreasonable, and the manigment slacked on its duty i would normaly have an hour wait to recieve change  for my drawer, and the manigment especial the personell office made you feel uncomfortable and unwelcom when approached for information."
bad,High overturn and managers who refused to do their job made this workplace a living nightmare. Constant schedule changes behind your back. Working 3-4 departments at once due to lack of people. Managers getting angry when you can't work outside your availability.
bad,i loved my job and my co-workers the management was poor and lacked comunication skills. more people wanting to play boss instead of being and working as team players.
bad,"I felt as if I didn not have a good, supportive, management team to help train and support me in the tasks at hand, and was made to do multiple peoples job, without proper trainning."
bad,My job was great and I did the best of my ability each and everyday.its a great place to work people are kind and great to work with Manager are not the best people to get alone with.
bad,"everyone works there because they need to not because they want to."
bad,On a regular day working at Walmart you get to check out peoples items and you sometimes get to have nice conversations with the customers. I have learned how to use the machines efficiently. Some of the managers do well but a lot of the times when you need them they take a very long time to get to you and help you with what you need or what customer needs. the co-workers are also okay some are very talkative and others seem very drained. the hardest part of the job is standing for long hours at a time and the day seems to go by super slow. the most enjoyable part is being able to talk with different people on a day to day basis.
bad,"This was a great store to work in, with excellent people.  This store is a tough store needs experienced management which it did not have.  Market manager kept putting trainees in the store and that would cause good people to not make it and leave the company."
bad,"They work you like a dog, management is horrible in the Williamsburg store. The more you do the more they will push you to do more. They lie to you all the time, if it was not for the co-workers it would have been terrible. Now they are hiring new people at $9.00 an hour and when your yearly review comes due they come up with bogus comments and rate you poorly so they do not have to give you a raise. I was dinged for two things my department manager is supposed to handle and because I joke with my assistant manager.All the negative comments you have heard from ex employees are true."
bad,Had good friends work was changeling but worth it management some times did not know what to do and made bad choices i learnd how to check merchandise and how to stock
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of unloading a truck, Taking merchandise out to floor, And doing picks. I learned how to use a pallet jack and how to stack boxes."
bad,"This company used to take care of their employees till the founder passed away, after that they only cared about how much money they make with the least amount of people."
bad,very poor upper management and horrible hours and pay will never work for a  wal-mart again would  work you just enough so you werent above part time so you couldnt get benefits and stuff
bad,"Não trabalharia novamente e nem indicaria para ninguém,empresa não cumpre com sua missão e proposito."
bad,"The managerial staff failed to communicate with the other employees about what they wanted to have accomplished, they also failed to communicate with one another about the work that had already been completed during the shift changes. They never read any feedback the employees gave them and they blamed the lower level employees for their own incompetence."
bad,"Walmart in New Milford is highly unorganized. If you get sick or hurt there, your doctors note will go into the trash. The managers play favorites and if you aren't one, they will make your work day miserable."
bad,horrible experience the managers would blame everything on their employee's so they wouldn't get into trouble the work was simple yet they would make mistakes and everyone else would pay for it
bad,Worked 6 days a week for up to 16 hours a day.Great day but you have no life at all.Always short handed and had to bring in temps that didnt help.
bad,management is unorganized. its good if your in or fresh out of high school. you cant make a living off of a $1000 a month with out any help.
bad,"I really didn't like working here, the employees were sweet, however, management refused to help you grow.If you were great in one area they were going to stick you there by yourself everyday. If you had a day off nothing would get touched until you got back. Just was not the right kind of job."
bad,When I work at Wal-Mart there was several managers telling you to do something different.  It is very hard to advance and they will work you overtime and it is unorganized especially the management.
bad,hated the job it was awe full  pay was awe full they didnt care if they nothing was good about the job it wass jst aweful you have no life if you work at walamrt no life only work
bad,"Péssima Fui traído passei da experiência no C.D do Wall Mart no Embu das Artes com um mês de efetivação eu e meus colegas que tinha acabado também de ser efetivos fomos mandado embora se ter feito nada. Simplesmente disseram que estava tendo corte por falta de vendas etc, Só mentirinhas que o povo conta... Enfim não recomendo por ter supervisores,gerentes,encarregados falsos,sem caráter e colegas de trabalho igualmente!"
bad,"Co-workers and department managers were all very good. Understanding to the needs and hardships of the job."
bad,"They say that when you are hired at Wal-Mart it becomes like a family and each employee can make a difference by making suggestions, and that there is always room for advancement. Maybe it is just this specific town I am living in, but I have not seen those promises to be true. "
bad,"This job wasn't really as good as I had thought it was to be. Management wasn't very good at all, too many employees stole, lied, and dishonored the code of working at Wal-Mart. I was treated unfair and I was cursed out multiple times. Working here didn't really help me any but to work in a timely manner and organize correctly."
bad,A typical day at work can never predicated simply because orders giving throughout the days aren't properly thought out with everything thing else that goes on in the store.
bad,"WalMart was a terrible employer. Managers were very unprofessional. There was absolutely no way to advance unless you ""knew"" people. I loved the  people that I worked with. They were in the same position that I was in so we all could relate to each other. I learned that I do not want to work in retail as a career. I do want to help people & I am a  quick learner. I am very loyal, dependable, courteous and friendly. I am also a great team player & work well with others. I would love to help patients, for I know what it is like to be in a hospital setting. My mother has been ill practically  my whole life even being on a ventilator twice in my 24 years of life. I have seen what transporters have to do & I believe that I would be a very good one. I am also a very gentle person. Thank you for giving me the  opportunity to apply for the position!"
bad,"it was very hard to work when you had to watch over your shoulder."
bad,Southridge Wal-Mart is operated by poor management who run the store with a skeleton crew.  Management belittles their employees and treats them as inferior.  Management will not listen to any employee concerns or ideas.  Management blames employees for poor store evaluations.
bad,Wal-Mart do not pay there employees well. Wal-Mart management doe not manage well because they play favoritism. I wish Wal-Mart would pay 13 dollars or more.
bad,"Wal-mart fails to understand they need staff to run the store to increase sales.  I frequently work alone in the deli.  Turnover is VERY fast due to poor treatment of employees, and demanding too much work for 1 person to complete.  Due to the customer intensity and lack of coworkers there are times when breaks get delayed.  It is one of the worst jobs in the store due to how demanding management is and no help."
bad,They promote out of favoritism. Skilled capable people fall by the wayside as degenerates with friendships get promoted. This ultimately leads to an unfair work environment and a poorly run store.
bad,Oppressive work conditions and environment. Dissatisfied with current and future opportunities for advancement. I see no future for me with this company.
bad,Management changed with the wind. I never knew who to contact with any questions or concerns.  The management team was most inconsistent.
bad,Not a good employer. There was too many people coming and going and none had any proper training. Employees were no.t treated fairly by management
bad,No room for advancement. The people that work here are people that do the least amount of work. Nobody cares about anything.
bad,It was a very fun workplace. i loved my co workers i had. it was a great place to work. they just liked to make you choose between your family and job. and i wasnt havent it that way.
bad,"Pay and Benefits are awful"
bad,"Walmart is a very boring place to work, with most rude employees and customers. The management doesn't care about you or your family, all their worried about is them self's. The most enjoyable part of my job was zoning my area."
bad,"At Wal-Mart you're just another number and they basically have no problem with letting you know that. Wal-Mart knows that they can replace you just as fast as they hired you,"
bad,Management is all over the place and once a new rule is implemented it is changed again. They do train you pretty well on how to do your job. They are not willing to work with you if you are a single mom on scheduling and things like that.
bad,"There was nothing I learned except how to be a Cashier and the one that trained me was not friendly.     The person that was head of cashiers did not know how to schedule people.   You could go in one day  thinking that you are suppose to be there and u were not suppose to be there."
bad,Not a good place to work.... No motivation from management for handwork... very poor salary....  unrealistic expectations.... hours cut off...
bad,Nothing is ever good enough for management. The company tries to make sure they fire all associates before each persons year is up. Not a pleasant work environment.
bad,test temperatures and clean then cook and cut meat and cheese then sanitize the cutters and sweep then do dishes and take stock of what all we had..
bad,"I got along with co workers for the most part but management was awful!!! They were just rude as can be and didn't care about anyone's well being. There was maybe one manager I liked. I was seasonal and they let me go at the beginning of January, then three weeks later, they called me asking if I would want to come back to work for them. No thank you. I would not recommend working at Wal-Mart in Jasper, AL unless it is the last option. If you work 8 hours, you are supposed to get 2 breaks and an hour lunch. I didn't get one of my breaks and I asked my manager about it and she said ""We don't have to give you your breaks."" They do. I'd like to see what our store manager has to say about that."
bad,they dont treat all there associates fairly  they have there picks and and some of they policys on that let some get away with .the most enjoyable part of the day was to help the customer.... managment needs to leard how to treat there associates
bad,"Little to no opportunity for advancement, insufficient training, and lack of managerial guidance. Mangers are rude and take advantage of associates."
bad,"You basically clock in, see your available ZMS or assistant manger so they can tell you your task for the day or you can go scan your badge under a price checker and it will guide you. Your day will basically consist of stocking the store, or zoning, Facing the areas given to you. Management sucks. Rude, does not know how to talk to employees. Coworkers DRAMA, everyone hates their job at Walmart all every one do is sit and complain about how they should if called out. The hardest part of the job is everything. he most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out. I forgot to mention everyone their kiss booty just to advance in the job."
bad,It is a horrible place to work. They don't have enough people in any of the departments. Managers could care less about how difficult it is to get your department in the right order with only 2 people in the department and a truck piled on top of everything else they want you to do.
bad,Cashier co-workers always left me by myself on register being left alone all the time to deal with customers getting a paycheck
bad,Inconvenient work hours.  Rude and ignorant customers. Management has no respect for their employees. Not a great place to work.
bad,"-A typical day is hectic, pressuring "
bad,"Swing shift is the only day time schedule. Managers have been known to change this without notifying you despite it ""being against store policy""."
bad,Pay was really low almost not even minimum wage I have a family to take care of and need a better income.....Customers treated you like you had no education no morals. my co-workers were very rude not only to other employees but to customers as well.....there weren't hard parts of the job.......the most enjoyable part was the friendly customers and the children.....
bad,"Never know what I will walk into when I get to work, overnight deliveries everywhere.  Overnight staff does only minimal work no accountability.  Leaves deliveries for morning staff no discipline for not putting deliveries in cooler. Walmart is the worst job I have ever had.  Management team petty and unprofessional, plays favorites. Retaliates against those who try to make things better by reporting what is wrong and possible ways to make things better for customers and associates.  Never feel valued, never given credit for spontaneous efforts to improve conditions in dept.  It seems the #1 objective is to lower associates self esteem.  The hardest part of the job management, I truly don't believe they have had any training or are versed in dealing with human beings.  It's rare to see associates smile.  The pay is not equal to what you are MADE to do. "
bad,"Work life balance, job security and advancement is terrible here. I do not recommend being a pharmacist at Wal-Mart. Management tends to work against you than with you.  They expect so much while giving so little, in terms of a supporting staff.  You're expected to be available for them 24 hours a day without being paid that way."
bad,"I would help the Customers checkout fast, clean, and friendly. Also when I didn't have Customers I would Redline meaning I would look for misplaced merchandise in remove it. Also I would clean down my register."
bad,place to work before finding something better it is a place to start in order to get the experience for when you want to go further in your carreer
bad,"The first store I worked at was reduced to about half capacity a month after we opened, but the managers were at least willing to work with the remaining associates and understood that there simply wasn't any way to get everything done. We still worked harder than normal, but it was at least tolerable. The second store, however, was a hellish nightmare. My department bleed nearly all its workers in the span of a few months until there were two people to do the work of five. Management would routinely pull one of us to work different departments, but laughed in our faces when we requested help ourselves. Every suggestion made to management could be summed up as ""in one ear and out the other"". All of the upper management (who seemed to outnumber the actual floor associates by two-to-one) blindly followed whatever edict came down from the top, no matter how backwards or nonsensical it was. The only good thing I can say is that working there allowed me to learn multiple skills that I am eager to put to use at better companies. Having left their company, I have vowed to never buy a single product of theirs until they pull a complete 180 turn around, if such a thing is possible."
bad,"Treat you like garbage, under pay associates, get rid of you over $100! coachings arent uncommon. They hire underqualified candidates purposely."
bad,"No comment, I cannot say any more about this company."
bad,Wal-Mart is probably one of the worst places to work at. I felt very under appreciated and they expected more from me everyday. One time I was sick with a fever of 101 and they still made me come in to work cause they said it was to late to call in!! Like dude I'm sick how is It to late to be sick!!! And then when a district manager comes to check out the store they make you do everything all at once. Like c'mon! If y'all made us do this stuff on a daily basis then y'all wouldn't have to scramble like this when the district manager comes. And the management there is terrible. They don't treat there associates like human beings more like robots. And the managers are so rude at times. I'm putting in my two weeks.
bad,They do not pay enough for the amount of stress each employee has to endure. Management did not know what to do or what needed to be done most of the time. They were clueless and not well trained.
bad,"No training in walmart, I was a baker, working the warehouse, deli and floor."
bad,"If you want to have a stressful job, then this is a good job for you."
bad,"There is no typical work day. We are given routines to follow, but major under staffing has lead to every day being subject to change. This makes it extremely difficult to manage an area when you are not allowed to work in it everyday. I have learned to make a plan for work each day and that some times it needs to change. Management is bad because they are not given the chance to be managers. The co-workers are a great set of people. Co-workers do there best to help out others. The hardest part of the job is not being able to do your own job because of an under staffing issue."
bad,"Enter and audit deliveries made to the store"
bad,"I literally hated waking up everyday and going to this job. Management is incompetent and horrible, advancement is not likely, and even if you are qualified they will give it to one of their friends. Pay is absolutely horrific. Even though I had 4 years of experience and am bilingual in Spanish, they started my pay off as the same rate they gave a young kid fresh out of high school with no work experience. Management does not listen to your concerns, and often times I was not given the resources I needed to do my job well. Also customers are horrible to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,I was dissatisfied with managers and supervisors when i needed help or had important questions. I did not feel important or needed as an employee.
bad,"Every member of Management complains on a daily basis about work not getting done the way they expected even though it is their own fault for not enforcing rules and expectations they set when they conducted interviews, job offers, and orientations."
bad,"typical day was being yelled at to move faster."
bad,"It was pretty much retail like any other, but Wal-Mart really felt like the definition of a soulless corporation.  I'm honest and old enough to know better than to sugar coat a company that's more willing to write a mother up for having to leave work early than to let her go take her child to the emergency room.  I've seen it happen, and it was just sad."
bad,I enjoyed up lifting my fellow associates to help them succeed and learn the proper skills need to complete task at Wal-mart.
bad,"picking merchandise nightly for each department in store"
bad,"work with customers and money. learn how to maanage and multi-task. must have good attitudes towards customers, show them you care and apprectiate them for shopping with Wal-Mart"
bad,"Associate level to promoted as Department Manager."
bad,"Maintained the building, made out crew work schedules, ordered products, trained new employees, stripped/waxed, assisted outside contractors when needed."
bad,I have worked at Walmart in different positions and have been told I was going to advance many times and received a college degree after many of these times that i was allegedly going to advance. I spent years there and nothing ever happened. I worked extra at nights when they asked and holidays. I needed surgery and missed 2 weeks then came back and worked 3 days hen told to go home and not come back till i had papers releasing me. I then did that and they wouldn't let me back. Walmart is a huge company and some stores are not as bad as mine I am sure and some are probably worse but there is no loyalty in this company just remember that when you get hired. If you go into the job knowing that then its an okay job till you find a real job.
bad,A terrible place to work. Customers and managers are rude and don't respect workers as humans. Asked to do multiply jobs that weren't on the job description. Also poor management skills very unprofessional no morals or standards for performance. Would never advise anyone to work there ever. Unless you like jobs that are terrible. I learned that I never want to work hard for people that don't deserve my respect at all. There were no enjoyable parts of the job. Not benefits in return for hard working employees but the door if you've been there for too long or even take a little extra time to sit because you were standing on the register for 4 hours without a break.
bad,"I am a student, I started working at Walmart to try and make money for living when the year finished. They were not accomidating at all with the hours I needed, they gave me to many hours and I have been over worked to the point im so stressed out I cant even function properly."
bad,I cried going into work many time I got harassed by co-worker and management did nothing. I was told I should not go to school to become a pharmacist.
bad,"They treat you worst than slaves. The managers will tell you that you are just a number to them. If you don't make production, even if it isn't your fault, you still are held accountable. If you get hurt on the job, they write you up because you should of been aware of your surroundings."
bad,Awful company that clearly could care less about it's lower level employees.
bad,a company this big cant pay there employees much more than mimum wage
bad,"Negative Reinforcement for job performance, and open Christmas Day..."
bad,"Everybody is always arguing"
bad,Management is not understanding; pay does not compensate for time and energy put into the work; co-workers are sometimes lazy and unhelpful. No benefits.
bad,"Simple, who wants to work for a company that selectively enforces it's own Harassment Policies?"
bad,"I have faxed letters to your ceo and contacted your ethics hotline conplaint#WMT 14101013 but received no help. I was bullied and abused by your manager Linda and co workers Paige and Shereen. I told my managers Sherry and Melissa who did nothing about it. Then I was wrongfully terminated Oct 8 at 11pm and I had to take a cab home (as the buses had quit running) which cost $28.74. According to Sherry (manager at store#3160) she and Deanne another manager had discussed terminating me between 7-9am in their meeting ;yet they didnt call me to let me come in earlier to have this discussion or let me know about it till 11pm. When I brought up my concern to Sherry the manager she says to me "" well we dont know how our employees get to work""?. Its bad enougy that Deanne and the management team allowed me to be bullied on the job and did nothing about it. Then did not give me proper training and so they held it against me when acording to them I was not able to do the job properly. But this is the straw that broke the proverbial camels back. To make an employee come all the way to work on the bus at 11pm when it was unnecessary, cause they knew all day long that I was gonna be fired."
bad,"If you can go not working at Walmart, then do so. Employees are treated horribly as well as not paid fairly. Unless you absolutely cannot get a job anywhere else and are completely broke I would suggest avoid working at Walmart at all means necessary."
bad,"Aprendi sobre rotinas de estoque, como ele funciona e como lidar com outras pessoas,"
bad,learned a lot about electronics that I didn't know.  Met a lot of interesting people
bad,I was not employed with the company very long to gain very much knowledge about it. I would normally check customers out at the end of their shopping experience or assist with directing them to find a product in an area of the store.
bad,stressful and depressing. A typical day was frustrating. I learned that people  can be mean and nasty. managers did not solve problems. co-workers treated you as if they were the boss. The hardest part of the day was being there. I enjoyed talking to the customers.
bad,I stocked shelves and ran the register most of the time. I learned how to count inventory and order what need to be ordered for my department. Management and co workers were good for the most part. I enjoyed the department I was in because it was the types of things I am interested in.
bad,"- it is horrible , not very friendly ..they are rude "
bad,"Awful company to work for and the management is just there to draw paycheck,"
bad,The job was not too bad to work at but the male workers do not have any type of respect towards women.
bad,"typically understaffed, poor time management when it came to breaks and lunches i can't tell you how many times my last break was given to me an hour before my shift ended. I felt upper management didn't care about personal needs i was pregnant while working there and i wasn't expecting special treatment but there were certain needs i had that they didn't compromise with. i did enjoy my co-workers though they were always pleasant as were my direct supervisors. i worked quiet a distance from where i lived (because i moved a couple months after starting) i tried transferring to a closer store had my transfer in for at least 2-3 months and nothing ever happened even though there were open positions in those stores. the store co-manager said he would call and try to push it but i think he was just trying to keep me happy because if he had actually called my transfer wouldn't have sat there for so long before i ended up quitting."
bad,"I've worked in three different stores and every time I have found my self unable to trust management. This is not a stable job for any one unless your high level manager. Even then it may not be. "
bad,"•	Provide friendly customer service"
bad,at first it was alright Brand new store and then it went to I leave you figure that out not a good experience after store manger left..Bad leadership and that's all I have to say good people bad leadership . they didn't get enough training for that store in the grocery side
bad,"Helping customers"
bad,"A typical day at work was getting on the line and sorting through boxes and placing the merchandise in the proper disposing area. I learned how to do a good job very quickly. Management and my co-workers were very professional and helpful. The hardest part of my job was the heat in the warehouse was at times unbearable. The most enjoyable part of my job was the hours, four 10 hour shifts Mon-Thurs."
bad,Company can't seem to make up there mind on Policies and Procedure's. The pressure upper management puts on local management then that management puts on lower associates does not make a happy or healthy work place.
bad,Amazing CEO and management. Great products and the bonus was good the benefits was amazing.
bad,"As a pharmacy manager for Wal-Mart what started out as promising turned into a NIGHTMARE!!  The district manager over pharmacists did not even have a college degree???  This person was responsible for numerous pharmacists simply leaving the company due to her hostile personality and lack of any pharmacy knowledge.  My name was forged by this lady, and nothing was done about this issue!!  When I spoke with one of the main HR guys for Wal-Mart he simply informed me that she failed to make notation that she was doing an evaluation on my behalf.  If you like or enjoy working in a corrupt environment then this would be the place for you.  If you are looking for ethics and accountability you will be working at the wrong place."
bad,"A typical day at walmart was ok, I learned how a retail business work. Management at wal-mart was the worst; you have to many people telling what to do and how to do. They try to use you as much as they can and when you speak up about they cut your hours. My co-workers where great and they where outstanding to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was when help out the customer and actually did my job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management"
bad,"Employess are nice to work with but managemnt are not experienced enough, rude and they dont give a chance to grow in the company and they dont appreciate the hard work."
bad,"Loved my job at Walmart, but the management needs to be revised, or all new management brought in to replace the ones that are there. Due to unfairness to employees. Learned a lot about accounting from my job there but no help from management. The coworkers that worked out on the floor where good hard workers and were treated unfairly, Having to deal with management. Going home at end of day and thinking I did a good days work when everything comes out good in the office and to know that I did my best everyday there but not knowing cause of no recognition from any member of management,"
bad,There is no team work. employees do what they want when they want. Production is poor. No customer servicee skills.
bad,"Built modes. place items on shelves, and price items. carry heavy loads from outside the store to in the store. Clean work area. I learned how to read a mode sheet everyday to build the mode. the co-workers were great we help every other. My boss was every understanding. the hardest part was asking questions but then I start to ask a lot of question about the mode sheet, but then once I ask I was able to see how the job could been done faster. I enjoyed learning a new skill and working with great people"
bad,"Walmart is not a good place to work. Its management does not value family and if you became ill, they would still want you to work. I hated working here and was stressed or upset everyday. Horrible business!"
bad,"Its walmart, the culture has gone to the tank. They have managers fresh out of collage who know nothing about retail. I would recommend staying away..."
bad,Overworked on minimum wage. Disrespectful management at times. No recognition of hard work. As a csm im on my feet running around sometimes without breaks even.
bad,"I love my job and the duties that come with it. New challenges and frustrations are presented daily and I've learned different ways to work through or around many different situations. My co-workers are very friendly, becoming ""family-like"" after working together for so long. Management would have a new direction or goal every day with little to no communication or follow through after initial instructions. I work mostly unsupervised, so this hasn't been a problem for me, but can cause frustrations for others."
bad,"Generally it isn't that bad. The customers are generally not terrible and the coworkers are generally actually nice people. Management is a lot better than other locations I've read about, but they have a bad time remember when you are or aren't available to work. The hours are atrocious, you could be working late one night and early the next morning. Also, their scheduling is pretty bad, one week you could be working almost 40 hours a week and the next you work around 10. They do give you 1.5 hour break, split into an hour and two 15 minutes breaks, if you work more than six hours. They do also pay pretty decently (I started out at $8.35/hour)."
bad,"Wal-Mart is the world's top retailer. Yet they do not compensate their associates accordingly. I performed perhaps the most difficult task in the store, and was barely paid above minimum wage. Also, if you want health insurance, you must pay for it yourself with a large portion (25%) of your paycheck."
bad,Ok I am a cashier in month two I must say this job is appaling. First management is horrible. They hate me because I go beyond my job for the customers. They count something called scans per minute. The average is 850 per hour. I am always getting yelled at because I am at 700 to 7 something.I am too busy giving good customer service. The customers like me they even tell me this. I have many repeat customers. Management is always throwing me under the bus even telling lies because I am the opposite of them. I have seen them lie to customers I have seen them ignore handicapable elderly customers. They put the cashiers especially me infront of the door as a door greeter constantly. When they see me enjoying my job they lie about me and make me feel bad. There is no training at all. I learned nine hours of how to spot and stop unions how to identify diseases and spills how to use a box cutter even ladder safety. But nothing to do with my actual job as a cashier. I learned from other cashiers and from a few mistakes on how to operate a cash register. I hate going into that place everyday now. I work most days from 2 pm to 11 pm or 1 pm to 10 pm. I never signed on to be there at 7 am to 3 pm somedays. Today they were pushing it. I came close to throwing my phone through the ice box breaking the window. I have had dreams lately of cursing them out then walking out. Tonight it was time for me to leave I was at speedy checkout I had three customers. I nicely and respectfully told them it was time for me to go home. This cashier that had been nice to me lately was at cashier nine. I
bad,"Stocking Shelves"
bad,"working in any department means you work anywhere in the store no questions asked. If your not doing something that drains away your optimism and hope, then your not doing your job right....."
bad,"Trying desperately to find anything outside of this company.  No incentive for progress or for even trying.  Ignorant to customer and employee needs.  Insensitive to employees who have suffered great loss.  Ignorant of safety concerns, even when brought to upper-management's attention.  Foul and lewd work environment."
bad,Very bad people to work for they miss treat emeoplees. Management only cares about thereselfs

bad,"This is just a job, a bare minimum job, period. Yes you can advance and quickly if you work hard, but beware when you advance you take on three times the responsibility for a raise of (if you're lucky) twenty cents. Basically your a minimum wage manager."
bad,"Cheap company that over work employees. Management is self righteous and act like they are working for the government in a 1,000,000 job. Nobody is happy here and you can see it when you look at any employee."
bad,very poor management  never stood by their employs never believes in their associates.  nthe newest thing now they are being timed  like there on a race track no quality of work being done besides trying to cut everybody to part time .  so they wont half to pay insurance.
bad,"Customer Service"
bad,"Im a college student with a flexible schedule and told them this. The worst mistake of my life. I worked part time but in this time they ran me ragged. Instead of constant rotation of stockers so you learn and addapt to changing environments they stick you in one part of the store and leave you. My area was animal, beverage. The two heaviest stocking. It got to the point where i was almost addicted to pain killers. The work environment sucks. Every employee hated there job. Pay was barely minimum wage. Working 32-39 hours a week i couldnt afford the cheapest of rents. Wouldnt reccoment this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"They intimidate, retaliate and discriminate!!    "
bad,"You will attain a hard work ethic. Fully responsible for the daily physical technical maintenance of both the wet lab and dry lab printers, equipment and five adjoining kiosks. "
bad,I worked there for 4 years as a cashier.  It was a terrible place to work and the management are extremely rude and egotistical. I wouldn't recommend working there to my worst enemy.
bad,Management didn't care if your shift was short handed. Everything was expected to be completed. Explaining that something couldn't be done was useless. They didn't care.
bad,"I have never felt so unimportant at a job in my life.  You feel like just another number, management was horrible, and the compensation was horrible as well.   I would advise people to not work there unless it was a last resort.  Sam Walton would be ashamed of how his company treats their employees."
bad,I worked everywhere that I was needed. I didn't like management and there policy's on how they had favorites.
bad,it was a nice place to learn new stuff.and working with nice people and custmors
bad,This job pays ok but the management is horrible! You only get the hours your promised during the busy season.Then its 4 hrs a day for 7 months.Revolving door.
bad,Registers acted up on a near hourly basis. Occasionally took 15+ minutes for a Customer Service Supervisor to key in the code in order to be able to continue scanning.
bad,my thing is team work and there is less here .I do my job well co worker talk to much. pay could be much better. the store it self is racist they only give promotion to there  kind only  which I feel is wrong . management team sucks  in every way when it come to confidentially all associate business is in the air. brad is terrible he is a manager and there very rude and don't live by there 10ft rule .hardest part is feeling like your working alone every day and not progressing to the next level cause of your skin color a lot of thing is unfair at this company they need a change a union would be the best start ...my enjoyable part is getting my job done like all ways and going home.
bad,"The management is selective on who they should advance to higher positions. If you are not close friends with management, they will not appreciate your work unless a customer informs them on your good work. Its stressful to get certain days off for personal reasons due to the lack of help they have."
bad,Over the past few years the company has turned away from the ideas of Sam Walton. When you cut back so much that you hurt the customer service and put the stress on the associates to try to keep up with the high demand. This is one quick way to turn people off.
bad,"management was anti-productive. Constantly changing schedules were commonplace. There was arbitrary rule enforcement, an ambiguous policy for attendance, and a co-manager who would goad employees."
bad,good working crew management was good n fair at night but one manager took his job to the head abusing his power even telling me he can fir me for no reason because he can and ill be calling him begging for my job back I guess it was true went to work n got terminated with no reason stated
bad,Very unsafe and un organized work area. Suffered an almost career ending injury working around wet pallets and still recovering from such injury. Management never around to answer questions when you needed them they did more time standing around talking than working I as a former manager I would never advise anyone to work for this company.
bad,muita pressão e poucos funcionarios para trabalha em conjunto e todos ficam sobrecarregados de trabalho onde gerentes tinha dia que tinha que virar 32 horas direta
bad,Its a very high drama place to work. Management doesn't know how to talk to their employees when assigning them tasks. All management does is yell.
bad,"I would go to work and attend the 10:00 meeting, then get my supplies ready to work. I would open the boxes, stock the shelfs and zone and do my returns. I learned have to zone a shelf nice. The management is good, if I have a issue all I  have to do is ask and my co- workers are hard workers, we work as a team. Their are no hard parts of my job. The most enjoyable part is being a good service to a customer in need."
bad,I did meet several nice people. Management is in a click. If not part of this click there is no advancement opportunity. Also found there is a problem with being sexually harassed as well as some racial comments. Was written up for taking my husband to cancer treatments. Manager plays favoritism game.
bad,Wal-mart does not look at your degree and they try to hold you back from your goals.
bad,"It was very nice at first.  I learned alot of things being a pharmacy cashier to begin with.  I loved the customers and loved helping them. The pharmacy was very busy all the time.  Management was not that supportive, as far as getting help with a line of 10 or more customers.  I think the district manager could have imported more help with getting customers checked out in an efficient and more timely manner.  When I went back to train as CPhT, I was thrilled at the help and support I received from my co workers and the manager at that time,  They taught me  so much and all were patient with me and encouraged me to see it through,  However, when the new pharmacy manager came, she instantly disliked me and others.  She is a poor manager, not caring about customers or anyone but her self and the ""rise to power"" , only cared about more power she could receive.  I know that I would stll be employed and progressing if it wasn't for her.  I miss my customers and co workers.  All in All I give it a 10+ BEFORE new management came.  Now, I would not recommend anyone to work there if you really CARE about customers and helping them, because that does not exist there anymore.     I would go back there in a heart beat if the new manager wasn't there anymore,.  The hardest part of the job for me was learning the insurance imput in computer.  THe most enjoyable part was helping and assisting the customers or just listening to them talk and letting them know that you really cared about their well-being."
bad,i enjoy the work i do. Very fast pace. friendly enviornment.
bad,An endless game of backstabbing and authority abuse including being asked to work off the clock.
bad,We were the only store that did not follow the rules of the store. The managers goofed off when they wanted to and yelled at us employees for slacking when were only doing what they were doing. The hardest part of the job was actually going because I always felt like if I go im wasting my time because they weren't really going to put us to work we were jst people they could point the figer at when things go wrong.
bad,Main responsibilities included checking customers' purchases and completing cash and credit transactions.  Organized isle and kept checkout center clean.  I assisted customers with items' locations throughout the store.
bad,"doing same thing over and over"
bad,When I was hired there was no more work that would come from the coworkers. Management did not help and after having a medical flare up and asked to be taken to the hospital they immediately fired me.
bad,"The job is very high paced, always on the move which is great.  Management does not work with it employees.  They do not take suggests at all, regardless if they have no ideal what they are doing.  Very stressful place to work in, with very low wages."
bad,Walmart is one of the worst places i have ever worked. Management was horrible and they get you to do things that are not in your job description
bad,When i show up for work everyone is at the break room. No one shows up on the floor for work until its been 15 minutes in. The workers are really slow and the managers yell at the workers which isn't right. Everyone gets there work done but a very slow place. What i learned at Walmart was how to stock isles and make a bail. The management was terrible they never knew what the employees where up too and they yelled at the employees. The hardest part of my job was when someone wasn't at work you and then taking there work and doing your work in the 8 hours you have. The only part of the job that was enjoyable was the discount.
bad,walmart is a nice place to work if you just graduated high school and have no kids. the chance of getting a raise isn't very good and advancement in the job comes after years and years of working for them
bad,A typical day as a cashier is basically a lot of repetitive ringing out of customers out who nit-pick and complain about every little thing. I've learned that you can't please everyone no matter how much you try. Management and co-workers are pleasant enough to ease some of the stress and frustration. The hardest part of the job is the boredom and angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the day is punching out at the end of your shift.
bad,"Hay rutinas elaboradas, pero nunca las concretas por estar ""tapando fuego"" o haciendo el trabajo de otros, casi nunca terminas tu día planeado porque no te permiten hacerlo. Aprendí la tolerancia a la frustación. La dirección o gerencia básicamente es nula, solo tiene el título pero no son líderes. Mis colegas muy variables como hay gente que vale la pena como hay muchos muy chismosos. La parte más difícil son los horarios, no tienes vida propia. Lo que más me gustó es que dan prestaciones"
bad,Scanned all merchandise and accepted payments. Helped out other departments
bad,"Wal-mart is by far the greedest company ive ever worked for bearly paid over minium wage to unload semi trailers by hand heavy back breaking work. Co-workers very cool very friendly, management was not good on how they ran things."
bad,Large matrix organization steamrolling over America one project at a time.
bad,The worst place to work ever. I was pregnant and the managers knew it and I was showing and they made me stock heavy items on the shelves instead of moving me to cashier. I reported sexual harassment 4X and never got any results. I had to hire a lawyer and sue.
bad,this place is one of the worst places I've worked for. The management is terrible. The have no respect for there employees or customers.
bad,"Oh, what to say about WM? "
bad,I hate it every since we got new management. They only care about the job and none of your personal life  or goals.
bad,"I was a cart pusher at the Wal-Mart in North East, MD. It was really just to pay the bills, and save enough to buy a ticket out of there, and it did that."
bad,"was an employee @ walmart for 5 weeks, worst job "
bad,"this place is terrible, you are a number and not treated as human being, the turn over rate is very high, pay is poorly I don't know how they expect any one on minimum wage to pay rent etc much less get money deducted from their pay check for company costly insurance.   I had to take two jobs to make ends meet because their pay is horrible for cashier or any worker starting off."
bad,"A career at Wal-Mart would be great for someone who has no children and no major bills to pay, they hire you as an temporary associate with hopes that they'll keep you. Work you like a hog, making minimum wage, not flexible with your schedule, doesn't do much acknowledgement of your hard work but will let you know when your not working to there standards even if your trying. Barely helps you if you need any help. Not for adult bills in the real world."
bad,"A typical day at work: Clock in, go to my department, be productive through out the day, and than clock out. Not much to tell really"
bad,Store just had/ has a big problem with management and some associates calling off work alot
bad,Management promotes friends not by skills and will lie to you daily. They cannot get organized so nothing gets accomplished
bad,I unloaded trucks and sorted merchandise; and did whatever else they needed to be done.
bad,Working for walmart you have to have a thick skin the customers are horrible and rude and the managers care nothing about you. The work environment is far from clean and you have to be ready to stand for long periods at a time. You will get written up for sitting among other things.
bad,"The company is a good company, but the store I work in is not managed well, and it appears as though the customer is not the #1 priority.  The work week that was set when hired has not been upheld and there is little positive motivation from the leadership up to and including the market manager.  The store asks the ASM's to work the job of everyone except what you were taught in the trainig program.  The blame is always set upon the ASM's; causing them to resort to working 55+ hours each week.  I believe that other stores are probably better, but have little to go off of."
bad,Worked there for a year but it was a up and down work place. they ask for so much so you dont get anything back .
bad,"I went in thinking this is great Walmart is for the employee as much as the customer... I was wrong, I rated the management at a 3 rather than a 1 because I believe most of them truly want to do whats right but company policies prevent them from doing so.  They pay so little that most employees have to supplement with government programs such as EBT and the management actually advises you to do so if you ask about raises."
bad,Not a good company to work for. They do not care about their employees.
bad,well i love my job i use to be all over the store learing something new everday
bad,"Worked nights."
bad,When I start at walmart in 2001 they was a great company to work for it stared getting bad down the years management was acting like they was always right and they did not care about you and your famliy..
bad,"Walmart does not care at all for their associates. Your just a mule to them. If your sick, or even your kids, you better be in a hospital bed dying, bc it will be unexcused not matter what. While I worked there we referred to them as the attendance police. I have had a lot of jobs in my life, Walmart was the lowest. Walmart doesnt care about its associates because they know there is always someone else looking for a job. We had one decent manager step down and quit because it made him sick how walmart treats there employs. Now I only shop at Target."
bad,Managed the Multi line phone for the store calls and helped the customers to get a fitting room to try on the cloths they wanted to wear. and processed the returns for all of soft lines.
bad,i hate this place...they take advantage of your work ethic and take advantage of you as a person and use you beyond your expectations
bad,"got to meet a lot of different people"
bad,"-Management turns a blind eye to associate complaints or concerns"
bad,"After a 19 hour (8pm-2pm) ""Christmas conversion"" night at work; I was completely over this company. Assistant managers get abused, especially when they're the overnight managers. Maybe things have changed, but I'd never go back to find out."
bad,I kept busy with assisting customers by running a register and working as  salesfloor associate. I learned alot i the area of customer service. I enjoyed alot of my coworkers that i worked with. The evening hours i worked was my least favorite part of my job but everything else was good.
bad,"I was trained very well. I learned how to use a lot of power lifting equipment, and good warehouse etiquette. I was extremely overworked, and extremely underpaid. Management always pressuring me, guilted me, or tricking me in to working harder than I already was. I worked full time(80+ hrs) and I couldn't afford to shop at the Walmart store i worked at."
bad,"Ok. This job is not for everybody... the pay is not enough for the work you have to do, the abuse you have to take from the calls."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a company that has values in place that are not enforced. Hourly associates are treated with disrespect by salary managers on a constant basis. Issues are never addressed. "
bad,Wal-Mart was not a very good company to work for. They don't care about their employees.
bad,there was no typical day every day had its own issues there would be at least three managers almost every night and all three would give you a different direction it made it difficult to know who to listen to at times. the co workers were always the best part of working at walmart. the hardest part of my job was doing my job cause management and the company it self didnt make it enjoyable your job was always on the line and management was always over your shoulder it just has gotton worse every year and i been there 9 years i wouldnt be surprised if the company ended up like kmart
bad,"IF you were not a favorite to the management, you didn't get anywhere in that job!"
bad,"My rating said it all. The only good thing about Walmart in the Carolina's is that you have enjoyable coworkers... Management except for 1... are slave drivers...if you have to work for this company you better work the 1st or 2nd shift that's the only way you will work you title, if you work overnight you have no real title except to be a slave to the man/women."
bad,"overworked"
bad,"A typical day at work was more of a do your job, then go home, never learn anything, or expand in the company type scenario. I learn quite a few things from working at Wal-Mart. I learned how to supervise, work with many customers on a daily basis in customer service, and as a cashier,and how to stand on my feet for long periods of time. I never had any issues with management they were primarily only seen when there was an issue with a customer. Co-works were fun and energetic and I had a blast working with them. The hardest part of the job was when there was a customer that I could not help and they would leave the store upset. I loved being able to enjoy helping customers and watching them walk out the door with a smile on their faces."
bad,It a fun place to work at I have learned cashing check  and money gram . The managers need to have better relationships with the employees lots of rom for improvement .The co-works a fun to work with .I enjoy meeting new people every day
bad,"Does not value any employee, strictly there to make more money"
bad,there is never enough employees so you are basically always working by yourself and management never wants to help
bad,Walmart is one of the worst places to work. I only stayed there so I can make money and I recently quit because I couldn't stand it there anymore. The management there treats their employees poorly and only care about them selves. There was nothing enjoyable about working there and there is no room for growth in the company as the managers pick and choose who their favorites are and give them first priority over anyone else who has seniority.
bad,Walmart in a nutshell was the most clicky environment I personally have ever worked at. The Assistant Managers were terrible to work with. They all had their favorite employees and if you were not in their group it was hard to survive working at Walmart. I recommend strongly to reconsider this company.
bad,A typical day at work would be me doing returns. What I learned was to be patient. Management is management. Some if my co-workers I loved working with. I had no hard part in doing my job. The enjoyed doing my job.
bad,"Worked Customer Service, Worked Claims, Worked Shipping and Receiving, Cashiering, also a dept manager. Dealt with a lot of customers on a daily basis that were usually upset (because I worked in Customer Service) so keeping a positive attitude was important. Co-Workers were awesome but not happy with the way the store was managed. I definitely enjoyed dealing with the people though. I met a lot of nice people coming through that store."
bad,Don't believe the commercials you see on television! You are only safe in this company if you're an hourly employee or the corporate office. Any other management positions in the field or stores is absolutely awful! Poor pay! Bad attitudes! No teamwork! Your job is never safe. Do yourself a favor and find another company to work for.
bad,"Nothing good to say about this company. "
bad,"that is all i can say. They constantly break company policy and rules. Forcing associates to do jobs that are wage levels higher than they are and not being compensated for it. And cutting hours for holiday pay, for example, if you are schedule for 40 hours and there is a holiday that week, they will cut one of those days so you will only get 32 regular hours and then the holiday pay to equal 40 in stead of 40 regular plus the holiday pay. Sad."
bad,"Management did not train new employees, such as myself, as they should have done, which caused confusion and uncomfortablility."
bad,"Typical day at work is very hectic with many tasks to accomplish. There are everyday tasks that must be completed on a daily basis as well as other notes and other tasks that are given throughout the day.   Cannot walk in with a game plan for that day because management will redirect you to yet other tasks. Many of my coworkers are team players and willing to assist when needed. The hardest part of my job is when one manager gives you a set of tasks that are of importance to them but then another manager comes along and gives you a whole other set of tasks that are important to them. In the end, it doesn't matter which task is important because they all must get done as they are all of equal importance.  The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely assisting, helping and interacting with the customers."
bad,"In my experience working at the Walmart in Golden Ring they had terrible management, unprofessional. They refuse to give hours and they lack enough employees working on the floor. The store didn't seem to have any sense of rules or how it should be run."
bad,This job was a summer job in between me being in school. I was a new associate and we were still short staff and I was asked to do the almost impossible because we were short staffed. The managers were very rude and demanded things that couldnt possibly be done by a new person. I was asked to work and used machines that I had no idea how to use.  The hardest part of the job was to stay awake because it was a 3rd shift job.
bad,"I worked at walmart for a year and a half just for a job to get through college.  I worked in the deli and had constant contact with customers.  This isn't a problem for me but there were an average of 3 people to make sandwiches, cut meat/cheese, clean, and run various cooking devices.  They also didn't respect the fact that I was trying to better myself with college because they knew my school schedule but still scheduled me at those times.  When I brought this to their attention they said work was more important."
bad,Will hire you for one department then demand you to help another. Proceeds to yell when your department doesn't get done after pulling everyone out to help elsewhere for most of the shift.
bad,"en un dia típico de trabajo,si no tienes clientes en tu área,te mueven de lugar y te ponen a apollar otra área."
bad,Though I did pick up some great skills. I would no recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"the most enjoyable day at walmart was on 4th of july,lots of excitement was dere and it was a great day."
bad, 
bad,"Great team work, but not enough employees."
bad,"Do not work here. No ownership taken, wrong management in charge. Place is a mess."
bad,"Rude, negative, disrespectful, hateful, condescending, egotistical, over-demanding managers that when something isn't going their way, they gather up all the employees and tell them that they, ""Aren't working hard enough or fast enough"", but never stop to tell the people that are kicking their butts that they're doing a good job."
bad,"And its all upper management's fault.  From the store manager up, the culture of Walmart is cancerous."
bad,"Daily task would be managing over 30 employees. That would include breaks, lunches, checkstands and balance there tills before the shift was over. Collect all the tills through the night and audit them. Also had everyone organize the store for the next day."
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be cashiering as my schedule say, but sometimes I get pulled to work in the Money Center or Customer Service. Working there I have learned a lot in those three area's. Management isn't all that great, many of them just have the title but not really doing the job requirements. I love my co-workers, we usually have a fun time while we work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers, but you just have to know how to handle them and always making sure they are satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and seeing smiles on their face once they leave my check out line."
bad,"the work itself was not bad or hard, i learned how to do the work fast and it was very easy, managemnet did not respond well to theporblems that were in the deli, some of the co-workers were lazy did not help others that they worked with or customers, getting left there by myself when there was still stuff to do, not running aournd four different departments."
bad,I only work here a few weeks and I didn't like it. I didn't enjoy my job at all. I basicly had to force myself to get up and go to work.
bad,"The managers look down on you . The managers don't care about the customers but of course its Walmart what do u expect! Rude customer service from employees but we learn from the best our management! Plus they make decisions based on favoritism not by ur hard work ! They fill your head up on growth with the company but to move up you either kissin a.."
bad,"Turning on/ calibrating machines, collect daily inventory sheets, evaluating department, tending to tasks ranked by priority. I learned plenty of tolerance and patience. Management varied, but typically was lackadaisical about any task. Co-workers varied as well, but mostly helped each other out without question. The plethora of human behavior was the hardest thing to deal with, but that directly correlated with the demographic store to store. Satisfying customers was by far the most rewarding part of this job."
bad,"Generally you work with friendly people, that's where the fun ends though as after your training is complete you're basically their slaves.  They will look at every excuse they can to keep you as low on the food chain as possible and only the people that have been working there for 10 years + or the people who management likes will ever get a promotion.  As for a raise, I worked my butt off following all the rules and everything for a mere .40c after a year of busting my butt scrubbing their floors and toilets.  I trained new employee's, helped outside of my department, fixed their machines and took the time to help customers while still getting all of my work done.  They don't give good hours, they rarely give you the tools you need they're slow when they say they're going to do something and they give you an extreme workload and threaten you if you say you can't possibly complete it.  A couple years ago the benefits were great, the work was fun, management had the tools they needed to do their job and help with yours.  "
bad,focusing on the customer needs first ringing up customers when needed then maintaining my departments cleanliness. 
bad,everyday was stressful. didn't learn anything. horrible management. limited resources. nothing enoyable.
bad,minha avaliaçao sobre esta empresa e rasoavel se nao fosse o descaso com funcionarios 
bad,"Less employees means more work for one individual"
bad,"A typical day is non-stop ringing up customers, and making sure that I help them leave satisfied to the best of my ability. I've learned to appreciate having a job no matter how good or bad the situation. My co-workers are nice, and so are the customers. The hardest part of my job is the lack of attention supervisors give to workers, and because of this my coworkers are not hard workers, and affects people like me who do what they are supposed to do. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I did my best, and that I've done what I was supposed to do at work."
bad,"The customers were my main concern,I really enjoyed working with them every day. Management showed a lot of favoritism and did not allow some people to move forward. I learned that respect and kindness is the most important aspect when working with customers.A smile,friendliness,being helpful and caring is what customer service is all about,"
bad,Wal-Mart treats their employees very poorly as if they disposable even if they are top notch. wages are extremely low and the over all work environment isnt well adjusted. Power struggles.
bad,One of the hardest parts of the job is dealing with different variations of management because none is on the same page. I like people so that is the easy part. My coworkers are great I feel a good connection with them.
bad,"There was always nonstop criticism towards the Hispanic members. The high school branch manager does not know how to at least wait until the door closes to talk bad about the last person who was just in the office. She was VERY immature. The supervisors there were extremely hypocritical. There was always so much drama in the workplace. When you try to keep to yourself and stay out of trouble, you end up getting into trouble for not associating with anyone. There was no pleasing anyone there. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to leave that place. Supposedly we were allowed two 15-minute breaks, but I couldn't even be gone 5 minutes, and they'd already be looking for me even when I was trying to take a restroom break. How ridiculous was that? Very. Do not work there!"
bad,Its very inefficient and there is not enough employees to meet to work load.
bad,a typical day was bein moved to an area you knew nothing about and be expected to perform good with no training.this job is the worst place i have ever worked at.for 2 and a half years i lived in poverty. you only make about 12000 a year its pathetic.no full time no benifits. cut hours.low bonuses.managers who dont care about their employees.rude customers daily.walmart and all the employees that work there have no rights no benifits no future.they need a union.everyone who is not a salery manager is poor. its sad and something needs to change soon. union.
bad,"Again, I very much enjoyed helping customers get what they needed. I would form honest relationships with people so they knew that they could come back to me for anything. I also enjoyed working with Electronics and technology. It's an area I feel very knowledgeable in. I could say a lot of bad things about the company but I'll just leave it at; ""I was unsatisfied with the ethics and general practices of the company."""
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart has its ups and downs. On one hand it is a steady, secure job as long as you show up on time and do your job. On the other hand management as a whole can be very rude and condescending to employees. I enjoyed working with people."
bad,Wouldn't work around my school schedule. Wouldn't rehire me after 2 interviews because I was pregnant.
bad,The salary is not worth the time and energy associates are expected to waste here. They don't have a good promotion system; managers are selected through favoritism rather than hard-work and dedication.
bad,"as far as people wise and customer interactions its good, but management at this place SUCKS!!!"
bad,"Of all the companies I've ever worked for, this was the absolute worse. I was surrounded by the most unprofessional management that I have ever worked under. People here manage based off emotions, hearsay, and without investigation. You are put into positions with absolutely no training, if you do such a great job you can forget ever leaving that position unless you're in good with upper management. Some employees were talked to like dogs, treated like animals and definitely underpaid. Financial numbers were gone over in morning meetings and I would think to myself we brought in this much money and I only get paid how much with my experience? Two words sum up Walmart: greed and unprofessional. It's and american sweat shop that doesn't respect their employees."
bad,When i started at Walmart a few years ago a typical day at work was enjoyable meaning we had the help we needed plus we had the time to get our goals put in place before we clocked out before the day was over.I learned quite a bit about running a good company while i was there a good company ensures all of its departents are set up for success instead of just the few that might bring in profits at certain times of the year.The management team was disorganized and inconsistent which in turn created problems such as taking a enployee off of one project to start on another before the goal was compleate which led to failures of certain goals that led to employess taking the blame for later on.The co-workers i had are the only reason why i miss working at walmart.The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done under the new hub system the company put in place which was set up for full time workers.I enjoyed the people i worked with plus getting our goals done before everything changed.
bad,"A typical day a work was collecting payments from customers, bagging there items, interacting with customers."
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was nothing but chaos to say the least. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know from working with the company prior to my being hired. The management team (or lack there of) was constantly overworking their associates, and constantly wanted people from other departments in other areas to do other peoples jobs when the called out sick or didn't show up etc. The only real teamwork that was ever (sometimes) seen was between the lower associates of the many departments. The hardest part of the job was trying to riddle out what supervisor or manager wanted you to do what, and it got annoying as hell having multiple people telling you what to do over the course of a shift you didn't know what needed prioritizing."
bad,"Boring shifts with a lot of standing around because you can only clean your register so many times. You can get plenty of hours even when you don't want them because your in school. Had me up to 39 a week when I quite. You had a different manager every couple days, The only nice thing was making friends with your coworkers."
bad,"Si bien es cierto dentro de esta empresa, se habla mucho de los Valores y el respeto por el individuo, muchas veces no se cumplen. Por lo gral es un multinacional rodeada de valores, pero frente a la comunicacion deja mas que desear. Sin embargo si se mantiene una buena relacion con los supervisores y gerentes en gral tenes un tiempo de duracion de aproximadamente 5 años en adelante. La parte mas dificil es el ser discriminado por preferencia sexual Y/O alguna enfermedad de transmision sexual..."
bad,"harrest by employees,ets. not honest place to work.I enjoy the custemers."
bad,empresa que nao valoriza o funcionario e nao tem respeito pelo funcionario
bad,"I liked the work , however the department had a strange dynamic due to unknown reasons...??"
bad,"I made about $12/hour, but it took 6 years to get that rate. Constant management turnover (I worked for 6 different store managers in 6 years) leads to inconsistency in communication."
bad,total lack of order and profesionalism managers unqualified
bad,"As a manager you are subject to the moods of your store manager, there is nothing fun about it, used to be fun until they started emptying the stores of associates to assist the customers but cooporate greed at the top to put money in their pockets think the stores can operate with no employees."
bad,Worst place ever to work... EVER! The only good thing I got out of working for Walmart is that is where I met my husband.
bad,Got fired for something that wasn't my fault..and now can never work there again.
bad,"Morning shift i would check my emails, print out my t mat and my schedule of my deli associate's for that day. Open deli me and one by checking out of date facing floor . Turn on equipment and clean slicer off . Check cooler for out of date and all floor products. I check log communication log form night for any issue of night before. I then set up my t mat. To let assistance know there they will be working for day and any job duties that need to be done before that shift ends. I place order for any low products. Check the order book to see if any orders are due for the day. Have associate stat cooking for hot bar. Then wait on customer the request slice meats and cheese."
bad,"In my previous field I had been required to take care of the entire produce department, overload myself with stress, and resulted in both physical problems. My manager although great full for my hard work tended to trust me to run the entire department myself at times with little to no check ups. In the mean time I was urging myself to a higher easier (on my back and neck) position of supervisor/manager. Which I was qualified for prior to my dismissal due to an injury. In this position I was required to lift 10-50 lbs continuously for hours managing the produce back room and cooler, sweeping, moping, cleaning, organizing, sorting through garbage and deciding perishable foods for donations and for refunds/claims, customer service on the floor, teaching my supervisor and all of the new hires for the grand opening and start up,and dealing with other associates with and at times for the supervisor."
bad,Idiots get promoted. Butt kissers get advancement. The mules stay mules.
bad,Would not recommend. Very unprofessional working environment. do not treat associates wit respect.
bad,I didn't really like it. Management didn't really make good decisions. But majority of the employees were good people
bad,All I can say is walmart is a place I will never work for again!
bad,"The motto ""over worked and under payed"" fits the bill perfectly! They want to be in 3 different places all at once, to clone yourself and get multiple jobs done at the same time! You're told that ""customers come first"" but you're treated awful! They expect you to give your undivided attention to each and every customer yet you're expected to get all of your ""tasks"" done as well ! They definitely don't stay true to their ""beliefs"" they were founded upon, one being integrity, which is thrown out the window there! The employees are expected to be perfect but the mangers are liars!!! They don't care a single bit about your valuable family time and expect you to devote your LIFE to that place! The customers are AWFUL because they're mad at YOU because the managers can't schedule enough people !! HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK PERIOD."
bad,"They have no respect for their employees, none of them. Unless your a manager, or an assistant manager, your treated with the utmost disrespect I've ever seen through any company."
bad,"I worked in the tire lube express and they fired me after 4 months, despite the fact I worked the hardest there, and the others would goof and play around on their cell phones. I got called down and told I was being let go, and told to leave. The worst part of the job was, that I had the most experience in the automotive department from doing apprenticeship elsewhere and yet I was getting paid less than someone who had next to no experience in automotive, not only that,but he was also very careless and irresponsibile, consistantly would leave the lugnuts on the wheels loose. The only enjoyable part of the job was some of the guys I'd work with, they'd understand and try and help out."
bad,Extremely understaffed. To many of the managers that have no clue of whats going on. Tell you to do something and change their mind a hour later and everyhing has to be redone. They expect you to work for peanuts and do the work of 2 or 3 people. Overwork their good people and keep the dead beats. Double standards when it comes to what they say and what they do.
bad,This company does not care about its employees' well-being what so ever.. terrible place to work.
bad,Walmart is a company that is only based on customers and does not pay enough attention to it's associates at all and full time job is hardly offered.
bad,We process shipment order for medication to patients home. what I enjoy about the company is the patients. My coworker are very nice. the hardest part about my job is getting management to see a better way to do things.
bad,"placed orders, stocked shieldes and told other worker what to do"
bad,"Was hired to be an Assistant Store Manager and quit within a short period of time due to the poor structure within the store. They treat their employees like slaves, and they are not very organized. Their stores always look like trash and their training is very limited."
bad,I worked there for about 7 months and they would not make me full time because they could not pay for benefits. I was super disappointed in this company and the management never dealt with serious issues.
bad,"on a typical day at walmart i found myself depressed and pressured. i love hard work but it was so unorganized and there was never the proper tools to complete the job. i found myself hurting myself due to walmart not providing the proper equipment to complete the job properly. i have learned very little from walmart managment they never teach or train, they just throw you under the bus and blame you for not knowing how to do the job properly. my co-workers were fun to work with. we all felt the same about management. lots of associates left walmart or got fired for horrible reasons.the hardest part of the job was not being trained properly. the most enjoyable part was i had a job."
bad,walmart is only a good place to work at if your single have no kids. they are not family oriented. they dont care if your child is sick or you have to rush them into the e.r. it is still held against you.
bad,Get to work and have to help unload the truck because we were short staffed. After had to go and stock whatever dept. we are assigned usually with little help again because we were always short staffed. Management expected miracles and when it wasn't done to their liking we would get written up for things beyond our control. I was always given the slower workers because i never complained and always picked up their slack. The hardest part was that I don't like to fail and it felt like that was all that i did. The best part of the job though was that since we were short staffed I got to learn many aspects of different jobs and was never bored or without anything new and different to do.
bad,wal-mart is a company that does not really care about their worker there way to many people who you are to listen to and they all think that they are the most inporting person in the world they dont care that if they tell you to do something and it is wrong if you try to tell them that you will get writing up for it even if they find out that what they told you to do would brake something they would say then that you should have told them that even though they wrote you up for trying to tell them that.
bad,"A typical day was filled with caotic incidents, I learned that you are lied to on a daily basis from management teams. Co-workers are scared into submission for fear of being terminated. The hardest part of the job was physicing yourself to go to work.The most enjoyable part was getting off from work. It was like a releif came over you. that you had survived one more day."
bad,"Stocking shelves, customer service, ording product is the typical day."
bad,Fannel at white lake walmart loves to tell the worker there that he can fire you at any time he likes this is why I am here looking for a better job then this miss or a so called job. In all my life I have never been treaded this bad or take down to like this boss has I try to get out of walmart so on my resume it will be that I ligth on good treams
bad,Managers were hired who had no experience and did not even have an adjusters license. There was a high turn over rate. Contradicting directions from different managers made the job very difficult.
bad,"A typical day at walmart is alot of drama with all the younger cashiers thats new to the company.I learn how to do great customer service,I also learned not to get into people business.The management of the front end of the store was very poor they never came when a customer needed them the customer had to call home office to get managment attention.The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers and rude employees.The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to work with different people and learning new things.Also learning how to have great customer service."
bad,Advancement chances are slim to none and management teams only care about production. An overall easy job with low compensation for the work being done in an environment full of incompetent supervisors.
bad,"wal mart has lost there value you the associate, management is all about who you know, the open door is a joke and if some one dont like you they will find a reason to get rid of you, I feel that just because wal mart is the largest retail bussiness they have taken over and are worse then the goverment in ali=ot of ways, I feel that the CEO needs to get more involved with what is REALLY going on! Sam Walton was a good man and if he were alive today Wal Mart would be a better place, Wal Mart acts as if they are not out to close down the little bussiness but I know first hand that is a lie, Direction from above is simpley not right and some one needs to open their eyes, they work their people for next to nothing and there words are ""IF THEY DONT LIKE IT QUIT"" that is so sad. They have cut labor back so bad that the management team is having to work extra just to try and put product on the shelves, yet store managers and higher up are yelling to get the job done but you dont see any of them rolling up their sleves to help....Wal-Mart has outside job fairs for management yet there is plenty of GOOD management that should be promoted but if you dont play their game you can forget it,I realize that new talent is needed but look benith your nose and figure out another way dont make the people that have been dedicated for years suffer.. so much for promoting on talent.. I was promised one thing and because my store manager and market manager didnt like my life style I was let go, things at Wal Mart are just not right..I am sure this wont be posted due to the fact is is the real ""FACTS"""
bad,was expected to work at the speed of three people. I did oil changes as well as a lot of tire work.
bad,Wal-Mart does not care about its employees. They offer a low salary and will not hire you full-time. They do not give benefits to part-time employees. Management does not care about your issues or input. I would not work here again.
bad,"I really can't recommend anyone work for Walmart unless you have no alternatives. Even then, try to make your time with them as short as possible."
bad,i wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. managment is disrespectful. they do not listen to what you have to say nor do they work with you to try an fix a problem.
bad,Stocking shelves overnight was fine but having Managers cussing me out just for asking a question and mistreating me all the time was not fun or enjoyable. The co-workers was nice and would help sometimes but they always had drama and got me involved in it. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the people i was working with and my bosses and the most enjoyable part was having a hour for lunch.
bad,atareado por ver diferentes departamentos
bad,Working the graveyard shift is emotionally and physically draining and the management overnight is horrible.
bad,"tem que ficar operar caixa, supervisionar operadoras e ficar na tesouraria, trocando dinheiro fazendo malote e etc"
bad,Never again will I ever work for this place. The manager was very harsh and very hard on everyone that worked at this store and the store was a complete write off every night.
bad,"I can honestly say, one of the worst places to work at! Glad i at least tried it."
bad,It was a fun place to work but not enough hours. I enjoyed stocking shelves and unloading/loading the tractor trailer with the merchandise.
bad,mgmt does not provide adequate personal for productive customer service. The hardest part of the job was trying to do the job routine while also trying to provide good customer service. Almost all my co-workers had the same complaint. I learned how to use all the equipment in the deli department and help out my fellow workers. The most enjoyable part of the job - the people I directly worked with.
bad,After four years with this company trying to prove
bad,"I don't feel that Wal-Mart values their employees. I understand the saying that the customer is always right, but Wal-Mart uses it to the max just to keep a paying customer coming back whether their wrong or right."
bad,"Terrible place to work if you're planning to invest. I saw tons invest years and years of their lives into this company, yet within 5 min get told to step down to cashier or quit. In the 1 horrid year I stayed, I saw 7 managers leave or get demoted. Now I heard the store managers gone too. Unrealistic goals and no employees to make it happen. As a manager you're all alone. I had employees cry to me daily about mistreatment. 10 cent raises a year... If you need a part time job its a great place. But don't invest full-time stress into your life and deal with it in the McDonalds gaining 50 pounds. Think twice, honestly. Walmart is not who they use to be and it's only going to get worse when they gain more control in their monopoly. I wouldn't wish it for my enemies."
bad,Work as a cashier which was pretty easy. Just handle transactions.
bad,It's the worst location I've ever worked. I only stay here because it barely covers my bills. The management staff is rude and banal. Every employee I've spoken to has been actively seeking other employment within three months of starting.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of blending in, being a customer, watching for any behavior that might lead me to believe someone might attempt to steal from the company. Having no experience in this field, I learned that it is something I enjoy, and something I could be good at given the proper training."
bad,"Favoritism amongst staff and management. Hours go up and down like a roller-coaster so you can't have a life. Management tells you one thing one day but never stick by what they say. No consistency in general. You never get enough hours and can't seek a second job because no set days off. All in all you want freedom, you give it up working here."
bad,"en walmart hay muy poca educacion en el trato de las personas de parte de los administradores y sub.administradores, lo cual hace que uno trabaje con desconfianza todos los días el cual un día te dicen que sirves y al otro día te dicen no sirves para esto y no te crea ese ambiente cordial el cual publican"
bad,i was a sales associate in electronics. I was in charge of that dept to make sure customers received the help that they needed.
bad,"At Wal-Mart, the only way you advance is through favoritism. Management is horrible. Once you get wrote up for anything they find reasons to have you fired. They refuse full time employment unless you are management, and they cut hours like crazy along with refusing you extra hours."
bad,"my co-workers most of them were excellent workers some i have taught them how to do there jobs, others i have learnt alot from, management there were only 3 out of 7 that were caring enough to make sure you knew how to do your job right. the other 4 did not even know how to do most of our jobs.most enjoyable part of my job was feeling great about myself in the work i did on a daily basis. i was also proud of my accoplishments with a program called ""feed america"" we donated food to our local food self.i have learnt through out my over 9 years how to be better person with our customers needs, was great with inventory,vendors,claims,stocking .re-doing the selfs when it was time to re-pricing items,re-aaranging merchandise.i have many years cashier experience,many years customer service experience,some computer knowlege."
bad,"Walmart! What can I say about this use to be amazing company, except for the fact that it is only a shell form of what it use to be. The managers don't manage, the workers from previous shifts don't work, but management wants the job complete all the same. How does a multi-billion dollar company save money? By underpaying the peolple who actually put in the man power and hours to save you that money in the first place, all so that my managers can see a bonus that is bigger then my years salary. Basically if you want to be under paid but worked extremely hard walmart's the place to be."
bad,i learned do my best even if they expect you to be superwoman.
bad,Wal- Mart is a company for someone with no life. It requires your full availibility with NO EXCUSES.
bad,"I came as a cashier transferring from Arkansas. Was given no training (everything is different in GA), was ridiculed, demoted to people greeter with cut in pay, was denied breaks and was finally set up to be fired. It was totally unjust and shocking after having worked at Walmart headquarters, Bentonville, AR. I have been denied the opportunity to support myself and have suffered great hardships as a result."
bad,"I was a Unloader sounds easy enough but its not. Very physical job and if your not fit you wont last long. You start your day laying out pallets, unloading the trucks and separating the frieght by department on to each pallet. Their trucks merchandise aren't on pallets so you'll have to pick up each box by hand. Truck size varies form 1600 normal to 2200 pieces boxes are from 20 to 80 pounds maybe more. Afterwards pull pallets with jack to sales floor by department, clean backroom, and if you have nothing else to do you stock. Co workers are friendly and if ya need help you can count on them. Management however likes to play favorites in terms of moving up in position, they don't care about your safety much and if you have a problem you cant rely them to help you fix it. Walmart cares more about numbers than its employees and if you don't like how the company is run your as good as gone. I left Walmart because my team and I were being harrassed by a manager because we reported her to home office for the way she treated people. She fired 3 of my teammate 1 deserved it for stealing. Tried to get me twice but I gave up from being hounded by her."
bad,This company bullies its employees. If you get injured then you will get fired. They do not care if you have family obligations and will threaten you to get what they want. The Open Door Policy is nothing more then something for you to get yourself in trouble with. The people you work with are better then the managers. You are worked as though you are a robot and expected to be able to complete 15 hours worth of work in 6 so that you can Zone and clean up the rest of the time you are on the clock.
bad,Clock in they tell you about what needs to be done by this time. I only learned one positive thing and that is providing customer service. Some managers were good but the rest were satisfied just giving orders. coworker were good. is trying to do 2 pallets in an 2 hrs.
bad,I think that the immediate Supervisor of each individual department and all coworkers have a meeting at least once a month. That way there would be more open communication with everyone. I also think that Supervisor/ Assistant Manager should be more open to all employees.
bad,"The management is poor. The pay is poor. The work is boring. The morale isn't very good. They keep cutting hours, but never have enough cashiers up front so they have to call associates from other departments. I have found it isn't a very pleasant place to work. raises don't come very often, if at all. Some of the employees gossip about other employees. The customers are rude, the can't take no for an answer."
bad,If I can do anything to prevent someone the misery I've been through at Port Coquitlam Walmart (Bakery Department) then this posting will have been worthwhile.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of drama and politics. I have learned to not work so hard, as it will not pay off in the end with this company. It is poorly managed with leaders that don't know a lot about the areas that they work (they mainly are looking at the dollar signs instead of the customer service and leadership role they are to fulfill). Most of the Co-workers I worked with were very nice and willing to work as a team. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep customers happy with the best service without providing easy access to High Theft items. The only thing that I enjoyed while on the job was Learning different departments and getting to know new product."
bad,"A typical day of work would be doing a million things not in my job description, and being belittled and disrespected by most of management. The hardest part of the job was being treated like a slave, the best part was seeing my friends at work and meeting new people."
bad,Fired on my nine year anniversary for attendance during a custody battle. Apperently court is not an excused absence
bad,it was very busy you had to stock the shelves all the time. the managment wasn't very nice. trying to do everything at once. working with my co-works.
bad,work you to death with low pay. The breaks were ok but if you dont say their cheer every night they will force that on you.
bad,"too much favortism, unfair to some of their associates.managementdemands to much from their associates.Certain associates always get away with not doing nothing as long as they are on the good side of management"
bad,Management is extremely lazy at the store I work at. Expect way to much from single individuals. Don't move up to full time status but schedule for full time hours. Clientele is horrible.
bad,"I'd advise no one to ever work for Wal-mart unless you are management or office personnel. Out of all three different Wal-mart stores I have worked at, in 6 consecutive years, unfortunately every store is the same! I relocated several times to find this out. Managers are very favortism, unfair, and it shows! You will not get promoted based on skills and qualifications, but on which manager favors you the most. If you do a good job you will not be noticed but if you mess up oh yes they notice this instantly! The pay is a joke! Sure it is a tad bit more than mininum wage, however the long 9 (yes nine) hours, the actual work load, and the nonsense you have to deal with on a daily basis from co-workers, managers, and customers; it is definitely not worth the stress or lousy pay!! Wal-mart does not take care of its employees and does not intend to do so! Yes this job was the most stressful job I've had and I absolutely hated it! Glad to be out!!"
bad,"I learned that it take hard work and respect to get the work done . I made great life long friends there. Mgt treated employees and customers with no respect I had to numerous time appolize to customers due to the way they were treated. They made us work over then take then time off at the end of the week or we would be fired, while fussing at us for having to take the time off. In truth there alot of issues at this job that need inprovement but seem not to be happening any time soon."
bad,"A Typical Work Day At This Place Is None Like Any Other. I Work In The Toy Department, Well That's What My Job Title Is. My Daily Work Consist Of Cashiering, Unloading Trucks, Cell Phone Activation, Photo Processing, Dot Com Pickups, and Keeping Up With The Toy Department. All Of This I Don't Mind Because It Keeps Me Busy and I'm Not Just In One Place All Day. My Issue With This Company Is That It Is Very Unorganized. There Is No Chain Of Command. Everyone Wants To Be In Charge and It Ends Up Becoming A Head Ache. The Pay Is Awful and The Only Way To Actually Make Some Decent Money Is To Be Full Time Which They Don't Believe In. Asking Management To Adjust or Fix Your Schedule Is Like Pulling Teeth With Your Fingers. Overall Its An Unorganized Place To Work For But They Do Have Some Great Discount With Other Places."
bad,Can be a great place to work if they care more about their employees and not just about the money!
bad,"The only way to work there AND not be on government assistance is to either have been working there for years, have a degree, or work overnights. Being as i had none of the predispositions needed and that i do want to avoid government assistance, i worked overnights. The appreciation of any work ethic was non-existent if not inverted (I.E. the harder you worked the more they asked)."
bad,"its a job best for elderly or students, or if you really need it. this is only experience from the montrose, co store"
bad,A typical work day at Walmart consist of surveying walmart premises for theft both internal and customer theft. I spent the majority of my days in office watching film filling out paperwork or walking the store disguised as a customer.
bad,"Often lack of communication, flawed investigations, lack of positive attitude behind doors. Management is untrustworthy and usually have their own agenda."
bad,"Management is worried about their bonuses and nothing more. They lie about advancement and promotions, they try to fire people for being there ""too long."" Its a miserable place to work!"
bad,Upper management does not take care of their employees. Wal-Mart isnt what it used to be
bad,"This is not the same company that Sam Walton created. They are constantly cutting benefits from their associates each year. They want robots and you are timed at all things you do for them. They have a poor record of following state and federal labor laws. If all you want is a part time job while going to school, it should be ok."
bad,"Most employee's do not speak understandable english, their 'fix a problem' rating is between two and eight months, compensation is poor and increases bear minimum, and the respect between everyone is below par"
bad,"Not a fun place to work, horrible scheduling, horrible management, horrible people to work with (customer, the public in general)"
bad,I feel that Wal-mart is alot of thick skins people who are not team work people.
bad,"I was employed at Walmart for 2+ years, I enjoyed working with my crew, however the crew members always told me the Pharmacy Manger had it out for me and tried to get me to quit countless times. I have been coached and wrote up, I was not in the ""group"". I refused to kneel to that level, costing me my job. I was one of the best employees in the pharmacy, I knew my job, I did it well. When a series of unfortunate events falled upon me, Assad my Boss took advantage of my situation and gave my job to someone else."
bad,Wal mart is not the best place if you have a family. they do not care about your life outside of wal amrt. even if you have a dr note you will be in trouble if you are out
bad,"Before we start I need to say that I quit and did not get fired so I am not spiteful towards the company because they fired me. The pay and benefits are bad. There are no merit raises, just annual raises. The highest raise you can get is 60 cents/year, but I only knew of 2 people getting that in the four years and three months of working there. Almost everyone gets a 40 cent raise. Management was a joke. Politics NOT performance is what determines who gets promoted. It is solely the store managers decision, and if you work third shift, he/she will not know you. There are no set hours and they expect you to revolve around wal-mart and expect you not to have a personal life. You can help them, but do not expect it in return if you need it. They cut hours for any reason (some full time down to 28 hr/week others no higher than 32 hr/wk and part time cut down to around 20 hr/wk), but you will have to work five days a week to get those hours because they give you four hour shifts and do not change it for you. They make you do anything that is needed (ex. push carts, cashier, clean toilets, work in frozen or dairy) no matter where you are supposed to work, and if it is a higher pay rate, you won't get paid that pay. I worked all shifts at Wal-Mart. All in all it is a horrible place to work and it is just there to get the CEO more money in his pockets."
bad,easy work hard bosses at first it was a good job but the more i worked there the worse it became.
bad,"Working at walmart was refreshingly NOT a nightmare at first, but that quickly changed as I got through the training. On two months of working there, my FIRST EVER job, I got saddled with running TWO departments completely alone. No other associates, no department managers. Every department was criminally understaffed and not being hired for because all they wanted was cashiers. Basically nobody working there gave a flying rat's behind about safety protocols, or really anything regarding doing their jobs well. You'd do your best, and come back the next day to see overnight undid all of that work and then some. The systems were completely useless, so every single day was a total slog of just manually trying to brute force our overstocked freezers onto the sales floor. It was a job. It was a first job. It's not a career, and it's not sustainable. It'll help you get a sense for what being employed is like, and it's something. That's the best I can say about it."
bad,"The is job continually eliminating positions and opportunities to advance. The management is highly disrespectful a vast majority of the time. Never once received a raise is 3 years of work. Was scheduled outside of submitted availability constantly."
bad,"From top to bottom, many managers are demeaning to their employees; very unprofessional and nothing is handled in private. HR seldom has time to answer questions and if you're lucky enough to get some time, the answers don't make sense. If it's answers you seek, you will be given the runaround, as trying to get a  straight answer is difficult and you will be sent on a wild goose chase to obtain it."
bad,"They'll say that they care about you as a employee and work with you on scheduling and training and it's a lie. You gotta pretty much be available 24/7, which is understandable but when you need a day off, they'll more than likely wait until the last minute and say that there's no coverage in the department when there's always coverage and if you get sick and have to go the hospital, they don't accept doctors note"
bad,The management of Walmart that I have worked at on 67th in Lawton Oklahoma clearly show that they have no concern for their employees or family lives they change your schedule without notice and takes four weeks just to get your availability adjusted only for them to change it 2 weeks later and then tell you that you have to refill out the paperwork and wait another month to get your schedule backas well as the point system that Walmart uses for absences and tardies because as a veteran we have many appointments but Walmart does not honor a doctor's note and sees it as you just not showing up to work.
bad,"The work itself is great, however there are a couple employees that do not have the drive to handle what being an optician is. And unfortunately the manager does not correct their behavior. It can be a fun, fast paced work environment but it does take teamwork! There is always something new to learn in the optical field!"
bad,"We got new managers after a month or so of me being there. They didn’t communicate ppto being used for Christmas and I got points as a result of issues with that miscommunication. I also had to report my 2 up front managers to personnel because they knocked things off a shelf and told me to pick them up and then I needed to dust the shelf they knocked stuff off of when I got done picking things up. Then they got on me for leaving the self checkout belts to go in the bull pin to approve alcohol for a minor who was working it, which is what I was told we were supposed to do when I first started there."
bad,They fired me because I had too many points in my attendance and had to go to the hospital because I was working with the flu they are one of the worst company’s I ever worked for
bad,"Poor pay with highly physical demands, and no opportunity to work in an area that best suited my needs. Wal-Mart was understanding of personal situations however."
bad,Job was just a job to get by at the time for me . The pay sucks high turn over a lot of people quit eventually over time . Co workers was nice and respectful manger was also cool . Location was great for me that’s why I took the job and it was over night so it worked out .
bad,"Poorly managed, got in trouble for calling out sick despite having a doctors note, was not trained well and hated every minute there. Customers are ultra rude and department was severely understaffed."
bad,Management was awful. Didn’t care how employees were being treated by their supervisors. You work all the holidays and don’t get paid extra. The Deli is the worst place to work in the entire store.  Only good thing was my commute to work
bad,To many people talking about each other was not a good work environment for me and not friendly and a lot people was very rude worst job I ever had not professional at all.
bad,They will hire any person that they can get. They just want a body. There is no benefits to the people working full time. I was a cashier and I was over worked with floods of consistent rude people coming through up to the till.
bad,walmart only cares about the money not its employees.they work you to death and you get very little to no appreciation for it.they constantly change everything
bad,Working at Walmart is a very selfish company. No boss or manager wants to ever answer there associates questions. Only thing i liked about working there is they pay rate.
bad,its bad to work for them long term unless you move up (fast tracking)---->which requires you to move were they tell you! though short term is ok its steady pay that declines over time in my experience.
bad,"Don't work here, especially in the deli. A typical day at work is dealing with rude customers and then having management up your a** at all times. They come bursting in the door, shouting your name, even if you are busy with a customer. The deli manager doesn't even know how to work in the deli and has to ask you how to do things. Customers will assume you are ignoring them if you are busy doing the 100 other jobs you have to do. If you close, you are at the bottom of the chain. You get to clean up after everyones mess, especially the 500 pound trash bags they leave for you. Good luck lifting that trash bag into the trash compactor (especially if you have to close by yourself, which you will have to if your coworker gets fired in the middle of their shift, or they don't show up to work because nobody really wants to work here) and having to throw away the pile of cardboard they left for you. And if someone didn't finish their job, it's O.K. because they can just leave it for the closers to finish it for them! Oh, and if you don't clean everything perfectly, you will get coached for it or worse, fired. They pick and choose who they like and if they don't like you for any reason, they will find a bull reason to fire you over. You can't work overtime to finish that job they assigned to you or you will get coached. Everything you do here has a consequence and it's either getting coached or fired. There is a clique consisting of old, bitter women who gossip about everyone (even each other) behind their backs. The enviornment is here is so toxic. It's like being in an abusive relationship."
bad,Nothing Good to say about East Town Walmart. I am just on indeed trying to find a company that i can work for get paid well and have a good amount of hours that I can afford to make a decent living for me and my family.
bad,Had to go into work sick because they will write you up for calling out. Got in a car accident and got wrote up for leaving. Unrealistic expectations with no ways of leveling up without working way more than its worth.
bad,Honestly the worst company I've worked for. The management team is absolutely terrible. Customers are even worse and extremely rude. Pay is low for the amount of things your are required to do.  There are 1hr lunch breaks which was the only highlight of working there. Worked for the company just over 2 years never received a raise or benefits. Employee discount was 10 percent which is a total joke. High stress environment.
bad,"Horrible work experience.. The store manager created a toxic work environment at the store making this one of my worst work experiences. I've never been around a tenured team that hated a store and the store manager so much that they choose to quit, then to continue to work with her... Very sad, very nasty person"
bad,Don’t do it! You will never feel less appreciated in your life. Employees come and go like a revolving door. Management says they care but nothing is sacred. A private email or phone call is shown or talked about with the person the grievance was about.
bad,"This place takes your soul!! No weekends no holidays and the way the schedule goes you have no life. If your a good hard worker, you will get paid the same as they lazy worker. There is no incentive to do anything for the greedy company."
bad,"Pay is decent but the environment is terrible and not worth the compensation. Managers are rude, constantly turning over employees, most employees don’t want to work. This is at the Shelby DC"
bad,"Cut throat place, Assistant Managers were prejudice & played favorites daily, Management would tell at you in front of other employees AND customers, you never feel secure in your job & you can’t trust anybody because even management will lie on you to make themselves look better or just cuz your not one of their favorites."
bad,"During my time of employment at Walmart, I was suffering from random frequently occurring seizures. This affected my ability to work with the public as well as stand for extended periods of time. I had a seizure at Walmart while working the register and decided that it was too stressful and risky for me to work in that environment at the time."
bad,I felt like an outsider. I worked my butt off and never felt appreciated. Did not have the right guidence to move forward. I loved my regular customers. They made me feel appreciated. That was the best part of my job.
bad,"To anyone wanting to work at 495 Flatbush Ave Walmart, don't go. They treat people of color differently because it's ran by Hispanics and most of them don't do any work. So to save yourself some time, don't work at this Walmart"
bad,Walmart was not organized . Managers would be hard to find . They were always the most comfortable to talk to. They would down talk you but wouldn’t try to help either . They are a real contradiction to their values
bad,Management sucked. They did whatever and don't care. They scheduled anybody anywhere any days. They just need to tidy up completely.  I did learn a few things for the better and worse
bad,This company sucks. It doesn't matter how much hard work you put into it. If you mess up once you're out the door and they'll replace you with someone new immediately.
bad,"Lot of discrimination in the workplace. Expected to overwork. Management were disrespectful and rude to employees, even aggressive. Inconsistent enforcement of the rules. A lot of favoritism. Did the work of four people sometimes and was not appreciated or acknowledged for it."
bad,The pay not acceptable for all the work we do. Cap 2 big turn over . Has the store claim we’re the back bone of the company we’ll pay us more and we do a lot through out the store as well.
bad,"Stay away! Years ago this was a wonderful company to work for. I was hired with a flexible schedule that worked around my college courses. There were community fun days where we raised money for local charities, we hosted employee cookouts, we used to get $500 quarterly bonuses. That's all out the window now. And it just gets worse every day."
bad,I am a single teenage mother & I also take a nursing class. The managers did nothing to work with my schedule & eventually fired me because I “had exceeded my points” which were due to them scheduling me beyond my HOURS . WORST JOB EVER
bad,"Seriously, having worked at Amazon and Walmart, I'd rather jog my feet down to the nubs and use the bathroom in the corner at Amazon before I'd ever go back in Walmart.  Toxic management, no sense of direction, and throwing your subordinates under the bus to get ahead are the name of the game here.  Expect high turnover, a manager who's smiles and friendly to your face but would stab you in the back for a nickel, and customers who think you're a NPC in a video game.  It's THAT bad."
bad,"Just ok pay"
bad,Working for walmart was alright to be honest. Id do the same thing from pushing carts to cleaning bathrooms and sweeping and mopping the floor. However I did learn lessons from working at at walmart.
bad,They only care about how much money the big mangers make.they don't  care about  the people who works under the mangers  ..that are really making it happen ...They  don't care how you pay your bills. This is not a place for people who have family's  it's for school kid's
bad,Walmart was once the company people wanted to work for till they started changing positions and letting people go for wrong reasons there's less concern for the associates the more money you make it's more about the favorites than anything moral changes fast too many rumors not enough communication .
bad,management is really negative and dismissive of the staff with members like Co manager angelica being clueless to other job roles outside of her own. fresh and production staff know what they are doing and are on point.
bad,Trust no one you work with. They will blame you for everything and praise you Nothing. There's certain managers that have their favorites and those are the ones that do no work while a hard worker will get no praise!!!
bad,"They don’t care about their workers at all. In the tire and lube where I worked, in 4 months 3 people quit due to not being able to deal with management. They don’t even tell you if your seasonal or not. Me and my friend were put on as full time and applied together. Once the winter season was over and they didn’t need extra people anymore they started screwing us over. The contract says they can’t change your schedule with in 74 hours but they would change it overnight so we were supposed to be there at 7 but overnight they would change it to 6 so we kept getting lates and penalties so we said screw it and quit like everyone else was driven to do"
bad,"Worst place I’ve ever worked for, management plays favorites and your not allowed to get sick or you get dropped to part time. Will never work for this company again."
bad,Has been a huge challenge getting acclimated and feeling welcomed. Huge lack of partnership. Broken management and corrupt system. I would not recommend this as a healthy work environment
bad,"They don't care about family thats why they made it double accountability to call in holdiays, tired of being out of work half of the year. They change everything on you without warning any of their hourly associates."
bad,"Unsupported,  extreme responsibility on lower management.  Rarely do you see upper Management working. Not a good place to work.  Upper Management is not supportive."
bad,Was good at first. Frlt like you had to be a brown nose to get a job in a different department. You get promised to a position and it's given to someone else
bad,"Lots of BS to put up with. Used to be a good place to work. Can't trust all managers. If management wants you gone, you're GONE!!! Extremely focused on the ""One Best Way"", even if it defies logic and common sense! May NOT be the ""Best way""! Management seems more focused on style rather than substance. As long as you appear to be doing what ""they"" want, you're safe, even if it doesn't necessarily cause desired results. Watch your back around here!"
bad,"When I first started with the company I thought it was going to be great! Unfortunately they immediately lowered all the benefits, took away several days of our PTO and hired poor managers  that just treated everyone horribly. We were treated poorly and shown no respect!"
bad,No clear direction. Upper management is comprised of yes-men looking for somebody to blame. The first step up into management is not even a dollar raise.
bad,The manager I had ignored the company wide standards and the people who work for her suffer for it.  The job also suffers for it and she doesn't realize its because she doesnt follow company standards.
bad,"just a basic job that can work around any kind of schedule with school, kids, etc, pay is okay. management is terrible and corporate rules are terrible"
bad,Poor management and communication skill with employees. Work many hours. Salary pay. Learned many skills. Enjoyed working with customers and seeing friendly faces.
bad,"Your just a number there unless you are friends with one of the managers. I was there for a year order filling, and could not get moved or new training. A guy came in six months after me that was friends with one of the managers.  And he only had half as much time there as i did and he got moved. It's all in who you know. Managers play favorites, some people can get away with anything.  point i started losing my drive to move product."
bad,"If you need a easy job, and don't care if your mental health goes down the drain then work for this soul sucking company. a typical day at work is stressful and full of abuse."
bad,"Hardest company I have ever worked for,they do not care about the employees,preaching safety first but dot not follow through themself. I have developed a hernia, nothing was done about it."
bad,"They got rid of the overnight crew, which now makes it so less work gets done. The reason they got rid of overnights was because they didn’t want to pay them the extra $1.50 for working overnight anymore. Also management does nothing and has no idea what is going on in the store."
bad,"This company likes to use and abuse their managers until they are completely spent.  It was fine when I was younger, without a family.  Having children made this job difficult."
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible, don’t have a family or get married or get injured because they will NOT work with you. They expect you to go above and beyond with no extra help"
bad,"Only accept a job here if you have literally no other option. Even fast food employers their employees better. If you're desperate to be treated like you're disposable, have no voice, and are just a paid slave, then apply to one of the factories in town. At least you would be making decent money."
bad,"The work-home balance is terrible. They pressure you into pulling overtime and explain that you must not want it and enough if you're not willing to pull 16 hour days. Blatant favoritism and they don't care about your job history. Management is a joke. If you go to them with a problem, they tell you to ""get used to working on your own and fixing it by yourself"". They fire you if you miss work for grieving the loss of a family member. Yes,  you get to learn a lot if you choose to, but that's the only perk. I was verbally abused on a daily basis about how I don't know anything even though I was fully self-taught and only learned because I asked questions. DON'T DO IT!"
bad,Every year they take more and more away from the employees and expect more and more from them at the same time. this was my experience in Columbus. It may be different elsewhere.
bad,No advancement for people that really want it.  There is too many favorites there. they only promote people that kiss butt around there. That is not a place to work if you want to make some money. You will live paycheck to paycheck
bad,"Too many rules, unrealistic goals, lack of organization, rude managers, denying requests for days off, unappreciated hard work,  bad attitudes from coworkers, and the point system is unreasonable."
bad,"The management was horrid to work with. Super unprofessional, rude, and all around unpleasant people to work with let aline be around. I would always finish my task and managment would always set you ub for failure by lack of communication."
bad,I left this place cause it was a joke 60 cent was the door greeter every morning People need to stop stealing cars out of the parking lot I just didn't feel safe And they just didn't care
bad,"my time at walmart was degrated constantly by management i stuck it out for years taking there#@!, many times ive made reports with ethics and the open door policy, i finaly gave a letter of resignation and they held my paycheck for three months, i finaly had to call the labor board to get paid, now theyve listed me as terminated, they are a hatefull co. And control freaks.ffreaksfreaks.notmmemtion"
bad,"The front-end management at Walmart in West Rome is extremely unprofessional. No one was treated fairly, I believe I was treated the most unfair out of everyone despite how well I did my job. I absolutely loved interacting with customers and making their day simply by conversing with them and making sure their items are bagged how they would prefer. I reached out to those in a higher position, but they didn't take me seriously. I would never recommend anyone to work as a front-end cashier in West Rome Walmart due to my awful experience."
bad,When I first started my job as a service Tech at Walmart I Loved it. I love working on cars and being around cars. The job itself was great and simple to me. The management team needs work. They do not look after their employees and do not care about your personal life even if it is an emergency. You're just another replaceable cog in their system and will have your position filled within a day.
bad,"The company doesn’t offer holiday pay!! So you have to work pharmacy or use your own paid time off to cover those hrs not worked. I started with great techs showing me how the system, company ran but everyone left. I got stuck with lazy techs whom been there for 5,10+ yrs yet seem to accept any responsibility for their actions. Horrible team ethics in pharmacy"
bad,"I have absolutely nothing to say about my time at Walmart except work there if you want 11 bucks a hour. the managers are awful, and the people do not appreciate you."
bad,"Walmart is extremely big company, the management there is terrible, they do not care about our safety, our health, our well being, mental health, all they care about is money and having numbers. They also do not let you have breaks if you took one they would pull you into the office and tell you you're not allowed to take a lunch, even though it is state law they are suppose to allow their employees lunch as the orientation stated, they don't follow it."
bad,I would not recommend Walmart for any reason . It has changed a much over the years and upper corporate overlooks the most important part of all. You the one who makes it all happen.
bad,"Employer made me sign an agreement to not make public the reason why i feel betrayed by them."
bad,"Severely understaffed, but company expects workers to pick up the slack. Company has ever-changing rules which only change to benefit the company. Would not recommend!"
bad,"Poor management, not a company that is if have a family that you can count on being secure. Very much against family values. Does not appreciate a hard working on time employee."
bad,"i wouldnt work here more than a year... it literally drains your soul slowly "
bad,The company allows Pharmacy managers to bully technicians. The pay is ok but the expectations are unrealistic. They run on a skeleton crew which results in very poor customer service
bad,Upper management does not care about anything but the selves. Expectations are higher for certain people and they only cater to the ones that keep there mouth shut if you try and speak out your brushed under the rug and expected to hang the moon. Very minimal communication.
bad,Walmart it's pays good but it does not care about you and the workers.it cares about money there's no  payed holidays.they suck!!!! I work for this company for 15 years. I started on the weekend shift 3:30 in morning till 4:00 in  the afternoon for 2 1/2 years before I transferred to the weekdays 4:00am till 2:pm .started out as a Putaway driver. I putaway stock comming for the dreceived
bad,You learn to work with the people that are hard working and stay away from those who aren’t. Management is constently giving you side tasks then wonder why on earth you didn’t finish stocking what ever product its your job to stock. The vast majority of people are only here a couple of months if that because no one wants to stay and deal with their garbage. If they would leave us alone and let us d our jobs the turn over rate would be much lower
bad,Management will not follow OBW. Advancement depends on how well you kiss up to management not how well your doing your job or how much money you make for the company.
bad,Over the last two years it has become slavery aka get down or lay down for management it’s plain disrespectful the amount of hours expected not for the customers but for someone temporary who will string you along and either leave the company or region before you get what they promised. It didn’t happen to me but I have watched plenty of managers fall victim to it along with losing their families and health
bad,The employees are stretched to the limit and as for myself I don't feel appreciated. The home office don't want to give hours so besides all of our extra work we have customers yelling and cussing us out for things we have no control over.
bad,"Very difficult place to work. Dealing with customers is very overwhelming and i feel like we are targeted by customers. Customers say rude and nasty things to us because they think they can get away with it because managers do not stand up for us. I have been told very offensive comments by a customer in front of a manager and the manager ignored what they said to me and was overly nice to the customer even though they insulted me for no reason.  Employees need to feel appreciated and respected by management because if the customers see managers being rude and nasty to us, they think they can do the same."
bad,In my 8 years of working for this company I had to fight every day for my job. Management is made up of undeserving yes men who treat others as their personal do boys.
bad,"As a part-time associate this job really wasn't that bad. Even if you're a younger kid looking for a part-time job this really isn't a bad place to work. If your career focused or college-educated stay as far away from this place is humanly possible. The field positions are completely ridiculous they make the "
bad,very an organized. over worked and under payed  treat you that you are just a number as they say to us all time. management are not there for you when you need them
bad,"A high workload and demand is placed upon you while they pay you very little and give you no appreciation for the work you do. The only way to get promoted here is not by doing your job and being good at it but to make sure you are managements favorite, so if you are someone who treats the job as a job and just gets things done don't expect to move up here, if you are someone who likes to talk to the boss and make them your friend then you will be all set. Not worth the time or effort, avoid this company all together."
bad,Negative atmosphere. Poor management. People do what they want. District supervisors are not pharmacists and come from background of loss prevention. Spend more time trying to bust people then to support.
bad,"Dont go unless you literally never want to have time for anything other than sleep. Super hard labor on the body. They say 10 hour shifts but you will work 12+ religiously. They write you up for everything and show favoritism when it comes to career advancement and in the same breath say they are setting you up for ""success"" when all I see is failure. Working for this company showed me how much doesn't value employees. Revolving door... cant wait to quit"
bad,"As a store standards associate, you get treated as less than everyone else. Management is constantly down your throat and other employees put all their work on you, no matter what their job is. It's a stressful environment that creates a negative impact on a workers mental health."
bad,This job made me feel like a modern day slave. Management sucked here and the managers higher up did not care about the associates and it showed. I would never work there again!
bad,"I worked at walmart for a while,my coworkers were great helping me start out. But management has favourites no doubt about it. I would watch as they didn't tell them anything when they were lazy.The favourites got away with anything and while the hard working employees got no recognition."
bad,"you don't get 10% off EVERYTHING like they say on their postings.. if it's on sale, you don't get any discount.. your no better then the customer."
bad,Unless you don't have a family you are fine. What I've learned they don't care they care about numbers and people on the floor. Not the mentally of their employees. Don't be a cashier.
bad,"Some managers are willing to work with your schedule, but most wont. They're not understanding AT ALL about families, or family emergencies. Their employee ""discount"" is a joke, it doesn't work on most basic essentials, like food. "
bad,Is not a comfortable place to work. Managers do whatever they want and nothing flows respectfully. If anything happens in the workplace with you the entire place knows about it.
bad,"Home office has no clue about being in a store but wants to micromanage."
bad,Many times I was told to work in departments in which I had no training or prior knowledge. Management wants some departments looking good while others suffer heavily. Coworkers were fun and easy to work with. Hours were flexible unless you are a student then they don’t know how to manage a schedule.
bad,I have worked for Walmart for 18 years. Started out a great place to work but the last 3 years Walmart has changed and not for the better.They don't give the support that it needed.
bad,Very bad. Bad management not good at all never willing to help everyone doesn’t help as a team not a great place to work the environment is really toxic
bad,"After 4+ years of working I still got paid less than a new hire, and never got my full-time benefits for working full-time. The job wasn't what drove me out of the job, but the management and how the stores management treated its employees on a daily basis drove a dedicated worker out. If I had learned anything if walmart keeps on going the way it is now... They will become a stain on the retail industries history book."
bad,Very hostile and uncomfortable management was not helpful and all they did was gossip and pushed the work onto the new people hope your store is better
bad,Mgt is rude and tends to play favorites. Often the mgt doesn't know how to preform the tasks the expect you to know. Pay isn't worth the workload. Often asked to do the work of more than two people. Any bonuses earned are mitigated by mgt like cutting your hours before its payed out. Difficult to get days off. The only up side is the co workers.
bad,"It’s just not enough, over worked and extremely under paid! No family time have to work all holidays (except Christmas) which your not receiving extra pay for!"
bad,"I got sick this fall and had to call off four days total (two separate months), had doctors excuses for all of them, and they still all counted against me. Combine that with 2 migraines in two months and one family emergency, and I am being fired."
bad,They treat you poorly even if you get hurt on the job. They talk bad to you and put you down. They will continue to lie to you just to make you think they are going to work with you.
bad,"Walmart is all about management. If a manager likes you, and is liked by their fellow managers, you'll have a great experience. If one of those two is not true, then prepare for the worst. You can be the hardest worker in the store, the backbone of your department, respected and liked by your coworkers..... but if you're not a favorite, you are a scapegoat, a target. You could be the worst worker in the world, sit on an electric cart all night chatting and eating with other employees, never touching a box or tool.... if you're a favorite, you'll get a raise, and maybe an award. "
bad,"I worked at one of the grocery store locations and it was, by far, the most stressful, anxiety-indusing place I have ever worked. Management refused to take responsibility for their mistakes and they frequently insulted and demoralized their staff."
bad,"I was an asm for 6 years, during that time, the company changed the focus of what they thought was important. We saw many individuals lose their jobs, and restructuring-- only to bring the same positions back but calling it something else."
bad,Getting transferred to the Jefferson Walmart was the worst experience of my working life. The store manager was rude and unfair to her associates. Associates talked down to each other. It was the worst work atmosphere I have ever seen.
bad,When I first started the company it was a great place headed in the right direction. The pay at the time was above minimum wage and it was a lot of respect from management.  Now management is disrespectful and don’t respect their associates.  Company has went into the ground.
bad,"Walmart sucks! Won’t hire full time associates anymore , don’t want to come off the benefits,.but they’ll work uslike dogs. I’m noticing now, there’s never any cashiers when we need em,.Walmart wants their customers to work for them for free, self checkout,..Not Me! I no longer do business with their cheap tails and sure won’t ever work for them again !"
bad,Must have thick skin to work there. If you like high pressure and constant flow of activity and lots of responsibilities then you'll probably like working here. If retail is not your chosen career path don't work there longer then 3 years.
bad,The store I worked at the management were not on the same page and caused so much stress and unwillingness to help that I had to leave. Definitely lacking teaching for there associates even when moving up your put into a fend for yourself job
bad,Constantly filled with drama and politics. None of the other workers were willing to work. Would often high in the bathroom. Holding it up for people who actually had to use the bathroom. Management is a joke beside HR. Constant policy changes. Employees purposely trying to work above their work restrictions so they could use the corporation. No opportunity to advance. Only way to advance is transfer to another store that was hours away. Probably the  worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"Stressful being replaced by technology and robots. Working hours and not getting paid for them.Constantly cutting hours for employees,Poor customer service."
bad,I had fun working with most of the employees there. The job got boring at times if you had all your work done. Most of the management was good and helpful
bad,I worked at the company for 8 years and was an incredibly loyal employee. I was working on promoting and had been given multiple excellent evaluations. My time ended after I had reported that I was being harassed by another associate. They had been calling me repeatedly and threatening me. Once I reported it I was terminated shortly after with no reason.
bad,"I received little to no job training in the first two months and the section was understaffed. They expected me to do a job I didn't know how to do, which was extremely disheartening to work in."
bad,"Once you join the company you are just a body, not a person anymore. They will always let you know you can be replaced. You will have to cover multiple areas plus be able to jump on register to check out customers. You have very little help but are required to get alot done."
bad,"definitely a cliq- type atmosphere with this company. impossible for part timers to get any advancement much less respect. the managers and assistants don't care, because they are told from home office to keep wages and raises down, The manager staff are only appreciative of the ones that come in and kiss their butt, regardless of work ethic. I tried to move up to management, but they used a rule that they had never told me about to get rid of me because I had called hr on a fellow employee who was abusing other employees. so they blackballed me and showed me the door. never again."
bad,"If you wanna work at a place where management picks their favorites and gives you inconsistent hours, then you've come to the right place. Also, who doesn't love stress? Physically, emotionally? This is the right job for you. You will meet great co-workers though, they are the reason I stayed so long. I will honestly miss those people, but with how exhausting this place is with how its run, it's better to get out, and I'm glad I did."
bad,"My coworkers.... "
bad,"The pay is the best thing about Walmart, everything else is terrible. Walmart has specific policies that are not followed by management, for example maintenance isn’t supposed to get shopping carts from the lot yet everyday you will be required to do this as well as empty the outdoor trash cans which is the responsibility of an outside contractor or the cart pushers"
bad,"I stock merchandise overnight and the amount of freight moved is insane at times.  Our store is very profitable, so we have to really work hard to keep the shelves properly stocked.  The culture and morale is low amongst most employees because they feel poorly treated and undervalued by management."
bad,"The management was inappropriate and fired me because my coworker/ friend had a crush om me and not her and she let me stock Diary/frozen by myself which caused me to fall back, Didn't train me."
bad,Store manager does not back up his assistants. No teamwork among assistants. Poor communication. Assistant schedules not available until the week of work
bad,"If you have left last resort to work then only choose walmart otherwise it is not at all a good place to work "
bad,"Worked there for many years. It changed my life and not for the better. So many, many, many rules and if they didn’t know the answer they would make one up. A lot of favoritism and poor management. You get wrote up for anything and everything. Save yourself the hassle and stress...find a job where you are treated like an adult and not a child."
bad,"Awful management, awful co workers. Horrible scheduling, zero communication skills whatsoever Personal didnt accept my new scheduling hours so homelife was very very difficult especially with kids"
bad,They cutted my hours down to 24 hrs when I have kids I couldn't afford working only 24 hrs a week. The management will say your a hard worker and do that the next day not worth working there
bad,"Walmart showed discrimination toward me regarding a medical condition. Until then, I had no issues with my job there at all. They would not reschedule e while I still needed to use a cane."
bad,This Walmart has the worst management ever they like to target many people are aren’t consistent in enforcing rules. They’ll let things slide for other associates but the ones they don’t like they’ll pop them immediately. This Walmart management also has no problems firing an already low staffed team and still expected us to finish the same tasks. Many people have quit or transferred positions because of how this management team targets cap 2. Also for what this cap 2 team goes through they need higher wages... MINUMN $15 hour
bad,I started off as a truck unloaded in  May of 2013. My job duties were loading and unloading trucks. Stocking shelves on the sales floor. Customer assistance when needed. I did that for a year and then I became a customer service manager in June of 2014. My job duties were running the front end of a busy Walmart store. Making sure cashiers were on the clock on register or receiving breaks on timeonlunchesntime
bad,"Extreemly stressful, almost daily verbal abuse from management as well as older employees whoes been there for many years.  Lots of bullying. Atmosphere very negative. Not understandable if you require change or accomidations to health issues. "
bad,I was informed before I took the job I could transfer when it came down to the time to transfer I was told I couldn't until I was there 6 months and no one would show me how to do so. Breaks were usually a hour plus late or skipped completely
bad,Walmart absolutely does not care about the customer or the associate who works for them. I'm saddened to have wasted 2 years of my life on them. I do not recommend working for Walmart.
bad,"It was okay. There was good things, most people were good. It's a job for desperate people, and most seemed to try to work to a point to get out. "
bad,"Working for Walmart should be a relatively easy job. But the fact is it isn't. Between management having very little interest in actually getting the store running properly, and corporate doing everything it can to cut costs and make themselves more money while making the job harder and harder for normal associates."
bad,They make you work job titles and pay grades above what they hire you for and dont pay you for the higher pay grade they train you for its really hard to get promoted and hard to get full time hours
bad,"I seriously hated working at Wal-Mart, job title was ok but they way management handled their workers sucked. I Would never work there again."
bad,"While there were a few decent managers who really tried, most of the management seemed disinterested and or ignorant of the behavior of lower level managers who were largely ill tempered and scrambling to accomplish their assignments for which they were not qualified. They also generally did not have adequate staff, so their frustrations are understandable if not pleasant to endure."
bad,I don't recommend working there unless you have a strong stamina and not sensitive to constant criticism. Management has attitude problems and take it out on employees.
bad,Store manager here is very unstable.  When you 1st meet her you think she's the most perfect person in the world then she changes just like Jekyll and Hyde.  She tries to run the store on fear.  And speaks down to every individual in the store.
bad,"It was never a easy day."
bad,After many years of working for walmart they have made a lot of cuts. Recently they cut many associates that had been with them for over 20 years. They have absolutely no loyalty to the many associates that have dedicated their life to making Walmart successful. Not long ago I would have told you that it is a great job.
bad,"Not a very good company, they treat their employees unfair and with very little incentive, paid very little for the amount of work i complete. The management does not communicate correctly with employees"
bad,"Management is terrible, coworkers suck, and trying to move up is unfair. If you try too hard to move up, they will search for any reason to fire you instead."
bad,Do not Never work for Walmart . It was so bad . The managers to do employees like bad . And people are stupid at Walmart they did not know want go on at Walmart . Walmart should get shut down like Kmart did . All they want to do let people go at Walmart . Because of the robot come to Walmart .
bad,"Walmart doesn’t care about you!!! When I started you had 9 sick day/late days a year. Now it down to 5 points a year. How?!? Things happen these days. I never been soo broke in my life. Walmart tax your check sooo bad. Your check will average $500, when you pay your bills. You have no money to buy groceries or even gas. You can’t survive."
bad,Since hurricane management has went downhill... with so many people leaving we are extremely shorthanded and now expected to do the work of 10 ... no appreciation ever...
bad,Do 8 jobs for the price of 1 and than be promised advancement for years until you're finally burnt out. People you work with are dramatic and only 40% of the people they hire can do the job
bad,"When I started at walmart it was great place to work, like any other job there are goals to meet which I'm okay with but then slowly staff was cut more and more. With same job demand it has become tough to work daily tasks and meet daily goals."
bad,"While i was working there i wasn't trained for about 2 weeks when the mangers were supposed to train me. finally they had enough complaining from me and had someone who wasn't authorized to train me, train me. The managers never care about your requests and seems like they only look at you like you're a pawn on a chess board."
bad,This company it's an expert exploiting workers. No chances to grow up because they look for external people to fill up management positions. For this company full time means only 30 hours by week.
bad,"Was put into the job with very little direction.  Managers were giving conflicting ways of handling various duties and other employees lwould stand in front of the customers telling me I was not doing something right.  There was never a meeting between the parties that clarified instruction and procedures so everyone was on the same page.  Benefits were good but I found management and other employees were Saying one thing to your face and another behind your back.  I understand this is just personalities, hopefully in just one store, but it makes it hard to get up and go to work and look forward to having a great day."
bad,"The Walmart culture has to be experienced to be believed. The only thing not monitored is respiration rate. Pharmacists do not get the respect I’m used to. Supervisors tend review the Pharmacy using Tech information over Pharmacist input. Supervisors encourage Pharmacists to just follow Corporate concepts, and to “forget everything they ever learned” before coming to Walmart. The Company is so frightened by the “Me Too” movement, that they will investigate any unsupported comments or gossip uttered by anyone. This creates a generally unhappy walking on egg shells environment. Metrics used to follow work rate are misused by those who understand the system. Some Supervisors believe they can do quality analysis using video and other off-site data alone. That’s sketchy at best."
bad,"Seemed that Store management was under a lot of stress to produce. Very tense situation once I moved into Department Management Job. There was always way to much work, not enough help and not enough time to get job done. Impossible to keep up and take care of what needed to be done on daily basis. the expectations for the amount of work required to complete each shift was not possible."
bad,"job is not too great. you will be over worked, management will not care or listen to you. all they want is numbers and more numbers even if you are one of the best in the department. would not recommend, unless you want to be treated as slaves."
bad,"Managment at walmart really doesn't care about their workers or any problem they have until it becomes and inconvenience to them and they HAVE to act. In which case they'll just straight up coach or fire you cause it makes their life easier. And thats if they even know what they are coaching you for as one of my previous managers gave me a coaching for a ""lack of productivity"" even though I'd done twice the work he thought I had and when he actually saw that after coaching me, didn't have the balls to man up and admit that he made a mistake and reverse the coaching. And their expectation of what people should be able to accomplish is ridiculous."
bad,I made new friends there but management was not good at the time. I worked hard and was harassed constantly. I do not know what stress they were under but they needed a stress management class and activity. The management needed supervision over them.
bad,"Managers, don’t respect associates, to much work not according to the salary, very stressful ambiance...Arbitrary schedules without respecting associate availability, etc"
bad,Since starting at the beginning of Summer 2018... the store had gone through a remodel and 2 different policy changes. The pay isn’t ideal for the amount of work you put into your job. There are always new workers and no proper training. There was never enough coverage in any department. Your work goes unnoticed and under appreciated.
bad,"At one time it was a very nice place to work. When corporate got more involved, the place took a dive. Now, I would not recommend it to anyone who might want a job there."
bad,I am not a fan of this place. This place is worse than high school. There is more drama here than a teenager. This place is a huge stresser. The management there isn't a team.
bad,This is a tough company to work for. Never any appreciation for your hard work. Very negative atmosphere. Morale is generally pretty low. You deal with a lot of negative feedback from customers due to poor management decisions.
bad,"I worked maintenance for 12 yrs"
bad,The culture is good but the pay is beyond awful. We were always short handed creating a very stressful environment. You hardly ever got a break because you were too busy. I felt under appreciated and overwhelmed most days.
bad,This company has changed direction and no longer cares about the customer or associates. They pay well if you like the negative work environment. Good luck.
bad,"Walmart is a deàd end job, the pay is laughable, on overnights you find yourself with no help and like 11 pallets of freight that they expect you to finish."
bad,"Was trained for Asset Protection at 2 different stores, the store I was suppose to return to had major communication problems or lack of. I was turned down for the Asset Protection position at another location. Was absolutely discriminated against. Want my job back and want some answers from Management. 18 years of Law Enforcement experience, and never called in or missed a day. Just denied hardship status."
bad,"Instead of a positive tax return I instead owe money. After working at Walmart for 4 months I owed the IRS 80 dollars. My brother worked the whole year and he owed excess of 500 dollars. Walmart was paying us too much to make our paychecks look nicer, and gave us debt. Management was also lazy and unreliable."
bad,"Employees sexually harassed me and the few other women that worked there and managers never did anything about it. If you were a good worker, you had to of course pick up the slack because 80% of the employees there are lazy and horrible. Underpaid, overworked, disgusting work environment. Would NEVER recommend someone unless I hated them."
bad,I enjoyed my job duties but the management team was beyond ridiculous and spent more time talking behind people's backs rather than doing their jobs. Many ethics issues and borderline harassment but no one really seemed to care. Team building exercises were beyond childish and may as well have been in a day care. If you want time off or weekends off forget it even if you request time off for your own wedding it'll be denied.
bad,"During my time working at Walmart, I experienced a total lack of dutiful management, and employee mental state seemed to be very grim/depressing. Job security, and some corporate rules, give employees the ability to feel content. Under its current management/practice, I would not recommend anyone I know to work at the same Walmart as I did. Also, my review does not apply to the entire Walmart corporation, just the Walmart Super Center at Comstock Park."
bad,"The experience varied, was good at times, like first company to promote me and the managers, when they liked me, tried very hard to help me/my career. Then at other times, it was the worst place to work and management was a joke. You work your butt off, for very little compensation, while the slackers get to continue the slack with no repercussions."
bad,"It's not a bad job for retail, but the company is uncaring and cold by nature. Their policy is to fire anyone who misses 4 days in 6 months (8 if you can make it past that) and nothing can save you. I saw a manger of 11 years fired because they wouldn't approve her time off and she had to attend her 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S BRAIN SURGERY. she was fired. for THAT. Others were fired for taking too long to recover after a miscarriage, and of course there's the ones that get the flu and can't come into work, and not even a doctors note can excuse you. Walmart if an unfeeling machine and even at it's best you can tell that if you couldn't keep up it would steamroll right over you. don't work here unless you're desperate, and don't fall for the fake HR speech. in walmart it's keep up or get out."
bad,"You can't trust your managers, they will tell you lies. It is all about them and not you or the customer, as long as corporate don't know. That is how they operate."
bad,"None of the managers or supervisors were professional. They were all rude, didnt know how to talk to their employees, and favoritism was huge. Not only that, but all of my coworkers were ghetto, nosy, didnt know their place, tried to micromanage, etc. Sometimes they would forget to send you on your lunch or break and even after reminding them they still didnt care. None of the managers even know what theyre doing. The stockers ordered too much inventory and if you were a cashier they wouldnt give a rats a^^ if you had an extremely long line. They would leave you up front all by yourself. I tried moving to a different position and they kept giving me bs excuses about how i wasnt working there long enough when they gave my coworkers the position i wanted while they were only there for 2 months ;^)"
bad,As an individual no one is valued here everyone is seen as replaceable but the turn over rate proves that's not true...The guidelines the company gives us are good but implementing them in problematic stores with hardly any associates isn't possible.
bad,"Walmart is not a good place to work. No matter your store location or position, there is always drama. That is the Walmart culture. It is actually really sad."
bad,"I'm short there is no training, most of management Is incompetent, raises and promotion based on favoritism, getting a day off is impossible due to no coverage, expected to work the multiple jobs at once."
bad,"Walmart understaffs regularly, but still finds it necessary to cut your hours. Management is horrible. They don't seem to feel the importance to tackle existing issues. They hire many lazy people that need to be babysat. There is ABSOLUTELY no appreciation for being a dedicated, hard working person because you will make the exact same money as the last people that seem to call in or are repeatedly late. Worst company ever! Oh, and the customers are rude as well."
bad,You never have time with your Family on weekends or holidays you always working and the management could care less. I would never work there again....
bad,I had a vey bad experience at Walmart. management was horrible. I didn't get the hours I need to get by. they wouldn't work around my school schedule and I would go weeks without being called in
bad,Walmart is a fun job to work at. You meet and help so many people that they almost start to feel as if they are your family. What I learned from the job was time management but overall it was fun but it was time to move on.
bad,"They are more worried about money to care for the employees and customers. The way you are told to do your job by home office in a time frame is not a reachable time frame unless you cut big corners and don't take lunch and breaks on time. They are 2 faced and have favorites. The management is very vengfull but "" they don't do this stuff here"" is biggest lie ever told. I use to love it there and now can't stand it because it just gets more complicated. The customer sees part of how bad it is now try working in that horrible it is."
bad,"The management dont care about you, they are rude and your always replaceable. They do have good benefits for you and the pay is decent, they just have too many managers."
bad,"The Service Manager in Automotive is an idiot. A Drug addict in tire Service. Lazy co workers, who call in and never get punished. Back Stabbing work environment, and Manager Favoritism. Auto Techs work side jobs for cash using the Auto Care Center tools and equipment in evenings. Techs sell tires for cash and inventory are always off."
bad,"Everyday Was Draining And Hard . I Learned A Couple Different Things Working There A Couple Things Are That Giving Respect Earns Respect , Minding Your Business Lets You Go A Long Way And Also How To Stay Focused . But Everything About The Job Is Hard . And The Most Enjoyable Part About The Job Is Lunch Time And Clocking Out ."
bad,"Been in every position with Walmart. This company sucks. people who shop, or work there study you like your some kind of wild animal. If your lazy on day 1 welcome home. If you work hard be ready to be talked to any kind of way and fired if your back hurts while they allow affirmative action employees judge you."
bad,they are cutting everyone's hours they are also removing jobs so less likely to be hired more likely to be fired they removed in house hr and the asset protection manager goes after the employees instead of the people walking out of the store with tvs games and such other sites may differ
bad,Management talks to you like you're 3 years old. Pile on as much work as possible. No recognition. It's also like being in high school. Everyone talks about everybody.
bad,"Unless you're severly desperate, I don't recommend Walmart. They don't ""hands on"" train enough. If the customers like you, management doesn't. They enforce work time between breaks, if you work more time than allowed before a break they will write you up, but if you remind them you're supposed to have a break, they ""punish"" you. If you answer a customers question, even as simple as restroom location, while off the clock, they punish you. You're supposed to be customer oriented but you're not allowed to be."
bad,"not enough associates for the floor always under staffing and over working the associates , customers always complaining thats it not enough associates in the store for help."
bad,I had worked with this company off and on for 11 years and I enjoyed being able to help customers and interact with them as well. Management is  always disrespectful and don’t help their employees. They treat them as if they don’t remember the struggle to get to the top and treat you like your beneath them!
bad,My time as a walmart employee has been okay in the beginning in was interesting cause it was new but after a month or so it was repetitive and overall an un enjoyable work experience
bad,Management sucks.  Nobody in management backs the associates. All managers are prepared go lose their jobs.They promote based on who their buddies are. They are cutting hours and reducing benifits.
bad,"In order to get promoted to a management position, you would have to know the managers from different markets. Market managers wouldn’t care about the associates in the stores just the work getting done, and would fire them even if nothing was their fault."
bad,"Good luck getting a raise. $0.23 after 1 year. They are extremely abusive, and force you to work understaffed, and threaten to coach you on a daily basis (write up). Day & night shift blame one another for tasks not completed. I had less drama in Middle School. You'll have 3 or more different managers telling you to do several different things, and none of them communicate with one another so you'll always be wrong to someone."
bad,Walmart was the worst company I've ever worked for. They don't care about their employees at all. There's a complete lack of communication within the company.
bad,Nothing good to say Not a good place to work at too many young management that don’t know what they’re doing Would not tell anybody to go to work at Walmart  at lease in Chambersburg
bad,"The company cares only about money. The employees are treated inhumanely by expecting them to do above possible and harrassed when they cannot. They stay undertaffed to save money and they cut hourly associates hours. This is a heartless company. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The stores are in complete choas because they don't have enough associates and they continue to cut hours and positions. There is arguing, fighting, blaming, and nervous break downs behind the scene!"
bad,"- Unrealistic expectations from managers;"
bad,Management has their favorites. You can do your job and youll still get written up. Other people can goof off and get away with it. I wouldnt even let my worst enemy work there. Their not for the customer theyre for the sales and thats it. They are not for their workers theyre for sales. Theyre not caring they dont care whos toes they step on to get yheyre sales
bad,"Nothing to tell thank you, a job is a job. If you are looking for a job for experience they will Hire you no matter no experience what so ever. Noting enjoyable about it. Management expect more but they are okay. Noting hard just heavy work"
bad,To advance you have to be friends with management. Overall the company doesn't care about employees or their needs. If you get injured and can't afford to see a doctor before the insurance kicks in you will likely lose your job
bad,"Honestly walmart was torture for me "
bad,"The managers made the job sucky. The stress per day before you even clock in wasn’t even worth the time. The pay was not that bad though, especially for the location."
bad,Bad company to work for not equal on employment opportunities as far as you upscaling up never will happen unless you suck up to managers if they like you will succeed if not you will be stuck in same position for ever I feel sorry for people who still stuck for 10yrs and + years ... I only threw away 5yrs of my life with this company took me 4yrs before I became full time and new hired people will start  higher pay
bad,"Management is awful. They belittle you, talk down to you & embarrass you. The people I worked with were horrible, lying, backstabbing individuals. I would not recommend working here unless you like crying at the end of every shift."
bad,If you want to feel unappreciated overworked and and disrespected than this is the workplace for you. Walmart doesn’t care about their employees only about the money. They allow Managers and Support Managers to talk to employees like they are dogs. So I wouldn’t recommend this job to even my enemy
bad,There is no communication between management and all hourly associates. With the three latest's incidents at Wal-Mart there has been no training of updates from anyone. Extremely poor communications.
bad,"St"
bad,I was treated very unfairly do to my mental health. I take great pride in my work I always have. I take my doctor appointment seriously. I take my medicine daily and little by little I am doing better. I believe I would be a great fit. Dogs are great for someone like me with anxiety. I grew up on a farm so I know hard work. My grandpa always say time for work and time for play.
bad,Walmart doesn't care about you having a home life. It is very hard to get a weekend day off. Even when you put in a request it often gets denied unless it's for vacation. And even then it still will most likely be denied.
bad,"It was a tough job that paid well."
bad,"I cant speak for all Walmart's but the one I worked for the management was horrible, very inconsistent always blamed everyone else for problems , never took action. To many people not knowing their boundaries of their job and would never honor your availability. I called in 2 days and because 1 person didnt get the call in they locked me out of the system and I even snap shotted the confirmation."
bad,"We are not in a good area so we work harder, I like some of the people I work with. I have learned that some people are nice and many or not. Management sucks."
bad,Associate moral has steadily declined in the past 5 years because you have no communication between management and the company keeps taking little things here and there from their associates. So at this point the long term associates that have put in the hard work are now walking out on the job because they are fed up with how they have been treated. There is no associate appreciation anymore at all.
bad,"At first Walmart was a good place to work, it was fun and most everyone wanted to come to work. It was until recently, that things have taken a turn south. The culture has moved to a you need to do more with less mindset, we are to push our associates hard and Id they don't work hard enough we are to coach them out of their job. No matter how hard you try, nothing is ever good enough . Myself and my fellow assistants had the pleasure of being told we were not worth the money we are paid."
bad,Definitely almost everyone I've met has worked here. Smaller town so you see the craziest things. Really wish the pay was a lot better though. I didn't mind making a few great friends though.
bad,This place is based on like a high school clique. If u know the right people then u fit In. If u don’t know the right people u get dumped on which means they give u there work plus the workers they like there work. Not all but a lot of the managers and supervisors were rude and ignorant. They talk down on u and push and push for u to do your work. Not understanding that situation happen where u can’t do it on time. Like assistanti g customers.
bad,"If you don’t have to, don’t do it! It looks good from the outside but once you are in they will use you and abuse you to their benefit. Never tell them if you know how to do more than one thing. Why? Cause you will be doing management work for the pay of a cashier. It’s not worth it. Unless you want ant to be bald in the future."
bad,"This company is all about the money and care nothing about its associates. Management is supposed to be robots, never get sick, work long hours and not have a work life balance. She company also participates in the good ole boys club. They run your ragged changing directions several times a day and setting unrealistic goals sometimes. Its mentally exhausting. You leave defeated daily. They make it hard to bonus but expects you to work 60+ hours per week."
bad,"From my experience I don't reccomend you will be worked and overworked, then later on down road have your hours cut. My manager doesn't do anything when issues are brought to his attention. Unprofessional place not a pleasant place or good work environment in my opinion."
bad,"This is an okay job if you're looking for something better in the meantime, but it shouldn't be considered permanent if you're looking for a job where you can truly excel at something or make a difference. Management at the two locations I have worked at have been clueless about how to work with their employees and conduct business practices so that employee satisfaction, productivity, and customer experience are prioritized. The only thing prioritized are the store's bottom line and appearances. Workplace culture involves management telling you that everyone needs to work as a team and then not checking in while most of your ""team members"" proceed to actively work against you. "
bad,"If you want a job that is next thing to slave labor, than Walmart is for you.  They advertise flexible schedules and work/life balance.  You will work every single weekend, and when you ask for a day off or a weekend to yourself They will just threaten to cut your hours or write you up.  Some of the managers are good people, but others are idoits.  They yell at you to work faster and then are mad when someone gets hurt."
bad,Bad company to work for. I gave them 110% and that wasnt good enough.  I was blamed for people not doing their jobs on another shift. If you want some money go ahead and apply you might actually like it . I'm sure it was just my location.
bad,"The pay is good, that's it. Management is horrible, they don't care about their associates. Hours can be cut if they don't like you. They will get onto you if you don't get an assignment done, even if you get slammed with customers and can't get to anything. 0/10 would highly not recommend!!!"
bad,"My fellow associates are easy to get along with and the customers too. The management cares only about the profit and only that, always understaffed and then expect us to do the impossible and not get overtime."
bad,It's really not worth the time or effort management and costomers put you through. Management is lazy and likes to do nothing nor offer any help. If there's a 2 truck night and there's still freight in the back room it's always your fault. Management will not hesitate to write you up for the smallest thing. The associates are decent but management is a living joke
bad,A lot of people was not willing to do their part in order to have the daily tasks completed. It was always lazy work ethics shown by other and the nothing done to change these people work behavior.
bad,Great if you don't want to work much part time work travel 5 days a week for 30 hours  or less and don't need insurance and still live with mom and dad.
bad,Don't work here. You'll be unhappy.  Management doesn't care about family and they won't follow through. You can't rely on them to do what they say they will do.
bad,Worst job ever. Do not trust management. They use you everyday. And coach you for no reason. No holiday pay. Vacation s have been cut in half. Management always sides with management
bad,"I was being given 27 hours a week on top of the 30 hours in school, so my grades started dropping. People you were not my supervisor would frequently tell me what to do and it would be the opposite of what my actual supervisor would tell me to do. Hours were very long and i would often work alone. Fashion was awful you would have carts upon carts filled with clothes that you had to fold and hang right out of carts. moved my position without telling and i had no schedule for two weeks."
bad,I do not recommend this job to anyone unless you are desperate and even then there are better options. I got lucky and had a great manager but unless that happens life is a living migrainel.
bad,"You bust your butt, and then they say you don't work hard enough, always never good enough for them and they will write you up for nothing , always accused of not working hard enough"
bad,Am just tired of the poor management in my building. Cant wait to find another job. Everyday  there are so many changes which does not allow you to really learn anything new. And the schedule as as ASM really do not allow you to have are life at all.
bad,"Employees really need a union with the upcoming restructuring, many employees will be looking for new jobs. The management also has no idea how to run a business."
bad,Nobody cares and they'll just feed you sweet lies so you're stuck right where they want you. Managers yell at you and degrade you in front of customers and other employees. An absolute hostile work environment.
bad,"The managers at my store are very rude. They don’t know anything about customer service and simply don’t know how to make the customer happy which is one of our Phrases. I remember the other day the customer was trying to do a price match on our app and the CSM is the only one who can approve price overrides, so CSM came and didn’t wanna do it for them because it wasn’t showing up on the Walmart app but it was for them, and it was for me and I didn’t wanna argue with my manager so I said okay that’s fine, I won’t override anything and I apologised to the customer. Sadly, they got into an argument with the front end customer service manager so they wanted to speak to a higher level manager. The assistant manager came and he was so rude to them I was just in shock. He later turned to me and yell at me for no apparent reason. He’s like “Why can’t you just do the blank ( inappropriate language)   add match! It’s so simple just DO IT!” I was like in my head, “If I could just do it I would have done it by now!” The disrespect I got that day by an assistant manager was shocking and disgusting. He literally yelled  in front of everyone! People were stopping and staring and wondering why he was so mad! I was too!  It literally wasn’t my fault at all. The customers defended  me though! They said to him, “Hey! She didn’t do nothing wrong, there’s no need to take your anger out on her when she was just simply trying to help us!” And he just stared at them and I bet he couldn’t fathom their response and that’s why he left without even fixing the issue! He left so angry and he didn’t even"
bad,"break room was very loud. TV did not work 1/2 time due to no reception. lunches were stolen. soda machines were out 3/4 of time. could not hear TV when on because of loud cell phone use. IF you wanted some quiet, GO TO YOUR CAR."
bad,"I just quit this job about an hour ago. I worked their for 9 months, I started when I was 17 and I am 18 now. This job BLOWS. The people I met were truly amazing as co-workers, and I am so grateful to have gotten the chance to learn from them as a first job. I also learned this job pushes the limits of your body on the daily. I had to unload a 3,300 piece truck today with not enough people, or carts to put the stuff we unloaded onto. The management is awful and absolutely the worst kinds of people. My manager was a fat guy with a huge gold chain and a gold grill who acted like a gangster when his career was Walmart. He hires 17 year old kids and throws them in the juice aisle by themselves everyday and expects them to kill themselves every day. Today he tried me on the wrong day, after I worked for 5 hours without getting my 15 minute break or a 1 hour lunch break, he asked me if I wanted him to teach me how to do what I had already been doing for 5 hours. I said ""I f*cking quit bro"" threw my badge on the floor, and my vest in the trashcan for him to fish out for me. Even if you kill yourself working they still treat you like a newbie with no job experience who is lazy. I also got a horrible schedule. They started giving me 24 hours a week with my days all split up. So I would work 1 day then get 2 days off. That's not enough money for ANYBODY to survive unless they live in a cardboard box. So glad I left this toxic job. My advice to you is don't go for this position. You WILL be a slave. If it's a first job like it was for me, go for it. You'll learn how hard you can work,"
bad,"Lack of educated management, poor pay for employees depending on position, career advancement is nonexistent and absolutely no respect for hourly associates from salary management. If they feel their job is threatened by you they will find anyway to get rid of you and higher ups will not do anything about it."
bad,"The management is too young, the store manager himself is in his mid twenties. Working in store 2337 was a nightmare. Employees and management there are still mentally high schoolers. There are cliques, favoritism, “popular management”, and even bullies. The saddest part about it is, this is the biggest downfall of this store in such a prosperous county."
bad,"Either too many hours or not enough, you could work 35 hours one week and 6 hours the next. Horrible communication skills with upper management. A few good customer service managers. Bad work environment, made some good friends but horrible other than that."
bad,"The 6 months I was there for Walmart, I busted my butt everyday, 6 days in a row mandatory. If you get sick, forget about it. They don’t care for “excuses” and they don’t take doctors notes. Management didn’t care about any of the employees, only themselves. Only pro was the benefits. They don’t pay enough to put up with them."
bad,I worked in the shipping department for a few months loading 2 trailers by hand off conveyers. The trailers were extremely hot with no air flow examples if it were 100 degrees outside it was around 125 in the trucks. You are just a number and they could care less as long as you load the truck. They will promise you one thing and do something completely different behind your back.
bad,Management is bad and stressful and opportunity for growth is limited. The company also puts too much emphasis on making everything exactly perfect for the customers making the employees more miserable. Most of the management is terrible because they're under the same stress overall Walmart it's just a stressful environment.
bad,The only job I have ever had where you are made to feel like a failure every day. Management has wildly unrealistic production expectations that they use to threaten your job. Translates to motivation through fear.
bad,Doesn't care about long turn employees. Pay good no hours.lots of rules to get rid of you. Benefits not good Insurance  Real high. Tried to get rid of long turn associates
bad,"Walmart is horrible. They treat people badly, expect one person to do the work of three people. There is never enough staff. Stressful  & overworked. Bad management."
bad,It depends on the store you are at and the  management team you are with it could be a great place to work or stessful place to work sometimes very unorganized
bad,The philosophy of management is to be as nasty as possible in order to berate employees and somehow this is supposed to motivate them. I'll tell you a secret. That doesn't work.
bad,"Manager don’t care about the employees, if you not the favorite on , you would be treat really bad. I been working here and you basically have to be flirting with the guys so they can give you good freight so you can make your number and don’t have warning of getting fired.."
bad,Management at this store was terrible. They expected way too much from one employee while allowing friends to do nothing. Management was very rude to employees disrespectful infront of customers. Enjoyed embarrassing employees. I worked in the deli and there would be a line of customers and only one worker taking care of customers. Management would scream at the only worker waiting on customers to make pizzas now. I have seen management grab employees that were timid. I hated working for this store. If you worked overtime you had to get rid of it by taking longer lunch breaks. Work late for an hour then take an extra hour for lunch.
bad,"After 8 years of loyal service I had received no extra compensation besides a yearly raise, which was not much. During my last two weeks with the company the store director came a verbally threatened me because I was going to work for a vending company that services the stores. After attempting to report this to global ethics I find out that our ethics is a third party company that ultimately ran me around in circles until I gave up with no resolution. Most of my management team congratulated me on my acquisition of a new job but my store director continued to throw a temper tantrum that would make a toddler blush."
bad,"Very poor training keep saying check ""one best way"" store didnt really follow one best way managment wasnt around when needed. Very poor training. Management didnt even know how to run department so when asked how to do something or what was wrong he said he did t know."
bad,"Call it being a disgruntled employee, but this is NOT the place to turn to for a job."
bad,Management generally lacks professionalism. There is no concern for work/life balance.  They demand more and more and more from their employees.  Can make a buck or two.
bad,"Pay based on tasks required is unfair, management is dismissive, refuses FMLA paperwork after surgery. Invasive in personal life, systems are older and outdated"
bad,"Fairly easy work days"
bad,Nice managers but low pay it’s almost impossible to live off of Walmart without having an extremely low class lifestyle with a partner/roommate to help with bills.
bad,"This place hired me to do a job for an agreed wage, then after I started, they added to my workload, until four months after starting, I was doing double the work for the hiring pay. I am currently using my PTO to search for another employer."
bad,"management has no clue. it's like being in high school all over, young popular staff received unposted promotions even when they weren't qualified, older members of staff were mistreated and forced out the door, very much a clique to survive atmosphere, scheduling and advancement based on who kissed manages last, managers permitted customers to abuse staff"
bad,"At the Troy, Michigan location, there's a lot of favoritism, and the hard workers are often overworked. You are expected to run the floor effectively, even when you are short staffed. In the year I worked for the company, we were only fully staffed on holidays. The culture at this place is also horrible... be prepared to hear a lot of gossiping and for people to make up rumors about you. It's like being in high school all over again. A lot of unqualified people are in management positions. Advancement within the company is RARELY based on your work performance; but more so how well you are liked by the store and assistant managers. The pay isn't to bad, however it doesn't match up for the amount of work or stress you will have to go through on a day to day basis. I really do not recommend the troy store. Choose a different location if you really want to work for Walmart."
bad,"Wal-mart if awful. Just simply stay away. They are upping their pay now (I think they realize they were helping the number of people requiring government assistance to rise) so it may be better now, but overall they just suck and do not care about their employees. The customer is always right, no matter what. Even when they aren't, they are."
bad,"Management never communicated with one another"
bad,Never will work there again. Managers talk to you like you were nothing. Off days were barely given not enough cashiers. Never had things in order when i was there
bad,To much work for one person to complete in a day. No thank you’s or moral boosting efforts made. Flexible for holidays and sick days. Good people horrible and I mean horrible management.
bad,"I unloaded truck for CAP 2 also knows as walmart's toilet. CAP 2 is universally disrespected by all departments in a walmart. I agreed to the job because I am a hard worker. Now to discuss the unsuspecting toddlers that they hire for CAP 2. they hire a lot of kids for this job. kids that have phones. kids that will not do their jobs, leading to many people not being able to get the day's work done. coworkers who stayed late to pick up slack for the kids that HAD to go home at around 9 usually had about 2 to 4 pallets of freight left to stock, meaning that if they breached the either allowed or denied overtime, the job would get done, but if you had no overtime allowed, you HAD to go home and deal with the consequences of not DOING YOUR JOB. Mind you this is after I would finish MY stocking with an hour to spare. but if you ever try to pick up any slack for anyone the responsibility would land solely on your shoulders and you would be at fault for the incomplete mess. Managers would frequently go through mental gymnastics trying to justify their reasoning for this, giving off some schpeel about teamwork as if we were connected through a hivemind. They also preach some garbage about RESPECT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL, though they never practiced it. The other departments would frequently blame CAP 2 for any number of things and the managers would listen to them and discipline us over it also. If you work at an ""ACADEMY"" store be mindful that you will have double the managers roaming about your workplace, most of whom never did anything other than discipline people over swearing in the"
bad,"Walmart does not care about you, me, or anything except their profit and it shows. I had a co-worker who worked at my store for 18 years, she had to go to the hospital for some reason, she was a solid worker the whole time she was there but the fired her for 2 no call no shows. Also my supervisor was a bully who had countless people fired over the years. As far as I know alot of people had reported her and management did nothing about it, I even reported her twice and management basically said ""Oh well that's how she is"" so I was one write up away from getting fired so I got out"
bad,Management  only promotes friends and move other managers around. No chance fir movement otherwise unless you fit those criterias. Do not follow company policies at all.
bad,Managers are willing to throw you under the bus. You have to constantly fight to get the slightest things. You must have everything set and have no issues ever or you spend a hellish amount of time trying to deal with it.
bad,This is a job that should see more promotions and opportunities for those that are seeking them. Management finds excuses more to promote friends then best candidate.
bad,"La empresa no contrata directamente, y los altos mando nunca se involucran en los proyectos más que en forma negativa."
bad,"Most people here were a bunch of clowns, excuse my manners. Some were women who thought they were men... rude, loud, and confrontational.  I left because of the lack of communication with my supervisor and my schedule."
bad,After working for Walmart for 10 years as a cashier I torn my rotator cuff and they denied my claim and I had to hire a lawyer!!!!  BEWARE!!  They don't care about their employees only numbers!
bad,"The job itself was fine. I was part of receiving, so the work was usually fast paced and strenuous but I expected that, and the days went by quick. But after about a week of working there everyone in my department started calling in sick. There is supposed to be 5-7 people working in my department every day, but almost daily it was just me and one other person doing the work and picking up the slack for the people calling in. Our manager did NOTHING about this. Which normally wouldn't be a problem right? She cant control what other people do.. That would be fine, but she expected me and my coworker to get all 7 peoples work done, like 100% complete. And she would totally hassle us about it. Like literally yell at us, threaten to fire us etc. How did she expect 2 people to finish 7 peoples work? Ridiculous. She would constantly swear on the job, and make everyone feel like they were useless and stupid. No wonder everyone started calling in sick! Also on top of that we were only getting paid a few cents more than cashiers, and we were working a labor intensive job? give me a break!"
bad,"Management makes sure that you know that you are replacable from day one - the threat is always there, even when you are doing well. They will schedule you on night shift then early morning, cut your hours to avoid paying benefits."
bad,"Everything you hear about Walmart is true. You get treated poorly, paid poorly and all the management is poor. I wouldn't recommend anyone work here unless it's short term or post retirement."
bad,"The pay seems good but the amount of work you are expected to do is for 3 individuals. Their goals are unrealistic. The managers are trained to treat you like bottom feeders and bully you especially at this particular location.. management are puppets and do and say anything to keep their jobs. Don’t bother calling home office.. won’t help, causes retaliation. Don’t bother moving up you will be forced out of a job even quicker than you moved up unless you do a lot of sucking up and telling on others to make your self look better. I can’t begin to explain the amount of anxiety That i had that was caused from working for Walmart. Also they make you take off your overtime."
bad,If we were seen talking or smiling with our co workers our managers would get extremely mad. You had to be on the job nose to the grindstone no exceptions. Our schedules were very inconsistent. I only got 3 days a week with no benefits or overtime eligibility. Very depressing work space. My co workers looked beat and dead inside and some would go to the back room and cry. This was on a daily basis. We were made to do too much considering we only made $11/hr.
bad,"The people in management dont know what they are doing. Treat the workers like absolute trash.. Security there is a joke, supervisors dont do any work to help the team"
bad,"I lost my job at Walmart due to their REALLY stupid 5 occurrence rule. Not only had I become sick, but there were issues at home that required me to be at home, and because of that they fired me."
bad,Liked while was there. Worked at face pace stayed on time and busy. Not going to miss it really. Stayed busy busy busy all time never late always there on time
bad,"Not much room for advancement, When I first started working there hours were great and then overtime, walmart hired to many people and hours were cut down to almost nothing. Definately not a place to work if you're responsible for paying alot of bills.,"
bad,"Due to restructuring and other changes in the last two years, Walmart is an extremely stressful place to work. I feel the focus has shifted from customer service to corporate greed and the customers suffer because of it."
bad,If your young and want to make money its good but know that the more up the ladder you go the less they care about and they already dont care about you as a regular associate you will realize you have to give your life to this company and suck up all the bad things that come with it
bad,"Job.pays good but management doesnt care about the job or associates, just the check. Lack of training lack of motivation. No one follows one best way."
bad,Money hungry management. Terible place to work upermanagrment is very rood and unaprochable.  They only care if they get their bonuses. You a number not a person. You are supposed to be a robot and not have an opinion.
bad,"Walmart is trying to find ways not to pay its employees. Perfect attendance gets you 125% of the bonus, which is awesome, but they're punishing people who call out by giving them either 50% or no bonus at all. Because bad things never happen to hard workers, apparently. I earned my bonus, same as everyone else, and Walmart thinks I'm only worth 50%. Not feeling much appreciated."
bad,On a downward spiral. Getting to be a bad place to work. They squeeze out older associates by making them change jobs hours or schedules. Management is turning over as fast as hourly but not by advancing up the ladder.
bad,I worked as a truck unloader and stocker and our department was extreme high stress and overall just a bad place to work. it paid well enough but after a month or so you would be sitting in the break room looking for a different job to save you sanity and health.
bad,"I like Walmart, its a good company to work for but its a lot of false advertisement when its comes to benefits as far as health, dental, and vision insurance. They do not hire anyone on full time. I have worked with this company for 3 years and is still part time. The pay rate is not bad for minimum wage. The things i liked about them is that they worked around my school schedule and you can basically set the time you can work. good company, poor management."
bad,"Many positions that should have been full time, they made sure they were part time. Management was constantly being changed every six months so you would get some bad with the good. Everyone would receive the same percentage wage so it never paid to work hard while other's did little as possible"
bad,"I started walmart starry eyed and full of hope that i would have a good time working there. I was wrong, the managers were horrible and didn't' respect you. The workload was tremendous and they expected you to finish at a set time. overall i left there thinking I had just escaped the worst job of my life."
bad,"terrible employer, they don't care about you at all. They will belittle you as much as possible, making you feel unworthy of such a low paying job. They really try to demoralize you."
bad,"I would never recommend this corporation for a job. There is little to no advancement now that they are trying to downsize managers. No one’s job is safe anymore as they push forward to more robots, less people. Working with the public is like working with children. Everyone feels entitled and treats you like you are dirt. Management will lie straight to your face just to get away from you. They push impossible workloads on the workers, while they sit in an office drinking coffee or on their phones. They are constantly coming up with ways to push long term workers out the door so they can hire Joe Schmo off the street for less money. Turnover is insane. Once people realize that the corporation isn’t all that the media makes it out to be, they find the door. There is no accepting of doctors’ notes, don’t EVER get sick, and don’t expect to ever spend a holiday with your family again. Run. Run as fast as you can away from them."
bad,"walmart would be a better place to work if management actually cared about the employees that work hard for the company, They work more with the employees that slack then the ones who show up and want to be good at what they do. Assistant managers are the worst ones."
bad,"I've worked here twice and it's the same disappointment.  Managers care about bonuses only!! New point system is very confusing and not properly explained and when you think you've understood, something else gets thrown at you. For as much as associates put up with, including the hard labor, employees should get paid way more than offered.  I wouldn't even recommend this job to a 16 year old applying for a first time gig."
bad,Walmart is hard to work at. There is a lot of hours and not a lot of people. The management promote people that are great workers over others that bust there back. If you get hurt they talk you out or talk around seeing someone for your injury. You may see the general manager once a month for a group meeting on shifts that aren't during the day. Even if there are issues he won't come in to support workers.
bad,"1 hour lunch break will spoil you lol A good stepping stone as far as employment, but couldn't see myself retiring there in 30yrs. No room for advancement."
bad,Very unhealthy work environment.  The position has caused many people their physical and mental wellness.  The processes home office puts in place change on a monthly basis and are rarely ever successful.  So no one really knows what they are doing half of the time.  With such a big company if they actually employed and gave enough hours to the people that are needed to run the store sales would go up tremendously because shelves would actually be stocked etc but they don’t year after year they are getting rid of more and more key positions and people.  Store managers among others get fired and stepped down all of the time if they can no longer create miracles 365 days a year.  I could go on but I think you get the picture.
bad,"Employees were often treated poorly by management yelled screamed at near the top of their lungs on occasion, followed procedure poorly, Employees thrown into toxic environments without training."
bad,Management was always behind and rude. Never wanted to help. Always had us understaffed during rushes. Never listened to any of our advice on stuff. Was just the worse.
bad,Coworkers messy managers don’t care not enough money gives full time hours but considers you part time. Never get your lunches or breaks on time. Rude customers
bad,"Sorry place to work, poor decisions made by home office. You get less than 20 minutes to eat lunch. You work 10-12 hour days, some in the freezer the entire time and get less than a 15 minute break. No longer get holiday pay, now they have reduced PTO."
bad,as the years go by the job gets worse and worse. management is either micro or inept or both. lots of press about how they want to help the employees while either not carrying it through or taking other benefits away.
bad,"Do yourself a favor and don't work for this company. A typical day is meet with attitude and anger. I learned to never ask questions because you will get blown off. Management is terrible here, with the exception of a few. Hardest part of your job here is working your butt off and being told your job performance is terrible. Enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the different associates and what they have experienced in life."
bad,"The rules are black & white. It’s a hard job physically unless you work in QA or AP. You can be the best employee in the world, but if you can’t consistently make 100% in production, you’ll get fired"
bad,"Management had no backbone when it came to sticking up for the workers. During the holidays they would make you work overtime, but sign a paper stating that you will not become full-time, if the paper was not signed you would get write ups everytime."
bad,"Management was horrible, they never listened if you needed your schedule changed because you were working a second job or needed a specific day off. No workers comp honestly, unfair pay it was just bad."
bad,Very poor environment management doesn't care about the employees. Harrassment is apparently okay when it comes to its employees. Alot of irritated customers.
bad,"Great benefits. But you need to deal with those unprofessional managers. The pay rate is not worth it, because of the stress and lot of things you need to do. Consider yourself like a slave. Thats how they treat people. Im just telling based on my experience on our store, maybe its different on other store."
bad,I've been with walmart for 15 yrs now .Its a good company  but poor management.  I need to advance  myself and try somthing new. But what make looking for a new job so much harder is all the associate I've had the opportunity to work with..Over the 15 yrs the associate  are not just associate  were family...
bad,"The manager really sucked and they would never give me hours. My grandma died and they wouldn't let me off, and when I finally convinced them they didn't pay me bereavement."
bad,its a place where you just want to work for the summer or you just want to work somewhere that you just need a proof of income don't recommend to anyone really don't do it
bad,This place is a nightmare. I worked there for three years and I don’t have hardly anything good to say about it. I’ve done most jobs in there and their all just awful. You are only a number that pumps out more numbers. They don’t and won’t care about you at all. I’ve never made a better decision in my life when I decided to find another job and quit that modern day sweat shop.
bad,Work life balance is a joke. 80 plus hours a week as a manager. Terrible company to work for th ed only thing decent is the salary but you work a ton of hours for it
bad,Terrible work place indecisive managers and strong sexism along with favoritism would not recommend this as a job worth looking at you can do better trust me.
bad,Very Bad Place it can be. Work Life balance is a joke. So many changes is making your job unreliable. Can be gone next week. Walmart runs its associates with the fear factor concept.
bad,"Walmart is a place where the children are running the school!. Imagine that for a minute. Wouldn't that be very chaotic?!?.. Salaried management are compensated with bonuses,... but having a store properly staffed, obviously must affect their bonuses, by making their ""draw"" lower. People are always complaining that wm has long lines, Really!?!.. the stores managers can't get a fat check, if the stores are properly staffed with cashiers!!!! The employees are always asking for sufficient hours to pay their bills! Also, anyone can be a manager at a Walmart, any dope addict, inexperienced child. You just have to be able to work late nights and weekends. They don't care about the hourly associate, with a home life, especially the mature adult, with a family, even if they have been there for years. They only say that they do and will let you tell them your availability, but if you don't eventually bend to their will, they will cut your hours until you have to find another job. I can go on and on about the horrors of WM, but I think you get the picture. Stay away, unless you are prepared to be a overseer, at the salaried level and if you can still sleep at night, after oppressing the unfortunate."
bad,"Work days are okay, I have learned a lot in the past 23 years.  Depending on the management team they can be helpful. The hardest part of my job is the heavy lifting.  I like working with the vendors and associates and teaching associates new things."
bad,This place will not give you a full 40 hour week for just a regular employee. They like to keep you under 40 hrs so they dont have to give you benifits.
bad,"Too many chiefs. Right hand not knowing what left hand is doing. Unrealistic quotas.  Unrealistic attendance policy, and dishonest compensation policies"
bad,Overall Walmart is a great place to work. Management team should very more of a team. There is some favortism among managers and cashiers or sales associates. I enjoy my job
bad,"Acredito que eles pensem que não se tem uma vida fora do local de serviço, pois esquecem você trabalhando, acho que foi os piores meses, me ajudou a adquirir experiência, porém empresa só tem nome, porque resumindo é uma falta de respeito com o funcionário."
bad,"walmart treated their managers horribly, and now they are doing it to the rest of their employees. they cut hours, and eventually cut the jobs to save money."
bad,"I worked at walmart as a stocker for roughly 9 months, because my management actively refused to get me a back brace because I was ""too young for one"" I have a permanent back problem now.  the management has absolutely no idea how to manage a floor either. They go by 1box = 1 minute which even now you can imagine makes no sense at all. a box of 25 candles is going to take longer to stock then a box filled with 2 gallons of tea, yet the management who seemly never worked as a stocker would refuse to listen to anyone working the floor and get straight up angry if you asked for assistance if their system said your area should have only taken 5 hours. This isn't just 1 manager either, I believe there were a total of 3 or 4 that would rotate, some being better then others of course. But even the department managers were often ridiculous with their requests, expecting straight up miracles to happen on a daily basis and getting angry when what they wanted wasn't done. "
bad,Not enough associates and work overload; good stock as well as 401k plans and paid time off is accumulated based on the amount of hours you work in a pay period
bad,"I am going to start from the top of the list and work my way down so, day typically started out with us having our daily meeting to get yelled at for not doing enough the night before after the other shifts couldn't complete their jobs and we had to pick up the slack to do ours and theirs. "
bad,If you can handle being treated as just a person to fill there needs with no gratitude or appreciation then this job is for you. The only way to get ahead with them is if  management likes you. Knowledge and experience helps but unless you bow to there needs you mean little to management.
bad,"Typical work days were stressful due to lack of communication between the management and associates. As expected the work flow was fluid depending on freight loads and worker callouts. No consistency, and lack of following even their own rules made working for Walmart difficult. There was no set of standards that needed to be met, at least by my management staff. Store morale suffers among workers, due to the above stated problems. Working with and helping customers to solve their electronics problems / questions, was the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,"It only gets worse. Been doing retail leadership and I’m tired of the negative changes and then being told we should be happy for the changes because we are told it’s good for company(not for associates) and happy we have jobs. Remember every time you hear anything positive in the public like minimum increase or increase my share payout there is always a huge (NEVER PUBLIC) internal cut or change like cutting positions without any notice or adding more work for you from eliminated positions but no overtime and treated like just another replaceable number to Walmart. You will be told one thing by market, another by store manager and something totally different by assistant. If you are liked by the right people then you can get away with anything."
bad,"All I have to say is, do it for the money other than that Walmart is a very toxic place to work. Management is terrible and they don’t care they are just waiting for you to make an mistake so they can get rid of you."
bad,"I would never work here "
bad,"I have never worked for a place that had more ""One and done""  employees than this Walmart. I have seen people come in for a day and never come back. Poor pay, total disrespect from other employees who, pat themselves on the back if they can get you to quit. Some supervisors refuse to hand out equipment to get the job done, then complain that the job wasn't completed. The word is out on the street to stay away. People aren't exactly beating on the door trying to get a job here. It was like being back in kindergarten with 5 year olds."
bad,"They have such a high turnover, that as long as you show up on time, don't steal or start fights, and follow the attendance policy, they'll keep you employed."
bad,"The actual service I provided while working for Walmart was enjoyed. The managers were difficult to work with, rude and were not understanding at all."
bad,"Loved my co workers and my job but management is so shady and horrible they ruined it. They're dishonest and will string you along with promises of future advancement and full time hours to keep you there, you'll never get full time or advancement unless you're a favorite. Work ethic has nothing to do with who gets promoted it's all about who is their buddy."
bad,I would not recommend. Managment doesn't care about there workers. Big company with no care for anything but money. Not enough workers for the amount work they have
bad,i always got in trouble for playing music. while all other employees walked around with headphones in all day playing on there phones. management would always target me because i was the best worker on cap 2. not to mention one of our supervisors got into a fight with an employee in the parking lot while he was still on the clock but he never got in any type of trouble for it but the employee got fired ???
bad,The management does not care about their employees they only care about what is going to make them the most money rather than the community they are a part of. There is hardly any communication between management staff and hourly associates.
bad,"They do not know how to hire ppl that want to work and the ones that are there get worked to death."
bad,"Favoritism. I spoke out and got retaliated against. Every time I spoke out, a manager would say they would fix it; only to have the situation get worse."
bad,threatened multiple times with forced termination for not following rules that were made up on the spot or they were ignored until a manager could use them against you. Payed so little I had to steal from the company just to feed myself
bad,This place was He- double hockey sticks at times. The only thing I liked was the hour lunch. We were extremely overworked. There was strict point system so forget about reasonable attendance accommodations.
bad,"Company went down hill after founder left... All for the share holders. No customer service with the amount of task you’re given. Not even 40hrs a week full time, make you clock out to make sure you don’t get passed a min of overtime. No one smiles anymore"
bad,"Worked as a Cap Team 2 Associate.... got paid $11 per hr for 8 hours... was only alowed 32 hours a week because i was part time... was NEVER allowed to be full time... that way they didnt have to give me the PTO or other benefits... was constantly threatened with my job security if i didnt finish my work... Id like to see all those managers get  this done (had multiple days of 17 hours of estimated work to get done and got nearly 12 hours worth done in less then 6 hours... (constantly had to unload the truck before i could actually start)) if i didnt i was told id be fired because i was ""expendable""... YES THEY ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT... PERSONNEL TOLD ME THIS MANY TIMES.... WALMART DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU"
bad,"The hours are terrible, the schedule is frustrating, the management is incompetent, your coworkers are mostly incompetent, . Honestly you would have a more fun, productive, and healthy time trying to sell literal dog excrement to strangers than working here."
bad,"Nearly every manager you have at Walmart I'd not qualified for their position and it shows. They do not care for your feelings nor how well you work, everyone is interchangeable to them. In my experience only 2 managers out of the 14 I've worked with have shook my hand and introduced themselves to me"
bad,"Extremely stressful, management often times wants associates to work at pace that is not safe. Regardless of exceeding production goals it is never enough to please them."
bad,"Paid less than your counterparts to do the same job. "
bad,I worked cap 1 for almost 2 years and it was the most miserable experience I've ever had. The co workers I had were awesome and my department manager was very understanding and respectful. Our store manager we had when I got there was really good with associates but he transferred stores right after I got there. Our new one came in and treated everyone worse than the dirt he walked on. He would send us to different departments to help out and a couple hours later he would threaten to fire us because we weren't working on our original departments freight. It got to the point of being so bad that my department manager and 6 out of the 9 of us on our crew all walked out a d quit because of our store manager.
bad,Was looking for a company to grow with and perhaps retire with as well but this is not the case due to a high turnaround and poor communication between management and employees and management with other management.
bad,NOT ONE hourly employee makes a living wage. Store management is not very helpful or supportive. It's a toxic work environment. There is truly no way I would return ti that job. Expectations are unrealistic and deadlines are preposterous.
bad,If I didn't need the money I'd never touch this hellhole with a 50 foot pole. Lower management was nice and effective. Upper management was extremely racist and homophobic.
bad,"Management was extremely rude and degrading and threatened our jobs on a weekly basis. We often didnt get our breaks because we needed to get our work done, so certain managers would tell us to work through them."
bad,When you work at walmart the company wants you to give them 100% of your time so they want you to work only for them and no other jobs. Walmart offers a share holds check every year.
bad,"Typical days are stressful, not to mention the lunch/dinner rushes. Normally understaffed. The managers are poor with dividing labor evenly when they do get involved. they typically do not, most of the day to day running in the evenings is typically left with the associates so they determined who did what, which typically worked out better.Managers are typically hard to get in touch with, they almost seem to avoid certain departments in the store and when they do get involved it is typically to reprimand someone."
bad,"Everything is ok at walmart other than store and market leadership. Stores average over 100% turnover, need I say more?  No help, abusive management. Horrid communication top to bottom."
bad,i recommend never working there.they don't give enough hours and refuse to give me full time because of budgets.the mangment dont explain stuff well and wont listen to problems.they play favorits.
bad,"Started out as low level hourly employee and worked my way up to assistant manager. Spent 8 years with the company. No work/life balance at all, especially once your salary. Constantly called into work and pestered on your days off. Store and district managers seem out of touch with reality and think Walmart is greatest thing on earth. Impossible to staff stores and run them smoothly with hours given. As a manager you spend most of your time doing your associates jobs since there isn't enough man power. Constantly deal with ridiculous amounts of drama from employees and customers. Most of the time I felt like a daycare provider. If you're someone who cares about work ethic, you will be stressed because most workers coming through the door have none."
bad,"não há equilibrio entre vida pessoal e profissional"
bad,Walmart is a complicated place to work. Its fun and has great pay and hours. It’s the people that work here are very disrespectful and talk down to people
bad,"Co workers are great,  however they choose the lowest of the low to be management. Buddy buddy culture if you kiss add you'll get hours. Management is uneducated it's just sad. Harassment constantly"
bad,"Jefes sin experiencia, pedantes, arrogantes y con poca empatia por quien lo rodea, solo les preocupa no perder dinero en la empresa, pero tener mas en sus bolsillos"
bad,"In the few months I worked there, I was constantly belittled by the management. I was a ""courtesy associate"", which are kind words for what is a cart pusher. The safety devices for the cart pushing machine were not maintained. The store's management got upset with us for not going fast enough due to defective equipment."
bad,You come in to what should be a game plan if you are at a good location. Once you go over gameplan you will tour the store speak to each department manager.
bad,Very stressful. Management don't work together customer service  Management don't work with associate.   A lot of rude customer  .A lot of shoplifting
bad,It was an ok place to work some understandable management team and some that just don't want to help you.. I loved my job and was the best at it but it ok
bad,Working for Walmart afforded me the opportunity to take care of my children. I have been able to promote within the company for more than 15 years and loved my job and taking care  of associates and customers.
bad,would never return to Walmart would not refer anyone to Walmart. day are longer with low pay. Walmart has no rescpect for employies no help in stores.
bad,"No training, No Teamwork. Bad Leads. Could not ask questions without getting an altitude. Can't get help without getting an altitude . Some of the Coworkers Have me center altitude."
bad,A typical day at Walmart can be stressful and l learned that it not what know it is who you know.The hardest part of the day is seeing what goes on the enjoyable part of the day is no matter is unfair and what doesn't seen write we always come together and make the best out of it
bad,Don't work here if you don't have to. The store manager is friends with many associates and managers beneath her and picks favorites which goes down the line to her assistant managers which also do the same.
bad,Over all the managers didn't really care about their associates they tell them what to do and doesn't show them respect but treat them like criminals and watched us like thief's.
bad,"Stressful, taking the slack of other workers, management needs improvement and learn how to treat associates..Need to hire more people, associates need more pay and stop giving new hires more money than the associates you already have"
bad,"I am kind of the ""clean-up man"". Meaning that they put me in any area, something that can be done quickly, so I can move to another area and usually help the slower workers.In my time there I have learned the location of most products, so I can direct any customer to any product (and even to some employees). The hardest part is having to correct the mistakes of other employees, and watching as others move slow and stare at the shelves because they don't know where things go."
bad,"The pay is good but not worth the ignorance or stress that is involved with the job. Every month they screw with the benefits and pay. They change things that worked fine to make way for terrible procedures that make the job harder while raising production regularly. There turnover is threw the roof because of incompetent managers. Overtime is forced almost every week, 2 days of OT. IF you don't mind being treated terrible for a decent pay then this is the place for you. We all worked there for the same reason, the PAY, we all left for the same reasons, THEY TREAT YOU TERRIBLE."
bad,Not really a place you want  to make a career out of some days it can be inconsistent with the workload and expectations are most of the time unreasonable management picks and chooses who they want to move up instead of promoting who’s deserving of it
bad,"The gossip is unruly, the management are young and egotistical punks who overshare, what's expected of you is outrageous, and there's a scandal every two weeks. My time at Walmart was the worst of my life, and I'm still facing the aftermath, months since being let go (due to my job being located to another shift entirely). "
bad,"The only thing i can say about my time at wal-mart was how absolutely stressful i was for me, between trying to figure out which manager was over my department to trying to discern if i was supposed to truly help customers, as i was genuinely told not to help customers with a few things that they had been coming to my department for help with on more than one occasion."
bad,"Not a great place to work. Deathly boring and management doesn't appreciate their workers. They would have less turnover if their stores didn't have hospital lighting, they put effort into effectively training their associates and making the work environment an enjoyable place to be rather than something to be dreaded"
bad,Walmart does not follow any of their own policies they break ethic laws I know some co workers that wear diapers because they know they will not get a bathroom break. I have not received lunches until six hours on the floor and some people do not even receive their last breaks. I do not recommend them as a place of employment unless you have too.
bad,"We are considered Cap !.  We recieve 7-8 pallets of produce every day.  We then have to scan prdts into hand held computer and stock shelves.  Freight very heavy.  Usually have to have team lifts for some items.  When we stock, rotation is a MUST.  Learned all the computer lingo...doing all that is required with hand held computer."
bad,Would not advise person to work here no lunch break awfully  long day with mandatory overtime. Not worth the stress from day to day after trying to give your job 100% of u what else is there to do.
bad,The asset management team was awful when I worked there got demotion when my son was on life support and didn’t tell me until Friday when I came back  I had plenty of offf time
bad,The managers would constantly forget about breaks I'd be scheduled off at 6 and have to wait until 7-10 before I got off the clock I never got paid for maternity leave for sick days and I was always working different registers and sometimes I'd have to wait until almost 11pm for the person to come releive me and it was bull I was always criticized for my work I'd even work other shifts and still not get appreciated for it I would definitely not recommend Walmart as a place to work
bad,"i enjoyed working at walmart, untill i was injured at work, and even though i did not miss any work, i was  placed on un-paid leave!!! then i was informed that i could no longer work in the maintenance dept!!!"
bad,"I have been with Wal-Mart almost 6 years and when I first started I loved my job. In the past 3 years it started to become awful. The managers don't care about their employees and neither does home office. All we are to them are worker bees. Which we are but they used to take care of us now they could care less about our well being. I am full time and I am only getting 20 hours a week. I am an experienced cake decorator and I get paid low for what I can do. I also go to school and they are supposed to work with my schooling, but there way of working with my schooling is by cutting my hours. which is not right since I need money to pay for college and to keep a roof over my head and eat."
bad,Not a really good place  to work they are slave drivers they dont like to be trust worthy and some of the scsep are friendly and only 2 out of the millions of supervisors or managers are nice the others are very in to them selves and the power they have
bad,Store management often have no clue about their own protocols or the company's rules and legislation. No room for advancement and work was usually extremely stressful.
bad,I liked it for a little bit in till the holidays. management was horrible and co workers were rude half the time and get jealous  if you get promoted and will talk behind your back a lot.
bad,"Poor Management that doesn’t care about their employees. They gave raises and then cut out hours to basically nothing. Always short staffed, from call offs. They don’t pay holiday time. They reward the lazy workers and punish the hard workers. Constantly changing the way you do things. One minute it is right the next it wrong. Managers talk down to you. Treat you like your a robot. Not aloud to have fun. Stay clear of this money grubbing  company! WORST JOB EVER!!"
bad,"The ""myth"" that Walfart has poor management is TRUE!! Two female assistant managers in the apparel department corners me and both gained up and discriminated me, calling me name, making threats. Enough said. (:"
bad,"Wal-Mart has shifted from what was once Sam Walton's philosophy of customer service excellence and the fun environment for which he delighted in his employees to an all computerized void of people-disconnected and empty cash cow.  There is absolutely no need for employees in the company shifting towards an Amazon of sorts, where self check out and lack of customer service is innovative in their view and disregards the old school nature of customer care. I was utterly lost and disappointed.  Upper and Middle Management does not even regard thier employees as having names, any value, or worth to this company void of human spirt. a customer fell on the floor and I comforted her for over a half hour, and sat on eh floor until help came--the managers nor anyone ever spoke to me about the incident, horrifyingly.  I will not shop there any longer. I would rather pay more at a store where customer service and appreciation is of the utmost value. The culture is that of machines, self check out, and total disconnect from the customer in the hopes that the customer do it themselves-- and Wal-Mart not have to hire people at all in thier ever-growing gluttonous capitalism gone mad--CASH COW.  Shameful and low wages and awful hours scheduled by apps and computers and not people."
bad,"Working at Walmart has provided me with a lot of experience dealing with customers and management. Management pushes hard for Cashier associates to get ""Walmart Rewards Mastercard"" which is difficult to sell and is one of many tasks as a cashier working at Walmart."
bad,Wal-Mart used to be a great company. Now they have no care of employees or thier needs. Your work week used to be a set schedule now you have no idea if you will work 40 hours or 18 hours.
bad,"Je suis un ancien employé qui est revenu passer un entretiens d’embauche à la succursale de Magog.  Lorsque j'ai passer mon entretiens, avec l'un des gérants, il semblait être presser et ennuyé par se que je lui disait, il n'avait pas le choix de me posé certaines questions. Lorsque j'ai fini mon entretiens avec celui-ci, il m'a donner une pogné de main faible et rapide, en me disant que je devrais avoir des nouvelles concernant l'entrevue dans une semaines. "
bad,this company cares nothing about its people ONLY profits no this is not a place to grow or work or even shop its a company that needs to go away blah blah blah
bad,Its seems alright at first. But you find the out pretty fast how bad of a place it is to work. Management doesn't care about anything but numbers. Associates turn on each other. Some have to fight for their hours because of corporate cuts. Not a place I would suggest.
bad,"not the best environment, the management  wasn't very understanding with family matters. the training i received was non existing. not my preferred place to work at"
bad,Typical work day is medium paced. Some days are better than others. Sales were okay and it was an easy job.Workplace culture is very poor morale. High turn over rate.
bad,"Excelentes piliticas y cultura de empleo, pero deben ser supervisadas,"
bad,It's ok in the beginning but as time goes on manager don't know how to talk or communicate with you they walk round with attitudes an just plain rude to associates.
bad,pooor management and open door policy is false they will retaliate the staff are great in certain aspects deffinatly a hostile work environment i wouldnt suggest long term employment entry level.
bad,"The coworkers were what kept me coming back. The hours are rough, and the amount of work for very little pay was difficult. Customers made it even harder to even want to be there. Just don't plan on making much money or enjoying any free time."
bad,All salaried managers were horrible. Didnt know how to lead associates. Make you do everyone elses work & gets mad when you didnt do the work you oringinally had
bad,"I started at Walmart some time ago, and I must say a lot has changed in the company in those years. It is extremely understaffed 90% of the time, management's way of working is to cut down on associates, it would be an awesome  place to work if morale wasn't at an all time low because you are treated as a number not as a person. And if you want to move up in the company don't even bother because the back room politics there with management is so bad that unless you have your nose so far up management or threaten to quit you are out of luck. If you are too good at your job, you will not be allowed promotion because they don't like having to replace you. The customers (with the exception of customer service desk) Are great, one of the most enjoyable parts of the job is helping customers and watching them leave with a smile. Hardest part of the job would be getting the rest of your job completed (zoning, stock, etc) because you are so understaffed and higher ups don't communicate with each other."
bad,Managers made it miserable very wishy washy. No paid maternity for me even though I was worked 40 hours a week longer then 8 weeks in a row. Sounds like it could have been a law suit.
bad,"In my first few years here it was a really enjoyable place to work. It was pretty laid back, management was fantastic. Then a few years later some management changed, they are extremely lazy. They have no idea what they are doing and they have incredibly stupid expectations. They no longer work with anyone on schedules so the hours are really inconsistent and if you are only part time you are screwed because you will only get 8-27 hours a week if you are lucky. Me being full time and being employed here for nearly 6 years now am lucky to get 35 hours a week. No one gets 40 or over 40 hours"
bad,This was the worst job I’ve ever had. They don’t accept doctors notes at all and will fire you even with one. They don’t pay very well at all and it’s not enough to live on. The managers are inexperienced in what they do and they don’t know how to treat people. Policies are rarely fallowed and when they are it’s only to use it against the workers. They put too much work on their employees and show no appreciation to them.
bad,"Not a people orientated organization . No work life balance. Progression is hard, without politics. No structure to groom and train. Quick to roll out policys and tactics but months later will not stick to them"
bad,Bad management co workers were rude they don’t allow overtime but will ask you to stay late then have you leave early the next day pay raises are a joke
bad,Favoritism and sexism run a muck around the management class. Lazy employees are babied while hard working employees with more responsibility to make up the slack.
bad,"Walmart is the job you have if you NEED a job. If you aren’t desperate for a job, wait it out and find a company that is going to treat you better than Walmart will. It’s an awful work atmosphere and you will hate your life."
bad,"Not that great of an experience. Equipment doesn't work, management cares little about safety and wants people to dump unmarked chemicals in a drum."
bad,"Terrible tell you to do things that are not your job position, you do not get compensated for working in higher paid places or positions that you are forced to do or get coached if you do not go do it."
bad,"If you lost your job, and just need something to scrape by until you can find a real job, Walmart is an option. Keep in mind it is a very hostile work place with very cheap management who's job it is to squeeze everything out of you for as cheap as possible until you quit, or get fired. They find out who they're best employees are, and instead of promoting them, drive them into the ground until they are burned out and leave. Only pursue this company if you need a temporary income solution."
bad,Managers are rude and backstabbing. They will find a reason to fire you if they don’t like you and will do anything to keep you from going home even if your shift is over
bad,Very poor mamagement in top positions. Very poor morale in general as far as the morale that Associates have. When I first started there we had a great manager and morale is high and he got promoted because of the stores position and profitability. The managers after that destroyed any of that great morel and respect for management. I would never ever in my life recommend anyone to take a job at that store under its present management.
bad,this job  is  an ok job i believe the management for the walmart i work at in particular could have some improvement in thier management decisions i feel that we are paid horribly for the amount of work or expectations they have on us.
bad,"I was hired into a management role in the company.  I spent 5 weeks in training, which was not at all related to my job after training. "
bad,"Did not care for the people, management and how the place was ran.  Just kind of fell apart and still is. Job was not that hard but we were never appreciated there for our hard work."
bad,The management seemed more concerned each day with getting the job done by a made up set of rules instead of in a practical sense. My direct manager told someone the day i quit that she makes people angry on purpose to try to make them work harder. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"It was a great job until they changed the store manager. Unfortunately in Walmart culture, poor managers are the standard, as seen in the Assistant Managers. They will use you and abuse you, never thank you, ignore you. The workers are great human beings who all deserve better. Can't get hours because they're trying to make it mostly about machines; unless you can work overnights or sacrifice all relationships you have outside of work, it's a nightmare on your mental health. Love yourself, look somewhere else."
bad,Always remember that just because a policy is in place DOES NOT mean the company/management will follow it. Certain policies apply to certain people. Management will cover up what they have done wrong to protect themselves rather than follow the policies and procedures that the company has in place. Would not recommend others to work here.
bad,"My first years at Walmart was really great."
bad,Don't work there. The management doesn't care. They have no appreciation for the work you actually do. Only recognizes the work that you didn't do. It's a horrible place to work!
bad,I have never had my will broken so many times by a job. This job sucked the very soul from my body. I learned how cold and cruel a job can be. Never again will i ever work at walmart. I will starve to death before i wear a vest again.
bad,"I tried working at Walmart twice, and i will do everything in my power to never have to work there again.  The managers do not care about their employees at all.  I was pregnant my second time and it was a high-risk pregnancy due to a previous miscarriage.  I asked to be demoted or put in a less stressful role.  They were unable to accommodate, so i had to leave. I also, witnessed one of our cashiers doubled over in pain at the register from a toothache (because she didn't make enough to afford dental insurance to have the problem fixed), and she was told by the store manager that if she left (again) because of her tooth, she would be terminated. So she stayed her whole shift, crying the majority of the time while trying to smile though her pain for the customers."
bad,"Poor management, great team to work with. Almost impossible to move up or get interviewed for higher pay positions. Managers attitude towards associates every day"
bad,It is a okay place to work but they really don't give the employees that are part time hours they basically give hours to full time but no hours are given to part time workers
bad,And they hired me. I worked 6 different departments and got paid cashier pay which at the time was 9 an hour. Over worked and tired all the time. I will never go back.
bad,"A typical day is RUSH RUSH RUSH! Well, to be fair it was a temp job. "
bad,I worked there for 2 years it’s about the worst job you can ask for. They pay you less then you do and expect you to do more then your job quota.idgir
bad,"The time I spent at walmart was only made bearable by my awesome coworkers. The rest of the experience was dismal, from the work conditions to the customer interactions. If you have any other choice for employment I would personally advise going that route and avoiding walmart entirely."
bad,"dealing with customers mainly angry customers"
bad,the most enjoyable thing about working at walmart is meeting new people. a typical day of long standing. I learned you are not going to work to make friends. Don't know how it is at other walmarts but the one I've worked at management suck. It was rude supervisors and management
bad,"I work to live, not live to work. I felt like most of upper management do not see their employees as people, but more like robots they can push until they get a new one"
bad,the job is not good u work hard there they give not god ime about gettig long with people and if let do are job i have good friends at work i wish i had a better job
bad,"Walmart should be a happy and fun place to work, when management is bullying and not listening to the issues in the store and breaking polices. it makes the work environment not so happy and fun. "
bad,Walmart is a horrible place to work. I knew from the moment I started that I could not possibly work there forever so I started college online in order to acquire a degree in accounting so I could leave Walmart. There is way too much shoplifting and Walmart supports this practice because they do not allow managers or employees to confront the shoplifters. The also do not hire enough asset protection for any shift. There are no asset protection associates on third shift.
bad,Unless you get in good with management you will go no where. Be very careful because you don't want to get on the bad side of anyone higher up than you they could make your job more stressful and possibly get you fired.
bad,Not really the best job and the store itself wasn't professional and I had a hard time even proving my worth to the store. Overall not worth applying for.
bad,"Great pay mangament dont care about their workers, love working with customers, picking up every persons slack every single day Never getting holidays off, always working with the same people who dont do their job correctly."
bad,I really don't even want to talk about it. They treated you like all their problems was your fault and the only time they had anything to say to you personally was negative.
bad,Management doesn't care are the customers or the employees. During busy times never had enough help and too much help during slow times. If you tried to communicate anything to the management you were labeled as a complainer.
bad,"The hardest part of my job was in order to do my job policies where always in the way."
bad,"I worked there for 3 years, and only stayed because i had mouths to feed at home. Coworkers are always filled with drama and its every man for himself. One day you might have to work overtime to finish a mandatory project but they make you cut it at the end of the week so you do not get compensated for rearranging your schedule. My manager was pretty decent, but the other managers in the store were constantly throwing eaxh other and their employees under the bus."
bad,one of the worst retail companies i have worked for. extremely poor management. you dont get properly trained on any position and they wait until you do something wrong to teach you how to do it. they put too much on too few people to try and get the job done cheaper.
bad,Wal-Mart isn't a good place to work by any stretch of the imagination. Wal-Mart hasn't been a good place to work since Sam Walton died. Raises suck and managers are not trained well at all.
bad,"Typical day at work was clock in, deal with work, clock out. I learned that I never want to work at a walmart again. The manager of my particular job was great, those under her that managed me were unrealistically harsh for the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with new management. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with."
bad,The company was entirely too big. They did not care about their employees. Overworked and underpaid. Just like any other big corporations. Discounts were a joke.
bad,I work as a CAP 1 associate so therefore I work 4AM to 1PM which are great hours! The good things to celebrate end there however. Management is always in a panic and disorganized which basically kills the ability to be efficient at a job and we can never get anything done because of it.
bad,"I was hired for part time, worked an average of 40-50 hours a week."
bad,"No le interesan sus empleados, no es grato trabajar en WM"
bad,the  job didn't give you the time off if requested manangment wasnt helpful and theres so much work that needs to be done within  the company for the most part it payed my bills so it was a job
bad,"The management team and lack of follow through are the worst parts of working here. The company does not care about their associates at all. Managers will ask you to stay over your scheduled time one day and then tell you that you have to cut the time the next day. You are not supposed to have to work off the clock but salaried managers will interrupt your lunches/breaks and time off constantly. "
bad,"Management is terrible and picks favorites, often prevents associates willing to move up the ranks from doing so, full time associates no longer receive 40 hour weeks guaranteed and commonly get part time hours, problems that are brought up to managers are never handled or taken care of when said they would."
bad,"If you are out of any other choices, this is the place for you! They will tell you that you don't work hard enough, fast enough, you aren't good enough, stuff like that constantly. Great benefits that cost you half your check if you have to cover more than just yourself. Overtime is VERY HIGHLY discouraged and you will be sent home before you get that close. Can't change shifts to one that works with family life no matter what the company says. The store managers will do everything in their power to keep you from going to another store that might be closer to where you live unless you change states. Raises are only if the company advertises that they are giving everyone a raise to a certain amount. Time off is earned based on how many hours you work and it is all the same whether it is sick time or vacation time. If you have health problems you'd better make sure that you have a very friendly doctor who doesn't mind filing out paperwork for each and every little thing to pass on to the company that handles FMLA / short term disability / and everything else on behalf of Walmart.  When you tell them that you can not work certain days of the week due to appointments, they'll schedule you on those days just so they can fire you for no call no show."
bad,"Overnight stock was terrible. Training was poor. Picked me to stock Chemical isle with cases of  heavy laundry detergent bottles stacked up highter than me on an 3 L Carts and a cart full of sponges and dish soaps in an hour and a half. Being new and a woman and also having to help customers find items, I didn't even come close. Unrealistic expectations and no help from management or trainer. Never could find someone when I needed help. Coworkers were angry all the time and ganged up on those they didn't like. Hour lunch break at 3am was TERRIBLE. No where to go but McDonalds and no one in the break room was friendly with one another. Got ""talked to"" once for missing a 15 minute break due to some strange customers asking me to scoop out 10 different pet fish for them at 1am, when I never scooped fish before. The rest of my coworkers ignored them and then when seeing me stuck well past my break helping them just walked past me."
bad,"After eight years of loyal service I was fired when they no longer required my services due to a reorganization of the the store when a new store in Kissemee took a major share of busness in the area. This unfortunately is typical of how Walmart treats its employees. Our schedules were cut, we were forced to work in different departments and no one was sure about the future. Management was .unable to reassure us because all decisions were made by corporate headquarters. Many employees were forced to find other jobs because Walmart could no longer give them full-time work. The best part of the job was my fellow co-workers. I made a number of friends there and I shall miss them."
bad,Worked there for 10 years the last three years Several changes in management every week and they all demand something different and want the changes made immediately. Super stressful. No wonder they have such a high turn around.
bad,"Overall the workers at walmart were friendly and understanding. Management, however, was often times inefficient for the sake of efficiency which would inevitably become a detriment to those doing physical labor."
bad,"The company will tell you that you can have days off that you want and that they will work with your personal life, but I have not found that to be the case as of late."
bad,"The level of incompetence in the stores can be hit and miss. I worked at my store for a decade and it was ok for a while and then new managers came in. My god, the place went way down hill. The management became vary unorganized and displayed seriuos competancy issues across the board."
bad,Poor place to work with a poor environment and poor upper management. Lack of tools and personnel make tasks impossible to complete. Favoritism and double standards apply here.
bad,Managers are terrible and will throw you under the bus because they don't know what they are doing or talking about. The place and system it runs on changes all the time. And when it does everything gets worse.
bad,Typical click culture. So many bullies in this company and no one does anything about it. Waste of time to try to contact management about problems. No one has respect for anyone. Sad because otherwise would be a great job.
bad,"They no longer run this company in the eyes of Sam Walton. if they ran the company the way Sam did, they would have happy productive workers, because of the positive management and influence that Sam taught his employees."
bad,Its an ok place to work at but under very bad management it eventually gets to you. Management is not well trained they let many employees skip their duties then expect others to do it for them
bad,Walmart is a notoriously know cut throat company.  They do not care about the well being of the employees and want the work you the longest on payroll 40 hours/week but you actually work 60 plus with no overtime pay or appreciation. It is expected of you.  Management and Corporate are not supportive of any employee that complains about valid issues.
bad,"Walmart is a stressful job,but most customer service jobs are because the customer is always right and they can treat you any way they like and you have to bite your tongue and just smile. Walmart is flexible though. benefits are not that great but I mean it should really just be for people who are needing a first time job...nothing to live off of."
bad,A typical day at Walmart was not too well it was full of broken promises and expected us to learn without training certificates and never could get a hold of management for any issues
bad,I liked the Co-workers that was about it.  Management is all over the place.  They don't care much for their employees.  Schedules were never out on time (maybe 1-2 weeks late).
bad,The company is not about it's associates. Work load ridiculous and pay is low for work they want you to preform. This company wastes more money on sending store managers and market teams to Disney land and other places then it gives it's associates who run the stores.
bad,Walmart is focused on sales and numbers rather than the happiness/success of its employees. I have worked there for seven and a half years and I am making less than new hires.
bad,"At Walmart a typical day at work would be anything you're assigned to do has to be done fast-paced. Working on the register I learned how to to do price matches, scan coupons, how to bag groceries the proper ways and to load the buggies for the customers. I learned to make sure every customer that comes through my line was checked out quickly with a smile on my face. As far as the management was concerned they saw us more like robots or mules. They weren't big on a life outside of the workplace and some managers could get pretty ugly with the employees, especially if their managers were coming to view the stores. The hardest part of the job was a lot of times keeping a smile on my face when I had to go to the bathroom but couldn't leave my register because there was no one available  to relieve me. The most enjoyable part of the job was two 15-minute breaks and an hour lunch break."
bad,Walmart likes to squeeze blood out of a turnip. They stretch their associates too far and pick and choose when they want to follow policy and procedures.
bad,While working at walmart I was given tasks and told how to do them. The management changed the process of doing the same tasks often. Management had more intrest in themselves than their employees.
bad,"I did learn a lot in Walmart. i worked in different department. Its an ok job to start out, but I don't recommend to stay there for long period of time."
bad,"The air of Walmart is the depressing stench of corporatism. Never a consistent schedule, no benefits, and low pay. Walmart is the epitome of suffering in the workplace. They don't care about you or what you have going on in your life."
bad,Parece bueno cuando entras pero la verdad que mal lugar
bad,Terrible. Just terrible. Chaos total chaos. It is slavery. Not good pay. Make a plan it gets destroyed by other mgrs. No team work. Run from this company
bad,"they don't consider the age of the associate work area environment"
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work at this store unless you're desperate.  Guaranteed min hours are higher than some other places, but too many changes has brought too much negativity into the work atmosphere. With the last round of changes it has pitted all the different shifts against each other, and now pretty much no one enjoys going to work. There's never enough associates, and management (especially home office) doesn't care if you have family or other important things going on."
bad,Worset company to work for. They didnt want to give you your time off you ask for. They didnt give good raises. They just didnt care about you as a human they dont care about you .
bad,management just doesn't care about  the employees. they have their few favorites that they promote and lift in the company.  they are unwilling to work with people with alivablity
bad,Working for Walmart was basically pulling out pallets on things to work on for that day back stock items left over and zone your work area. I learned how to deal with tough work environments along with time management. Management was not the greatest. People were rude and unfriendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with poor management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of fulfillment after a job well done.
bad,"As an Assistant Manager for WalMart, there was a lot of sink or swim mentality. Because of the shortage of associates, you were constantly ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"". The worst part was that there was absolutely no reward statements the entire time I was there. The focus was strictly on what was not being done opposed to anything that you have done right or well."
bad,"Not sure, I dont really want to work for walmart anymore, i need to make more money right now at this point in my life. They didnt really want to work with me with my schudule so things went south"
bad,"The management staff didnt do much work around the store,  the loved to gossip and get into drama including the employees personal life, and overall the working life at walmart was not all that great."
bad,The Walmart I was employed at never took the time to train or develope anyone or any of the departments but were more than happy to discourage you and your abilities to work.
bad,"Don't work for the Gainesville Walmart some of the employees are disrespectful and it's not worth the pay, management sucks there they don't really care about their employees, they will tell you that you can be replaced without caring and some of the employees and managers will talk down to."
bad,"Store managers are like working for pretty little liars. Your fellow management ""team"" is pitted against you like a high school blood bath. Everything is a petty competition but don't count on it being fair uNess you're a ""favorite"" and you get to sit in the office gossiping with the boss all day while she eats her cheetos and Dr. Pepper and shoves all her pets work off on other people so she can scream at them later and call them idiots for not being able to do everyone else's jobs. But you know... that's the wally world way!"
bad,As a former stocker and electronics/wireless associate i can honestly say that working at walmart was a good learning experience. I learned alot about retail and how to work cooperatively with others.
bad,"worked on the cap 2 team for several months and the job was awful, managers are strict and air headed and controlling. expect too much for little pay. expect you to do things that are hardly feasible which results in needing to go into overtime which makes them frustrated and angry. some Managers talk about the employees behind their backs and are just plain rude."
bad,"It's the management that ruins everything. I work at a Glendale store and 85% of the people above you could give a s*!+ how they treat you or what they say and do."
bad,Not the best experience some staff were rude others were kind and always helpful personally I wouldn't recommend Walmart to anyone just because of the experience that I had weren't the best and I wouldn't want someone that I recommended to Walmart to blame me for poor management./and or associates
bad,working here you could meet a lot of people working there but it gets overwhelmed some nights when the customers are using ebt cards or price matching with coupons
bad,This place is honestly one of the worst places to work they gave all the associates a 50 cent raise which should have gave us more money but to counter the raise they gave to associates the more hours they cut leaving me with less money then last year.
bad,"Very Poor Management, they treat associates horrible. Its like being in high school all over again. The worse part is that Assistant Mangers are involved and they do nothing about it. The Store manger is worse and lets the associates get treated horrible.They want you to be as miserable as they are."
bad,A typical day isnt too bad until you have to work completly by yourself with a manger who dosent know what hes does. Thankfully i have work here before so I knew what to do.
bad,"I’ll keep this short and simple. "
bad,Stay away at all costs. Horrible place  ge a manager. No time to even go to the restroom. You will have no clue and upper management is clueless. Extreme cut throat also
bad,I would not recommend Walmart as a place to work or shop. Some folks might enjoy shopping or working there as for me I will absolutely avoid the place all together. I support the Mom and Pop stores and I don't enjoy the environment at Walmart.
bad,"Working as a retail manager is a very cutthroat position in the general sense of the matter.  However, this is especially true while working for Wal-Mart in the management role.  Essentially, you will be expected to be PERFECT and will also be expected to squeeze blood from a stone.  I would not recommend retail management to my worst enemy.  Just my honest opinion.  It isn't enough to do your best in this role because its never enough."
bad,Working at Walmart was very monotonous and the managers are not understanding of students academic careers. I only worked part-time so I can't review on their benefits.
bad,"Strictly customer focused with no regard to the value of employees. Advancement is by favorites or you must pitch yourself to them. No merit for work ethic, loyalty or trustworthiness"
bad,I hated working at this miserable place they worked us too hard for very little pay . We barely received our breaks and didn’t get paid if we did someone else’s job who gets paid more than us . They send cashiers to do customer service when it’s busy but we don’t get paid how much customer service workers get paid . Very unfair . They leave frozen food out for a long time before they put go backs away . They are very unorganized and messy . They lock everything up so you spend your whole day unlocking stuff for customers . VERY DEPRESSING
bad,"Walmart treats all employees as an expanse. No thanks is shown for a job well done. Good place to learn retail skills Very little training is provided on the floor in using the telzon gun. You have no supervision so learning how to do your  work properly is a your own. "
bad,"Did not want to give hours to work., The hours that were given were cut and given to other people. Treated poorly, lack of communication between management and employees."
bad,The first couple of years were great. New management has suppressed job morale. Quarterly incentives have ceased as well as annual raises. Scheduling is a major problem as well.
bad,"It is a very nice place to work at. It has it's Discounts as well as it's Lunchroom.  If only I can get re-hired this time for good, then it would be very nice."
bad,This job is very hard on your body and your mind.  No mistakes aloud. Its very stressful. Fast pace and no time to slowdown. The enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers.
bad,the management team at Walmart don't care about the associate needs and wants. only they want there bonus and that is it. Store manager don't care what they say about the associate and if they have special needs or anything
bad,"If take pleasure in hurting those below you, while being hurt by those above you for no conceivable business purpose. If you love to be lied to, but hate creativity it would be a nice place to work."
bad,"Leadership makes the difference, if you are doing well and making your leader look good everything is great. If you have a bad day and you fall from grace with your leader, you will no longer enjoy your career."
bad,I do not see why I must write a review and therefore this is the extent of it.  Anyone that has worked for this company already knows all about it. That is about all I have to say.
bad,Use to work at a DC. Worst mistake I ever made. Its a cuthroat company now. They don't give 2-craps about you. Especially since they're getting their butts kicked by Amazon. ..haha
bad,Walmart was a bad place to work they made it seem really good at first but when it came to work they treated you like trash and didn’t really care for you
bad,"poor management resulting in poor teamwork and culture."
bad,"The worst job I've ever had.  I was fired for something that all the other employees were doing, so I assumed it was ok.  Was fired with out any warning..."
bad,"I've worked for Walmart twice now. Once as a stocker, and the second time as a pharmacy tech. I honestly might be a bit biased considering that I have had major problems with management at both of the locations I worked at. The first time a family member died and they wouldn't give me the time off to attend the funeral, even though I followed proper Walmart procedure. The second time I had a manager that had unrealistic expectations, he wouldn't work with me on my schedule (I was and still am attending college as a full time student), and he actively singled me out from other people he had hired at the time. I actually rose to meet those expectations by completing the tasks he gave me quickly, and because of this he actively blocked me from advancing in the job, and receiving my certification as a Pharmacy Tech. The only reason I stayed for a long as I did was because I wanted to prove him wrong, but also because of the people. Most of everyone I worked with were good people. So if I have one positive about working there it would be that the people I worked with there made the time I spent working much more tolerable."
bad,Walmart will promise you benefits while keeping your hours just a couple short of you being applicable for any benefits. Management is rude and asked me several times to stay and work even though my shift had ended and I wasn't being paid for the work done.
bad,"The management team can never get the schedules correct, you're always being left alone with no one to help you work, and they never have your back when it comes to rude customers. I wont recommend anyone working for them"
bad,"to advance in the company you must be a kiss up. they piled more and more work on me because they kept firing other department managers and i saw no raise. in fact they gave me a verbal warning because i wasnt able to finish all the department manager tasks for deli, bakery, meat, frozen and dairy in one day!. this company beats you down in the worst way and doesnt even say thank you when you do a great job. Sam Walton dying was the worst thing to ever happen for not only his family but every single walmart associate."
bad,Unless you're in with the management you don't have a prayer of advancing or  keeping your job. You get put down on a daily basis and yelled at by your manager especially in the bakery at 2318. You can't talk to upper management about any manager cause they don't fix the problem they go to the person and tell them what was said. That's their method of fixing a problem. Its sad when you have to talk yourself into going to work because of the stress your manager puts you thru. If your in the manager click you get all the early shifts and never have to close. You can plan evenings with family and friends cause you know that you never have to work past 4. That's called fair to the managers at this store. While the rest of the employees have to plan around their work schedule. The manager picks even get their vacations they want and don't need to worry about being turned down for the days they want.
bad,"The job itself is alright. No real downside, but no real upside either. Hard labor, but I don't mind that. The problem is management. They are the worst bunch of slackers you ever met. They don't care about their workers and treat them like a disposable commodity. When something goes right, they take the credit with the higher-ups, and when something goes wrong, they blame the workers, whether the workers are responsible for the problem or not. The policies that come down the chain are at least half the problem. They are unworkable at best, completely detached from reality at worst."
bad,"Walmart has its good and bad days but the poor management has to go. There are no raises given and no type of fun in Walmart anymore. Starting at Walmart, it was very laid back and competitive but fair. Working over the years, Walmart has gone down as a company because of the work ethnic and the pressure. I use to love working at Walmart but now it’s beginning to be very overwhelming and stressful due to hours being constantly cut and lack of workers in the workplace"
bad,"Don't work here unless you're desperate... you will be told to work anything from 2-4 hours over your shift the day of. If you can't, you will be written up for leaving ON TIME... If you get hurt at worked, you will be fired, KY labor board doesn't care, walmart lines their pockets enough to ignore them. No lunch breaks, only 1 ten minute and 1 15 minute break for a 12 hour shift."
bad,Management is very poor and are borderline verbally abusive. And if you get on managements bad side they will find every reason to fire you. Enjoyed customer interaction but the Walmart team ruined it for me
bad,When we first get there we set the backroom up move what has to be and work what was not work from the night before sometimes when lay down pallets and then we start unloading
bad,I learned to be very independent get as much work done and as fast as I was able.  To always help the customer first.  See that they found what they needed and make any offers of help for more.  Go the extra mile so they come back.  Always hope for the best and to expect very little.
bad,"if you want to survive in this company you have to be willing to partake in gossip and drama, otherwise this is not the company for you. the management team has their pick of favorites who they let do whatever they want with no repercussions or accountability."
bad,"aprendi a liderar me manter firme nas decisoes... "
bad,Not the company to work with... Management is not great... Favoritism all over the Lewisburg store... Gotta brown nose if you want to get anywhere with them
bad,Its ok if u know what ur doing .. I liked it but management played favorite and didn't know how to do some things and I was better off doing it myself
bad,"Walmart has been a great company to work for.  You pretty much got out of working  for them what you put into the job.  I really enjoyed the customer interaction.  I also liked the diversity of my duties.  Most of the time my position was about customer service and satisfaction, however, lately there are times when based on computer output we would have to complete tasks according  to what the computer states.  On these occasions the customer is not #1 and this became the least favorite part of my job.  New pay structures benefit new hires and employees that have been with the company for any period of time received little if any benefit."
bad,"Been there for more than a year. Been in Deli since March 2017, they focus on your weaknesses instead of strengths..counting how many sandwiches I can make, not counting how many times I get interrupted to assist customers. I get along with most of my co-workers except for one and this one fights with all of us and nothing gets done to her. Managers tell us how awful we are, no praise."
bad,The Management is very rude and does not show Respect for the Individual when it comes to the employees that work for them. I would never refer anyone to apply at this particular Walmart Store
bad,Walmart is agood place environment working place I have ever seen. Where by Associates co-operate together to make the the store Enjoyable for athers.
bad,"Work you to death, and under constant threat of termination.  Management on the overnight shift is simply intolerable at the White Marsh, MD store.  However, Management at the Aberdeen, MD store was just the opposite!"
bad,They have very good breaks and thats about it for the good stuff. the CSM's are rude and disrespectful and don't work. They stand around on their hand devices and do nothing or are there phones.
bad,"A giant corporation, with little or no interest in their employees. When employees are terminated, it occurs at the end of the shift, after the day's worth of work has been completed.  No training is provided other than a rudimentary safety briefing. "
bad,"Granted, I worked overnight, but my coworkers were the trashiest and most childish “adults” I have ever been around. Most employees either came in to work high or drunk, or they left on their lunch break to get high and/or drunk. The management is the worst I have ever experienced, and that’s really what makes the biggest impact. The general manager comes into work angry and passes that attitude onto the managers beneath her, and so on. It’s miserable."
bad,"A typical day at work starts with unloading the truck, then stocking and ending the day with prepping for night shift. I have improved my customer service skills. Management is not the greatest. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my coworkers."
bad,"Work days seem to drag, I learned how shady and unethical some managers can get and that they need to really make sure they higher managers with an open willingness to learn products and policies and that care about the consumer."
bad,"Honestly, I was very successful here but the management is out of hand. The PIC likes to yell and be rude to employees in front of customers (this also includes belittling in front of customers and co workers). If customers are screaming at the cashiers or techs, the PIC will NOT step in and defend them, he will just sit back and allow the employees to be mentally abused by the customers."
bad,"Walmart wants you to work as hard as you can as fast as you can then they tell you to go home early because there is nothing else to do.  Overtime was prohibited, you may be written up if you exceeded 40 hours if you were full time. There would be times when all of a sudden they don't need you to work for a week or 2 and then they may call you in for an extra shift but then reward you by making you leave early so you don't get overtime. They expect you do bend over backwards for then but they will not do it for you."
bad,if you might have guessed it then your right. only way up at walmart is getting on your knees and puckering up those lips. they treat a lot of the hard working guys like trash but the lousy lazy workers get away with almost anything.
bad,"First off, you will get written up/counseled over items that they really shouldn't.  You can get written up for missing work due to a documented VA disability interfering with your life.  There is also no policy protecting the members of the workforce from abuse by the management.  There is no safeguards for unknown write-ups.  The team member doesn't acknowledge the first two write-ups, so you can get written up twice before you will know it.  The third write-up can be you getting fired.  They're supposed to counsel you on what you did wrong and what to do to correct it, but there is nothing for the member to sign to prove that the counseling ever happened.  This is in my most humble opinion very poor on their part and should be illegal."
bad,I don't like working here at Walmart!! They are not a fair company to work for. I regret starting there. I want out of this whole.help me get out of this cray place.
bad,Walmart works u like a dog and doesn't appreciate you. Managers are rude unprofessional unorganized it's just not a very good place to work at like I said they work you like a dog and do not appreciate you. They don't want to hire people full-time so they won't give you benefits and they only give you a little bit hours people cannot live like that I'm sorry but they can't
bad,"Walmart would rather hire new people at entry level pay every six months than keep experienced employees. They hire you in as part-time so they can avoid offering good benefits. They will work you 40 hours and week, and expect you to do the work of 2 people, but they don't want to give raises, and couldn't care less if you stay or not."
bad,Was an employee for 5 years at 1677. They had the associates being scheduled alone and  doing the work of 3 associates so they only had to pay one. And sometimes I worked 6 hours with out being able to go to the bathroom.  Put in my two week notice because of the stress. Got the flu during  the two weeks and had to call out a couple days. Went to my second to last shift and found out then that they had terminated me with out even telling me. At least a call would have been nice to let me know so I didn’t waste my time.
bad,Keeping Place stocked constantly on your toes on the floor helping out customers keeping the place cleaned multiple jobsmanagement is highly demanding
bad,"Walmart says they want a change in their culture but don't count on it.  6 day, 15 hour days are the normal work week if you happen to end up under certain managers.  It's a dog eat dog environment where the management team is more concerned about completing their ""Notes"" for the day then helping other associates or more importantly the customer."
bad,"Working at Walmart is just how you might imagine it if you stand back and watch how the employees talk to each other, they are very open about management.  I might be just enough to pay your bills"
bad,"Walmart is constantly playing the 'more work, less people' game and it visibly affects the store's performance and customer service abilities. They are consistently adding in new 'red tape' hoops to jump through, while cutting hours and department coverage. We are constantly being told to ""work smarter, not harder"", but none of our equipment works correctly or has been updated properly to manage the workflow effectively. They do not focus on what good you bring to the company, or how hard you actually work to get things done. They only focus on what hasn't been completed, while not taking into account the various reasons those tasks may not have been possible to complete. It's literally all about the numbers on paper, and not the actual functionality of the workplace or how different factors affect those numbers. We are expected to function like machines, not people. Discussions are never about how to improve things to more effectively reach company goals. Discussions are only about how goals aren't being met, and how you aren't working hard enough, even as you're killing yourself to keep their company running. Basically, the company is being micro-managed to death by pencil-pushers and number-crunchers that have no idea what it actually takes to do the jobs that need to be done to keep the company running efficiently, and they don't care about anyone. They tell you that you can take paid time off when you've earned it and want to take it, but regularly deny requests. They don't keep enough staffing to be able to let people take the vacation time they've earned, and they just"
bad,Operations of Walmart is very poor as there is not an ability to apply basic reasoning to anything. A typical day includes stocking freight and the tasks are nearly impossible to attain. There is never enough hourly staff to help customers.
bad,"I loved my job at Walmart especially my customers and my co -workers i was there for 16 years i""ve  trained store managers in the areas i worked in before they have moved up  and have had customers come in just to say hello to me your customer is your #1 priority but also maintaining my areas in the store .I""ve had maybe 5 good managers since my 16 years at walmart ."
bad,"hard on the body, pay is not great, only certain people can advance. used to be a fun place to work but now they expect more and more from a person and give back less and less. for being the biggest company in the world the health insurance is horrible."
bad,"The only good thing I can say about Walmart is that the pay was great but, it's not anymore.  Management, with exception of a few, was not willing to work with the pharmacy. The suits upstairs had no clue of how to run a pharmacy nor how many hours we required , to do our job, talk about micro management.  You are expected to work when they need you, There is no uniformity, one store will schedule associates more that 40 hours per week and more than 7 days in a row, when others say it's not permitted.  The rules only apply when they want them to apply."
bad,They pay amazing but treat you like garbage. People are quitting left and right because of the production rate and sudden changes that are always made Its good if you need the money but I don't  suggest this job to anybody.
bad,"My experience at Walmart in the begin was a complete joy, until I finally indulged the true fdace of unsatisfying employment. Extensive work loads, poor pay, picky and implusive managers, and very disrespectful and unprofessional management team."
bad,"There were a few wonderful people working with me at Walmart,but most of the upper management team simply did not care. Walmart as a company does not care. They do things that make it look like they do, but the only thing on their minds is money. Managers are not allowed enough shift hours to make it even somewhat easy on the employees. Departments are consistently understaffed. A lack of workers, however, does not change their idea of how the store should look or be running. I was often in charge of three or four departments on my own, and i know the same was expected of many others. Walmart decisions, as a whole, are ridiculous and often end up making things harder instead of easier. This job was much harder than it should be and while the pay is decent, I did not feel like it was enough money to justify the way employees get treated. Never before my Walmart job, did I take home anger and stress. Almost every day I came home in an awful mood due to the leadership and expectations i experienced at Walmart."
bad,Working at Walmart is like working as a slave basically at least at mine. They hardly ever have enough employee's there to do the job with out stress they make their cashier's do anything and everything if they're short staffed else where because they didn't schedule anybody. And the manager where I work basically told mey job is more important than my child.
bad,"Management has gutted sales personnel, so customers are neglected and ignored.  Was told I'd be strictly customer service/cashier, was forced to work unloading trucks, which I had previously said I didn't want to do."
bad,"The night shift at Walmart was fairly easy, the environment fairly carefree, but the management for my particular department was lacking. The other employees carried no love or respect for them, and while at first, their list of tasks for me was clear, about a month in, I was reprimanded and removed from my overnight position for tasks I was not initially informed I was to be completing. So overall I found my time there frustrating, and emotionally draining. I resigned form my position about a month and a half in, for poor management, and on the account of my life being placed in danger."
bad,Management does not trust its associates.  Work in Bentonville is not valued due to recent purchase of .com companies.  Lost all original culture.  New forced bell curve of 80/20 causes mistrust and favoritism.
bad,"People who worked there were down to earth but the environment was stressful, had too many issues and didn't pay well enought. I'm glad I left. It's great for a part time temp job."
bad,"Great place to work if you're just starting out in the workplace, or if you're a college student, or need a easy second job. I don't see much of a future there, although."
bad,"When I was running the Tire, Lube, Express we had a sales increase on tires and services, I did all my own paperwork and the paperwork of my manager (they switched them out every few months so ended up with a new manager to train). I was removed from my position because I wasn't doing enough work. I was working 40-50 hours a week and having to cover all the parts of the service center when someone called in and do all my paperwork and my managers paperwork. I trained all the service writers and had daily meetings with them to get them onto the sales goals for services and tires. But I wasn't doing enough work. Right......"
bad,"Well, if you want to be kept on your toes while being treated horribly, this job is for you I guess. Customers were ok most of the time, but it wasn't uncommon for someone to be overly angry that a coupon expired or something wasn't on sale anymore. You're also highly required to get people to donate to the Children's Miracle Network and get people to sign up for credit cards. The funny thing is, I've had more experienced employees ignore this rule and yet it was fiercely required for me and other newer employees."
bad,very stressful place to work. underpaid and way over  they exspect more than one person can do. they don't .noone is ever happy at work and it is just a bad place to work.
bad,They got rid of me over bereavement days that I had to take for my uncles funeral they don’t really care about anything other then making money they don’t care about family
bad,walmart mgmt needs to be sent back to the academy to learn proper mgmt skills. they advance people in a department who know nothing about that department and then ask the other canidate who didnt get the spot to train said person
bad,"wal mart managers tend to forget to relieve cashiers and show empathy to employees. I've been working t walmart for 8 years and i have not moved up at all, there is very little chance for advancement."
bad,Inconsistent hour's. Short handed on employee's. You had to do everyone else's job and didn't get paid extra or receive overtime to compensate being short staffed. Management was very rude and treated employees horrible.
bad,"Loved my customers, they were primarily awesome. Even when they were challenging, there was great opportunity to ""turn"" them in to fans."
bad,Only good thing u can say about the building I worked at is the pay everything else will make u hate to wake up in the morning I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy... they ride u about production all day every day even when u are making production it's not good enough the management at this particular building is the worse untrained management team i have ever seen and the whole atmosphere there sucks... 90% of the people there hate their job and hate the way they are treated by management the other 10% just hasn't been there long enough yet
bad,"management unstable, nobody is ever on the same page, one person says one thing and other says something totally different, raises are based on percentage scale, no full time therefore no affordable benefits"
bad,"its walmart, dont expect much, they dont care about you, just show up and do your work and youll pretty much be set. the most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,I ran the register and bagged customer groceries. Stocked shelves when needed. Answered any questions or concerns the customers may have. Separated customer returns to be put back on shelves to be sold.
bad,"We are a huge family but you are expected to do a lot of work for very little money. It's walmart. They will try to squeeze every bit they can out of you and give very little to nothing in return. I have made all of my lifelong friends there, but every one of them have ended up leaving because their extremely hard work never ever paid off. I am now on this site, trying to get a better job because my extremely hard work for the past 3 years has gotten me nowhere but unappreciated, under payed, and medicated on depressants."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for almost six years and am currently making less then new hires in my department. I'm thirty and have a degree and 16 year old kids are hired in at a higher pay rate then me. I have talked to personnel and management but they are unwilling to help but acknowledge that it is ""unfair."""
bad,I believe that fairness in the workplace is lacking. Management abuses his/her position to intimidate the employe. Highly stressful work environment. Favoritism works when it comes to get a high position. Bribing is a big form of promotions
bad,"Stress and more stress, Nothing is ever good enough, wants to hold associates accountable while in training rather than train them.  You will only learn if you really  search it out, don't bother to ask you will be coached/  There was no enjoyable part of the job.  The hourly associates are the unhappiest I have ever seen.  Do not ever expect to have a weekend off or any holidays.  The company feels they OWN you."
bad,"Typical day at Walmart was busy, worked with four other girls but two would only talk and do nothing. Leaving me and another girl having to do all the work. Management was terrible, one of the girls continuously was rude to me and harassed me and they would do nothing about her. Hardest part of the job was having to do my work plus two other peoples. Most enjoyable part was the hour break!"
bad,Good luck progressing with this company unless you are comfortable working 60-70 hour weeks. Management will control your every move pertaining to your employment.
bad,"They don't care if you have a family, and they don't care about safety unless its to get you in trouble. They will threaten you the entire time that if you leave you will never work for Walmart again. All I can say is that they lived up to their reputation."
bad,the company is in the process of cutting jobs and making changes to run off senior drivers. many are retiring early or looking elsewhere. this is not the same company i hired on with years ago. they have also cut the new hire pay as of oct.1
bad,worst place i have ever worked and i've been there for 4 years now. I gradually watched it fall apart from a family orientated workplace to a cut throat revolving door no stability.
bad,"The work was easy but the management made it mentally draining. It's very hard to talk to management about work issues, because they will say it's your fault. Or that you suck at your job."
bad,Poor management. Too many bosses not enough positive communication. Lots of gossip within the associates. Poor warehouse organization and management. Warehouse is a major fire hazard
bad,To much to do to Ian not enough time or help to get it done! Management does nothing but walk around telling other people do things there way cause your not allowed to have a opinion
bad,"Management is lazy, horrible attitudes"
bad,"Entry level management gets most of the workload while the upper management sits in the office playing angry birds and giving assignments over a radio. Constantly getting overworked, underpaid compared to other similar positions. Management was cutthroat, if you could be blamed for something, even if it wasn't your fault, now it is your fault..."
bad,"Very stressful place to work, works you 60 to 70 hors a week. There is no teamwork. Everyone is out for themselves. Your job is threatened everyday. You don't have the staffing to complete the job."
bad,Do not ever care to work in the super centers ever again. The environment is not one of growth or prosperity. I do not recommend this as a job for anyone.
bad,Work day consisting of stocking shelves with as much freight that could go out as fast as you could.  Help any customers or employees that need help.  The management was terrible.  They seemed to not know or can't remember what its like to not be a manager and it goes to their heads. They abused their power greatly.  The employees were all pretty cool and interesting people though.  The hardest part was trying to finish all your freight in the time limit while helping others.  The most enjoyable part was going on break.
bad,"A typical work day is minimal 12 hours for salaried managers, giving you no work/life balance. The hardest part of the job is the cut throat leaders above you."
bad,"Work anywhere else. Literally. This place is the worst. Management couldn't care less about their employees. Customers are terrible. Overall the worst working experience I have ever had, and I worked there for almost 3 years."
bad,Management often has little clue on how to direct themselves and often rely on experienced associates under them for direction.  Management fails to appropriately recognize associates for their accomplishments.  There is often excessive gossip and rumors generated by all levels of associates within the store creating a stressful and chaotic work life.  Management is unreliable and does not maintain the same standards and expectations for all associates.
bad,"Managers were unfair, pay was not great.  I was never late, worked hard as anyone else and always got picked on.  I was not a fan of lower management.  Upper management was great."
bad,"Management was very political and played a lot of favoritism. People who basically sucked up to management were allowed to get away with things that others were not. If you were a favorite then you got overtime. If not, you were not allowed to have it"
bad,"TO advance you have to be young and pretty, but what you know about the department and that you serve as acting department manager when the manager is on vacation"
bad,I wouldn't  recommend this  place  to anyone.  Not really  interested in the employees. Open door policy  doesn't  really  mean open door. And most stuff isn't  kept confidential  like they say
bad,"Underpaid, yet expected to act as a manager while the management team themselves did nothing. No room to grow in company. Extremely stressful and treated like a nuisance when asking for help."
bad,They expect you to be available 24/7. I learned how to say no. Management acts like you are a number. The hardest part is dealing with rude people. The best part was making friends.
bad,"Employees are treated poorly by managers with a false ""open door"" policy to shield management from repercussions.  It is very stressful work for very poor pay."
bad,I honestly do not recommend working here. The managers are very rude and do not care about you what so ever. A lot of bullying. I honestly will be quite happy once I find another job.
bad,Don't work here there very poor management will make you crazy.they say one thing and do another without notice.can change schedules at any given time.
bad,Walmart was sometimes a fun job bot overall the job i had we were understaffed and they expexted 5 people to do the job of 12 people everyone started quiting the managers would do nothing but be on their phones not working at all but demanding us to wotk faster
bad,See above. The reputation of there products sold in stores is representative of the company and treatment of their employees. Most people work for Walmart until they find something better.
bad,"the hours was never , mainly had to work lots of nights, hours were always cut"
bad,"Absolutely an awful place to work. Management is too worried about their own backs to realize they are the problem. If something goes wrong it falls on sales associates, cause management will throw everyone under the bus. They do not train you on the salesfloor, they just throw into a position and expect you to know what you're doing. Place is like a high school, gossip, back stabbing, and everyones mating. If you try to go above managements heads and talk to cooperate they will find out, and they will retaliate."
bad,Walmart is a poor excuse for a job. I will never work there’s again. It was convenient for a overnight job. But I hated the management there were so rude.
bad,"working at Walmart is OK if this is a job to get some work experience. You could get a promotion if you are liked, but other then that there is nothing else to say."
bad,Picking and packing medication.  Inputting prescription into the data base. Putting up inventory. Helping customers with finding different needs.  Checking customers out at the cash register.  cleaning area after shifted is over.
bad,"this is a terrible company to work for. I would never recommend anyone to work for the Walmart I worked for. Management does not have anyone's back and with the lack of training, they will use that against you."
bad,They have favorites. And dont work fair with others. Ignorant rude. Never tried to work with peoples schedule. Management assumes before getting to know the situation of certain things.
bad,"While working at Walmart, the management was absolutely terrible. We had so many people quit that it was ridiculous. Out of the 5 people who quit, it took them around 4 months to replace the first person to quit. We were understaffed and their was never enough people on the floor. We were expected to cover the floor but many times I was the only one working and when a customer needed something from the backroom , the floor was left uncovered.  Walmart does have a great pay system and their benefits for part time employees were amazing but their was very little full-time opportunities."
bad,"This company does NOT care about the people working for them. You're treated like a number and if you happen to be full time they will try everything to either get you to quit or drop down to part time so they don't have to pay for benefits. For such a simple job, the work environment is toxic and feels like a high school full of immature kids. Save your sanity and seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"Good associates,  bad management certain associates management gave favored them hard "
bad,Wouldn't recommend still but older manager talked openly about employees in a negative way. Only speaking from overnight experience. I left because of different reasons but when I go in the store it still is unprofessional
bad,Just that management does not listen or take your personal life or anything into account for anything. Inconsistant in the way they treat you and the work load they tend to give.
bad,"Unless you start as management you wont get it.It is a fast paced,stock your rear end off kind of job.So many employees with many internal hassles.It was a job to pay the bills."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for five years and only made $0.21 more than a new hire when I quit. They expected more and more from employees that worked, but refused to take action against the employees that didn't pull their weight. In the end the management just didn't care about my well being as long as the job was getting done."
bad,"good place to pick up a paycheck, not a good place for long term career.  Associates usual have to do work in multiple areas due to staffing guidelines"
bad,"In the times I worked at Walmart I saw many employees loaded onto gurneys and carried out over STRESS.  One supervisor even passed away with a heart attack at work, Many firings and not a good environment at all."
bad,"I have never hated a job as much as I hated Walmart.  It was like a high school experience.  If someone interpreted your tone of voice as grumpy over the radio, you would be written up.  The manager would listen to rumors rather than get to know the associates and never respected the associates.  You couldn't look cross eyed at a manager without being written up for respect for the individual.  Though there was no respect for anyone outside of salaried management unless you were one of the high school drama."
bad,management treats you like second class citezens men and women get paid the same yet men have to do more work. the way i was treated by my main manager led to depression
bad,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers at walmart. I hated management. My last Walmart was the worst walmart i have ever worked for. Management treats people very unfairly, has favorites, treats associates like garbage and the store has a lot of inner turmoil. The management that is there causes good people to quit and to step down and to hate their job. The management can make it better but choose not to. the sore is a mess and is lacking everywhere because nobody cares about the job because management is awful."
bad,"This job was fun. Although the pay wasn't great, it was relaxed and I met some cool people. I would never work here again, but I do know some people who never stopped working here."
bad,Every Wal Mart is different but the one I was at was terrible no one cares about you just themselves terrible management everything is just terrible you have a question most people who should know how to answer cant answer due to lack of training
bad,"They fix your schedule however they want. Benefits sucks. Its very fast paste. We use to get paid and extra $1 an hour ,but not nomore, customers are ghetto and rude"
bad,"A job that lacks on having holidays off, time off, over worked as there is always mandatory overtime, and the goals to reach are ridiculously high for anyone to meet."
bad,"A typical day at work is very hectic and disorganized."
bad,Walmart was a different experience from most workplaces. Low paying especially for the Courtesy Associates who does multiple jobs within the company. My store was understaffed in my position also. You can advance through the company for sure.
bad,"The management team was very unorganized. They were never on the same page. One manger would tell you to do something, then another would tell you to do something different. The backroom was never organized. We were very low on staff. The manager who was in charge of doing the schedules, would not give anyone hours. We were very low on coverage in every department. They cut back on hours."
bad,Employees at Walmart are overworked without fair compensation. Mandatory overtime for days like Black Friday are horrific. Management did the best they could on the whole even though working for a mega-corporation.
bad,I am just trying to find something new in the workplace. And a cell center seems like the job for me i love to type on the computers and be on the phone and help people out.
bad,I work with great people but some of the management think they are above others and treat employees poorly. Some of the management are great but I have had a terrible experience with my direct superiors.
bad,multi task in your dept. take care of customers clean any equipment used help out manager in anything they may need must be aware of expired merchandise on shelves and case and around dept. must be aware of inventory also
bad,"They insist their all about the employees, nothing further from the truth. Once you start your just another one of their ""Dogs"". Think twice before working there. Easy to get hired, live to regret it."
bad,The harder you work the more they expect from you and you better not have a bad day. No room to advance. Get indirectly told that you're a bad worker. That town is full of drama too.
bad,"Work/Life Balance: I never had a set schedule, They never gave me one even though I asked. It varied the days and hours I worked and it sucked. I'd have to put in 2-3 weeks in advance for a needed day off."
bad,"Typical corporation feeling the pains of innovation and competition. This stress is put on the business teams, which are sometimes not included in the overall objective of the company. Making for a confusing work life."
bad,I was promised full time but never got it and then my hours kept getting cut. There was no job advancement here ever in my department and if you wanted more hours you were sent to do cashier duties in front of store.
bad,There is no communication the managers and the cashier. The cashier is always in the blind when it come to the customers. We always short on cashier a customer can come through and purchase and find it on the shelves and we don't even care the product. You can't never find a manager in a reasonable time while you holding a the line for the customers or they have there products in the wrong spot with the wrong price.
bad,I would recommend this job if you are desperate and in need of a job badly. If not then I would keep looking because this job makes it hard to enjoy yours days off and being with family. After getting off work your body literally hurts.
bad,I had a three managers when I started.  The two good ones left for advancement in other stores.  The one that stayed had developed a problem with me from the start.  My fellow employees were kinda shocked at how much he went after me.  He then turned all the new incoming managers against me.
bad,"hated working here. to much drama, not enough training. cant keep people hired here due to how they are treated. not enough pay for what is expected of you. managers swear at their staff"
bad,I hated my managers and they did know what they were doing. The culture was that nobody knew what they were doing and couldnt agree on anything. There was drama all over the place.
bad,"Treat you like slaves, you won’t let you have a word in say. The supervisors are disrespectful and ignorant. The work environment won’t let you use team work even though it says during training that’s the biggest part of the job. Yell at you for things you can’t control like: helping customers out while you’re working freight on the floor and yell at you for being occupied by customers when the customers are the main important part of the job over your work it says it on training."
bad,Walmart used to be an amazing place to work. Many changes have happened and they are working their best associates into the ground. Management is disrespectful and a typical day will drain your soul.
bad,"company was good, i got promoted within 3 months but the management team didn't communicate well with each other, no one wanted to do their jobs. if you do your job and only your job you will succeed"
bad,"The management is awful. They do not communicate with you, they do not teach you, and they do not care if you succeed in your position. Even if you are hardworking and willing to learn they will cast you to the side and get mad when you don't know how to do something."
bad,What made my day worth it was my customers. Helping others always made it worth wild. Going above and beyond just to make them happy. I loved my customers and they loved me; they told me often
bad,Management is awful and they do not care about their employees the least bit. I was forced to go out almost daily and get carts cause the store could never keep any cart attendants. I live in Florida so sometimes its 90 degree weather outside so to pay someone minimum wage to get carts in that heat is outrageous. I recommend working at Target over Walmart. Both are bad but Target isn't as worse
bad,As a new assistant I was supposed to receive almost 10 weeks of training. My classroom training consisted of the Wal-Mart cheer every hour and how to look out for yourself. My in store training was a week and I was thrown to the wolves. My store manager on My cared about saving her own butt most of the time. See went through a new assistant every six weeks like clock work. After seven months of being lied to and blamed for everything and anything I had enough and quit. I haven't lost a night of sleep over my choice.
bad,I am a dairy and frozen department overnight stocker. All freight is expected to be stocked even if the truck is late. I am able to complete my assigned tasks. I have even been pulled to other departments to help them stock their freight because of others who do not work with a sense of urgency. The overnight shift has a high turn over rate.
bad,"Management does not know how to lead"
bad,"I just cant say anything, its just was one of those experiences that one learn from and want to never do it again. i would definitely pass on that job all the way around"
bad,"Not good at all. It's needs to do better and progress and a company. The people hired were very unprofessional and rude, not the best place for anyone to work, they look for any reason to fire someone"
bad,They management is horrible. They never understand people have things going on i their personal life. but the co-workers there some are fun to be around others just do to much to be grown.
bad,"Walmart, just don't work here. I had first hand experience on what managers are like here, they suck and they're lazy. If you're looking for some real experience, work elsewhere!"
bad,"Typical days at work are very hectic a lot of things to do an many interruptions to getting that work done."
bad,Certain management had highly unlikely expectations and would punish for those who did not meet those expectations.  Needless to say they punished a lot of people.
bad,Management is horrible and only advance people that suck up. Hours are horrible and pay is even worse. Customers are always rude even when you are nice to them.
bad,I neither had money nor time on my hands untill I started to consider leaving this job and had to make time to get a new one. Thats when it all came crashing down. From OSHA violations to trying to get some of us fired by braking the law.
bad,"Greta pay for the job in theory, but unnecessary stress and long hours and constant changing schedules made the job unbearable. Great place to work for 15 years, the last three ruined the experience."
bad,"I feel as tho wal-mart does not care about their employees."
bad,"The management is different at every Walmart. The first one I worked at had awesome management, my current one not so much. There is always room to advance though."
bad,I came into this corporation looking to advance and use my degree in Business Administration. I never received any acknowledgement for a chance in advancement without some sort of letter of recommendation. This building in particular made it very clear they do not care what education you have but it's all about who you know and if they will vouch for in a meeting once you apply.
bad,"Working at Walmart is mostly a nightmare, because of the lack of communication between managers. It pays and is consosten and flexible with school schedules, but is also a corrupt corporation."
bad,Fairness depends on the manager chain. Pay can be fair depending on your position. Job security varies. Sanitation is not upkept and safety violations are common.
bad,Not a friendly place to work.  Too many chiefs and no Indians. Hardest workers are never appreciated.  Always willing to use you to work a higher paying job without being paid for that job.
bad,"very competitive and there is no advancement in this company with, any experience that you have or who you are. They go out of their way to use you for what the corporation wants and not for what you need. Public relations was the most enjoyable part of the job and getting to know your'e customers and to assist those who could not find exactly what they were looking for. Management is self centered and only cares about themselves and not their employeeses."
bad,"Walmart does not care at all about its employees. hostile work environment with very little opportunity for advancement. Pay is so low that state assistance, such as food stamps and state healthcare are required just to keep working there"
bad,Worked at a brand new store thought it was going to be a great opportunity to not be like the other stores with empty shelves and disappearing employees. 2 months into the job the Dept Managers were being reprimanded for empty shelves despite our asking for more information on the ordering system. It took 4 months before they actually trained us on the inventory management system for walmart. The culture is very biased. Everyone from Assistant Manager up are unapproachable and they let it be known. I ran 5 departments with only 5 part time employees and myself. Most of the time my employees were pulled to work other parts of the store leaving 5 departments with no one on duty.
bad,"if you think working for Walmart, absolutely it is the worst decision you ever make for your self. people at Wal-Mart don't respect each other. Management trying to make problems between co-workers so they can know who is doing what."
bad,"Accesibles en el horario sola para con los que trabajamos en oficina, turno rotativos y solo un día de descanso."
bad,"My job was very stressful at times, and the hours was long also I had to work every weekend. I had to do my job and the department manager job, I didn't think was fair."
bad,The priority of Walmart is to cut full time employees with benefits and experience in favor of part time zero benefits. The Walmart way is more for the corporate heads at the expense of quality work and services. The main goal is appearing to be competitive in a business world that’s quickly making their model obsolete.
bad,"Too many waves of lay offs. Employee moral is very low due to lack of sense of job security. Management prefers to bring in their friends, people that worked at Dell."
bad,I do not like the new culture. Walmart is ever changing and does not allow much opportunity for advancement if you are not consistently bowing down to mangement delegations.
bad,Its a nightmare scenario in which at any given time the management outnumber the staff and all of them constantly give you contradictory orders every 15 minutes.
bad,Wal-Mart Is not a company that you want to work for us a lot of stuff behind the scenes that a lot of people would recognize him to actually work for the company and I am not willing to give a good review on my experience working for the company
bad,"Everyone thinks Wal Mart is a great place to work at. It was at first but it went downhill."
bad,Walmart would be ok but they are coming up with letting the computer do the schedules people who have been there and are full time  hours are getting cut from 40 down to some of us are being cut to 4 and a half hours this program is called customer first but there isnt going to be many employees in the store this is going to start in january and i cant wait until then
bad,"Wasn't a very great work environment, unhappy for most of the time was working there. Coworkers never seemed to get along and there is usually always something that is going wrong."
bad,Night shift manager is unprofessional and out to get people he has disagreements with. The ask you do jobs that you was not hired or trained for and when you tell them you not trained to do it they cut your hours.
bad,"The managers were rude and vocal. They were also very incompetent. Customer service was not good at all, this was because of bad management. The pay was too low for the amount of work we did. We were usually forced to work with out enough staff."
bad,I was treated horribly all the time and it was a hostile work environment. The management is awful they don't hardly do anything ever. And they get angry if you have overtime and make you cut it by having you take longer breaks or getting off work early.
bad,"Good working environment and a great work/life balance.  "
bad,"This job is trash. I dont' know if it's the management itself, but the hours suck and can change at any time. One days you can have hours and the very next you check and your missing a whole 6 days from your schedule. You ask management about it and they promise. ""Oh I'll fix it!"" so you keep checking and hoping that someone will and NOTHING gets fixed. Don't even get me started on the lack of cashiers! There are associates constantly asking for hours (Like myself) and there's only 3 cashiers scheduled. Wal-Mart is trash and I hope they see this."
bad,It's walmart it is a good job for people still in school or looking to get a job real quick to help with income. But over all i wouldn't work here again
bad,like the summary say's it's a fast pace management didn't care and the people where pushed to the limits.. not a lot of care as in caring about if you needed help or better training.
bad,Walmart will take you in and work you down until you are a shell of your former self. The management is awful and they treat you poorly. I've rarely heard of people loving their job unless they were apart of management or their work was easy.
bad,"The job is great except for the fact that management does not help or support the department.  Inadequate number of personnel to handle preventative maintenance schedule.  No time to train new personnel during working hours."
bad,its just not enjoyable any more ever one is always sad and the management has no communication  and you will get in trouble for other peoples mistakes they punish you as a whole group. the only reason I would recommend someone to work here is there pay is pretty good and you do get really good benifets.
bad,"It has been quite a while since I worked at Wal-Mart but they seemed to cultivate an atmosphere that put their employees last. No benefits, ever changing rules that never seemed to make sense. However, my co-workers were excellent. I just wish the corporation valued their employees much more than they showed."
bad,bosses don't care about your schedule. deliberately put you on days you request off. inconsistant work schedule. no real bosses at all. everybody is trying new and exciting ways to avoid doing their job.
bad,"No appreciation for employees, not directly that is. Over worked and understaffed. You can't have over 40hrs and if you do! You have to cut them on your lunch."
bad,You unload trucks and stock shelves. I learned that the costumer is always right. The management is always barking at you and expecting more than you can handle I never figured out there was one. getting stuff done on time and dealing with costumes.I liked my pay check.
bad,"the main reason I am giving this company such a low score is that it feels as though they are lying to me. It seems that every time I get my annual pay raise (which is 10 cents usually if you do well) they lower my hours so that I make the same, or less, then before. the only way to get a decent amount of hours is to become full-time, and the only way to become full-time is to be apart management now. I have no desire to stay a part time employee for my whole career."
bad,"when working at walmart you are over worked under appreciated, managers dont know anything about people they just care about getting stuff done, you are the dirt underneath their boots, lowest on the totem pole."
bad,Just go there to make money.its a quick job. The work and too stressful and they expect too much from you when your a hard worker. They will drain you if you actually care about your work and you will always pick up the next person slack.
bad,"Hate it your a ""body"" for this company and not a person. Racially profiled a lot, if someone has more  years in the company then you they are right and never wrong!"
bad,The Management team is the reason why anyone would leave this company. They are the reason I want to move up because I know I can be a great assistant manager who not only cares about the business but the employees as well.
bad,"I started out being a stockier at night, then went to a customer service manager, then a department manager. It was a great experience but they do not consider family(children) being sick. Otherwise they would schedule you on the days you could not work after I told them."
bad,Only people of one certain race get promoted at this store and if you're not of this race they make sure to make you feel unwelcome from day one!!! Management has their favorites and some get away with whatever they want until corporate comes down on them.
bad,"The store i work at is constantly progressing towards micro-management. From district manager, to store manager, to assistant manager, to support manager, and finally to department manager there is little to no communication ability at all. Even with all theses managers, I still felt like there was no plan and just a chaotic mess everyday. The work was simple, all I needed to do was stock and make sure inventory counts were right, but unfortunately every task was a struggle trying to use the company's faulty equipment. This store is trying to become more technology evolved by implementing online grocery. Though, online grocery is great for customers that aren't physically able to shop themselves, associates suffer the consequence, devolving the stores customer service and putting customers in store are put aside for online grocery."
bad,The job has become very stressful. It's difficult to enjoy a personal life with the hours they have you work. I have enjoyed receiving the experience and the ability to work in many different areas of the retail business.
bad,"I worked at this job an average of 70 hours a week. But I only got paid as salary for 37.5. All of my workers were impressed with the length of hours but when I told them I was salary and I was not receiving any overtime for the time I was there- that I was just making sure the building wasn't going up in Flames, they were completely shocked that I would essentially waste my time to help them out. My store eventually closed down about two years after I left due to just the difficulties of that particular store."
bad,Meeting different people is always a joy on any typical day. You Learn how to pay attention to detail. Management is always there to help you. Hardest part of the job was to go back and track something down that were missing in shipment or in audits. But every day is enjoyable.
bad,"Good place to work if you like what you do. People can be nice and helpful. As a supervisor, our job is very active. Ive learned a lot of skills I didn't know I had. All that I learned I want to put into practice everywhere I go."
bad,"Place was very large and no one to help the customers.  "
bad,Management aren't very understanding when personal issues are taking place in your life. Point system is horrible. PTO time is based off the amount of hours you work.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. But I think that has a lot to do with who your managers are, including store manager. Always has a reason to cut your hours. Full time or not."
bad,Walmart is a terrible company to work for is a stressful and negative environment. management never cared about life situations they didn't care about anything . the money wasn't even worth it . they go off a  point system and I got pointed for showing documentation on my sickness don't work there terrible company
bad,"They do not care about nothing but themselves they bark orders like we are there children. Super disrespectful, and amazingly unprofessional. they run out all the hard workers with their constant nagging but they never help nor to they send you help. they give small windows of time to complete large projects. They want you to fail. Promotions are impossible"
bad,Walmart is a good place to work for. But during my time that I work their. Management was poor. Too much prefrance. If a superviser did not like you. He would always put pressure on you. And lie to management which would listen to them.
bad,Just a gloomy place to work. The customers are rude and obnoxious. The management is lazy and clueless. All the employees are miserable people. The pay isn't great and if they feel like you don't deserve the little 25 cent raise then you don't get it. Benefits are complete garbage. Some occasions you may not even get a check because it all went to insurance. Then it doesn't cover anything when you use it.
bad,"Although Walmart is a great place to work, I don't see the need for two assistant managers (assistant and co-managers) then have a store manager. Also, not enough workers in my dept. to keep filling the fresh wall and do other things in that particular part of the store."
bad,"This is not a good job for college students. Management will not work around your school schedule and will purposely make you come to work on days that you are not available. When I talked to my supervisor about this problem, they did nothing to resolve it. In fact, they told that if I missed work for two days (even for being sick), they would fire me! "
bad,Too much to say not much positive. I would gladly have not worked there as long as I did. Most management untrained in areas.  The real people that keep Wal-Mart together are the hourly employees whom most work as hard as field hands.  Management more than willing to throw you under the bus.
bad,"Honestly, Walmart is a mess, the way staff is treated poorly... the way the poorly made schedule is. I hated working there, there was few staff who actually enjoy being there, I by far was not one of them"
bad,"Good company to shop at, not too good of a place to work for. I had a good time working there but the management was pretty horrible at my location. A good entry level job but not good for a career."
bad,Company has changed for the worst!I use to enjoy coming to work everyday and after 9.5 years I literally get nauseous at the thought of going to work and that's a terrible feeling!
bad,"my experience with Wal-Mart has never been   pleasant. the customers were mean, sometimes some of the workers were mean. my lunch breaks were skipped and"
bad,Working at walmart was one of the worst experience I had. The job was tiring and the managers was very unfriendly. Would not wish this job upon anyone.
bad,"Walmart has always been a poor place of employment. They do not train, do not reward people who try to train and management is just as stressed out as the lowly hourly employee."
bad,Not my favorite place to work. Tall Expectations and to many people who think there in charge. And crazy work weeks and not much time to yourself trying to juggle your life after working a morning shift then a night shift the next day.
bad,"Working with the people in the cashier area was a good experience. The assistant manager in this area was an individual who should never have had this responsibility because she could not relate to people and made no effort to make things better"
bad,Being a cashier can be stressful at times but also it can be very interesting I meet a lot nice people on a daily and also a lot of mean people. Sometimes the mangers are fair and sometimes they aren't. The hardest part about the job is having a lot of work put on one person and everyone else not doing anything.
bad,Pues muy buen ambiente de trabajo la verdd me gustó trabajar en walmart
bad,The management was poor and the pay is low. I did not enjoy my time working for this poor company. They are unorganized and are more worried about the work being done than the well being of their people
bad,"walmart is a cut throat industry that treats employees with disrespect and abuse. I used the ethic commodity to try and resolve harassment and abuse from my manager. Nothing was resolved. Walmart also has a customer first program that is designed to improve customer satisfaction. It doesn't. In reality, it leaves gaps in key position and leaves customers without any help. It affects the employees by cutting there hours when they are not available to work. The real goal is to force employees to work when they want you to, leaving you with no time to find another job if you so choose.  In four years of employment, i have been call 20 times a in one day. it is not company policy to call hourly employees unless an emergency. Ive been forced to work overnight with no benefit to me, then given one day off and forced to work day shifts. Plus Neighborhood Walmart at 8040 independence pky, plano, texas has rats."
bad,"Management didn't care about employees or their schedules. Changed shifts without notifying employees, with no way to check schedule outside of workplace, showed preference to favouritism and nothing was done against management when discipline was needed, and there was no discipline against those who deserved it.  Overall place had a bad environment which left you not wanting to work, and left coworking and customers with a bad attitude."
bad,"So much turn over in associates, nobody on the sales floor to help customers. "
bad,"the best manager they had they got rid of all because she was ""too liked""! She got the most done! Most people in the walmart management team are monsters! They see your a great worker they make you do your job and then push you to do other slackers jobs."
bad,"Management at Walmart was disorganized and no one ever cared about the employees. They would discipline in front of customers rather loudly I might add, and always looked for ways to make situations the fault of the employee."
bad,"If associate did not do everything that was asked of them even when not related to their job, management would do everything they could to make associate quit. And if that didn't work they would find a way to get rid of the associate. They also cheated cashiers out of their full 15 min break my starting their time as soon as they left the register. Enjoyed the customers. Had many that would look for me when they came in to shop."
bad,Had a fiance going through a very difficult pregnancy and they absolutely refused to be any level of understanding or accomidating to the medical needs of my fiance and unborn child.
bad,"A typical day as a Customer Service Manager consists of getting cashiers change, doing price checks and answering customer questions. The hardest part of the job is management not being consistent and communicating. As well as them not following the same rules for everyone and having favorites."
bad,"Welcome to walmart, where the managers are lousy and their attitudes match. Managers during the overnight shift are rude, obnoxious and inconsiderate. I lost 2 loved ones in the same night to gun violence and another was wounded, I was instructed by a family member to take time off for the funeral and the management staff said ""I don't feel the situation is urgent enough for you to miss 2 days of work. People die everyday get over it. If you call off it will result in termination."" What a great way to treat an employee"
bad,The hotter it is outside the hotter it is in there and they work you like a slave but expect a lot especially with management standing over you like a prison guard and they want you to throw 1000 boxes a hour
bad,I worked at 3 different Walmarts for a number of years. The store was not flexible in time off and did not offer good benefits. There were never enough cashiers on staff.
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone they don't care about there employees management is ok but the company is unorganized won't provide right tools for the job or hire or schedule enough people to work
bad,"The first 2 weeks of your job at walmart will be great. After that, everything goes to tell. The management gets cranky with you for no apparent reason. You can go above and beyond for them and they still want more. You do your plus plus everyone else's and get written up for not doing everyone's job ON TIME even though your assignment was done hours prior. NEVER AGAIN"
bad,"Es un buen lugar de trabajo , pero carente de posibilidades de crecimiento, en lo cotidiano es un ambiente calido y llevadero , pude aprender todo sobre la linea de cajas y otros  sectores .."
bad,Demanded long hours regardless of interruption with school. The environment was not productive for the reason that those who were in management positions did not take it seriously.
bad,"I worked there for a short time a long time ago, but I'll never forget it.  It wasn't a pleasant experience although that's not surprising given it's Walmart.  When I shop at Walmart these days I can see some things have improved but in other ways, it's still the same.  "
bad,"The only redeeming quality is the potential that you would have a friendly coworker. Management is stubborn and apathetic. Homophobic statements are punished with a soft warning, and some of the toughest positions, such as cart attending are given a meager hourly wage."
bad,"No advancement opportunities. Indifferent management. Low wages. Irregular, inconsistent, and inconsiderate hours. Poor working conditions. Poor customer treatment."
bad,"BAD Management they do not care about workers. Schedules are crazy and pay is ok. Loved my co-workers, but they were dissatisfied too. Top managers do not  back up their employees."
bad,"Customer backlash is extremely, in which your aren't supported by your manage."
bad,This job will let you go even if you have doctors notes excusing the absences because of medical issues they did not give me my bonus after 8 months of being hired
bad,working for Walmart pharmacy you must be correct and fast pace all in one.  Being patient is the key  while working  in the pharmacy.  Be while to explain things In the best way you can when she customer doesn't understand. Working in the pharmacy had taught me to be kind and understanding of all who comes to our pharmacy.
bad,"Honestly I loved working in the vision center . The district manager was the worst ! She plays favorites and only cares about pharmacy and does not care about her vision centers . My manager was a joke . She has no optical experience had me and the other girl do her paperwork ! She does not understand customer service ,tells customers when they come in for a warranty that it's money she's throwing away in the garbage !! What type is management is that ? Worst manager in the history of managers !"
bad,Provided existing and prospective clients with personal financial consulting and bill pay services. Mentor and coach a term of three to six customer service representatives assuring cashier area is sedured and well maintained at all times.
bad,"Treated like a commodity, coworkers are great, but managers fail to address worker concerns. Hours are not always there. Good for short term employment, but not for a long term place of work."
bad,Ok place to work if you don't mind being worked hard with very low pay. No team unity in Walmart and management is very unfriendly and ignores their associates. Not much done when policies are broken and harassment charges are filed. When I first started working for Walmart I really felt like part of a great company that treated there associates like family. Now Walmart has change in many was and none of it is to be a great place to work.
bad,"stocking shelves, ordering, cashiering, customer service, no help from management or support was hardest part especially when helping customers, stocking shelves was probably a little enjoyable"
bad,"In general a very stressful place to work. I did learn a lot about the retail environment and working within a group, however the management culture is very difficult."
bad,"No matter how hard you work or what prior experience you have, it means nothing to Walmart. Having initiative and leadership would guarantee a management position in most companies, just not here."
bad,Great people. But management sucks there and they do not work with you at all. I have two kids and after I had my second kid I came back after five weeks of having a cesarean and told them it will be a little hard for me at first. I have two kids and was a full time student and they said they would work with me and I told them I had to get everything situated and find a consistent babysitter for my kids and I might be late because it was hard for me to find a babysitter that woke up at 4 am so I can drop the kids off. They pointed me so many times for being late and missing because I didn't have a babysitter in February and I even warned them. the management sucks and they have favorites and if you don't kiss their butts they will fire you and a lot of people call in all the time and are late to work and they take their points off but for a hard working mother of two they can't work with me and give me another chance and fire me leaving me with out income for my kids ticked me off hate Walmart and the managers.
bad,they were a terrible company to work for the pay is bad and trying to do your job and getting yelled at because you are not getting enough credit cards
bad,I don't like a Manager yelling ant and calling me liar and cussing at me for stuff I did not do. I also don't like Mangers coming up to me on my day off and say I didn't do my job last night when I didn't work the night before.
bad,Not a giod place to work whatsoever . The management team is horrible. There is no advancement when u are a valued asset to your store . Was highly disappointed and would not recommend  to any of my friends
bad,management staff lied to there employees about there reasons for terminating people. in order to call out u have to go thru a third party. they not treat there employees fairly. i know all this because i was a victim of this. and the mistreated me knowing i have disability's.
bad,"Management was awful, gave unrealistic expectations and degraded you for not completing said unrealistic expectations. They will fire you for the smallest infraction, and belittle their workers at every chance. The job itself was enjoyable, and my fellow employees were great, but you always feel like you have a target on your back."
bad,After a month the job becomes so dreadful that you want to quit. The only positive with working with Walmart is that they work with your school schedule.
bad,"Horrible management and Human Resource Department. Would not recommend Anyone to work there. Favoritism runs rampant in all departments. More experienced workers were given more work than new employees,even though they were trained by staff. Many younger people would not be followed up with, left their positions before stop time."
bad,"At store 1357, overnight managers expect way too much. While you work your a** off, they walk around and criticize your work, make you redo everything you already did, then go do someone else's job, and then coach you that way you can never get a management position. I would rather have re-enlisted in the Marine Corps should I had known how bad it was, and Marine life sucks too. Come to think about it, this Walmart works like a corrupt command. I got my last check, never went back. Supposedly it's a bit better now, but I would never work at store 1357 ever again."
bad,I would get with the immediate manager regarding the size of my truck and the employees I had to unload the truck. My employees were great until management felt they were not unloading the trucks fast enough. Management would ride them hard advising they could not take breaks or lunches until the truck was finished. The job was so stressful I stepped down to manage a different department.
bad,"Walmart was Walmart, it is a great job for someone in high school, the pay isn't really substantial for someone whom has household responsibilities. Managers don't seem very interested in customer needs or employees."
bad,if they would actually let the workers they hire work when they can life would be alot easier there when we were always busy and instead of getting us help they would just yell at us when we couldnt get stuff done.
bad,"while working there felt unwelcome and was not taught how to do things properly. i did not shadow another cashier, i was just put on a registar and then got awful looks when I would call the CSM over to help me."
bad,I didn't like working here at all. No Vacation tome. To much work and they don't pay enough. I don't think I would ever work there again in the upcoming years.
bad,"lucro era o lema, eles não estavam nem ai com o funcionario"
bad,They make you do things that are not in the job title. They are bad at giving the breaks that we are suppose to get. There is also favoritism above seniority.
bad,"Walmart its not a bad company for me I was looking foe something I can grow up faster than what walmart was offering me, I was looking for a great opportunity something better for my life"
bad,"I,m a department Manager. I work freight do price changes. Control my inventory, reset my department when I receive new items, Supervised over 10 associates."
bad,"Typical day: 5 different managers pulling me away from work in progress to work on their project(s) with no regard to work being left undone. Micro-management to a fault. Every level of management laying down operating procedure and then wanting you to break it."
bad,I would be harassed from the time I clocked in to the time I clocked out for little details that slowed my work progress. When I would ask for assistance none was given and then I would be reprimanded for struggling to complete a task on time.
bad,"Extremely poor place to work:"
bad,Certain aspects of the job are ok. I enjoy my coworkers and maybe a few members of management. But the home office has too much say over the way an individual store is run. What works for one store doesn't necessarily work for another. They also constantly change their minds about one thing or another. They find loopholes to screw a person over without actually breaking policy. Like creating a shift that is 5.5 hours long. As long as you are under 6 hrs you don't get a lunch. Only one 15 min break. Doesn't sound too bad except these shifts are almost always right through lunch or supper. Like 9:30-3 or 4:30-10. Still not terrible. Unless you are a cashier where you must stand in essentially one spot for the entirety of your shift. It takes its toll on knees and legs and your back. The pain is unbearable.
bad,"Its like the equivalent of following a religion.There are so many rules regulations and policies that are constructed, theres no possible way you cant sin/get in trouble. Not the place. im not certain its all stores, or just the specific location. The customers werent always bad, but when they were, they had to be the epitome of a bad customer. Dont ever hit your 5 hour of working, under no circumstance, you get in trouble. If no one relieves you for your break, leave, walk off, tell a manager to get someone to cover, cause you will get coaching for not taking your breaks on time. Dont stay for overtime if they ask, its a trap. smile or not. Closing was always a hassle and a half. Some managers talk down on you and not to you. communication is key. Managers are less personable. Managers will undermine you after an argument with a customer. Customers are most of the time stubborn and ill informed. To many duties for not enough mangers. A typical day is always stressful for at least 6 hours. The only thing that kept me going is my co workers who would experience the same drama i did, and would talk it out, and just relax. Almost like a decompressing therapy session. Then back you you daily sentence. It is not a happy environment. They may seem happy, but they dont want you to be happy"
bad,Working here was not what I expected. During orientation they talked about Wal-Mart as a great place to work but for the Wal-Mart on Union Ave in Tacoma was not. There was a lot of unfair and bad work ethics with management. The only thing I like was that there was a lot of diversity.
bad,"I would not consider this as an option because the managers are idiots and have no real interpersonal skills. If you can tolerate this and enjoy working with the public, you can enjoy it as long as you avoid the managers."
bad,"By far the most aggravating place to work. No one listens in upper management, every concern is brushed aside, and no one ever does anything to help change these things. People get outed and retaliated against constantly and nothing is done."
bad,"The company is changing and expanding weather the changes are good or bad are yet to be seen. The life in the shoes of a Walmart associate are long, hard, and brutal. It is constantly a battle for cashiers, floor associates and good management. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent behavior from management leaving all the burden on the hourly management to figure out. The most enjoyable part of the day is the small team of people who feel like family, and assisting the customers who are faithful  to Walmart."
bad,exploitation is not even strong enough of a word to describe what they expect from you as an employee versus what they pay you. the people are okay but have multiple faces and the managers are so over-worked and stressed out all the time that they don't even acknowledge your existence half the time.
bad,"Was not a good work experience for me, Management was very poor and due to scheduling issues I would get in trouble by management for having overtime when I was scheduled to work 40 hrs"
bad,The duties of this job aren't bad but the workplace itself is terrible. Rude managers treat the employees like dirt and will have you constantly working outside your set work hours. If you call in because they schedule you outside of your availability they'll still put it as a mark against you. This happenes often.
bad,At 16 i enjoyed working there but the older i get with more responsibility i need more pay and a easier work environment. One that has no hassle or harassment.
bad,"Walmart Was My second job in my life, it was a learning experience , very successful, very unprofessional, I didn't like it one bit , I was very uncomfortable!"
bad,I have been an assistant manager for Walmart for 13 years prior to that I was with them 6 years I actually met Sam Walton and since his passing it has been non associate friendly and in reference to the associate said when there are visitors coming yes they go into panic mode and the bad thing about it we know when they're coming so it's really no surprise so we ask Associates to work extra for that visit and then we ask them to cut their time later on at the end of the week is that fair I think not
bad,To whom this may concern; Walmart for the most part was an ok job to me. I was hard-working I didn't show any lot and did when I didn't know something I ask questions. then the day came when they pulled me into the office they complimented me on the work that I did then they laid me off.
bad,"come in at 6:30 am, to pallets on the floor and carts, overnight says their overstock but their not.( also their no tags on anything) backroom looks ugly. start by tagging product only for the mangers to start yelling at you because you haven't  started scanning the bins ( keep in mind you can only start scanning  your bins when all the products have tags and are bin) trust me I tried to scan bins then tag but managers start to yell at you because you haven't tagged the overstocked. i mean that's just the morning problems. you try to coach your associate for not working, just to find out that the managers want to coach you. I'm sorry but their is no pros to working for Walmart."
bad,You don't exactly feel like youre part of a huge succesful company like you should. Most people just mope around and dont even do their job correctly. Management is very rude.
bad,Working here was terrible to be my first real job. Management was so out of line and so disrespectful. I was over worked and being new I was poorly trained and penalized for something they were responsible for.
bad,"I hated working there as a cashier. The customers were so mean, nasty and just plain rude, to top it all off so were the employees. The hours and the pay sucked too."
bad,Too many notes while under time constraints. Managers having no accountability. One best way is constantly preached but never implemented unless higher management around. Constantly being pulled from procedure for things that should have been handled either the night before or by someone else. Constantly understaffed while productivity expectations constantly rising.
bad,I do not like the politics that are within the company. When requesting time off it's almost as if you're punished the following work weeks because they give you few hours. The upper Management doesn't seem to care or really value their employees or their home life and what they need to survive.
bad,No job security. Always given the impression that you can be easily replaced. Corporate doesn't care about store level employees. Would not work there again
bad,"Very hard to move uo the ladder. Management is unorganized and not coperative."
bad,Management is very corrupt and plays favorites. Every associate acts like they are only there to collect a check and asking them to do anything is like pulling teeth. You aren't properly trained on anything you might be selling and either have to google any information you may need or hope that the customer knows less than you.
bad,"Good luck if you're sick, they will harass you over the phone and demand doctors notes for ONE UNPAID SICK DAY, absolutely unprofessional and ridiculous. "
bad,"This company is very well known all over the planet. With it being such a popular houshold name and so famous, it is easy to see them as one of the top businesses in this country and around the world. However thats if we look at the numbers or the larger variety of items/products the super stores offers to its customers over some competitors. In the time i have been working for the company i have learned many good things that will benefit me in my future and have met good friends in the process. Yet i do not see the company as one that i can stay with for a large portion of my life and when it comes to the management i felt very un-connected and unapreciated as an associate for the company. There are far too many individuals who work at walmart who simply do not care and complain about the company on a daily basis, those who lack integrity make it easy to spread negative perspectives on coming in to work everyday. so i find it hard to stay motivated surrounded by such a careless staff. it is not a job i am proud to be apart of and that is exactly what i am searching for a place where the management and associates have pride in what they do and enjoy waking up in the morning to go to work."
bad,I had a great time working there even if it was only seasonal.I met so many great people. Alot of of them put in there 100 % The only thing i didnt like was that it was short term and they weren't hiring anyone.
bad,"I worked in produce which was very demanding. At our store managers would publicly shame a department by bringing seven managers to ""show us how it's done"". They would pull pallets to the floor (something we weren't allowed to do) and our department had at best two people and a department manager. I had to work alone one Thanksgiving weekend. We had to regularly break safety regulations because we couldn't take pallets t the floor. If you were caught you'd get written up. They only released your schedule three weeks at a time and they wanted associates to commit to 24/7 availability."
bad,This was a stressful place to work.  Management was horrible and not understanding to the needs of the associates.  I wouldn't recommend this as a place of employment.
bad,"Walmart seems like a good place to work when one notices it pays above average, but what they don't tell people is, you will be doing the job of 5 or 6 people. Constant lack of coverage in every department. It is the most oppressive place I have ever worked in. They don't value good employees any more than they do slackers. Is a little bit of money worth your health or sanity? I say, ABSOLUTELY NOT!"
bad,its good pay and theres always something to do. I did night shift and that was very hard on having a social life.  Nothing was ever good enough for them. They are a tough company to work with but the management does a good job of working with you.
bad,"The work-life balance is lacking.  We are working 70+ hours a week during down seasons (it is not inventory or holiday time).  Job security seems to be getting worse, and it is about the almighty dollar.  They don't seem to care about management, especially the Assistant Manager level."
bad,"It's good overall, good management. Good co workers just not the environment i see myself working at for a very long time. Other than that it's good, no complain"
bad,They don't discriminate against people with disabilities. I loved working with all my co-.workers. I made some great friends. Management has issues with treating their employees with respect.
bad,"No período que trabalhei lá, fiz tudo o que me pediam e nunca fui reconhecida..."
bad,"Wal-Mart's pay and benefits are on the ridiculous side.  They don't care about performance (i.e. speed, customer service skills).  They barely care what your name is.  I was a seasonal worker during Christmas time.  Not my favorite job ever."
bad,"Favoritism, no possibility for advancement and poor training are just a few. Mandated to help dry side constantly once our work load is completed. Few hours during the winter months"
bad,"Managers will ask you to come in on your day off or change your schedule without hesitation, but will not excuse an absence for any reason. The ""benefits"" are terrible, stress is always high, too many tasks to complete per shift, too many requirements and inadequate compensation."
bad,"swipe in mid afternoon and get to sorting boxes out of skids, carry them to floor, stock, assemble shelf mods, fix displays etc due to poor management"
bad,When needed a day off it was a huge hassle to get it off. Not very respectful management. Constant reminding of management to fix schedule or errors. H
bad,in my opinion wal mart is 1 of the worst places to work in the area I live in. I worked overnight IMS. the whole time I was there it was nothing but drama. the day crew would blame the night crew for everything that wasn't done. the management  is a joke.
bad,Due to poor management the work atmosphere is shakey at best. Very stressful and this is due to managers not knowing anything about the equipment or jobs required to complete the product for customers. Over time it becomes a dreaded place to want to be at.
bad,Was never able to do my own job without having to do or pull other areas jobs. Some Support managers and Assistant Managers were never there to help. Too many chiefs not Enough Indians. Department Managers never did their jobs and left whatever they didn't want to do for the sales associates to pull on top of the work they already have.
bad,They like you to work different positions but do not like to pay you for it. Management are extremely rude ! Barely worked around school schedule because they wanted to work you to death. I use to love working for this company but it seemed like management go the praise but they didn't do none of the work. The lack of communication is extremely aggravating because you would get in trouble by your csm for something you manager told you to do. Simply because they didn't communicate. I used to love going to this job but when i transferred to a new store i really hated it. I busted my butt for something that was promised but never got it.
bad,"Muchas Argolla, para puestos de relevancia no importa sus títulos, ya tienen dueño por tanto no sé porque realizan concursos internos, además la mayoría de los Gerentes no tienen un titulo de administrador que los acredite"
bad,"Not the best store to start as a manager Its a very hard job hard learning curve and little to no training, i have worked for the company now for almost 14 years now and i can say the higher you go up in the company the more you demand and expect from you but they offer nothing for your training you ether learn on the go or fall flat on your face with this store"
bad,a day job that help Customer Service  a fast past job I learned that my Co Work are the best people to work with I enjoy work at Walmart  the people that work are very good work
bad,"working for Walmart can some times be pleasant but not most of the time. customer service department is very and always busy the customers are very nice most of them any how, as far as management goes Rude!! its obvious that they are over worked and under paid like half the staff there, there is no room for advancement "
bad,Walmart actively tries to get people that have worked there for a long time to quit and it prefers to rotate new untrained staff in then keep old staff that they have to give benefits to.
bad,"Was not given hours. Found out much later that they had overstaffed my department when they hired me. So I never worked."
bad,Walmart was a OK place to work but management made it difficult for me to be there for my children when they needed me.  the hours I didn't like. had to work over night
bad,"I dislike being a Walmart employee. They over work you to the maximum. They are very inconsiderate and care very little for their employees. If you have no family no kids and no other areas in your life that require attention then this is the job for you. Plan on being tired 24/7. But the hours, that would be the best part for someone who has a financial goal to reach. hey should really consider stating all their employees off at $10hr due to their high demands,  and heavy customer flow."
bad,"I loved the job itself but if your not kissing enough behind there is no room for advancement, the managers are horrible they speak to as if your their child. the pay is terrible. walmart treats its employees like the stuff on the bottom of their shoe"
bad,"Walmart is one of the most wasteful companies in the world. They set a terrible example on how to live a waste-free and environmentally sustainable life. Walmart, like most corporations, doesn't care about the health of the community or the planet on which its empire was created."
bad,Walmart managers from corporate they dont care about there employees. I did love working with my co workers but the store manager are a bunch of careless disrespectful
bad,"Walmart was my first job, it was nice at first I enjoyed it because I was making my own money. But after you've been there for a while people show their true colors and the management there is unorganized & poor."
bad,Mgnt. is not fair. Won't work with you on hours and are not fair to everyone. Some people get away with everything while others have to do their share.
bad,"This job should be mainly part-time. You spend most of the year coming in to work and getting sent home because there is no work. You only have about a few months out of the year where it's not all that bad and that's from about September until around the beginning  December other than that It's like the Management is like on a witch hunt writing you up for almost everything. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep it, it's not for everybody."
bad,"great employees, "
bad,Just need to move closer to my brother. Since my mom pasted away. I like work and keep busy. Management is really great to work with. Learned alot about the company.
bad,There is nowhere to go with this company. Extremely bad business practices against their employees with underhanded ways of taking money from hours you are made to work. I am better than this job.
bad,"Management said they were going to fix my schedule and did not which led me to be removed from system."
bad,"Working for this Walmart in particular was extremely hard there was continuous authoritative abuse among  work associates. Lack of hours. Not adhering to doctors orders while under  medical care with doctors notes included. I was yelled at and threatened and called a liar by management. And when returning back to work from back surgery , I feel as though I was being disciplined for needing to take a medical leave for having surgery."
bad,I have learned at Wal-Mart to be rude to customers. Every co-workers basically hated each other. Just a bad place to work
bad,"Bad leadership, Long hours, okay pay, not staffed properly, bad communication, poor moral,  bad benefits, good 401k match, working manager, poor training,"
bad,I like working at Walmart. Alot of my coworker are like family most of us work really good as a team. If the would get better managers it would be a better place to work .
bad,i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy unless they were desperate. The location i worked at was horrible the management (minus one or two) were the up most disrespectful i have ever encountered in my life. They expect the employees to do their job as well as the management. You get treated so unfairly to be paid so little. If you apply to another position at another store and got it they woukd not tell you until its to late. Store 1578 in Roswell Ga is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!
bad,"The Typical day there wasn't very great i worked there for 11 months and i got no training when i got hired on. the time passed slowly even though it was busy most of the time. the management would always harass me when i wasnt doing anything wrong. they wanted you to act like robots, and always managers would always take their time to help a customer that needed their assistance."
bad,working at Walmart can be like .... or heaven you choose you never know what you will run into at Walmart things change so much and all people are not able to handle change.
bad,"They promise full time but then give you 20 hrs a week."
bad,"As a company the promotes family, it is far from that. The time I spent at this company made it almost impossible to have a personal life because of the demand."
bad,Walmart isn't the company that it once was. The younger generation that inherited the company from Sam Walton has lost his vision. They treat their associates like bad and the customers even worse..
bad,"I've been with the company for only 3 years, and I've already seen more than half of the workforce changed. More than once. The management makes you so miserable that you can't help but contemplate leaving. Aside from personality problems, the management team doesn't know how to make a schedule either. They'll have you work till 10-11p.m. one night, and have you come back in at 6 the next morning. The scheduling is so erratic that it's impossible to have a life outside of work. Sleep schedule? Nope. On top of hours that make you want to quit, there are hardly ever any employees in any area on any given day. You can go anywhere from toys, to cashing, to housewares, to grocery, to unloading a truck, to anywhere in the place. All because if they schedule less than the given hours, they get a bigger bonus. The only good thing about this place is that they pay better than most others. It's pretty much the only thing that keeps the few people that work there from leaving."
bad,The worst job I ever had. Always short handed and too many politics going on in the managers offices. Customers are allowed to yell and cuss at you and you turn around and reward them with a gift card for it!
bad,"co workers were very helpful at first but i soon realized that i was doing an unfair amount of the workload. I often felt singled out and looked down upon. Management  would not step in when i was clearly being treated unfairly, leaving me discouraged in the workplace. i did enjoy when i could get in my zone and work well with no distractions, i just didnt like when they gave me a difficult time even though i was working my hardest."
bad,i enjoyed working there meeting new people but the supervisors and some co workers were very unprofesional . managers are nice but rude at times.i would mot mind working there again because it was decent pay.
bad,The hardest part of my job was lifting heavy truck tires. Got along with my coworkers. Nice raises. Seem to treat their personnel decent. Good healthcare benefits.
bad,they treat the employees unfairly theres a lot of favoritism there I would never recommend to anyone to work there they take away certain benefits they don't appreciate a hard worker
bad,I feel like the management does not know how to talk to their employees. The employees at Walmart are a little unorganized at times too. Walmart has a very high turn over rate which means staff can be short of hand.The main issue is long lines and not enough registers open
bad,"The work conditions are deplorable when your hours are not being cut. Upper management is of no support and the things corporate sends down clearly looks good on paper written by a bunch of people who have CLEARLY never done the job. "
bad,"I've been with walmart for close to five years, and just finding out how unfair they can be when it comes to wages, it doesn't seem to matter how long you've been there compared to someone that's been there nowhere near as long as you. There are several managers that are very hateful and disrespectful."
bad,Horrible management. They do not care about their employees!!! Can be a fun workplace most of the time. Don't ever get sick if you are still go to work. Don't expect management to understand or care if you are.
bad,I worked for them for 2.5 years and never seen such a high turnover rate until I worked here.  You won't see any overtime unless you are salary.  pay day is biweekly and there was way too much gossip and back stabbing going on and the managers partook in that.
bad,"A typical day of work includes doing someone else's job upon arrival, not having communication between management and as a result someone is reprimanded, constantly switching areas and not being able to complete your own job. In the 2 years that I have worked at this Walmart I have been nothing but stressed and angry at the store. The only thing that kept me there was to provide excellent customer service for the people of the town otherwise, with the exception of some, it would not be done. Management is something to be desired whether it's from communication between each other or competency to do the job they are assigned. The hardest part of the job is most likely putting up with management. The most enjoyable part is helping out the customer and providing the best customer service possible. The employees as a whole are like family and they will never do you wrong."
bad,Every night i would just stock merchandise and answer any questions customers may of had. Work the cash registers when work was slow
bad,"All companies have their flaws, but with Walmart, Management makes up the biggest percentage of the company flaws.  There is no consistency, they tend play favorites, and one member of management never knows what another is doing because there is a huge lack of communication. Because of this lack of communication, employees often get caught in the cross-fire."
bad,"My reason for leaving that store was due to harassment issues I was having with another employee. I also informed multiple managers about the situation but none did anything, so I no longer felt safe at my work place."
bad,"It was a great job being able to serve customers. I wish management take care of repairs more frequently. Really needs improvement. I wish I had more feedback from them too. Some co-workers are nice, some well, not as nice. You just learn to learn to work with it, or around it. I do like Walmart as a Corporation."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, Walmart is a great company, it's just this location is really going through too much, From elevators breaking down, Power outages and just basically not having a lot of room to work with."
bad,"My job consisted of unloading trucks, separating stock according to store location, stacking them on the pallets and delivering them to the area they were intended for.  Often products were broken, bottles of liquids were dripping all over the place and I ended up covered in chemicals every time I worked there.  I brought it up to management who could not provide a solution or alternative.  I was told to conduct MSDS (Safety) training on their local computers but was not given time to do it.  I asked for a transfer to another department and was not considered.  Eventually I got sick from the chemical exposure and had to stop my employment with them."
bad,Nothing much to the job besides just standing and scanning. The hardest part of this job is to stay focused doing the same thing over the span of an 8 hour shift. Co workers are really the best part of this job.
bad,The management  is horrible all they think about is themselves. The  expect u to do the work of five and if your don't ur downed and yelled at. They think s****l  harassement  is OK  and  let's it happen to an emploeye as well as them being bullied. Dixon Walmart  is  like worst place to work. I've worked at other Walmart and they where wonderful  this one thogh no.
bad,They only care about salaried members of management! They do not care about other people's families! Will never recommend anyone in getting a job here! Also won't be doing here again!
bad,"terrible not enough pay to get treated so bad"
bad,people do not care about your wellbeing or what your managers are doing. my boss was doing drugs with coworkers and no one did anything about it.
bad,"no work/life balance. chaotic all the time. very understaffed and over worked and well under paid. expected to only have one day in ten days. very unreasonable work enviorment. was great when I started years ago, seems to be all about making money. not customer satisfaction or patient safety. no standard here for hiring knowledgable employees. will consitantly get rid of people and move untrained unknowledgable cashiers to technicians"
bad,Nothing good to say. It's all just a mess. I would not go back here even if my life depended on it. I was just used and abused then kicked to the curve.
bad,Its like a revolving door. They have a hard time keeping people. Most people stay because of the pay or the flexibility. Some days you are bored out of your mind and other days its so crazy because they don't schedule the right amount of people.
bad,"Entirely depends on the locations management staff. They were nice to work with my college schedule and I worked with some wonderful people there for the first decade of my employment."
bad,"You have the opportunity to assist individuas with various needs. I learned working here that hard work pays off whether you get promoted or not. The management can be overbearing,at times unknowledgeable of facts that they needed to know in order for the team to run as a whole and effectively. Working alongside my co-workers was as thought you knew them for years and not just months. The hardest part of the job was that the integrity level was extrememly low among management. The most enjoyable aspect were the individuals that we came to assist."
bad,probably one of the worst jobs i have ever had. the work was easy but the mangers made it awful. wouldnt recommend to ANYONE.
bad,Work life balance is very poor.  Only get two days off together once a month.  You are expected to work every long weekend. Wednesday was normal day off and yet market leader would call meetings and conference calls anyways and we were expected to attend. Worked a closing shift on Tuesdays as Store manager yet market leader would hold mandatory calls on Tuesday mornings at times and we were expected to get on it from home.  On days off we were still expected to know exactly what was happening in our store. Had to be accessable by phone 24/7.
bad,"Typical day is stressful due to mismanagement practices and biased supervisor's. Upon hiring, i was told there was room for advancement as long as I showed hard work, commitment, team player qualities. However, I am still stuck at the bottom and have been overlooked for several upper positions, after training the people those positions were given to."
bad,"unsafe I was jumped while pregnant"
bad,"La journee commençe par aller debeamer le stock demander par l'ordinateur Apres fàire les ruptures, changement de prix, modules tout en répondant au clients. Mais ils n'ont aucun respect pour çe qui est de nos demande de congés. De bon manipulateur promette de quoi mais apres ils te réponde j'ai jamais dit ca! Ne remplace plus les employés qui on demissionné. Tellement de pression que ca nous brime sur le moral Ca nous encourage moins à vouloir faire de notre mieu, si tu ne réussi pas à finir de quoi tu te le fais reprocher alors plusieur veulent quitter ou menace de vouloir partir...."
bad,"Management at Walmart is shady and self absorbed, and 100% always look out for themselves. They preach about leadership, leadership qualities, team work and work ethic. When the entire factory functions on the exact opposite of every one of those qualities."
bad,it really doesn't matter how much effort you put behind your job management always has negative comments to say and even if we have input on doing something better they always have to look for a way to turn it down. I kept on finding expired items on shelves and removed them and showed to management but instead of giving credit where it was supposed to be a lot of things were just brushed under the carpet
bad,"You aren't paid enough for everything that you do. You carry the weight of less efficient employees. Everything is always changing, nothing is consistent."
bad,Everyday is a good at work..I love my coworker they love working with me my manage know I will get the job done. The hardest part with this job its no team work...
bad,walmart is a hard place to work because they dont understand how to treat there employees they do give you your breaks  managers do not like to hear what their employees think they do not know how to talk to their employees
bad,"How to begin with the enigma that is Walmart? The management team is collectively the worst and most incompetent group of people I've had the displeasure of working with. The favoritism, the miscommunication, the egos of those who are ""Holier Than Thou,"" and the absurd expectations of wanting you to literally be doing multiple projects in multiple locations simultaneously while no one is there to actually assist the customers is the fundamentals of what makes working for this company. I've worked in three separate stores in three completely different areas and each one operated the same. I highly recommend not working here unless you like stress and feeling insignificant."
bad,my family has been with walmart a long time. But I started there earlier this year and was disappointed. The whole time i was mocked and made fun of by managers and employees. And just because i was younger they put me on the more physically demanding tasks which they were shown records to show that i couldn't handle it. Just saying i was a cry baby and waste of time costly and judging me by my age.
bad,Typical day at work was a good fast paced environment. Co-workers were ok. There were some better than others. Hours were good. Management needs to be more people oriented and not worry so much about the numbers.
bad,unfair management and doctors notes will not help you in anyway what so ever. but its a job where you can earn income of somekind
bad,"Zoning, picking, filling. Job, physically demanding.  Management lacks caring.   Co-workers are the best.  Lifting is the hardest part.  Lunch."
bad,I've worked 5 years with no problems and haven't had a promotion even when I tried to apply. Management is unorganized and sometimes makes the wrong call. Some people the same age as I am have a higher salary than me and they just started.
bad,"Worked as a Team Leader for Walmart Logistics for 2 years and it was literally the worst 2 years of my life. Everyone is constantly walking on eggshells because they are terrified to be fired. People are constantly underappreciated and underpaid. If you love hating going to work everyday, making fake connections with people, working for a company that cares absolutely nothing about you and learning no new skills whatsoever because education is something they're afraid of; well, this is the place for you. If you otherwise have respect for yourself and enjoy happiness, steer clear. I can't stress enough how bad of a place this is to work; mind you, I am strictly speaking of the Cornwall warehouse based on my experience, but imagine environment is roughly the same throughout the company regardless of location, but Cornwall was a nightmare."
bad,"I was thankful to have been hired at Walmart because it gave me the opportunity to learn new things, meet new people and do well for others."
bad,16 years with company. Many changes over the years that have downgraded the work environment. Prefered no comment
bad,Walmart is not family oriented. They do not care about your personal life. They will go over your availability and do nothing about it. The CSM's are not nice nor is some of the managers. I would not recommend this Walmart.
bad,"The management were like ""bullies"".  Because of this, the crew didn't get along.  There was a lot of jealousy and envy at the particular Wal-mart that I was working at."
bad,Management was racist towards Caucasian people. I was belittled and passed over for advancement. I was given the dirtiest work with the shortest amount of time allotted.
bad,"I speak to my dog  with more respect !"
bad,My  job was to ring up people and offer them credit card. I wanted to advance so that I can get more hours. The job offered me 30 hours a week. However after 7 months they cut it to 14 hours a week. And eventually they wanted 3 cashiers to run a super store alone. Customers would be upset because of the long lines and lack of customer service. Management would get us in trouble because they would still expect no mistakes with all the pressure and no back up. I learned to work in different departments so that I can gain more hours Instead I got more work for the same time and pay! they moved me to nights three times and got upset because I asked them for the 50 c that is required by California that they tried to avoid by changing my job description. The only good thing about this job are my co-workers. Some of my co-workers became my best friends. Until this day we are as close as family.
bad,"It was a great learning experience about how to deal with people that have different expectations.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management because they rarely complemented you on your performance. It seemed that there was little you could do to please them.  It was rarely boring on a typical day since there was always something to do and the teamwork provided by the co-workers was helpful.  The easiest part of the job was dealing with the customers who were mostly positive and made the job enjoyable. It's a good job to gain experience in retail.  In face a few employees got the chance to move up the corporate ladder.  Fortunately for most it was a great opportunity to learn how to get along with others and get job skills at the same time."
bad,"Management refused to supply basic equipment required to do my job effectively, frequently ran out of supplies. A typical day I am the only one to clean the entire store, the assistant manager for nights did not know anything about my department leaving me to figure everything my self."
bad,Job itself was rewarding. However no job security. Always working weekends. Not a great job if you have family. most people seem to be negative at work place. heard time after time only here for the money.
bad,"It was a good learning experience for customer service, and cash experience, however they did not treat their staff with respect and honour their days off and preferred hours."
bad,"they change managers at walmart constantly, so as soon as you get things going the way a manager likes and everything starts to be ok and settle that manager gets moved to a different store and a new manager comes in and switches everything up. overnights has two managers working, most of the time they don't see each other or communicate so you do one thing during manager ones shift and manager two comes in the next night and has you change what you just did the night before. as stated in the summary, understaffed, so most people mainly myself and fellow frozen/dairy associates had to do multiple jobs that were not in our description, because everyone else was to slow and lazy."
bad,"My work day was very demanding which was a good experience. I learned a lot about how to interact with different types of people.. I loved my co workers.. I would say the hardest part about the job was not being able to satisfy everybody, especially as much as you would have liked to. The most enjoyable part of the job were the days when I seem to have satisfied everyone, including the customers as well as the cashiers.."
bad,Horrible company to work for they lost all their standards when Sam Walton passed away. They treat their employees with so much disrespect
bad,"I've worked for Walmart before. That was easily a decade ago. I'd hoped, as a company, that it had matured since then. It has not changed at all, at least for this particular store."
bad,You can get fired for giving birth because in America maternity leave is only offered to people who have worked with a company for over a year if you are lucky.
bad,hardest part of the job is figuring out when you work. schedules go up 3 weeks in advance but change daily so when you actually work may change the day of.
bad,"The problem with Walmart isn't the work, its the incompetence of your Supervisors and Managers. Employee don't come first, the priority for anyone in a management position is to move higher up the chain, and will pull dirty tricks to get a one-up on the others."
bad,I have a management staff that don't care about its employees and hourly management staff. We are always understaffed and people are mad and always putting stuff back when its not enough people in the store.
bad,"company is trying to do the right thing,however moral is down,keep on cutting hours to make up for upcoming salary increase,"
bad,I have been working here for 3 Years and the management team are just horrible . At one point you  would think things would get better but it doesn't. No support or encouragement or good jobs they just tell you whats your doing wrong all the time. The pay is okay but not for the amount of work and stress they put you through  .This company as a whole just doesn't care about there employes.  I am a sales associate and on a typical day at work i work a whole department by myself  other associates are no help.The Department Manager doesn't do anything but stand around and throw orders at everyone. The hardest part of my of my job would be the managers and how they look at the associates like slaves that are beneath them. The enjoyable part of the job would be that i get to meet new people every day and helping others.
bad,"work was typical you punch in , stretch, go to work area and start on the freight , Management was interesting some would help try to push you towards Management positions and others would tear you down. Co Workers were decent , some nice, other's  rude. You  learned to tell which to listen and learn. And others to listen but not take personally. The hardest part of job was being driven to want to do  more just not sure how to achieve it . The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the co workers and when you do a job beyond the managers expectations ."
bad,"This company does not walk the talk."
bad,They didn't want to make people full-time and they didn't want to give out any extra hours to anyone for the fear of having to pay the employees more money.
bad,"Constant change in hours. Reduction of hours"
bad,being a member of the walmart staff is ver stressful. Coworker and Customers makes the day better but management isn't great.
bad,"It was a ok company a typical day went by slowly, management would breath down your neck half the time, you could practically be begging for your breaks. I learned never to work for this company again. My coworkers weren't too bad, very helpful and supportive not my supervisor though he came in after me and didn't know anything about what we did or how we did it and he was bossing us around thinking he knew everything..... the hardest part of the job was probably when no one would lend you a hand after you were behind on your tasks. the most enjoyable part was probably the hour for lunch or clocking out......"
bad,"I worked there for a year and was the worst place ever. Management is disrepectful, Store Manager is rude and dont care about his staff"
bad,"I stocked shelves, dealt with customers, did price changes."
bad,Manheim California needs to be more organize it seem like they use don't appreciate when we work so hard. It seem like they don't care we have asked if we can get a rain coat or tent they don't give us what we needs
bad,"Our day always starts out picking all departments of the store and working the items we picked. The people that I've had the pleasure to work with, we are a team and help each other out."
bad,Wal-Mart management was unstable and the higher up positions in management were very unfair towards their employees. They did not give a fair amount of pay for what they made their employees do.
bad,A typical work day for me would involve a lot of stocking seasonal items in the front as well as checking out customers and occasionally other departments such as stationary and fabrics/crafts.
bad,"little or to no leadership, nor is their training in place for staff including salaried members of management. Employees feel like machines many are unhappy."
bad,"If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all. If I had to get stuck in a job like that then I was glad I did so with the crew I had. We had some good times. I will say this, I worked there for 2.5 months and 9 employees came and went through my department alone. Worst job I will ever have."
bad,"I applied for this job to escape from a terrible job. For a while, it was a refuge. I was a cake decorator, so I had some protection from management who seemed bewildered by the cake decorating process. They appeared to view it as a skill that one must be born with and such people were rare. In this way, I was both treated as a typical Walmart employee (poorly) and with a strange reverence. This amounted to management mostly leaving the cake decorators to decorating the cakes."
bad,"You will never feel appreciated, always too much work to do with not enough people to do the work. Underpaid for the amount of problems that can come up in the work place. Management is not very nice and make you feel like you're inferior and not human. Good luck getting time off on holidays."
bad,"walmart cares nothing about employees, its disorganized, management does not recognize quality workers, and don't promote as told. they don't have a system or standard for promoting, you basically have to befriend managers to get promoted. if you just go and do your job to the best of your ability and exceed expectations that's not enough to qualify you for higher positions."
bad,"The management, though most are nice people, is completely mangled and uncoordinated. It seems the stores ONLY priority is grocery side, and the rest of the store is hardly thought of until they don't like something we did or they want us to cashier or work grocery for the day. The associates there are mostly as incompetent as the management, with many of them who will just wonder around the store and leave you with their work and your own. Some members of management are really willing to work with you, and like i said they're mostly nice people, but the store as a whole was a horrible work environment for me."
bad,Must be able to work like a dog.Be harassed by management.And peel blisters off your feet daily.Pull buggies lift heavy items for customers.Clean floors.
bad,The managers were not willing to work with you on scheduling and personal life. The work environment is extremely stressful.
bad,Good Job to begin with but management is terrible and employees are treated terrible meaning they do not take care of there employees well or help them with tasks.
bad,"understaffed with managers that are always late and not prepared for the work day.The company has poor organization skills. also very unprofessional with employees. Unreasonable ""clock-in and clock-out"" procedure."
bad,"A typical day of work summarizes into these three words; Stressful, Frustrating, and Unprofessional. I cannot begin to express the level of disrespect that you encounter from management and co workers alike, the misdirection and failure that comes from upper levels of management, or the lack of teamwork that is exercised in this culture. From your first time of training until the later, you are already put in high stress situations, and without a thought you have to react and go. Perfect for fast learning and motivation to be better than you was the previous day, but the headaches that come with it are sometimes unbearable. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who doesn't have tough skin, used to professionalism, or cannot adopt quick, I do not recommend this job at all."
bad,"They do offer stock purchase, 401K, and benefits. They have small gatherings for different holidays. The employees are offered the chance to receive a bonus check. A lot of people are leaving Walmart because of management. They let one person determine another person's job. Upper management wants to much done with not enough people. One person is trying to do a ten person job. This is a company I do not recommend for anyone."
bad,my co worker were great my supervisor picked favorites and I wasn't one of them but I did my job was always friendly and everyone left my till smiling or laughing.
bad,A typical day would be helping out customers and running the cash register. Something i learned was all the material and equipment. The hardest part of the job was management.
bad,"My typical day with Walmart was spent performing not just the tasks of my own department, but several other departments as the store was (and continues to be) woefully under-staffed. The management was poor at best, often driving associates to quit or simply stop showing up for work with their lack of concern for employee wellbeing or working conditions. Furthermore, there was absolutely no communication between different managers often leading to employees being caught between two equal-level managers with different tasks or plans. My coworkers were nice and most of them were good to work with, but with new associates often quitting within a month there was a very small number of long-term professional relationships. The hardest part of working at Walmart is trying to fit several people's worth of tasks and projects into incredibly short shifts. My average shift times were 4-5 hours, but the amount of work was often that of a full 9-hour shift, and frequently punctuated by management interruptions. The most enjoyable parts of the job were helping people and getting my workspace clean. I was never happier at Walmart than when the Electronics Department was looking presentable and I had a customer to talk through about games, tablets, or computer in order to help them make their purchase."
bad,I loved working for this company as far as the coworkers and being able to enjoy coming to work. I personally think the company as a whole has a lot of work to do and should really look at the management structure.
bad,"Lack of management, and was unprofessional.  Was to many lazy non working co-workers. The hours was different every day and change a lot. This was the most stressful and unorganized place I've ever worked.  They had good benefits, but the negative out weighed the positive. Will never work there again."
bad,"highly stressful, low wages, unfriendly schedules, expected to work holidays. Not family oriented. Not recommended at all unless you need a little extra money part time."
bad,"I hated being a cashier at Walmart. When you tried asking the management for help or even simply said hi, they would give you the worst attitude, and begin yelling at you just because their day was bad. I would understand that every once in a while because I have my rough days too. But this was every. single. day. I would ask them for a roll of quarters and they'd immediately start yelling at me for no reason what-so-ever.I had a miserable time working here and I will never work at a large corporate retail store like that ever again."
bad,"I worked 10 years for this company, if you don't drink the cool-aid, you get treated badly.  The pay was poor, even for working overnights.  Wal-Mart has shown time and time again they could pay their employees more.  I traveled to help other Wal-Marts in the area, they were all structured the same, and treatment was poor in all of them.  8 hour shift, 12-18 hours of work in task manager, penalized for not completing the work.  I worked maintenance, or at least I tried to, they would just pull maintenance workers to help them stock and let the quality of the store go to waste, this is a theme in most Wal-Marts.  The sick policy gets abused so people can actually get time off, you also don't get to use your sick pay for the first day you miss, but you can for the next two, encouraging you to use your sick time  for the next two since you were being docked an absence anyway.  Poor environment, most managers don't have a clue, overnight managers run the place with an iron fist.  I have never seen management and a company as a whole get away with so much poor treatment and illegal practices."
bad,"Had a good time working with store management, but a horrible time with APA management."
bad,"Great Employees, middle management was good, upper and corporate management was not the quality of leaders and visionaries you would expect this company."
bad,"typical day at work was going in clocking in and grabbing my vest and heading outside to pull carts, i would pull carts and have 2 15minute breaks and a 30min lunch if i was lucky, somtimes forced to clockin early because no one was outside to pull carts, also if we were told to do any other job we had to drop what we were doing and do that other job, hours were inconsistant, not enough money, i learned almost nothing at this job, i learned a bit about how the people within the company really are and that isnt good, my co workers could be decent but didnt seem to care about their jobs or if they finished it on time or not, the management was below average, they didnt care about anyone that was below them, and they were mainly rude no matter what, the hardest part of my job was probrably pulling carts in extreme heat or even worse would be heavy snowfall. the most enjoyable part of my job is that for the most part it was easy."
bad,You usually get 40 hours a week. You seem to do the same thing everyday. Its not to hard to advance to a department manager from a entry level position. Hard to live off the pay they give you. Would recommend for high school student that need a part time job.
bad,Given work tasks vary everyday. Too much work give and pays very less! Extensive work invites mental and health problem. Poor management.
bad,"Coworkers are probably the best parts of working here; most are pretty relaxed and fun unless management is around."
bad,Great company to learn from but wouldn't go back. Not a safe place to work. Hard to make money. Little to no hours. Low pay. Hours across the board. Thanks but no thanks...
bad,"I learned how to preform varies different task wish included been ability to not trust some managers, overall benefits were greater of all. Hard work and stability in this company were one are my most important thing."
bad,"Working for Wal-mart is a frustrating experience.  Their policies towards their workers hinder most types of advancement and they are really looking for people to just put their head down and work.  They have a very low bar set for employees and most of the time I was working with people who were just playing the clock to gain a paycheck.  When looking for advancement in  the company, I found many roadblocks.  Its a fine job if you need something, but I wouldn't recommence striving to work there.  They were very unorganized and there seemed to be conflicts every night.  Experience with a job was given less priority that those that were at the company the longest."
bad,This company will not allow associates to make over 30 hours a week. A lot of there associates are loosing there house and car because they can not afford to pay for them both. You can have a job today and not have one tomorrow with this company.
bad,"The thing i like most about this job is the people i worked with, we all got alone really well. i learned how to stock shelves and how to organize products."
bad,"This company treats all workers as expendable. When poor safety behaviors are mentioned to supervisors, they inform coworkers who then harass you. If you report an injury, whether it be a pulled muscle or something falling on your head, you are wrote up for carelessness to deter you from reporting injuries. There is a reason that they are unable to keep a full staff"
bad,"Management was terrible, I got along with co-workers but the managers think they're too good to respect employees. The hardest part of the job is everything. It is so un-organized, very stressful, and they never have help. There would be days where i was covering the whole electronics department on Saturday the busiest day at any retail store. And the managers would not help and they would just ask me why I am not finished."
bad,stressful and hectic work environment. different directives from other employees and managers. I would not recommend working for this company
bad,"Shifts are horrible"
bad,"Management team constantly worked against corp policies. not many hours but scheduled in a way that when combined with a constantly changing schedule from week to week left no time to enjoy anything. bosses made simple human rights sound like a favour for being given to you. no respect from costumers(which is expected) or management(which is what made it bad). constant gossip and complaign made work life hard and unbareible. CONSTANT VIOLATIONS OF OSHA REGULATIONS."
bad,"After working at walmart I got a chance to see just how poorly the company is ran. Managers pulled tricks to make things look full and never ordered enough merchandise to keep the shelves stocked. On top of that the company had a very non customer orriented feel to it. As a matter of fact you could lose your job for helping a customer when you aren't on the clock. Basically, I can no longer approve of the company and will not work or shop there again."
bad,management does not care about employees but the pretend to care. They say they have a open door policy but when you leave from behind the doors every one knows your business
bad,"I worked in the electronics department."
bad,"its a good place to work for when going to college and as a short term career theres always room to grow as well, management can be very friendly as well"
bad,"This was the most job I think I will every have, I hated this job with a passion the supervisors was lazy, and the workplace was so messy."
bad,"Not only were the employees underpaid and overworked, but there was a culture of nepotism and favoritism running rampant there. No one else stood a chance. Horrible pay, and though harassment was acknowledged by management, it was not controlled or condemned. I wouldn't work there for $100,000 a year."
bad,I liked the work while I was in college. The work was physical and the schedule was flexible. Also enjoyed most coworkers
bad,"As an Assistant Manager, you are underpaid and overworked. I started with a salary of less than 45K. This position should be started at 55K with all of the work that you are expected to do. There is no equal balance between family and work. You spend more time in the store working long hours. When I got initially hired, I was supposed to work three on and three off needless to say, before I completed the Assistant Mangers Training they changed that in the middle of my class.  This was planned because, they just don't do anything without planning six months to a year out. They knew this would draw in the ideal candidates that they were searching for and changed it up once they gotten the numbers that were looking for."
bad,A typical work day here is the same old grind. The only thing I enjoyed about this place were the people I worked with & the awesome customers. I'm a people person & love it.
bad,The managers have you do everybody elses job. You work way more than what you are getting paid for. The schedules are not flexible at all.
bad,"You never know when someone from will jump down your back for something you may or may not  have done."
bad,There is again no work life balance. They have no understanding otherwise. Very difficult to advance as well. Even a good store manager is afraid for his job every day.
bad,the company treat its employees bad and pay is not that good. if your not a manager your going to slave for alil bit of money.
bad,Any day is usually accompanied by an angry associate or manager. Didn't learn anything from this work environment. The only thing i liked about working here was that i was employed.
bad,"Their management is very poor and unreasonable. They require their overnight stockers to have a box tore open, stocked, and torn down within one min. Then they discipline ( yelling and sometimes cursing) their workers on the sales floor even if a customer is near. I will never work for this company ever again."
bad,"The neighborhood market that I work at has awful management. It seems every salaried supervisor wants to do everything differently, and can't come up with a way to nurture and train employees to grow. They run the store like it's some sort of boot camp. I now understand why the store is having trouble keeping staff. There is no level of understanding or respect from the store team to it's hourly subordinates. It's basically,"
bad,"Sad place to work with the clueless leading people who know how to work already. Making rules to keep costs down, rather than finding a solution to the problem no matter what it costs. Hiring sub-par employees to do technical jobs requiring some degree of expertise."
bad,"Las comisiones no te las pagan al corriente y/o te hacen cansada para los objetivos excusas para no pagar, calidad de vida no ejercida ellos cuentan una política de calidad de vida para el empleado, la cual no la ejercen como debe ser. Te piden disponibilidad que con el tiempo se vuelve esclavitud... Y si no cumples con la metas te asesoran, lo que te perjudica a la hora de tu evaluación año con año para promediar  tu desempeño laboral y si sales mal según ellos ya no te suben el suelo mas que 100 pesos cada año, los gerentes en la mayoría de los casos falta de liderazgo, nefastos, y cuando es tu turno de pedir algo por necesidad personal, familiar etc, siempre hay peros, cuando has dado más de lo que piden.  los gerentes llegan a acosar a las asociadas y hostigar y humillar a los asociados"
bad,"Great insurance benefits. Decent pay. Poor environment to work. Often, if not always, shorthanded in one or more areas. Management doesn't seem to care about a lack of employees"
bad,"my favorite job and the 2nd worst.  my favorite  because of the people I worked with.  my 2nd worst because of the customers, the management sucked, etc"
bad,"Promises and guarantees not delivered on. Poor management treatment of employees and terrible inventory management. Do as I say, not as I do attitude. Very poor training program."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of doing work for everyone as well as your own work. A lot of lazy workers. Management really doesn't care for the associates, they will spread you thin until you cant take it anymore (quit or fired). What I had learned from working with walmart was that I am thankful for the job but I will never work for them again because low pay and no benefits for part time workers and you will have to kiss major butt to move up. The hardest part about it was when you did nothing wrong you still get in trouble like a verbal warning or a written warning. The best part about my past job was the customers, knowing that my ""hello"" and my ""smile"" brighten their day because at times I was the only person they saw in a single shopping trip."
bad,"Treat there employees like they not working hard, racial discrimination. about the money have every manager worried about every situation. the whole experience working there i was ex hauled i didn't like what their offering, do so much work for so little pay."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone unless they are in between jobs or as a last resort. Compensation in minimal, training and competent coworkers are far and few between and the clientele can be belligerent and aggressive at times. There are no opportunities for overtime, and they are open on Thanksgiving. Benefits such as health care are hard to qualify for."
bad,"I really enjoyed my work at Walmart, but I was harassed and threatened by coworkers and management allowed it. Self defense is not permitted in this company either. My CSM was terminated the day she came back from the hospital after being jumped by a customer cashing a check. My store managed told me that it was my fault for being harassed and threatened and that I needed to take responsibility for it. She also told me that I could not move or transfer positions and that a counter case was made against my me so I didn't feel safe going to corporate as it would take too much time and leave me vulnerable to retaliation. I was denied being able to give a two weeks noticed and when I finally was able to, the harassing got worse. This is a very unstable work environment and unsafe."
bad,no sense of respect at all. they disregard you as a human being and work you like a slave.
bad,Walmart is a great place to shop. I do not recommend employment here however. Management is seriously lacking. It is my opinion that Walmart is just so large that many things fall through the cracks. Management in this particular Walmart is in serious trouble. They see problems and issues yet do nothing to fix or even address them. They teach safety but do not uphold to it. My position in ICS was a dangerous one each and every day. I was put into positions that management could have corrected but instead turned the other way. Management did however caution me to be careful. I left Walmart because my safety was in question every day. I felt I needed to put myself in a better environment.
bad,"Typical day at work is stressful with unorganized management and unmotivated staff with little to no work moral or pride. The management team will nit pick on the small things but never the actual big picture and will never take in consideration your advice making the next day unproductive and filled with many problem and unsatisfied customers. Also one person is usually expected to do the work of 2 or more people on ridiculous time lines because the store is always understaffed and low on hours."
bad,"It was a really good experience for me,and I honestly feel that I have grown a lot from being employed there."
bad,Walmart has lost sight of their Associates. They are to micro managed to care about the welfare of their associates. Their wages are not concurrent to the economy. Bottom line they are promoting some of the worst managers and it shows in the work of the associates that work for them.
bad,"The day starts with opening the vision center up, counting the cash register, unlocking the cabinets and turning on and calibrating equipment. I answered phones making appointments for the independent doctor of optometry and reminding patients of their appointments and expiring prescriptions. I learned a lot working this job. Customer service, managing others, schedules, mark downs, and new skills.The management team was not really apart of the decision making in the vision center. I had the market health and wellness director over me. My co-workers liked me as a boss. They worked together with me as team! The hardest part of the job is to make the customer happy all the time. Making new connections and having regular customers/patients come back to see me was the best part."
bad,"Managers are for the most part rude and unprofessional... Some of them like to mosey around on their phones, take pictures of themselves, and even cuss about other employees and managers they don't like."
bad,"I start out at the service desk doing money order, moneygrams, paying bills, answering the phone, and handing any questions a customer may have, Being a cashier may be one of my jobs during the day, checking people out in a timely manner."
bad,"- I have made more friends working at Walmart than any other company. The people who work there are a unique blend of personalities from all walks of life. Management is more of a mixed bag, but the ones who are good are great. Management will set the tone for your experience with the company. Good, personable managers who care for their associates are priceless, and each one will quit or start stealing from the company because they get paid as badly as you do. Bad managers think they're good managers, except that everyone they talk to is miserable for some reason. A bad manager will last forever, unless they get caught stealing because they get paid as badly as the good managers."
bad,"If you'd like to work at a place where you are regarded as ""selfish"" as well as ""destined to failure"" for carrying emergency sugar in the form of a granola bar, due to the fact that you have TYPE TWO DIABETES, go work at walmart."
bad,"This was the worst job I had ever worked. I worked nights as a stocker and you better be a night owl. I would get home, sleep, and immediately go back to work. I barely had a life outside of work and I only worked 32 hours a week. My coworkers all only worked this job because nowhere else had the job security. They were all mostly defeated by life and management knew this. Management treated us like we were worthless, propaganda was everywhere, you mention the word 'union' and they would likely fire you, etc..."
bad,"During the shift there is usually a decent amount of freight to get stocked.  Alot of customers require one on one time to assist them with their questions, issues, or purchases to get what is right for them.  A worker will learn from co-workers, other customers, personal experience or having to research a particular item.  A worker will learn alot about technology on the market and its uses.  Management has been a bit scattery, but lately they seem to have a crew that clicks well together.  Over my time there, we had some rough spots.  But the past 2-3 years we seem to have a pretty decent group which work very well together.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people when they are being mean, rude and demanding, especially if you are all alone in the department.  the most enjoyable part of my job is able to see and work with some really cool and nice people.  Also, when you get that one special customer who really wants your help, and works well with you."
bad,"I will never work at walmart ever again. The management is terrible. The hours are exhausting. Never a set time, its all over the place. The benefits are not that great. They treat the employees like slaves, rather then people."
bad,"When at work there were times the registrar froze up, or I had customer problems. I needed help, so I would push the code many of times, and no one would show. Sometimes it took 15 minutes just to get the help I need a smile void error issues. Other times I tried talking to the manger about changing my hours around to work with school. The hours I could work they would not work with me, only allowing me to work two days a week or only four hours a day. With those hours it does not help with food, gas, extra cash, or even bills."
bad,"I was a cashier here for 2.5 years, and the job was absolutely AWFUL.  A lot of the customers were difficult to deal with, and made the store look unclean, and management tended to be cold and unapproachable.  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,I worked for Wendys for 10 years.  It is a tough job and you are luck to be able to go to the bathroom.  The insurance and vacation were good if you were a manager.
bad,"I learned that since Sam Walton passed his company on the quality of life as a Wal-Mart employee has steadily declined. One example is the benefit that existed when Sam was alive of double time on Sunday declined to time and a half , then to an extra dollar an hour, down to nothing."
bad,Started out strong with hours but as time went by hours kept getting cut until there were none left. Certain job areas are mind-numbingly menial and did not enjoy my time in the workplace
bad,Management skills vary drastically from store to store . It varies from nonexistent to excellent . The same is true on how you are treated as an employee.
bad,Learned something new each and everyday thanks to my coworkers on my team. No comment towards my management team.
bad,"Lack of communication between upper management staff and communication between upper management and employees severely lacking. Work was difficult to accomplish due to poor training and attitudes of supervisors. With this environment and low wages, moral was lowest I have ever seen in a workplace. The high point of the work day was the apparent satisfaction of the customers."
bad,Hard and very stressful job. If you want to advance in the store important to know the right people not what you know.
bad,"low pay good for student/ spouse type work"
bad,"I applied and took the job as bakery associate   to earn extra money and because of the flexibility of the hours and my college courses.  I found out several days into the position that two people originally handed the load I was carrying –baking, clearing shelves, stocking and bagging, instead of one as I was doing.  I soon turned in my resignation."
bad,"I have been employed with Wal-Mart for three years, Worst Company! All the managers care about are who they can get in trouble and the pay checks they get to collect. There is never any employee coverage! They tell you that you will be allowed to be empowered, handle most of the majority problems with customers on your own. But as soon as you do, what ever you have told the customer is always wrong and you end up in trouble over it, usually in front of the customer. All I can really say positive about working there is the associate that you work with daily become a huge family. The worst part is the degrading in front of customers and constant flack about stuff that you had nothing to do with, but since management got in trouble over something they feel the need to go chain of command and yell at you for something you may not of even been there for. Worst place ever to work!"
bad,"I enjoy my job. Is very busy and can get a little hectic at times. These are the best times, because then I really need to use my knowledge to figure out the various problems of the day."
bad,"not organized , no formal training."
bad,i didn't like working here i have gotten checks late the managers are unprofessional its a bad place to work.
bad,"Did cashiering, also worked in fashion folding clothes putting out stock, worked in the back sorting skids or pallets of products to be put out on the floor. In early august I helped set up the store as far as putting up shelves, pegs doing mods etc. I did returns and exchanges at customer service."
bad,I did not work at Walmart very long. I only owrked part time with no benefits. The hours were weird and there wasn't much opprtunity for advancement
bad,"Never work for Walmart. When they first opened, they got it right. As soon as the new CEO came into play, it was all down hill from there. The management doesn't care at all about there employees and the policies are not reasonable AT ALL. Horrible place to work."
bad,"worked here for 2 years, management and routines changed so frequently that directives and expectations became confusing and frustrating, leading to poor customer service, lack of morale and motivation. Hours were cut frequently. It was nice to work with so many people, and with better management and appreciation of employees which sometimes did the work of 5 by themselves, this would be a great place to work. Benefits are great especially if full time. Sad to see such a productive company show such disregard to its staff and management which ultimately leads to disregard of customers since the employees are so stretched that customer service becomes unimportant."
bad,"Hours were never the same, management was horrible. I did not enjoy it"
bad,a typical day starts off stressful and ends stressful. I learned how to stocker bin and set merchandise. the management is very unorganized. my co-workers are great people. the hardest part of this job is coming to work.the most enjoyable part is my co-workers
bad,"1.Easy work but not specific ( If you done your job, you may help  someone who do not want to do his/her job) "
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart for almost three years now and work my way up for department manager. The work loads and pay are far from right. they say they that we are suppose to be customer first but the actions of the management speak other wise. I love to help people, but wal - mart is not the place for me. Once respect was of their beliefs but now its just a joke."
bad,Só tenho a agradeçer pelas oportunidas que a mim foram dadas apesar de ter sido por muitas veses explorada por meus superiores porém tudo que nõ me matou me fortaleçeu hoje sou grata por tudo poix foi onde mais aprendir...A parte mais difiçil eram quando precisa ultrapassar 2 horas a mais de jornadas de trabalho altamente cansativas e a melhor parte era sempre o termino das jornadas super cansadas...
bad,did not like working there. I was treated poorly. I was lied to by the mangers. People i worked with was really rude. Always talked behind my back. I felt like i was treated like garbage. Would not recommend working there.
bad,unmotivated associates and lack of job training made work here extremely hazardous.
bad,"good place for students, slicing meats, serve customers, standing and walking all day"
bad,"Your duties as stockman include cart retrieval and customer assistance coupled with whatever else they choose to throw at you. Physical labor in all sorts of weather conditions alongside unpleasant co-workers and management made this job almost unbearable. The pay is poor, although it is possible to advance to a different position within the company."
bad,"Typical day at wal mart is rush rush rush . do this , do that , ( when your already have your assigned duties ). They want more and more and dont show the proper apreciation."
bad,Managers are not happy with their jobs. When managers are not happy neither are the employees.
bad,"•	Responsible for all aspects of payment processing."
bad,A veces ya te resultaba tedioso ir a trabajar el ambiente no te ayudaba mucho
bad,Learned that if you were nice people would be nice back!Enjoyed the Myshare Bonsuses and also the extra hours that were given during the holiday periods. Like any workplace there was a lot of drama so i learned to stay quiet and keep to myself.
bad,"A typical workday in a Walmart store is sure to take all and the best out of you. Many jobs do that, yet the compensation is not comprehensive to the actual workload and that takes a toll on you..."
bad,"I personally worked for Walmart for a little over 2 years.  I found this company terrible to work for.  I think the Management Team is a joke.  In my particular store we had Sr. Management talking behind co-workers as well as employees backs.  Making fun of employees for various reasons handicapped, personal attacks etc. I found this behavior repulsive and ultimately the reason I chose to leave Walmart. They say not all stores are like the one I was assigned to.  In my observation as a shopper at Walmart I would occasionally talk to employees while shopping.  I would say 75-80% of the people I talked to were dissatisfied employees for one reason or another.  I also don't need to mention the low pay Walmart pays their associates.  It is an extremely tense working environment and the the low pay doesn't help.  Medical and Dental benefits are less than desirable. I would not recommend Walmart as a good place to work."
bad,"Working at Walmart used to be amazing. Our management team had fun with us but we worked hard at the same time. It really felt like a family. Then, everyone got too serious and wanted you to put the job above yourself. When I started, there were about 450 associates. Now, there are only around 300. It makes working very difficult. I ran the largest department in the store by myself majority of the time and the tasks given to me for the day were completely unrealistic."
bad,"I worked there for 3 years and I knew so much. I was really great on the telxon, I knew how to bin and pick, I was fast at freight and I was a really good cashier. I was even teaching new hires in apparel how to do everything. I was told that if I wanted to move up I had to learn the rest of the store because I only knew apparel and cashiering and I wanted full time so I moved over to deli. Bad idea! The day I moved over there I got in trouble for rolling my eyes when a manger was yelling at another associate in front of me, 3 department mangers and some customers. When I got over there I saw so many things they were doing wrong. When I started to say something about it I was being singled out and watched. That's when management started saying I wasn't cleaning right. BULL**** I took hours cleaning one thing and cleaning it more then once. Then they said I stand around and do nothing. BULL**** number 2 I was always to busy with customers if not with customers then with the fryer. I finally got out of the deli when I sprained my wrist loading an extremely heavy basket of chicken into the fryer. I got put on overnights zoning until my wrist got better but until then management watched me so closely it was ridiculous. Everything  I  did was not good enough for them. I was zoning fast but I didn't do it right so I had to redo everything again, move them to the edge. So I slowed down and made sure they were at the edge still going a little fast, still not good enough I didn't move enough of them to the edge. So I slowed down even more making sure it was perfect for the managers pulled"
bad,"Walmart in itself is full of easy jobs.  But unfortunately the management itself could care less about their employees.  Every year they give a ""cost of living raise"" which they use to justify raising production.  I could go on about how poorly the employees are treated but everything you've heard in the news is true."
bad,"A typical day at work. Enjoyed meeting new people. Management needs to be more professional. Co-workers are good. The hardest part of the job is the pay."
bad,"A typical day a work consisted of me cashing people out, stocking and getting carts. "
bad,"I think it was to poor management and them not really caring about employees , They didn't give that sense to employees that there were appreciated  or had any where to turn if there was a problem"
bad,"Wal-Mart is large company that brings in more money than most other retail chains. The compensation they give the employees is ridiculous. I do not understand how one can support him/herself or a family on Wal-Mart income. Orange, Texas store is always a mess. Unorganized, total disaster. Always young, lazy kids working there that have no clue about try meaning of Customer Service."
bad,"This job was incredibly boring and the management expected the workers to be superhuman, assigning tasks that they themselves admit is not possible but you will still be reprimanded for not finishing your work. The fellow employees were constantly harassing me and every other woman that worked there. The work is physically taxing and not worth the pay because of what they expect from you."
bad,"worst place ive ever worked. managment is horrible, there is no job security and the pay isnt worth dealing with what they through at you."
bad,"Working overnight shifts at Wal-Mart predicates how your life will be during the day. I lost 20 lbs since I started working there 10 months ago. The physical labor can be overwhelming and the expectations to complete the tasks within a certain time frame is extremely stressful. The worst part of the job wasn't even the labor, it was the management. Not a week went by where one manager in particular would threaten me with job termination.  I know it's their jobs to supervise but getting threats of getting my ""face pounded in"" for not getting 1 of 5 pallets off the floor before 6 a.m. was beyond infuriating. The worst experience was witnessing a manager actually pull out a watch and time an older lady to see how fast she could stock an item on the opposite side of the aisle saying things like, ""and don't run,"" which left the lady in tears once he left. Management is Wal-Marts worst aspect."
bad,"I learned that the work could be enjoyable when you focused on that, the work being distracted didn't help.  However, the work was repetitive and so I made a challenge of it, stay busy and provide service fast.  I enjoyed that.  It was something that assisted me on otherwise preoccupied day.  The worst part of a day was having to deal with poor management."
bad,"Walmart is no longer transformational; it has lost its innovative drive and true customer centric focus. It is now a dying dinosaur, similar to Kmart and Sears. Here is what you should know...there is a lot of leadership infighting, there is an ""us vs. them"" struggle between the tenured associates and new experienced leaders from outside the company. Walmart's HR policies appear righteous on the surface but create an atmosphere of CYA and fear - investigations by ethics are the norm and you can be turned in ridiculous things like missing a meeting. Advancement opportunities are espoused during recruiting but are non-existent once you join.  Women - strong women are neither appreciated nor welcome - so if you join be sure to wear your ""I'm meek"" mask daily.  Single females get the worst treatment with discrimination and harassment.  "
bad,"My typical day was walk the floor. Take notes for my associates. Work along side them to get everything done. Meetings every day. I learned how to talk to different associates, how to run my team, plan for everything and re plan when plans fell through. The management team needs to be more organized and communicate better. The hardest part of my job was the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of my job was all the big projects planning them, getting them accomplished, helping the associates."
bad,I worked for Walmart for 3 years at 2 different stores. It can be a fun place to work but management team overrides that. They are horrible. They do not care for their employees at all. They could careless if you have children and need a day to care for them ( like doc appts and such). Management will delegate all their work to others so they don't have to do anything on top of all your daily routines. Then look to you when something doesn't get done. They will lie to your face and tell you yeah they want you in management or yeah they want to  promote you and then you turn your back and they are doing the exact opposite. I have several friends that are in this work place that are seeking to get out of this horrible place. I do not think that this is ever a place I would want to go back to. Its a trap. Once they have a target on you they do everything they can to get you out of there. I can actually say that I HATE that place!!!!
bad,"Walmart treats its employees very poorly with very few benefits.  Despite my direct supervisor being wonderful, store management constantly made me feel less than welcome.  They will do everything they can to provide any benefits to you, going so far as to hire temporary employees in order to deny medical or vacation benefits.  You are completely disposable with them no matter how hard you work.  I left the company because a manager was stalking me and defaming me to other associates."
bad,"Walmart, in my experience is one of the worst companies to work for. Your taken for granted, unappreciated, and don't matter in the company. They want you to work more for less as well as doing more than one job for the price of one while only getting paid minimum wage."
bad,"The associates are awesome. As an assistant store manager at Walmart, I liked to interact with my associates.  I also had a great schedule of 3 days on and 3 days off.  But, sadly, these were the only good characteristics of my position.  I spent most of my 12 hour days sprinting across the salesfloor fighting fires.  We were terribly understaffed.  I often ran a cash register, stocked shelves, zoned, cleaned up spills, collected shopping carts, sold hunting licenses, and carried heavy merchandise out to customers' vehicles.  I came to truly understand the real cost behind the low prices.  We (all employees in the store) were overworked, under paid and led to believe we would get a bonus called ""My Share.""  Well, I never got a bonus.  This is because of all the ""shrink"" our store managed to acquire.  Shrink meaning the loss of profits due to theft and accidents.  As a manager, I was told to give my associates more work than they could possibly accomplish in one day.  And in turn, my shift managers and store manager overloaded myself.  "
bad,"	Stocking shelves in varies departments"
bad,"Walmart isn't a great place to work but it's to be expected when you work in grocery or retail. Customers generally treat you as if you are less than a human being and management looks down on you as well. Not a career, just a job."
bad,"I loved the employees I worked with and I loved my job, but the company really is bad. They do not want to pay benefits or do anything for their help that they do not have to. you are not allowed to be sick or have a life outside the place in any way. You will be terminated. The company needs to care more about their employees and customers. It's going to kill them if they don't."
bad,It was all right to work there at times people were mean at times and at times I didn't want to work there.
bad,"Tous les matin, on commence la journée par la ""danse Wal-Mart"", il s'agit de répéter les lettre du nom de l'entreprise et de les former a l'aide des mains et de taper dans ses mains et de chanter les lettres une a une, certains se dandinaient. Par la suite, chacun gagnait son département. Moi, je travaillais aux mises de côté. Nous commencions par regarder la liste des clients qui viendraient chercher leur mise de côté et ensuite, j'allais préparer les produits qui sortirait et trier les mises de côté. Après, les clients venaient en chercher, d'autres venaient en porter, puis je faisais des va et viens du sous-sol a l'étage toute la journée. A la fermeture, nous trions les noms des clients et préparions la journée du lendemain."
bad,"I never had a typical day as the frond end Z but I did learn how to interview canadates for several job fields, complete associate evaluations, teach and train my own associates so that my department can improve its self, handle upset customers amd get them to leave happy and satisfied and willing to come back, multi-task during very stressful situations, solving problems within my depertment with two associaties. The management was hit or miss there I learned from some very good managers, and I learned what not to do from some bad ones.  The hardest part of the job was when I was given a task that needs multiple people to complete and I get no help until near deadline then making it happen was very hard.  The part I most enjoyed was when a customer ask for me to try and find an item that it seems like we may be out of, and when  I find it.  I get to see the look of joy on thier face, and that makes my day, knowing that I made thiers."
bad,Management cares nothing about there empoloyees. The only time employees get a glance or even spoken to are when the market managers visit
bad,The Mangers and the workload were so bloated that I was unable to complete any task let alone any others that were pilled atop of that first one
bad,"Im not at all happy with my work experience at walmart, at the location i worked at the alot of the tills had mechanical issues that could have easily been fixed if management would have stepped in, some of the managers at my location didnt care at all about the departments and how the store looks one of the biggest issues i dealt with from costumers was products being in the wrong place and that should not be happen at a walmart everything should be in there right place, i wouldnt recommend in getting a full time job at walmart"
bad,"pay was horrible, hours where everywhere. stayed till 11pm and had to be back up there at 6am. you didnt get promoted unless you were friends with someone, and management treats you like dirt on their shoes."
bad,"A typical day is 12 to 13 hours as an Assistant Manager."
bad,"If you aren't in their cliques, than you aren't in and don't get anything. Management is horrible, co-workers are full of drama, hardest part of my job is going in and enjoying it, and the most enjoyable part of my job of my job is meeting new people and having the experience."
bad,"Walmart was stable, but it sure wasn't helpful in getting me advanced up the ladder unless I was favored, or had been there for many years. I was there for nearly three years, and hadn't managed to get past a simple store associate. Politics stink. It was always weekends, late nights, whenever they could fit me in for their benefit. Which is fine, but I spent a lot of effort there to only feel shafted numerous times. If you need a job, go. If you can find something better, do."
bad,"Only 1 raise a year ,long term employees have rarely seen raises over $.40 cent per year,very few make the coveted $.60 a year raise.Constant pressure from management to meet work load demands,understaffed intentionally,high number of sick call ins on night shift.No recent full time hiring seen,few hired employees are working more than 33 hours per week.If you work over 32  hours by even a few minutes your following work schedule will be cut down to 28 hours the next week or even lower.Highly demanding and stressful work environment ,and not even related to dealing with customers. Dont expect to  support a family with 2 incomes from this employer.Some have toughed it out and reaped good rewards from working long term for Walmart but they are few."
bad,The benefits are not that bad compared to other companies but the compensation for working there is remarkably low. The culture and values of the company are only based on how the managers feel. They only care when regional or district managers are around. The advancement isn't bad at all didn't take long for me to get promoted but the job security is terrible. If you upset a manager you will quickly get fired. The management teams vary from store to store but they do need to work on weeding out all the bad apples. The work is simple enough but overall find another company to work for.
bad,The site I worked for management was horrible they treated people like a number instead of a person.
bad,Most of the people working there seemed to be there for a pay check. 
bad,Walmart is an enjoyable place to work and offers promotions to those that seek hard work and treat customers with respect. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with so many customers and help them in anyway I could. The hardest part of the job is running the entire front end alone during rush times but it taught me confidence. I would be more than willing to work with this company in the future.
bad,"I've worked every weekend night for 2 years now, have yet to receive vacation or personal time despite being promoted within 6 months of employement there. Was told schedule changes every 3 weeks(so I didn't have to work all weekends), and that'd I be moved full time after 3 months...all of which turned out to be false. Co-workers are nice enough but only because they are in the same bad situation. I thought it'd only be a couple month job until I found another one but the hours and draining labor make it hard to be up in the middle of the day to job hunt/interview. I highly recommend avoiding working here overnight, most employees are still on a lot of government assistance despite working(job does not provide health care unless you want to spend half your pay on it)"
bad,Typical day at work involves running around like a chicken with your head cut off. I learned time management. The management was cool at times. Hardest part of the job was having to work through breaks. Most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day
bad,"21 years of sales and retail its the worse company ive ever worked for, most unorganzed and they treat you like garbage"
bad,"wasn't a very good place to work at, i got hurt and they let me go "
bad,"Employees are overworked and underpaid. If you do a good job, they ask more of you then those who suck at their job. However, you still get the same pay as everyone else regardless of your ability to do your job. Also, you have to pick up the slack of others if you do a good job. Management doesn't care. They lack motivation and helping employees. Overall not a good place to work at."
bad,"Walmart is a big company to run.  The morning walk starts at 8am with the overnight managers, day managers and store managers.  The assistant managers shift was 8am to 8pm and 8pm to 8am.   We received about 3-6 trucks of merchandise on a daily basis.  "
bad,"Working in the Meat Department has greatly benefited my demeanor. I used to be extremely shy and introverted. After four years of working at Wal Mart I have lost almost all of my shyness and I am less of an introvert. "
bad,A typical day of working at the Walmart in Mebane is having to worry every day about losing your job over stupid stuff. I learned that it doesn't matter how hard you work there if management doesn't want you there. All the management there is crooked. Co-workers are awesome and always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was to have a huge list of things to do every day with almost nobody to work on them. The most enjoyable part was getting to leave everyday.
bad,I was laid - off because i went to lunch late twice in the 13 years that i woked there. i am 86 years old and have done everything they have asked of me. So at this point of my life i would like to work for a company that see how hard i do work.
bad,"Extremely disrespectful work enviorment, no ability to move forward in the company only positive feedback came from co workers on same level managers very respectfulness rude at times. Most days come into work left alone for most of shift expected to clean up after entire front end ie zoning, left behinds, suspended transactions western unions and purchase orders. All of this left to be dealt with by one person and one person alone"
bad,It is a job that has hard working people do stressful things. Hardest part is dealing with managment who do not care about their employees.
bad,daily routines on the job
bad,"I would not recommend working for wal-mart as it offers a very minimal pay,"
bad,"As a whole, Walmart does not encourage work-life balance. Even as a full-time associate our schedule is ever changing. One of my weeks has me working 10 days straight with it moving from 8 to 5 and 11 to 8 every other day. We have inventory once every month on the 27th and there is never less than 15 hours that day. I try very hard to take good care of the associates that work under me because they feel under-appreciated every day. The hardest part of my job is working freight everyday (50 lb boxes). I was hired to be a merchandiser, not a stocker and I have not been able to use my skills to their potential. The best part of my job is helping my customers find what they need daily. I did like the potential to move forward quickly, however, I quickly learned that those above play a more crucial part in you moving forward than your job performance."
bad,"Co-workers are alright, living wages are horrible, management and customer service atrocious, all last but not least ALL CONS no PROS."
bad,"Typical Day: Perform service on customers vehicles to include, oil changes, battery and bulb replacement, remove and install tires, and 15 point vehicle inspection. Provide guidance and knowledge related to oil, batteries, and proper tire selection for vehicles. Perform cashier duties within the Tire and Lube Express."
bad,"A typical day at work starts with sliding your badge through the time clock. Heading out to the sales floor to get keys you notice how much was left undone by the overnight crew. Having 8 hours to stock all the merchandise that came in the truck the night before, help customers and sell electronics results in a busy but manageable day...until management get's involved. Suddenly the department is left unattended so that homelines can get stocked or have it's modulars redone, because homeline associates can't do this on their own. I'm all about one team one fight, but it should really work both ways."
bad,"I start with paper that need to reviewed and filed before I go out on the floor an assistance with the customers. I do different job types like cashier, customer service, and department area. The hardest part is when customers I can't help solve their problem that require more higher manager to solve. The enjoyment was when customers leave happy."
bad,"You are just a number, I work the over night shiift and the salery i believe isnt worth it. Working the over night requires alot of physical labour."
bad,"Bad management, some co-workers were rude and unpleasant! just an overall horrible job! WOULD NOT GO BACK!!!"
bad,Management lacks the knowledge to run the company the way it should be. They play favorites with the associates and only advance though they feel close to or that suck up. I have worked there 5 years and in that time have been trying to find another job.
bad,Working for walmart was not all that great. I did not like the way i treated as a employee. There open door policy is to protect there managers. There customer service managers all had bad attitude with employee as well as customers in the store. I stayed at walmart because i needed the job
bad,The over all company is not bad to work for. Its the management that is the problem.
bad,"Not bad to work for temporary, a good mixture of people. I learned about cashiering, photo lab procedures and customer service. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The hardest part of this job was performing tasks with being understaffed. The management varies but I did not feel comfortable."
bad,"Bakery had set routine every day in order to fill shelves with bakery items. Typical day was to prepare bread for baking, bake bread, pull old product off shelves, refill shelves with fresh product, prepare product for next day, clean trays and counter, and floor."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for 3 months until I found out I was pregnant and they cornered me and tried to get me to quit and when I refused to quit, they fired me and lied, saying I refused to work."
bad,Unable to pay bills making min wage and over worked. Always calling me in at odd hours 2 weeks notice given.
bad,the management team at walmart were bad did not communicate with each other didnt have time for there associates had very bad tunnel vision and did not talk to associates with respect. They showed favoritism expected you to get impossible things done with lack of manpower in a very short time period. The hardest part of the job was having to put up with the disrespect shown by management team. the only enjoyable thing about there were my associates.
bad,"a typical day as a walmart manager includes, multiple meetings to delegate 5 pages of notes to 2 barely minimum wage paid employees who are already over whelmed by customers and freight. Management has political agendas. Most enjoyable? taking blows from upper management for your people who know you go to bat for them against slave drivers."
bad,I would greet customers and have great conversations. I would always try to keep myself busy if we were slow. My co-workers was great everyone tried their hardest. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management.
bad,People who worked there did not talk to the cleaners. I felt used and very long drive to work everyday.
bad,"The company is manager heavy. they do not do anything but micro manage. They get the most pay and the most time off, since they are salary employee's. everyone else is 22 hours or less a week. ""save money, live better""? YEAH RIGHT"
bad,dias de trabalho cansativo muitas horas extras sem retorno ao funcio
bad,Change is constant. I have learned to adapt to change even when communication is lacking.
bad,A typical day a Wal Mart will be; you coming to work at one time for one department to do one job and the managers have doing the job of two workers. They cut hours all the time to avoid paying out extra money. They will schedule one person to do two people jobs. They keep the trach compactor locked and hate to unlock it when you call for the key. When a member of your family pass and you call in; they write you up. They have no respect at all for anyone or any emergency they may have. The co-workers are the only thing that gets you by at Wal Mart. the hardest part of the job is actually going to work. The only thing I learned from working at Wal Mart is how to decorate cakes and bake bread. In which I honestly taught myself by watching others. No one actually show you how to do anything there. Wal Mart is horrible!
bad,O trabalho é meio puxado por não ter uma demanda boa de funcionários muita das vezes os poucos funcionários tem que se desdobrar pra dar conta de tanto trabalho.
bad,Muito extressante
bad,Not the best place to work. The pay sucked. I was a student full-time in school and already had about 25-30hrs a week. My supervisor basically told me he didn't even need me anymore because of my low hours.
bad,Hours are very erratic unless you have been working there and the only way to get ahead is to make sure you're in good with management or else you have a very good chance to get fired within your first 2 years.
bad,"A typical day started at 7 am, and working until 4 pm. To start out our day we would meet with management and find out what the plan was for the day. We would work freight left over from third shift or a new truck that came in. We would organize and maintain shelf accuracy and availability. Correct pricing errors and change prices according to home office. Work our on hands and shelf caps. The hardest part about this job would be the short handed. I liked the people I would work with at any given time."
bad,"Enjoyed working with other floor personal and customers. I enjoyed keeping up my department. Working with the fish and cleaning the fish tank. Management on the other had was hard. They were often unfair in their practices, they did not follow the rules of the company in regards to themselves"
bad,"Management looks down on hourly employees and often treats them rudely and without much thought. Salary is just above minimum, with department modifiers and yearly raises. They do offer a nice health and dental benefit package along with the chance to buy stock, and they put money for you into a retirement account,"
bad,"You can't get ahead if you have either a write up which too me is dumb cause I was looking forward to be a department manager or assistant manger, won't let you switch department to be in a more comfortable environment or transfer to a new store, always got called to my department knowing I was in my lunch brake, the management really have poor leadership and always in a bad mood, really stressful since I had to watch three departments and to put more stressful the customers were rude and insulting, sometimes the customer is not always right."
bad,I was let go because they said I stole one minute of their time. Needless to say I think management are a bunch of morons. They'll fire anyone for any possible reason they can when they need to cut back on labor.
bad,"I've worked for Walmart in 3 different distribution centers over the last 7 years and I'll say this it's good in the beginning because the salary is a bit higher than most local jobs however the big drawback is after 2 1/2 years you'll max out which to some may not be an issue but if you're an individual like me who has to shoulder more of the load than others I feel I should get paid more than someone who doesn't do half of what I do. Management is very poor very indecisive and inexperienced people are being hired off the street to be managers when at one point in time the motto was we'll hire from within next thing you know people with no experience are being hired and we're being forced to train our future bosses figure that one out. There's another big problem the hours are not consistent again the pay is good you'll start in the mid 15's but what good is the pay if you're only working 25-30hrs a week and it's like that for a few months. Prime example in July and August I'll average maybe 28hrs a week the next couple months I'll average 50+ hrs sounds great but there's no balance and consistency. For me to be the breadwinner of my family it's hard to plan for anything because you never really know how your hours are. If you're young fresh out of high school it's a perfect job to work and go to college if you're older than say 27 and have a family to feed I hope your spouse has a good job because you'll never advance up no matter how hard you try, and your hours are never guaranteed."
bad,Managegment is expected to work more then company policy dictates. Now that Sam Walton has passed there is no respect for the individual. The took away profit sharing from the associates.
bad,"Management was horrible, the work night went by extremely fast."
bad,"I would restock the shelves of the store depending on the shipment that night. My coworkers were back stabbing, the management team didn't not follow the correct protocols in disciplinary action. The hardest part of my job was dealing with managers of different personalities; each one wanted you to work a certain way. Every night would be very confusing as in how they wanted the work completed."
bad,"They dont take loaylty in to consideration, They dont have very good pay for the people that has been there for years."
bad,"If you want to have zero work life balance, be constantly degraded by your boss (regardless of what level with the company you are) and told you aren't good enough on a daily basis, offered very little chance for advancement, and generally would like to hate your life, work here."
bad,The management at Wal-mart was horrible. The only real manager was the store manager and if it wasn't done his way you would be fired. A typical day of work for me was getting 3 departments worth of stock to do while others generally had 1-2.
bad,"Wal-mart employee experience differs from store to store but in general not many are fun. From what I experienced I saw a huge, almost war like, gap between associates and management. Every system in place was broken and horribly disorganized, things would come out of the back of the store only to be sent back in the same night which only led to mass confusion. Management refused to arrange proper training for me even after asked for is several times and I only learned how to do my job by people yelling at me."
bad,It is a horrible place to work. I do not recommend it to anyone!
bad,"Typical Day at work: Overnight cleaners did most of the cleaning for the entire store, Day time cleaners only ""Check"" the Garbages/bathrooms and did them when they felt like it."
bad,the most enjoyable part about my time at walmart was being able to work with my best friends.
bad,"Management acts like their brain washed. There is no compashion. If you are full time you are harrassed until you quit. They say one thing and mean another. Case in point, if you are finished before your shift is over you can ask to leave early. They will say you can, but you will be marked down as a tarty and it will count as an absent. They play by there own rules."
bad,"In the beginning I use to value my job at walmart but my whole impression has went out the door. The management team has no concern for the employees they treat you nonknowing factor ,whatever you going through on the job or issues at home you'll do better keeping it to yourself.When it comes time for your raise dnt be disappointed when they tell you did't exceed in your dept. No one ever exceeds as long as they can give you a .40 Cent raise, the only way anyone ever exceeds is that your on one the managers fav's list...."
bad,"I reported a leaking propane tank then instructed to sit outside with the valve wide open to let the gas out at the bussiest corner of the parking lot where anybody could have thrown out a cigarette & blew the entire block to pieces. It was break time so I had sombody sit with the tank& took my break. I was wrote up coming back from my break. Eventually after being harrassed for over a year I was wrongfully terminated. My supervisor chased at me with a forklift Cussing & yelling with the forks scraping the ground. My neighbor who is a sheriff told me a list of felonies that he committed and Wal Mart said I was insubordinate & fired me. The supervisor still has his job. I would too but it was my managers day off the only manager who was fair with my prior reports of the supervisor telling .me where ""A womans place"" is and other reports of the same supervisor yelling using Profane language on the sales floor and showing me disrespect by belittleing me with wonamizing behavior in front of customers. And they say I was insubordinate. hah. he was head of risk control for several years before all this. my guess is if you worked risk control you get job security due to knowlege of company wrong doings they dont want anybody to tell."
bad,"drama, how to stick to myself, the managers doesn't care about the employees, i have a few good coworkers but not that many, the hardest part is not getting treated with respect, most enjoyable part is meeting nice customers"
bad,"Terrible management. Associates and lower to mid level management getting yelled at and cussed out in front of customers for minor mishaps. Hardly any employees enjoy their job and only show up for a pay check and go home sick and tired. This company that started out as a once pleasant place to work has become one of the worst employment opportunities. The home office came to the store to say they are going to change the way management runs the store to boost morale but has never come back to see that upper management didn't follow the guidelines set up. They give you the idea that there are opportunities to move up in the company or move to departments or areas of the store you would like to work in, but they never follow up on that so employees are stuck in the environment they would like to move out of also causing low morale. management puts employees in positions where they become hurt and have to go on light duty causing them to have to work less hours. They also listen to people that are only trying to get what they want to make others look bad and thus pushing other employees into a position that they cannot be respected by other managers of others departments."
bad,The Wal-Mart I worked at was a very bad example. The turn over rate there was very high and the management was close to nothing close to competent
bad,The co-workers at Walmart are the part of the job. In a typical day I scanned out recalls and merchandise to achieve credit for the company.
bad,It gave me valuable experience on how to appropriately handle difficult situations and limited resources to complete daily task. Also having to self motivate and manage due minimal and ineffective management. The most enjoyable part of the job was my fellow co-workers and being able to be creative at my own discretion.
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can range from fast-paced and teeth-clenching, to enjoyable and thumb-twiddling. They have pretty strict rules about uniform, personal appearance, timeliness, customer interaction and standards of job performance (each being somewhat different for every department). You eventually learn how to fake a smile and keep your mouth closed even when dealing with the most unruly customers or supervisors. Most of management can be friendly - if you catch them at the right time, but there are many cases of associates being unjustly punished (up to being fired) for first offenses that were minor, while other ""members of the team"" can repeatedly break policies and rules without any sort of coaching or discipline. I will say that the many co-workers I have worked with were very pleasant people. You can become a family of close-knit friends and the support system is something to be cherished. There is truly no difficult part of the job other than standing still for long hours, which can wear on your body. Certainly the most enjoyable part was being able to meet and talk with many different people."
bad,"With 20 years in the nursery industry, I was hired as a night stocker at a store that didn't even have a garden shop. Managers were all druggies and I had to listen to 90% of employees constantly complain about how much they hate their job. Talk about a negative environment to work in! Almost made it 6 months. Finally, after being screamed at by a manager to clock in early because they had tons of freight, in the immortal words of Johnny Paycheck, I told them what to do with their job."
bad,I have worked for Walmart Stores Inc for the past 81/2 years and have noticed a slow decline in its values. It is no longer a family oriented company. Management is on the decline as well. The company is not big on promoting from within the company as it should. It instead hires personnel just because they have obtained a degree of some sorts with no knowledge of the company's policies and procedures. This method of hiring is promoting low moral within the store. A typical wokday is filled with shortages in every department with overworked employees. Management is lazy and biligerant to the employees. There is no teamwork beause no one cares. The hardest part of the job for most employees is work schedules. Some employees are overworked while others are getting their hours cut. There has even been a death of an employee because of poor scheduling. Another is employee passed because of unecessary coaching procedures. The most enjoyable part of the day is when it's time to clock out.
bad,"review summary speaks for itself, bad scheduling/hours, absolutely the worst management ever they don't care for the flow of workplace, very rude and unpleasant, disables work flow."
bad,"Typical day at work may include a worker being taken from his or her department and put into another department. The worker may have work in his or her department that needs to be done, but has to put that work aside so help can be given to the other department. The management staff does not care about their employees. In learned that it's every man for themselves. Hardest part of the job was finding a manager when one was needed...customers had to wait at least 10 minutes sometimes. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers."
bad,Plain boring day.... Most of the people were nice to work with but they are just a big box store. If you must work here do your job and never get hurt on the job.
bad,"My experince at walmart was horrible ,work hard labor for little pay."
bad,Horrible company. Can only get hired through a temp agency. The agency ripped off its employees.
bad,This employer was good but the supervisors wouldnt do anything when I ha some guys bugging me.
bad,"Wal-mart is not a great company to work for. They work you to death for $8/hr, and you move up after being stuck in the same position/department for what seems like forever. Employees are treated like numbers instead of human beings."
bad,"They don't care about you as a human being. They won't work around a small schedule. Everyone there is mean and rude including managers, coworkers, and customers!"
bad,"I worked here for about a year and a half, they play favorites in this company. They object to diversity and will not work with you when it comes to scheduling, it took me months after I had my child to change my schedule. Then they found a reason to let me go based on them disliking me and blamed me for relations with another employee."
bad,"some people get treated better then others, some get promotions after only weeks of starting, for others it takes months to get a transfer to another department, then they look for any thing to get you in trouble. The open door policy says no reprocutions, bull you get treated even worse.They want you to do the work of three people, when you are out it takes two or three people to do your job and make a mess, then you get yelled at to clean up the mess. The front end managers take so long to get to the registers to help the customers that the customer takes it out on you. You do right by them and they call in and get you in trouble for something you did not do. a very un fair company"
bad,I will never work for a slave driving company again.
bad,"Walmart needs to treat employees better!!! Need to train management to handle problems better, like don't go on he said and she said statements. Be more organized the supplies for cleaning crew, understand the different types of cleaning floors."
bad,"Management is a joke, they only care about numbers and meeting company goals. They'll throw employees under the bus for customers and other upper management."
bad,"You cannot advance unless you want to go into management.  There are a lot of different positions to try, but your pay may decrease depending on the job."
bad,"13 years as a salaried Asst Mgr.  They act like they own you and expect you act accordingly. Bad management reported to HR never addressed, scheduling changes constantly and constant swing shifts or put overnights on a store managers whim from store managers that work 40 hour weeks and want you to work 70.  You work all the holidays and have no work life balance.  If you’re son in the military and leaving the country for a year don’t ask to leave on a long lunch to see him off to serve his countryman"
bad,"Typical Walmart, want top sales and services,  but don't way to pay for the employees it requires to make sure pharmacy is safe. Require Technician to make phone calls about compliance,  but the regional manager assistant is the one that gets the monetary bonus from it."
bad,"They only work with your schedule if they like you. They see you as a number, not a person. You can only be advanced in a position if a higher-up likes you. There is maybe a total of 2 managers at a time that actually cares for any of the employees."
bad,"Ethics will not assist you with work harassment and discrimination. It's a system of ""Friends over hard workers"". Low morale and burning good employees. If you work hard, then you will do others work. A socialism type system of employees not wanting to work hard, so you must and are forced to work hard for them if you show any potential what so ever."
bad,"Working here was the worst thing I've ever done. They literally don't care about their employees. They had good health insurance and 6 months paid maternity leave. But that was about the only good thing they had. They made us work like slaves. I wasn't just a cashier.. they made me restock shelves, work the clothes area/fitting rooms, bakery. Anything they could think of, or a section that was short-staffed, they'd throw us over there to help them. No recognition, no raise, no promotion. Management would basically tell us we weren't more than our obligation. Where my contract clearly stated I was just a cashier. And in Brazil, making your employees work another section that is not their obligation and is not mentioned in their contract, is illegal."
bad,Management it all depends how well they take care of their employees. Pay is good only if you get your right amount of hours which most associates won’t go past 32 hrs.
bad,I was with the company for a year and a half I started working at walmart where I worked with a racist manager Who the GM backed up after hearing her call me a racial slur. Can I transfer to Sams Club where it didn't get any better the manager stuff together and need to work environment very toxic for me I ended up leaving a company after a year-and-a-half
bad,"People last, product first. Wal-Mart does not care about its employees. Wal-Mart is only concerned with productivity and profitability. Wal-Mart stores are notorious for turnover in all areas operational because of the focus on productivity."
bad,They advertise a happy environment for their employees but in reality employees are over work and under paid. Their managers are abusive and over worked as well. The entire store was the most toxic work environment I have ever worked in.
bad,"Not enough hours per pay that’s why I resigned , and also mistreated by staff  and not allowed to work more then 20 hours a week  but  decent management and kindhearted hiring manger"
bad,"You can actually work and get terminated, but you can clock in and hang out in the brake room and just be spoken to , actually caught someone sleeping while on the clock but I was terminated for working on the computer, mind you , you can only use the work computers while your clocked in , I never called in and then you get people who do but the ones that don’t get terminated!"
bad,Too many buddied up managers. Too much management swapping. In the 3months that I was there 50 people quit and my direct supervisor changed 4 times. No organization.
bad,For the past 2 months they have cut every ones hours. I have been getting between 6 and 8 hours a week. The pay keeps decreasing over the years. The benefits are decreasing as well. Company does not care when you are sick you have to work sick or receive points and be fired.
bad,"Walmart has lost touch with what it's like to be an associate. The job is enjoyable, the management less so. Expectations for productivity are too high. Teamwork is frowned upon."
bad,"The management is terrible, for every one store associate there are three managers. I've never seen anything like it before! Everyone just standing around talking about what needs to be done rather than actually just working like they are paid to do! I would never suggest anyone ever working for this company they can switch your pay without even consulting you when agreed on certain pay when I initially started."
bad,"Un dia comun es muy relajado y te diviertes, a no ser que esten los jefe que quieren abusar de su autoridad poniendote a hacer todo mientras tu estas dando todo de ti, la gerencia en casos de conflicto no hace nada solo dice que va resolver las cosas pero no pasa nada, los jefes se toman represarias si los acusas y esto demustra su ineficiente cultura del trabajo. La parte dificil es tratar con personas malagradecidas y prepotentes, lo bueno te enseñas a trabajar en equipo."
bad,"They are disrespectful the managers and they don’t ever communicate at all and the pay sucks for what they make us do, they don’t ever listen to us when we need help."
bad,"A company that only provides the minimum to survive. Moving up is done by who you know, and they don’t want to pay for it. The culture is toxic regardless of how high you go."
bad,Is about numbers it's about business enforce it's the hours they can give you and that's not much. They Call You full time do you actually work part-time. If you work here I would recommend as a part-time job good luck
bad,"Too much racism, drug abuse, harassment, and threats that are EACH 100% reasons to be terminated on the spot as per Walmart policy, but Walmart has no backbone, they believe every deserves unlimited 2nd chances per day unless you are actually trying to do your job then you get the responsibility for everything and everyone but zero authority."
bad,only advance those who are willing to take a lot of mental and verbil abuse. Prior experience has no value just a willingness to do the job that your tasked to do.
bad,I'm a 50 year old female and my job duties were made for a 20 year old young man. Worked over a year and was passed over for advancement 3 times for an outsider. Management is terrible. They only care about the job getting done as long as it's not them doing it. Dept managers don't care about their associates.
bad,I enjoyed my job when I first started there.   Then things changed and I changed my aspect about the job.   My last boss disliked me and lots of others.   He did all he could to get you fired.   He tried to fire me because of my absences but that didn't work.  He said give me 2 months and I will have you fired.
bad,Working at Walmart has not been great management kind of sucks always cutting hour always treating their employees like they're disposable no matter how much time you give them I would not recommend working there.
bad,"Not somewhere I would want to work again"
bad,This company is a joke. You can never trust what they say. The .managers only look out for themselves.  No matter how above and beyond you may go it dosen't matter. You don't know from day to day if you will still have a job. They trick you into thinking they're all about the employees in the beginning and then turn on you once you're in there. Compensation is a joke.
bad,Can be fun working here at first but is complete sh¡t on the long run. Some employees can be great to work with and make work a little bit easier to come in to work each day.
bad,With this job I felt like they could replace you at any time for any reason. There's not job security. The hardest part of the job is when management gives employees too many duties expecting them to finish at an unreasonable time frame. Most of the employees that stay there for years look miserable so I left after 6 months.
bad,"The best thing to do is to mind your business and keep people out of yours...."
bad,Walmart culture values are taught to you during orientation but during your work experience is not driven at a store level. Upper member of management is lacking respect for ALL. Upper management can speak to you any kind of way and not be held to those same standards if you were an hourly associate. And the good boy network still exists. If you are not liked because you speak out on something they will see you as a threat and potentially a not likeable candidate for promotion despite your experience.
bad,It was the worst job I’ve ever had. They have no care to anything that’s happening in your personal life and if you miss work you get points and they don’t care what the reason is
bad,"There was a male coworker harassing me, he then proceeded to show up to my house. I had to call the cops and was able to get a restraining order. However, I had gone to management for the report where he had harassed me in front of all management, they said they just talked to him."
bad,"long story short, they lied about the hours i was legally allowed to work which resulted in me getting unnecessary points management said theyd remove and never did.. when i told them i was required to take 4 days off by my dentist for getting my wisdom teeth taken out.. magically more points appeared and i was “terminated for pointing out”. My dad worked here years ago and they did the same... Fort wayne has the worst management"
bad,"Terribly management. Dont care about their employees, managers are terrible... have to work every holiday with no holiday pay.. the people that have worked there are awesome"
bad,I give 100% as far as my job duties! We do not get the same in return from management. Walmart management does not care for  thier customers or thier employees.
bad,"The job is worth the pay in ever way, but management was difficult to not only keep but talk with as well. Directions were often miscommunicated and when employee's happened to ask for clarity they were greeted with cold remarks. The expectations are high though they fail to provide the devices required in enough volume for those in the back to work effectively."
bad,Store manager wants a young staff and discriminates against older workers. They get rid or people for no reason and keep the ones they need too get rid of. Not a family friendly place to work. The store manager yells at the employees. Stay away from Walmart!
bad,"This store has the worst management team ever. They literally do nothing but sit in the office and could care less about the employees anything that goes wrong they blame on their employees by threatening g them and bullying them.z"
bad,"You are alone in this company and a lot of the managers will get together and decide how to get rid of you. Management will tell you one thing and two other managers will tell you a different thing, so many disciplinary actions. You can not be sick in this company you will be guilt tripped to stay or get point off your attendance repeatedly. Maternity leave has lots of regulations as well."
bad,"doesn't give a pay raise based on morale."
bad,Management talks to me like I’m stupid when I have more education that them.. some of the managers never even Graduated high school and they don’t give hire positions off of qualification. Everything is off favoritism so if you’re not gonna kiss their behinds you’ll make it no where
bad,First time i worked here it was a alright job to work at but now they don't care about their employees or customers.  They make changes that may work for some stores but not for all.
bad,Working here was not a good experience for me. The schedule was awful and they have absolutely no respect for their employees. They would continuously schedule me at the times I said I was not available to work.
bad,The pay was good and they customer service was great but the was they treated there  emplpoyees was horrible I got fired for no reason. They have a 4 points till u get fired.
bad,There was always drama between all the managers. They are not flexible with your hours and there would be major consequences when you did not show up.
bad,"Management only cares about making the market and regional management happy. Management doesn't care about their associates or what associates have to say. Management constantly goes after the associates who try to succeed, and ignores the troublesome associates & issues. Associates create an environment similar to that of being at high school all over again - everyone gossips about each other, and stabs the each other in the back. There is no accountability."
bad,"Walmary does not care for their associates. Do not get cancer or a critical illness if you work there, you will lose your job. They have no ethics at all."
bad,The store manager does not care much about the employees or the customer she rarely listens to employees nor does she come out office also the management team are not very hands on
bad,Don’t do it. Literally go find anything else. I can not push this enough. It’s like working for the devil. I don’t know how many ways I can say it. I just need 150 characters.
bad,As a single person working for this company the benefits are some of the best. The environment and lack of communication with management to associates is lacking. The fact that management gets about as much training as a new associate. So in other words you teach yourself as you go type of environment.
bad,"Management expects you to do the work of twelve people and get it done, there is a lot of favoritism, too many bosses and one doesn't know what the other one is doing, not enough work hours are allowed, seniority means absolutely nothing, and management rarely gives you compliments."
bad,"This is not a place of team work. It's every person for themselves and you can not trust anyone. There's always someone watching you whether you know it or not, and your every move is under a microscope."
bad,Doesn't know wat they are doing. They dont treat thier employees right and only care about themselves. They fire people over stupid reasons. The pharmacist at woodrow bean is the rudest and most disrespectful person i have ever met.
bad,The management was absolutely terrible. Never felt appreciated not even once. I worked my tail off too. I completed daily goals by 150% and no appreciation
bad,"The past two times I've worked for different walmarts, I have had management that treated me like I was dirt under their shoes I would not recommend walmart to my worst enemy."
bad,Doesn't pay enough for all the work you they take money from your paycheck if you owe child support they actually charge you for having to send out a court order child support.
bad,We all tried to work as a team but lack of communication was a major issue here.. Issues with scheduling..you give your availability but then your scheduled outside your avalable hours. Required and mandatory to work weekend and holidays as well as long hours black friday.
bad,"Working for Walmart was a huge mistake in my life. The company has NO respect for home life.  Luckily, I did have great managers but the rest were horrible."
bad,"Was let go for ""gross misconduct"" over nothing had issues going on with my kids at home and they was unwilling to work with me on scheduling overall the worst place I've ever had the misfortune of working for"
bad,working there not a lot of hour because they want to keep everybody on part time and not offer no benefits and managers treat you like garbage  I no I worked at Walmart for 3 years and when I got my chance to leave because I found another job I left there in a hurry lol
bad,"I needed to take time off to care for a sick family member. There was no specific time when this family member would be better so my manager told me to ""take a leave of absence with no return date"" and then stated my job will be waiting for me when I'm ready to come back. "
bad,"Management is a joke, supervisors belittle you and talk behind your back, and the only way to advance within the store is to kiss the area assistant manager’s butt. The only thing keeping me with the company is the pay."
bad,"The actual roles at Walmart are not difficult to do. Whether you are stocking shelves, scanning groceries, or shopping for someone via e-commerce, you can find actually have fun and meet amazing people here. However, in my experience, any potential of enjoying your job gets ruined by management. They do not care about you, and will easily replace you if you stick up for yourself or speak up against how terrible the working environment is. Even though I was a college student taking full-time hours and was listed as part-time, I was constantly given 40 hours a week and was being scheduled to work when I had classes/exams at the same time. I was constantly being taken advantage of and threatened here. I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone."
bad,Company does not care about employees no organization on scheduling and always had call offs with no back up plan and had a bad attendance policy and would work employees hours with out a break
bad,"Good if you really need a job, but if you change your availability for classes or school they don’t care and will work you the same amount of hours and rarely are given time off"
bad,Walmart is draining stressful it is not what people think it is. They are unapreactied want you to break your back for them do not care about your family
bad,This company has gone down hill since Sam Walton passed...I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone...There's no room for advancement either...Jobs elsewhere is better....
bad,Don’t work for #3584 . The management staff is unprofessional and ghetto . They yell at their associates in front of customers and other staff. Not sure why expected anything good from here. Don’t work here unless YOU DESPERATELY NEED A JOB. Apply at your own risk.
bad,I've been working for Walmart for 4 years going on 5 and the store managers are not doing what they supposed to do or the department manager need help at store 5327
bad,"A typical day at Walmart was zoning the area. Helping customers find an item they're looking for. Getting returns from customer service and putting them away. The work culture was very toxic at times. You could cut the tension with a knife. Management wasn't very good either, they only came after you paged them a million times. The hardest part of the job was getting done on time and completing tasks on time and accurately. The most enjoyable part of the just was the people I worked with."
bad,"I worked there for 14 years. Initially it was an impressive store, with management very involved. Over the years, they repeatedly reduced the payroll budget and increased the responsibilities."
bad,"Just a lil bit higher for wage but not designed for anybody of color unless u kiss up or kissing up 2 management "
bad,Management keeps pushing you harder and harder till you want to give up. No support if you are a cap 2 Supervisor even if you work 150 hours every 2 weeks
bad,Improve management and your stores would succeed treat your employees fairly and never bash a employee if their in the right for a department manager and stop firing good employees for nothing. Compensate me for not giving me a schedule for the last 3 months I’ve lost a car and the rights to everything learn how to deal with employees instead of being mean and lowdown.
bad,"management is absolutely terrible, hard to move up in this company unless you kiss up and have your foot in the door through a higher up friend or family member, extreme favoritism shown policy's not followed"
bad,"Modern day slave camp!! Management micro manages. The good managers get taken advantage of and the brown nosers get all the ""percs"" . Need to send most of the managers back to school."
bad,No sense of job stability. Did not fell helped at all. Was not paid what I was worth.did not wanna come to work. Did not get treated fair. Bonuses where laughable.
bad,"Store Manager required us Assistant Managers to do unethical things. He publically displayed racist,sexist, and homophobic behaviors. He would threaten anyone with their job if he wasnt followed 100%"
bad,"I am 57 years old and, I can tell you, getting a part-time job at Walmart has been the most stressful and down right confusing experience of my life! I applied at the Raymore/Belton Walmart (amongst other places) in October, hoping for just a part-time job to go with my full time job, to make a little extra money. From the very first contact I received from them, it has been such a nightmare! Just trying to reach the person in charge of hiring (who left me the message) was almost impossible (which she informed me at my interview she does not have a special ext # or other contact # or, a way to leave her a message, nor did she ever display her schedule so one could at least know when she'd be at the store. Can someone explain to me how anyone could hold the position of hiring when they have no way to be reached, except to call the store & hope they happen to be there!) Then, once I finally did reach her and she set up the interview, telling me to go to Customer Service that day and have them page her, I was made to wait over 25 mins, all the while, being told by CS that they thought she had left for lunch and wouldn't be back for another hour. I was contemplating leaving when, at 26 mins after our scheduled time, she showed up, only to approach me and ask me my name. It didn't help, with her looking all the more confused as she asked me how she could help me. I told her I was there for the interview she set up, thinking that would finally do it but, she just continued looking confused, once again, asking me what my name was. What? What? "
bad,"where to begin? Terrible management, terrible hours, terrible everything. No one cares about a single thing. That includes corporate “leaders”, managers, employees. Just a constant environment of he said she said rather than work. Constant abuse by customers that’s supported by management. No one is trained properly. I could go on forever. You’re better off digging graves (plus that pays more)"
bad,"I love working in my field of Pharmacy, but this company made it miserable, under staffed, doing the work of 3 people, talked down to, awful management."
bad,"Walmart sucks to work at. They tell you integrity is important, and that they value YOU as an employee, but they care about money, and customers, and if you don't get done on time they freak out. Get done with what? They're disorganized, it's hard to find a manager to ask what you're supposed to be doing, then they get mad you didn't magically just KNOW what department you were suppose to be working. The training was god-awful (not from my co-workers- they were all very nice! The management mostly is awful. Maybe 1-2 good managers out of a dozen) I was thrown on the job in rush season with unclear directions, with barely two days of training when I started. When people call out the managers get mad and take it out on you. The pay starts between 11-12$ depending on the area you're in; stockers have much rougher jobs than the grocery pickup people, but get paid less which is strange. "
bad,"Managment was terrible, lied to several times, when a family/medical emergency happened they threatened with termination, refused to work with me, do not respect employees"
bad,Walmart is an okay company. They are not too bad to work for. Management could be a whole lot better. They have changed a lot in the past 10 years that I have been working there.
bad,company had gone the wrong way. miss direction not a lot of job clarity there no job safety you could get fire any time. People are the most importance on the work place and that is not the case at walmart
bad,I was a cashier at Walmart for 12 yrs. I was let go cause I absent from work for 3 days which I spent in the hospital. also had a doc's note saying so. I called in everyday but 1 n that was because I never worked that day before. I got marked down for everyday I was gone including the day that I never work before. except that 1 . that 1 I got a no call no show on it . which counted as 2 . so there was my 5 . so I was let go .no lee ways no nothing after 12 yrs . just to show u how tuch they r on that stuff.
bad,Walmart it’s self it’s not a bad company to work for. It’s management that is ruining the stores. They are glorified stock people and they refuse to help any employee under them with anything.
bad,"Abused, used, and expected to work over 50 hours every week for minimal gratitude. Even if you go above and beyond, you’re rarely ever noticed for it."
bad,"I remember many of my friends telling me that they quit Walmart because of how disrespectful the management people were to the employees,and it is unacceptable.I was treated with utter disrespect by the Walmart Managers.Just one of the Managers not all of them.I quit after 6 months.I was hoping to move up but after the disrespect I experienced I lost comfort."
bad,"I was salary, and while working 18 hrs/day, 6 days a week, I was told I needed to put in more time.  They worked me til I couldn't handle the stress.  I wish I had never promoted to management.  They abuse management, cutting associates hours, and asking management to ""make it work"" without the staff needed.  I loved being a department manager.  Wish I had never gone salary. Now I could never work at Walmart again."
bad,But after being there for some months it was a lot of things I didn’t like while working there and most of the time how I was treated while working there
bad,Poor management. Promotion friends first work proformmentioned last .management are promoted with little or no experience. Management isn't at by store leaders. They look for they jubilee not the hold store.
bad,"The store manager likes to pit the department managers against each other just to see what would happen. If you don't keep carefully documented notes of what you did, when, how long it took you and why it took you that long you could potentially find yourself in a writeup that you only vaguely remember the details so you are unable to defend yourself adequately. The basic structure and ideas are great but the Walmarts around here are all about brown-nosing and making sure that you stay on the good side of certain managers otherwise you could find yourself on the chopping block. It was not uncommon for the store I worked at to lose about 3-6 department managers a year most of them leaving or getting terminated around January - March. As long as you keep your head down and do the expected work without trying to do too much more, then you stand a chance at having a good time there without a bullseye on your back but once you step into a leadership or training position remember to always, C.Y.A."
bad,Once you’ve been at Walmart for a while you learn that they don’t care about you or your family. The management doesn’t care and corporate certainly doesn’t either.
bad,"This job is by far the worst place I have worked for, including fast food. The management is ridiculous, there are assistant managers who act like the cool kids in high school and it’s rather disappointing. The hardest workers get work loads dropped on them and are constantly harassed. While slackers are overlooked. This job is physically and mentally exhausting. I do not recommend if you suffer from behavioral health issues. As a supervisor over the online grocery department, that is by far the worst part of the Walmart franchise. There is no care in the world and it is treated as a second business. If you work only for the money you’ll be alright. However, if you’re looking for a job to advance your experience. Look else where, Walmart is filled with favoritism, neglect and disorganization."
bad,"Management is poor, day shift managers and employees barely do there job correctly. When you come to work it’s the same thing over again. Overnight managers are alright but expect high expectations from everybody. You’ll never be able to finish doing your job because your doing somebody else’s. There location in mineral wells doesn’t know to schedule right, your schedule constantly gets messed up."
bad,"People quit, not replaced. We need help and management doesn't  care.   Use to be a good place to work but has changed drastically the past few years."
bad,Would not recommend any one to get into management for this company. Expectations are way to high. Work life balance is horrible. You never know your schedules. They get changed last minute without notification.
bad,Very unorganized company and managers. Management team expects you to be in 4 places at one time. Often expected to do things not in your job description. Wouldn't Recommend.
bad,"Management had unrealistic expectations. They wanted you to be short handed and make up for the lack of other workers. They were quick to discipline, but not actually work with people on how to improve their work."
bad,"their respect for the individual policy mantra has markedly decreased over the past several years. when i started working there we had some fun and more positive interaction between associates and management,but that away due to poor corporate management."
bad,They require you to work much harder than necessary to meet unrealistic goals and deadlines. The culture they foster is toxic and hostile with favoritism abound.
bad,"Favourtism amongst management and certain employees"
bad,"Worked 4 10 hour days, Mon-Thurs. But couldn't plan anything on your days off, because of their poor hiring practices."
bad,You feel like you work like Volunteer the give you less money for more work and whan you get your paycheck there nothing left for living just for rent
bad,"When your pay is higher by being there for a while, they will find a way to get rid of you so they can hire new person at minimum wage. Profit is their only concern and no longer customer service."
bad,"I absolutely hated working here. If you have an issue with anything you have to bug the managers plenty of times before they help you. Anything you do goes unrecognized, and you can even get punishment for doing the right thing, for example when it’s busy and the manager tells you you’re not allowed to take a lunch, they give you a strike for it. You are definitely not compensated for the amount of times customers yell at you. Working here is just not worth it because you are very irrelevant to the management team."
bad,"Worked for Walmart for 6+ years and it took that long to reach $10/hr. Managers are slave-drivers with gross incompetence as their most common shared trait. The company doesn't care about it's employees unless it's profit-centric to care. I would never recommend working for this company, even if the insurance coverage is the only decent thing about this place."
bad,I like the experience I got from being a part of the Walmart team and running the cash register.  I gained valuable work place skills at the cash register and met lots of sweet crew members.
bad,"Management has always been awful since day one. I only had two to three managers I enjoyed working with. They don’t praise hard work, they just give the best workers more to do and let the lazy ones slack off with no repercussion. They always took people from out of store for open positions in which a current, more qualified employee could’ve advanced to. They also did not let overnight associates switch to a day time position to possibly further their career in the store, but let day time associates switch around left and right. This in turn left a lot of employees the only option but to leave for a better paying job all together. They threw people out if they weren’t a good positional fit in which they could have tried moving them around to find a good fit. No action was ever taken when someone was told of a thief in the store, and my last manager left the building multiple times a night to smoke cigarettes, which breached company policy of the 2 mandatory 15 minute breaks, and the hour unpaid lunch break. They’re supposed to be setting an example"
bad,Not a good company to work for! To much favoritism and the store managers are more worried about there yearly bonus then they are about the employees!
bad,Management did not do to great. Still working here and only being here for a short amount of time i have had so many problems with the management teams.
bad,For the stess we do not get paid enough walmart only care about the customers and dont care about there employees its very stressful you get wrote up for anything and you work hard for the company
bad,Look for ways get rid of you make you do others jobs on top of yours when we are all there same reason work instead letting go lazy ones wont work look get rid good ones work managers poor management save lazy ones
bad,"This job is a joke.. unless you are 19 or older you only make 390 of that every 2 weeks.. with rent car payments and a newborn baby not even close to enough of what I need to be making especially outside in the heat/cold/rain, non stop disrespect of management and employees"
bad,"Working at Walmart is good for a student or people living with multiple people, for a family surviving is not enough. You do not have an opportunity to grow if you have any degree."
bad,Working at Walmart was good for the experience but wasn't good working there. The mangers are unprofessional and nothing there is confidential. They do not take harassment serious !!
bad,Mangers lie to higher ups about you and the higher ups false claim that you shoplifted. Noting but a joke Walmart is. Do not recommend Walmart for job.
bad,"It’s was hard working the grave yard shift, but walking around stocking and helping customers find what they need, made the night go by easier. Overall it was a good experience."
bad,"Started off feeling like I won the lottery. After running Dallas area Fri-Tues in sleeper cab for 3 months.. I was at my limit in stress. Dallas Traffic and not getting dispatched on long loads took a toll. My beard 🧔 went whiter in a few months. So many good drivers & Shop Techs either got fired or quit and went to work elsewhere over the politics, micro management and constant back stabbing frommainly co-workers and managers. I’m currently applying for a variety of local jobs. I’m sick of this place. Ready to be home again. Money isn’t everything. Im a current employee. I’m not bitter. I’m just a realist. They’ lost 4  drivers this year to cancer. This job ages you quick . Its easy but stressful day in day out. Constantly tip toeing trying not to get shiiit canned over any thing they can pin on you.  If you have a family, don’t leave them to live in a truck.  This job is for loners that hang out at truck stops drinking coffee and talking to strangers as entertainment."
bad,Poor management will cause anyone to become drained and fed up with the daunting tasks they ask you to perform along with the constant  run around when looking for a promotion. Also they have and show favortism to those that they like and will do things against policy for those they actually like so if you actually go there to work thinking thatll put you in a good place it wont because the lazy workers catch most of the breaks
bad,"A typical day: get yelled at to accomplish impossible tasks, on break for  5 minutes get yelled at I've been on break too long and you try to object they say they saw you go on break."
bad,working there has made me really dislike the people shopping there as customers are very rude and management allows them to walk all over us like we don't matter and are not paid as we should be
bad,Horrible need better higer management. Does not give proper evaluations. Grade employees by their feelings instead or performance ect. This is a neighborhood market . can not tell you about the super centers. I pray they are much better on higher management.
bad,"liked it at first but no one sticks up for u, your 2 days in running the floor by yourself getting complaints ordering for the store and no one approves the orders making u redo the whole store again tomorrow ect. terrible place to be for 8 straight hours"
bad,"Got hurt,  had to fight for workers comp, because I was considered safety support worker. Eventually both the LP management and supervisor was walked out the door. Took home office over 4 year's to do it. You're just a number."
bad,Management is not professional. Hours and days are never set so you will work mornings one day and nights the next. You work all weekends and holidays so you have no family life.
bad,"Typical day working at Walmart:  Management rude, dishonest, bullies, not organized, don't know what they are doing, miserable, and last but not least a trained monkey could do better."
bad,Management talk to you like you are a child really crazy.human resource was very unprofessional this was at the location I worked at.I was never a yes person. I left and never looked backed.
bad,"When working there it was my second job, I thought it was good, and didn't realize until i left how badly i was treated. Poor hours, supervisors who would get angry easily and pushy, forced to stay out in lawn and garden in over 100 degree weather because they didnt want to find anyone to give me a break. There was many reasons that i left but in the end I said i was leaving so i could focus on my degree and my health."
bad,"outside of the pay scale as far as management is concerned the job is stressful, the turn over is high due to favoritism on the market level which trickles down to store level. My experience within my market is they do not promote based on if you can do the job, they promote based off a buddy system (who you know and who your brown nosing to). Every new managers approach (that I have witnessed) is to fire a lot of associates and slowly replace the abandoned shifts. I left because my position was being eliminated and I found a better opportunity. The company itself is not bad, but my time in that market has been anything but success it just paid the bills."
bad,Realmente paga bn pero no tienes casi hora y cuando trabajas es mucha la presión yo no la recomiendo
bad,Very disorganized and managers were not trained correctly. No real communication between managers and employees. Employees were never satisfied with there schedule because their is no communication between managers and employees.
bad,"Pay the minimum, no raise for all the I know and I help with, lack of opportunities for hard working people. cow workers are amazing but management is bad"
bad,"I worked for Walmart for almost 2 months on CAP 2. I had been there 2 weeks and I knew it wasn’t for me. They yell at you over everything, even if they have nothing to yell at you over they will find something. Not only were the supervisors on you constantly, but my coworkers were constantly at each other’s throats. It was the most toxic work environment I’ve even been in, and I worked in childcare (with all women)for 5 years! Even when I addresses my concerns with management they shrugged it off and made me feel like it was just me. But all of the people I worked with cited the same issues, they just wouldn’t go to management about it, probably because they knew management didn’t care."
bad,"Customer service, the issue is Occurrences, if you miss more than 3-4 days during your probation which is now 6 months and not 90 days they will fire you, it’s a system not the actual store!"
bad,The management had their favorites and the others were put down and yelled out. They gave them the easy stuff while making the rest deal with all the messes.
bad,"the work place was toxic and the schedule was complete trash, only worked here in highschool, was underpaid as my position had lots of responsibilities"
bad,In the beginning my experience working with Walmart was good. Going to work actual made me happy. Time changes and people changes too the management team has absolutely no respect for their workers
bad,Walmart is a good old boys club. You may follow the rules  and guide lines but if you are not in the good old boys club you  are not heard  at all.  Mangers sleep with employee and its against the rule. You turn them in his house allow them to fire you.
bad,"DSD is treated as human garbage cans/Mgmt scapegoats. Mgrs will throw the people under the bus to satisfy the market mgrs. ""Agghh howzitgoin? Yagood?"""
bad,"The CSM, were not fair in cutting down the lines on busy days nor step out of their zone to help us out, all cashiers.. We as cashiers didn't have a say when we needed to go to the bathroom, we had to wait until it was a late break or no break and etc.."
bad,"Probably the worst job in Walmart has to be Cap 2. The pay is not worth the stress. Management treats you like garbage. "
bad,I was a high school student having to work overnight to support my family. The management was there to get the job done but never wanted to listen to some situations to help us. And would sometimes get mad if they had to help.
bad,precisa melhoorar muito ainda pra ser considerada uma das melhores do brasil no meu ponto de vista
bad,I will admit at first working at Wal-Mart was a fun and at times rewarding but over time the job just somehow got worse and didn't seem like it was getting better.
bad,Good pay but terrible management and working full time for part time pay. There is nothing else I have to say about Walmart. It was fast paced for me but every store is different.
bad,"They continue to pile more and more on you, the berate you on every little thing you did wrong the day before. No one is happy, no one even notices you until something becomes messed up and your their scape goat. There's a few decent managers but most of them just talk down to you. It's not worth the heartache and mental anguish of working here."
bad,"Management is lacking, turnover was large. No respect for hardworking employees but respect for those who play and don't work. People working for 9 years make less than new hires. They expect you to stay over and left me by myself for 4 months on several times while telling me that I couldn't reduce the amount of orders that I had to do, while complaining about my work."
bad,"It is okay working there.   People are okay.  Okay working with them.  I just recently had a new boss and she is not that great.  I like my old boss much better, much nicer, and allows overtime."
bad,"Long hours with no breaks, checkout manager rude, vile, insulting , cant get holidays booked."
bad,"It was lots of working there; the pay was good and the fellow assosiets were very freindly. The only downside to it, is that  if you need help regarding a schedule change or adjustment the managers wait weeks before listening. The managers and people higher up are also very rude."
bad,"Walmart offers great benefits, but management is poor, and the job is extremely stressful. Hours get cut after bonuses are given. Managers are unprofessional. Not worth making yourself ill."
bad,"Even their Ad is full of lies.  They don't hire you to retire you.  They'll, over time force you out with more policy changes and micro managerial BS."
bad,"Walmart is tops for hiring all cultures,  genders,  disabilities, age and races.  They are to be commended for this.  Treatment of employees by management and ridiculous and insulting pay raises are a negative.  Management is consistently bad at most stores."
bad,"I started as a fitting room attendant and moved up to customer service manager in less than a year. Walmart then created a job one step above, a head csm of you will. They pride themselves on promoting from within. I internally applied for job and passed all assessments. At this point Walmart is required to interview for position. The new store manager informed me that he did not think I was qualified for position and refused to conduct the interview. I left"
bad,Was a great salary and awesome benefits. The temperature is extremely hot and water coolers with bottled water are everywhere. The pay is good. There is a lot of drama which i did my best to avoid. If you run into drama speaking with management doesn't help. A large amount of operation managers were fired or demoted. Everyone is always in fear of loosing their job.
bad,"Walmart is a place that does not care for their workers."
bad,"Turn over was always high, and Corporate is too cheap to supply the stores with enough equipment, so you often had to share with people. This is assuming you could find said equipment, because people constantly hid them. And then they malfuctioned/stopped working daily.  "
bad,They under paid the area that are over worked. Management are lazy and don't help with anything. All Walmarts are the same just a different location. They want you to stay over you schedule shift to help people do their jobs when that person is slacking.
bad,"The managers at Dekalb/Sycamore IL Walmart were unorganized one manager would tell me to do something other managers would be rude and unprofessional with me. The training was awful it is either you sink or swim. The store manager would not do anything about conflicts he would just step aside and ""say that is between you and that manager. I'm not getting involved. The workload was ridiculous."
bad,"Make yourself comfortable, because this is going to be a long review. I want everybody to know what working at a Walmart DC is like. I know it won't change anything, but if I can convince even a single person not to apply here, it'll be worth it."
bad,Your only a pawn to them  if your not starting out in manager positions very little room for advancement. They only care about their share holders. Worst management period.
bad,Walmart is really not a good company to work for they don't treat the employees right and you don't have job security. Management is not good some are but most are NOT!  You get 5 call offs they don't take Doctor notes!
bad,They change all the job role names delete certain positions and their policy is to interview 3 people that fall into what they call a rec. But they never even interviewed anyone in the rec and gave the job tovsomeone that knows nothing about the area to be worked in.
bad,Retaliation against employees. The higher management does nothing .its who likes who. If they want u out they will find any reason to get u out. No work life balance
bad,The management lives in a constant world of fear of you show skills that they do not have they go out of their way to get rid of you. They do not give you the awards you are due. They hold off on your annual raise to slide them in on something else so that you don't get it at all. They follow rules as they see fit when they choose. They pretend to care about families but truly don't.
bad,"Very bad!  Poor store managment, poor training, and stressful. Would not recommend to anyone to work there, as soon as you walk in the store you can feel the tension."
bad,"I have worked at walmart for three years, management is awful, and they will screw you over any way possible, watched my friend get fired for being in the hospital, (he was sent by management)  coincidentally it was 2 months after the fact on his last day before transferring stores. They dont care about their employees thoughts, or well being, if it doesnt benefit them, "
bad,Helping customers is a sense of proud for me. The management are amazing at problem solving so you do not feel overwhelmed. I learned so much in such a short time. they really treat you like a family(customers/members.)
bad,I was hired in as a department manager in an area I have not worked before. My supervisor was on leave when I started working. I was given no training from upper management and told not to listen to the  hourly employees in my department for advice on how to complete everyday tasks. I was not allowed to complete my everyday tasks in the manner that I tried. The store manager constantly changed my daily plans for my area and then would ask why I hadn't completed the work I had tried to do before her change of direction. I worried about getting in trouble for not completing tasks when I did not have enough employees in my area to help complete daily tasks as well as help customers. Overall I was given too much work for 1 person to complete and constantly got in trouble by different assistant managers for different things that I had not been trained to do.
bad,"Like any job, it's different everywhere my walmart was terrible the store manager did not do his job, scheduling was terrible we were understaffed and over worked as a cashier i had to push carts, and stock shelves. I do not care about that so much, its when I stated my dad has cancer and sometimes work would not be priority. A day my dad wasn't doing well and i called out they said I'd still get a point. It was the last straw on my already declining faith in that store"
bad,They dont work with you when you have family emergency co manager to you and dont care not sure what else to say but that they were horrible at doing anything with you an understanding anything that was going on unless it was their way
bad,"If you want to work at a place where you feel your job is on the line everyday this is the place for you. The management is horrible, they make up policies as needed and write you up for breaking a policy, but they will not tell you what policy you violated."
bad,"unless you have no other choice. id advice skipping the toxicity that is, walmart jobs. Managers will treat you like trash and expect you to meet impossible goals."
bad,If they don't wont you there they will get u out of there and they pick side and back stable they are not right and bad management and they let people go that been there 15 years and people that dictation to them they are ungrateful
bad,If management is lazy be ready to look for another job. If u get stressed as u work hard and still get no recognition just get another job. It's just not worth it. Really.
bad,"Don't work here unless you want to do everything minus your actual job code. Management is a joke, certain female managers will attack/harass/breathe down your neck everyday and if you try to complain to a higher manager they all just cover for them and sweep the whole issue under the rug. Managers also have their favorites, but what more can you expect from Walmart. Supposedly an academy store but nothing in the store is even done correctly. Nothing EVER changes in this store and it's getting worse, leave while you can because they will toss you around like a rag doll and stomp all over you. The only good thing about the job was the health/dental/vision benefits, and weekends off."
bad,The best part of the job is being able to help customers. The hardest part is trying to satisfy a customer's needs as much as you can. For my job i learned how to take care of customer's and how to do my job.
bad,"I worked here for a couple years, hourly and moved into salary. This is the worst company to work for. I will spare the details but to say the least, don’t take medical leave, don’t move up in the company, don’t draw attention to yourself."
bad,"This place drains your very life out of you because there is no communication, no respect, no opportunity to advance yourself unless you are wrapped around an assistant manager or the store manager. It's very difficult to feel motivated to go into work every single day when the company doesn't care about the associate but only about the profits it makes.  Its a terrible feeling that no person should ever have to experience. The worst part about it is, you give it your all every single day, 110% and we have nothing to show for it."
bad,"Well said as simple as possible the right hand of management has no idea what the left hand is doing, one manager will say this is how it's done then minutes later another will tell you different."
bad,The worst part about working for Wal-Mart is the management team. They do not communicate w other members of management including the store manager.  Management does not know how to talk to associates respectfully and expect you and other associates to do other associates jobs when they don't feel like working. Wal-Mart is supposed to be family oriented and they are not at all. They only
bad,Rude and careless management. Too many bosses telling you what to do at one time. Not enough employees to keep up with customer demands. Not hard work just stressful at times.
bad,"Management doesn't train anyone, that is left to their computer programs. It's success is based on sink or swim philosophy. Management only helps themselves. Rarely does management know policy or law. No real job description."
bad,"There are four kinds of jobs in a Walmart store. Part time employees, pretty much cashiers or cart pushers, work minimum wage and, while they can limit their availability to suit their lifestyle, will have their hours significantly reduced if they do not have open availability. If your availability is open, do not expect a consistent schedule, or to be able to reliably make plans in advance. Full time employees tend to work reasonably consistent shifts and are part of a team, whether it's the sales floor of a particular side of the store, the first stocker shift (5am-2), second shift unloaders/stockers (3pm-12), or the overnight stocking shift (10pm-7). They still work minimum, as a general rule, though they can expect quarterly bonus payouts if they have perfect attendance and the store significantly beats its sales from last year's same quarter and has good customer survey results (up to an unlikely peak of $900, I think. Under $100 is common). Supervisors, like department managers or customer service managers, have an above minimum slot on the payscale and pretty consistent hours (broken weekends still common, though some can consistently work Mon-Fri). Salaried members of management work significantly more hours (50-60ish weekly, easily more during crunch or for Co or Store Managers) and start at about $40k, I believe. All full time employees have to deal with increasing pressures about how quickly they get work done the higher they go."
bad,"Walmart starts off talking about great benefits and good work hours but they change your schedule with out notifying you, you dont get insurance for up to 2 years. And they pick and choose who they help and who they send out to do things alone."
bad,At my story we barley get praise from our store manager. Products must hit the floor when they say so or there will be a problem. Managers are not open to suggestions or your say.
bad,"Walmart is not a good company to work for. I really hate this company as a whole. They have very poor management. Run, this is not the place for you to work."
bad,"Managers were rude and disrespectful to associates! One manager name GREG would follow employees around the store spying on them ,hiding behind things being really unprofessional!!"
bad,They treat everyone like garbage and the pay is very little for the amount of work that you do honestly is a good part time job but wouldn’t recommend long term
bad,"Not a good place to work, they do not care about there employees at all. Rge environment was bad. They did not cut the air on. They were not responsive and did not care about your needs, because there was someone always willing to work for Walmart. Everyone was replaceable!!"
bad,"the head csm was rude and undermining. I also believe there was a real pregidice towards minorities.... customers are very rude and demanding... ""it's your job"" was said in a degrating manner."
bad,Management is unorganized and badly treats their employees. Management barely gives time off even though I work hours on end. Management isn't considerate of their employees time or efforts.
bad,I would never recommend this job to anyom. Walmart works you to the point of you are physically and emotionally drained. They only care about profits not the actual employeea.
bad,They don’t care about none of their employees. Management team sucks. They will find any little thing to fire you for. Then their are very slick racist.
bad,"Good job as a first job or as a supplemental income.  Don't go to management with any problems because it doesn't get addressed.  Bad workers get promoted, good workers get dismissed or let go."
bad,"No longer work there after almost 15 years. I was just shy of my 15 year anniversary when I was told I had complaints so I was terminated. I knew there were a couple because customers are hard to please but most everyone has some. They were making changes and I think they wanted me out of my position, and I couldn't work anywhere else in the store due to accommodation."
bad,Change your schedule too much and they say they're all about family no they're not they changed too much things there that are not good and they mess with people schedules and they cut hours.
bad,"I got terminated for no call no show after I had already called and talked to a manager and they never fix the no call no show other they said they would My job was to get cart's and make  sure that they was in the build some Time it would be hot and cool  would still have them all in and would take breaks and they would not want me to take the breaks I earned would some times send people to look for me when I was doing my job at all  high level"
bad,"Managers do not push anyone to do anything. if you are a good worker and feel like you deserve better than doing everyone else’s work for minimum wage, do not work for Walmart, they do not appreciate hard workers. If you are a slacker than go for it I guess. Easy money for doing nothing while hard workers pick it up for you."
bad,"Company was great when I first started but then it took a huge turn for the worst. Benefits went down, sick time when downhill, pay was never great even for managers, and they treat associates like dogs and not human beings. Never have I ever worked for a company that doesnt appreciate their employees and take their bonuses away. I've been a manager of a huge store and I've had only 2 or 3 employees to help me run the store at night, but I still get told I'm not doing my job."
bad,This job is stressful when it shouldn't be. Management expects you to do more work than you can handle without the necessary equipment to do the job. I do not recommend working here.
bad,"The work environment is just to toxic management didn’t care about the associates they were always creating problems and singling people out. The management was just to immature for there positions,"
bad,Do not waste your time working here. They do not pay enough for the job that you do. Long endless hours and days. It’s not worth it. Bad store management and treated like dirt with no respect
bad,"Walmart is a horrible company, they treat their employees like dirt, I don't recommend people working there it is just the worse i am so happy to finally be out of there. The hours were also horrible. They take advantage it was really bad."
bad,"I worked at the Oroville,CA Walmart. Didnt take long to see the high school like cliques the assistant managers had formed. Worked great in my favor honestly. After a year and a half I was blamed for all kinds of stolen merchandise.  No proof of ANYTHING at all just that it was me. No charges no fines just was blamed lol."
bad,"Poor management, doesnt care about employees. Retaliation on employees is a huge issue. Unfairly large workload on select associates.high stress & biohazards. Accrue vacation, sick time, and pto, BUT you get punished for using them."
bad,Did they change the rules and regulations like they change underwear you are not valued as a Walmart associate they will let you know you are easily to be replaced the managers keep up more mess than anybody the associates get along wonderfully
bad,"Senior Dirctor>Dirctors>Senior manage>Managers>engineer"
bad,"Walmart gives the impression to the public as a great place to work at but as you become part of the organization you notice experience the true Walmart values the internal ones the ones that not many people get to see.  If you ever wonder Walmart associates look and behave so poorly, it’s because of the treatment and things they are subjected to."
bad,"After patiently waiting for 8 weeks to be moved to a different department, the store manager promoted my husband to my department manager. After telling management I felt uncomfortable about it, they still refused to move me to a different department."
bad,They expect blood and not enough staffing to do the work that they would like done. You must get your work done and then the team meeting gives another set of tasks straight from the manager. That must be done daily or get written up
bad,My hours changed every week. Some weeks it was 40+ some weeks i was only scheduled 1 shift. Some managment staff was good and some of the management staff was rude and could be rather condicending. Stick to yourself as well.
bad,"will cut your hours if they want you gone, will fire at will, will make up things and have co-workers write up statements behind your back.  the place is a joke. don't waste too long here and ruin your career b/c sooner or later they will get rid of you."
bad,I was there for over 10 years. Had to have a knee surgery and got in a bad car wreck so I couldn't return to my full time job. But doctor said I could sit because I can't stand or walk for too long but I was told there was nowhere in the store I could go. Then they terminated me. I did love my job.
bad,Walmart will fire you for any little thing so don’t make any mistakes and the managers will show favoritism. A bunch of foolishness goes on daily. There is way too much work and not enough workers hours suck only a hand few are full time.
bad,Walmart used to be the best place to work. Great pay great benefits great management but now it’s all about the company. They cut sick days from 9 to 5 as if you or your kids can’t be sick for multiple days. They want you to work over To get the work done then cut your overtime at the end of the week. Your hours are cut if your availability is not open and last but not least your bonus reflects on attendance instead of woperformance like it used to be.
bad,"Diretores de unidade e regionais sem preparo para o cargo. Mau educados, grosseiros sem qualquer respeito pela base."
bad,"Assistant Managers follow direction from the Store Manager and thus that is where the disconnect is.  Store Manager must meet certain criteria for the month and will fire people without considering that no one is perfect.  Overnight is a skeleton crew which puts more of a burden on the day shift which is also a skeleton crew.  "
bad,"We all probably have heard more than our fair share of bad things about Walmart. I mean, it's the corporate incarnate of evil, right? Well, that's not ENTIRELY true. During my time at Walmart, I rapidly advanced to the department manager position, and was recognized quickly for my aptitudes and skill sets. Were I at a different location, I'd probably have had a wholly different experience."
bad,Hope they better than walmart...its so stressful but I'm n need of a job..I would love to go into another field to see how it is in a warehouse or driving
bad,"•	Handling money"
bad,Don’t trust it.  This is the worst place to work they have a no retaliation policy but they love to retaliate. Management does not follow One Best Way and they have a lot of favoritism that goes on..
bad,"When I started working there it was great. Pay sucked, but they worked with my school shedule. I did have to call corporate because management continusd harrassing e about parking in the handicap spot. As time went by and management changed it was awful working there."
bad,"While I have been there a long time, I would not recommend working for the retail giant. In a culture of dying brick and mortar, Walmart s currently throwing every idea at the wall to stay relevant while leaving the consideration of the associate in the dust. Constantly cutting hours and benefits while lacking compassion for every needs."
bad,"Good benefits, thats it. Everything else is not worth what management put you through. You’re expected to go above and beyond for pay that cant get you a one room apartment in the slums. You constantly get your job threatened. Management is very snake-y and not trustworthy. Do NOT recommend this company."
bad,"Wal-Mart is the absolute worst to work for. The mgrs only care about themselves. They run you to death never enough staff. You go on vacation then get blamed for what happened while you were gone. The store is a joke. I worked there 7 years, and when i left i never looked back."
bad,"The pay sucks, management sucks. Only the people you work with are cool and theyll agree. It's like being a slave. Management is disrespectful, and if they don't like you, you'll never move up. Worst place I've ever worked at."
bad,All I wanted was pt and always had to remind them if that.  Worked like a mule for 3 years in soft line and only missed half of one shift because of the flu.  Was told I would still get a whole point.  Went into loss prevention and wound up doing my job as well as cart pusher and janitor.  They also saw the video where an assoc tried to put his hands in my face and did nothing.  Seems he will get 1 point.
bad,"Lack of communication; micromanaged down to the exact second you clock in, take your breaks and lunch and when you clock out. I lucked out with a fabulous manager. Most are not qualified to be a manager."
bad,"yes, 11 an hour isnt bad, but the conditions we are placed under i would say otherwise. Not only we have no air in the front so we are all under heat stroke and nausea and none of the managers care. On top of they dont care if you have medical issues, you call out because you are puking or sick they dont care you will get written up and you only have 5 in a 6month period. Im a diabetic and have a low immune system so i get ill easily and ive had so many days ive been ill and not able to drive and they just remind me how i dont have any days left to take off and they will fire me. I Hate It. They shouldnt fire you over health-related issues period."
bad,"When I first started I worked as a cashier making $7.25/ hr. at the age of 16. I'm very glad they raised the wage at least."
bad,Unless you have the best Market manager in the world DO NOT work for the monsters at WM. Your soul will be ducked dry then they will discard you like a used condom after they destroyed your body
bad,"Horrible management,work you in the ground,and don’t care about their employees. Lack of care for employees family. All about production with no regard on the outcome"
bad,Toxic work  environment  Stress unexpected expectations hard work they push you till your  exhausting  Manager s didn’t get breaks busted are buts for nothing
bad,I’ve worked for Walmart for about 5 years and my friend who has worked for 21 years at Walmart makes just a little more than I do. New hires make the same as I do and there is no job security. Walmart as a corporation keeps making jobs and hiring people then getting rid of those jobs and leaving the workers wondering what job is going away next. The work itself isn’t bad but the drama and not knowing if you will have a job next week is too much for many of the people who work there.
bad,I would not recommend my position to anyone. Management is very easy to work with. Very strict. Management plays favorites with hourly associates. I would never wish my position to anyone
bad,After the Sam's club that I worked at got shut down and I had to move to Walmart it was the worst decision I ever made. I wish I considered a different career after leaving Sam's club.
bad,Pays real good but pay not worth it. Management sucks completely. Just go there to work your 15 week learning curve while looking for a new job. Ypu wont stay there long. Most people don't make it out of their curve before they quit.
bad,"The Walmart on Ireland road is pretty bad with communications between managers. Once you’ve been hired into a position it is very difficult to be moved to a different position. I tried for over a year  and always got a “okay great we can do that!” But they never followed through. The scheduling is very odd, and there would only be 2 or 3 cashiers normally. There was multiple times I couldn’t get my lunch  two hours before I was scheduled to leave on an eight hour shift"
bad,Walmart is nothing but stress. The management team treats you like you are nothing. Your hours aren’t we’re they are supposed to be if you are full time.
bad,If you work and do your job they treat you as awful as they can.  If you are young and could care less you will be promoted and put in some sort of mangment position.
bad,"I have never worked for a place where being part of the the click makes all of the differnce. I have seen people get written up for a mistake were the company actually made money and another work make a mistake that costs the company over $8,000,000.00 and that per son got promoted, best friends with the director of the area. I once had a manager that was a Devil Worshiper who treated people more fairly than the management team that I worked under treated their people."
bad,Very poor management right now!!! I got terminated because I was fighting a coaching I never should of gotten.  I open doored it and never heard anything back so I brought it up again and the next thing I know Im pointed out.
bad,"Walmart does not take care of the people that made them good. I and many others loved our jobs until they proved that they do not care, so we don't care anymore. Local management is way better than market level and up."
bad,el ambiente laboral es un primer momento es muy bueno posteriormente dejas de tener el puesto al cual t contrataron y te vuelves ayudante general
bad,Not a friendly place to work! Co-workers are GREAT! But managers are mean and half of them don't know or can't handle the stress! Alot of work has to be done and shifts blame each other when something isn't accomplished.
bad,"Not a good place to work at, it was a hostile working environment. I don't believe all stores are the same but their should've been more of an effort to tread people with dignity and respect."
bad,"Store 302 Murphysboro, Illinois itself and most employees were wonderdful, however the store manager is an over obsessive arrogant, rude, disrespectful pompous azz human that tries to intimidate and bully her employees. ."
bad,i will never work there agian the mangers suck they yell all the sometimes dont take you to the er when you get hurt at work and you get in trouble for almost any thing you do.
bad,"Your salaried management team will make or break your experience here, especially if you're hourly management. I used to have an amazing Co-manager and Assistant (friendly, willing to listen to your ideas, etc) they both were promoted and their replacements are the complete opposite of what I became accustomed to."
bad,"Poor management; lack of communication or recognition and very stressful work environment. Very cliquish environment. You have only 4 absences before termination, no doctor's excuses. Length of service doesn't matter. The bright spot would be some of your co-workers."
bad,Management constantly threatens you about your job. It's a fast paced environment and they don't even want you to talk at all it's like being in Elementary school.
bad,"So the store I worked at in Cypress, Tx was awesome and I was treated fairly and the culture in that store was much more positive and friendly  and you really felt like you are a part of a team. However, unfortunately I had to move for educational reasons and I transferred to a store in Corpus Christi. Absolutely the worst market I have ever seen and experienced. The management got on to all the hourly on every little thing, looking for an excuse to fire or write someone up. Many of my cashiers, door greeters, and cart-pusher are awesome but management could give two cents less about them. Cart pushers were left to push by hand as management refused to replace their cart mule as they pushed in the Texas heat. Also scheduling was terrible at that store as you could close till 11pm and open the next day at 7am. Management like to belittle and shame workers, always stating the negatives of a employee. "
bad,"A stressful environment with managers breathing down your neck for results on a daily basis. Reviews would strongly factor how many Walmart Mastercards were sold by an individual, rather than customer feedback or efficiency. This meant that many cashiers would slow down and try to act all chummy with customers, which slowed down everything. Have you ever been in a long line, but it seems like a slow day? That would be why. I am fairly certain that Walmart is where the term ""$99 suit managers"" started. They have a habit of going on power trips where they will denigrate their underlings or take out their stress on them. Management feels more like a gang of wardens patrolling a prison yard than the store leaders interacting with their employees and customers. That leads to the customers. Most are perfectly fine, if a bit impatient, especially with high school students who are operating cash registers from the late-80s. Some customers, however, are an absolute nightmare. The number of times they would try to return something that we didn't even carry was insane. Since the customer was always right, we'd frequently be instructed by management to avoid conflict by simply bowing to any and all customer demands, rendering the returns policy utterly pointless. This often led to a feeling of uselessness and frustration with the managers and the company as a whole."
bad,"I’ve been working at Walmart for about a year and a half now. Since I started, management has changed (like most places management changes) but they hired incompetent, rude, stuck up managers who will harass you and make you feel like they appreciate the work you do, not you as a person. Thought about calling HR but was told by the co-manager that I shouldn’t call them because they won’t do anything and then she laughed at me and called me stupid. Not a good place to work. The environment is toxic even if you keep your head down and stay out of drama, you’ll be brought into the drama whether you participate or not. Attendance policy is terrible. I was forced to work with strep throat because they don’t accept doctors notes and won’t let you go home, lest you get an occurrence and on your way to getting fired. Also not a good place to work if you are disabled, have kids or another job or a life in general. Good luck if you do apply and decide to work for Walmart though!"
bad,My managers were very nasty and direspectfull. You were supposed to be full time but when it came time for there annual bonuses they would cut your hour for there selfs.
bad,"I have been with Walmart for almost 12 years, it's worse than ever.Very few team players, I'm starting to think it's all about a dollar.The store pretty much runs it's self.I set a goal for myself,try to stay at a company long as I can. I am looking for a new job."
bad,"The place has bad manangement. No weekends off.Hours are cut when u least expect it.If you don't desire to be made a spectacle.Don""t work for Walmart Neighborhood Market."
bad,I had bad experiences with my coworkers and also with customers. Working at walmart can be very stressful. Managers wold put girls to lift up the heavy water cases with no back support belt. Safety is not a priority in this store
bad,"Highly toxic environment, poor planning/scheduling, poor management, not typically a safe place to work, and management picked their favorites and purposely singled out others and made it hard for people to do their jobs."
bad,Horrible unstable management causes high turn over. A few good co workers. Steady fast paced. Good hours for overnight. Breaks and lunches are good also.
bad,Constant structure and shifts changing. You never know what you are going to walk into. No one takes responsibility for their departments. I only had one good manager and he was hourly. Any salary management is terrible and lazy.
bad,"When I was hired, I was excited to start. Now I been there for a couple years. I hate it. "
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for almost 2 years, I have Aspergers.  I have had 3 managers. First supervisor had no concerns with me. Second supervisor much different- harassed me for months-I went to senior management/HR. Supervisor was asked to take Sensitivity training and was moved out of the area.  My new supervisor again did not have concerns with my performance.  Recently other problem supervisor moved back. I have not been overtly tormented, but have gone from working 30-40 hours a week to 8 hours a week. Tell me there is no discrimination??  She does scheduling.  "
bad,"the first year I was there, they would have excelled with a 5 star rating. However, they greatly started declining and we lost some of our best employees and the policies just got worse. The company just keeps going downhill."
bad,Wal-Mart does not promote growth or career advancement. The store manager is unprofessional and a bully. CSM lack the ability to provide neccessary support to personnel on a professional basis. I would not recommend friends or family to work at Wal-Mart.
bad,"Not much to say really from what I have heard I'm the only one who has had such a poor experience working there. I did the typical of clocking in on time and then checking out on time mostly, some nights I didn't get a chance to clock out till a full hour later. Hardest part of the job was holding back as to not punch some of the more rude customers and mostly the ineptitude of the management or some of the more cockier coworkers. Most enjoyable part of my time there was getting my paycheck and being able to leave (since I got my check on my day off)."
bad,Walmart is a great company when it comes too pay and benefits but the amount of stress that comes with it Isnt worth it once you are at the department manager level or higher. Management will most likely not know what they are doing which will make you job harder and training is not a thing there either so be ready too get thrown in and forgotten about.
bad,When fell off top stock ladder received very little support from management and from Human Resources they where horrible while I received workers compensation they tried to get me to do more then the doctor authorized it was a horrible experience.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a little over two years and I absolutely hated it. Management think they know everything. Walmart management always favors the customer over the  employee making the employee look like the victim. We were an Academy Store by the way. I hate the saying "" the customer is always right"" because customers now a days abuse it and take advantage of it, and management and customers threaten to call HQ but HQ doesn't care. At night its even worse especially on the weekends with no registers open and management standing around not helping us. Also Walmart does their schedules a month in advance so requesting personal time off is next to impossible. new hires get 4 points after the points you get fired. 6 months to a year the employees get 8 points. calling out is awful cuz Walmart can't do basic critical thinking when scheduling anybody in the store. We are always short staffed no matter what. customers are extremely abusive and you get coachings after many customer complaints which was the reason I quit. Overall if I had to rate this company I would give it a solid F. Its an awful place to work and avoid it at all costs necessary."
bad,"Management treats everyone poorly, 99% of people there hate their job, offered vacation and sick days but we’re very rarely approved, mandatory worked holidays (Christmas Day closed)"
bad,If you don't have a life and just love to work then this is the job for you but if you do have a life and a family just think about it before you apply
bad,"Typical day at work was cleaning bathrooms, sweeping the store, cleaning floors with a scrubber, pushing in carts from outside, and helping customers if needed. Didn't really learn much except how to run the scrubber and other cleaning supplies, management is absolutely awful. Some of them have decent personalities but overall, when it comes to business, they do not care to push that to the side. They have unclear policies, and will fire people for things that they didn't know was wrong to do. Workplace was nice and laid back for the most part as long as you did your job. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and fellow coworkers. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with people I enjoyed being around."
bad,After 16 years you are fired for Performance issues this is a little bit big.  But the other 14 years were fine without any problem whatsoever.  Sad!!
bad,Job is moderate hard long hours bad manegement bad advenment rate but u can irk out a living with the decebt pay if u really need a job walmarts ur best bet
bad,There were to many managers and my  supervisor  knew nothing and relied on an associate to direct her.
bad,"A empresa paga o que promete e nunca atrasa o salário, mas não valoriza o seu funcionário e é uma empresa que não indico para ninguém!"
bad,Never enough time to do what needs doing but overtime wasnt allowed/ discouraged. Definitely cried when I finally quit out of relief. Coworkers were kind but supervisors and managers made me cry multiple times.
bad,"went on vacation came and everything changed for the worst.my job was to bring money to the cashiers, we did over rides for the cashiers when they made mistakes. made sure the cashiers got breaks and lunches on time . made sure customers never stood in line for a long time."
bad,Just don't waste your time. They start you off at $11 but your yearly raises are 2% of what you make so itll basically take you 5 years to go up a dollar. Management is just pathetic...there's a lot to say but just don't waste your time.
bad,Only good this is the pay if you’re in management otherwise you don’t make much money for the amount of work you’ll do. No one cares about anybody and always understaffed
bad,I would not suggest this company for anyone with small kids.  The attendance policy is extremely difficult for people who experience emergencies.Its a no go!!!!
bad,"Very greedy, they don't even give out water for the people working outside in the hot sun of Bakersfield, so outside workers have to either buy their own drinks from walmart or go in and get a drink from the nasty water fountain that is barely washed."
bad,"The pay is good. But I started out at my max availability (25 hours/week), I opened up my availability and now I’m lucky to get 1 shift a week while all the new hire teenagers are getting 3-4 times my hours. My managers gave me the highest score they’ll give on an evaluation. They know I have 2 kids that I have to support 100% on my own. "
bad,Management is great. You do not get a lot of hours working for this company. The pay really sucks. Employees where great to work with.........................................
bad,"Walmart is trying to change to stay Relevant to today’s market. The problem arises when the store management team doesn’t make changes needed to follow these changes. The processes are step before them, the expectations are there, but then they get upset when they’re not meeting them. It’s also a problem when market walks the store  and she goes against the rules set by home office. Then whatever you looked up on the computer and trying to follow is thrown out the door."
bad,"I worked at Walmart after being under paid and over worked as a lead at Clorox. It was a welcome job for the first couple of months. It is difficult working at Walmart because of the managers, understaffing, co-workers, and general disregard for entry level associates. You will get occurances for being a second late clocking in or coming back from break. They will work you to death, if you decide to work there. All managers are know it alls and won't address complaints unless you open door them. They refused to let us go vote unless you mentioned it the day before and got approved but only told us the day of about the new rule. Terrible place to work."
bad,"Decent place 2 work if u like being in 1 job & not moving up. Overworked and underpaid is the walmart theme. Forget getting your issues resolved by management. That's a joke. Walmart doesn't stand by it's employees. They will fire u 4 the least little thing, whether real or perceived. When sam walton was alive it may have been a swell place 2 work but things have changed 4 the worse since he passed away. Not the same walmart at all. 😔😔😔."
bad,Do not waste your time working here. The management is very immature in their operations with unfair favortism.  Raises only when the gov raises wage.
bad,"A good place to work if you like being treated horribly, the only one that seemed to care was my main supervisor. Management will kick you down an make you feel worthless."
bad,For everything that Walmart promises you you should through half of everything they say away. The hours are long and the benefits are few the only thing I can really recommend is if you need Healthcare and didn't care how hard you needed to work for it other than that just stay away from Walmart
bad,"Management is very unprofessional and doesn't appreciate anything you do. They think they can talk to people any kind of way and dont care about anyone but themselves! They dont hire anyone on full time only part time, been there 3 years and is still a part time associate."
bad,It's just like being back in high school. The quibbling and talking behind your back. The yelling and temper tampers. That's the management team. Not all of them but way to many of them. They never get rid of the problem ones. Everyone walks on eggshells. You can't tell anyone that matters because they are the problem. Management backs up each other and really do not care. I believe that they are afraid of what will happen to them if they stand up to the rest of the management team. They can and will replace you.
bad,The management couldn't get there communication down . One assistant would rely on you to do one thing and another assistant would come right behind them and tell you to dosometinh completely different.  But they would both want it done at the same time . Ridiculous.
bad,"Hated it,unorganized, and just how they treated you, they don't care about you or how you feel or anything like that, it was so unfair sometimes to come in there, have to do your job and someone else's as well then management don't care if that happens they want you to get it done and if you don't and if you don't even know how to do it they try to write you up or talk to you like your a dog. Definitely is not a place I would recommend to work."
bad,If your new to the work force Wal-Mart is a good first job that is all. Great 1st timers cash handling experience. Will hire anyone who can pass background check..
bad,"Racism, Sexism, just a bad place to work unless you have no choice. Employees are treated more like slaves than workers! Better off just trying this job as a last resort as i heard from current employees that its getting worse"
bad,"As I stated, Walmart is a great place to work.  It's the managers and supervisors.  When your immediate manager gossip with the supervisor about different associates it becomes a circus."
bad,"There is a lot of favoritism, You have to check your schedule daily, if not you will find that they have changed it and you are supposed to work on a regularly scheduled night off which can lead to a no call no show."
bad,its just no fun do not feel like you on a team everyone for them self  from the market team on down to the store manager our schedules. where done when the week start so you cant plan your life.
bad,"Walmart was a okay job. I worked here for a short time and it got stressful at times, because the one i worked at wasnt operated that will, thats why i left."
bad,It was good until all the changes and if the manager didn’t like you well you had problems they don’t follow the ADA  rules but are sneaky and don’t write it on paper they will find a reason other than your disability I would not recommend them at all and if you get fired within minutes you loose everything medical life 401k etc
bad,The company is full of change and is doing a good job. This company has its pros and cons like any other job. Would tell young people to apply and grow with the company.
bad,"Very poor work environment. Management picks their favorites and treats others very poorly. You go to work to make a living and your immediate supervisors will make your life a living he** without consequence if they do not like you for any reason. The work is not bad at all and if you can stay busy, the work day will pass very quickly, however dealing with very poor, biased and unfair management made this place a nightmare to work at."
bad,"Some members of management had their own clique and made it rough on employees and other managers that they decided they didn't like. Job description and rules changed frequently (sometimes daily). These issues and more lent itself to be a low moral work culture.  For the most part the employees and some management were very friendly and helpful. So , sometimes the work environmenyt could be jovial. I did really enjoy working with customers and when I was able, I found accomplishing tasks or fixing an issue."
bad,"They’ve reduced breaks, in 10 hours I sit for 18 minutes total. I am walking all day, around 10 miles. Most of my break time is spent walking to and from break. If you can’t walk fast you can’t eat. No food on the floor. They’ve reduced my vacation time in half  without warning. I constantly fear for my job. They’ve made goals unreachable and everyone gets write ups all the time. Very stressful, if you’re caught talking even for less than a minute you get accused of wasting company time and a write up. If you get hurt they try not to take care of you, or make you wait for hours before you can go to see a doctor, all the while trying to intimate you out of going. Seems you have to be immoral to get promoted to management."
bad,"Feel the company is moving in a direction that creates unhealthy work environment by changing time off policies, bringing in robots, eliminating positions, and poor communication."
bad,",  I worked hard for the little bit of money, The customers were the best part, It was getting hard to work overnight,,Pulling up carpet and moving shelves were very heavy for older women,"
bad,"Walmart is a very large company but lacks employee satisfaction. Did not take care of their employees that worked the hardest, wasn't as professional and organized as it should be."
bad,"As a department manager, my job relied heavily on third-party merchandisers and other teams to get their jobs done correctly and on time so that I could do mine. Because these teams were supervised by other managers who outranked me, it turned the job more into a game of trying to clean up after other teams while being hounded by upper management to get that, my own work, and special assignments for other departments done without going into overtime."
bad,The worst stressfull place I. have ever worked asisst managers care about no one but themselves treat their employees like trash Don't care about the welfare of employees dog them out
bad,Its like working for the worst company. I agree with the mission customer service is everything but on the inside management was racist and treated a lot of us line we were nothing.
bad,Store mgr and most assistant mgrs are rude unless you're their favorite. They'll walk right past you don't speak but will bark orders.  Over worked and didn't pay associates well. Your ideas are never listened to. There's never enough equipment  to do your job properly but your suppose to take responsibility for things not getting done on the managers time. Your coworkers are nice.
bad,Staff is great but you can not rely on management to help you or uphold company policies. Low end managers are constantly struggling to meet unreachable demands.
bad,"I left walmart because i got pregnant with my second daughter and i felt like my kids need me more than walmart does. and management sucks, and way to messy."
bad,"a typical day in retail is being spread thinly across a department or side of the store. Severely understaffed in general. "
bad,"I was tasked with working nights which means, anything the day shift didn't feel like doing was your responsibility. I would often be left with an insurmountable amount of work that was expected to be done regardless of my job description. They admit to constantly firing people for the tiniest infractions so they don't have to give people benefits. Sometimes the line at the ""time card"" machine moves slowly so have fun being 1-2 minutes ""late to work"". Regardless of your job title they will make you do anything they want without extra training or pay. I had the privilege of doing maintenance work, customer service, and my managers work for less pay than my co-worker that got hired in the same week. No matter what department you work in, they'll find a way to use you and toss you before they have to star paying you a livable wage. Do not work here unless you are a manager's brother or something."
bad,can be a great place to work but cant depend on work hours available and management doesn't seem to take any responsibility for no sceduals always saying its uot of our hands it corprates fault
bad,It was very stressful to get work completed on time. Mangers would demand it be finished with unrealistic time frame. Did not enjoy this job at all. Would not recommend.
bad,"landscape maintenance by mowing lawns> riding or push mowers> trimming and edging around trees>   plumbing pipes, drainage systems, and other plumbing materials> Installs pipes and fixtures, such as sinks and toilets, for water"
bad,I wouldn't advise anyone to work there unless you are desperate. Even then think twice. They expect people to do insane amounts of work for minimum wage. They always run short staffed so it very stressful. Management in general are also overworked and under payed so that trickles down. People that have worked there for 5 and 10 years still making minimum wage. I finally quit after 2 years of misery and they have submitted 8 records of employment. They can't even get that right.
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work because they do not care about there workers. the problem working for Walmart is that no one wants to work as a team, and the people who do work hard they get overworked which is not fair."
bad,Go in at 1pm have a 30 min meeting being told your crew is slow and that the store is failing because of your crew. You pretty much have to nag management for them to get anything done or teach you anything otherwise you have to learn on your own. Forced to stay late on nights when you have no people on your shift on 2 truck nights to make sure isles get done.
bad,New managers treat you very badly unless you smile sweetly and buy them things. No advancement or raises unless you are their buddy and divulge all your personal info to them.
bad,Do not work for Walmart unless you want to be a brown noser.  My manager was a jerk and showed favoritism to a select few. I would never recommend this company.
bad,"I started off at Wal-Mart in Waycross and worked there for a year before having to transfer to the Douglas Wal-Mart due to personal reasons. It was something new, challenging and exciting to be a part of that team because we worked together with no trouble. I got to learn manager responsibilities because I was trusted to get the job done even when working by myself. My managers did not want to see me go and I didn't want to go either but due to personal reasons it was the best decision at the time. I now work in Douglas GA at the Supercenter and would like to advance in my career but not with this store. I do not get benefits and would like to find something that does or pays enough for me to be able to pay my expenses when its needed."
bad,How is an optician in the vision center for over 7 years it was great until the current manager came in she's the worst horrible experience threatening environment writes you up for every little thing very stressful run
bad,"No support from management. The place filled with drama. It is basically highschool for adults. People have their own cliques... If you aren't ""in"" then you are not respected and be like."
bad,"The longer you stay the more horrible the pay is. Job is for high school students or someone needing benefits. Benefits great, but barely can be used because you don’t have enough money to go to the doctor."
bad,Don’t do it.  I could write a book on my regrets with this company. I’ve never been so mistreated ever.  I leave many days just emotionally drained. You are NEVER good enough.
bad,"Omg where do I start the place sucks but money is worth it, um they work u to the point u have no life but hey ok but not only do u put all your effort and more u still get written up every week for production. It’s literally impossible due to the lines constantly stopping if u work 10 they want 10 hours of production no down time so question is now how can u make production when I spend 15-20 min in start up a 20 and 15 min break and also u need bout 10mins with a battery change and u gon need at least (2-4) a shift so u do the math."
bad,"The pay was good, everything else is wrong.  You are a number to management, they only care about production and how their numbers look.  You get 2 twenty minute paid breaks in a 10 or 11 hour shift, by the time you park your equipment and get to break area you've wasted 3 to 4 minutes of your break and if your late from break by 1 second you get wrote up."
bad,"Increasingly hard to be happy to go to work at walmart. Too much ""talking"", backstabbing, name calling, OVERALL DRAMA."
bad,The employees stick together and are a blast to work with but the manager hate that bond and try to discourage it. They only promote people they like but if you work hard and try to learn different areas and get ahead they will shoot you down and promote their buddy.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to go work there. They don't treat their associates with respect and they will have you do others jobs rather the job is of higher pay job or not and only pay you for what your job title has to offer.
bad,"overall when i begun working there in my department the 2 older ladies from the produce/fresh department   that have been working there for so many years were extremely rude and would just talk major negativtive things about everyone they would make it known that you they didnt like you , and they always made side eye comments rolling their eyes to everyone they didnt think was good enough for them .NO ONE GOT ALONG WITH THEM . I DO NOT NEED TO LIE ABOUT stuff  LIKE THIS.it was very uncomfortable working with them made it very stressful in my day to day life being around them and it is just very sad that Walmart carries this show pretending everyone is so nice and in reality people that work there are very jealous territorial and just plain rude ... aside from that their was a few of the people who were very kind an welcoming my former supervisor he was an amazing guy , the only thing is half my associates didn't respect anything he would say or tell them to do"
bad,I love the people I work with but the false promises are horrible and it's even worse when you can't give you an actual response from your managers. They should stop making promises of promotion and stop making people work twice as hard when people who slack get away with things.
bad,Theres about three managers at the south point walmart in ohio that shouldnt be there I was working there for three years and moved up to management about 6 or 7 months after I became a csm I got fired and I didnt deserve it but I've seen the upper management and the way they or and it's not right they shouldn't be management but I was low on the list with that company and know one really cares but I feel bad for the people they might have there eye on next
bad,The store I worked in was in bad shape.  Never saw anything to make me believe they had a plan to fix what was wrong.  Filled the store with brand new Managers and did not give them the support they needed to become functional.  At my last review I was asked to listen to the other managers and report back on them.  In a word spy.  Lost all respect for store manager at that point.  Co manager encouraged me to write schedules that would have extra people to cover up for areas that were not scheduling properly then at annual review sat back while store manager manager took away points for the way I wrote the schedule.  Needless to say gave 2 weeks and left.
bad,"We were constantly understaffed management was well aware and never did anything about it. Per walmarts policy you're supposed to have your schedule 3 weeks in advance but our manager was constantly scheduling outside of our availability or not scheduling us at all. If you run into any issues  with co workers be ready to handle the situation on your own. Following chain of command and even with their open door policy nothing was ever resoveled. If you just need any kind of job this will work for a minute, just don't comfortable or stay any long than you need too."
bad,"I'm sure there are Walmart's that are great places to work. I'm only referring to the Walmart in Carroll Iowa in this review."
bad,"Managers like to pick favorites, which makes movement within the store a living nightmare, and it makes the turn over rate much higher than it should. Customers are always rude and very demanding (few exceptions). They always trying to get everything to go their way even though they are in the wrong. There is so much theft there, you get used to it over time. I have to return over a minimum of 35 stolen stuff a day, and there is nothing I can do about it. You also have to work every holiday no matter what, you can never have those days off."
bad,Terrible place to work. Management is awful and treat their employees terribly. Customers treat you however they feel like and you get cussed out and degraded on a daily basis and management allows it. They drill the policies into your head but then they don’t follow them and make you look dumb in front of customers. If the customers throw a big enough fit they can do whatever they want. The hours are inconsistent. One week you could have 30 hours and the next week you may not even be scheduled to work.
bad,"My experience was bitter sweet. I really enjoyed the work pace and my coworkers, but the management is by far the worst I've ever encountered. I'm a little older and been around so I've experienced some poor management before, but this was a whole new level of incompetency. It included condescending remarks, retaliation, lying, targeting, favoritism, and just simply incompetent. I was having to explain scheduling and merchandising methods, hiring flags, and prioritizing factors. It was remarkable."
bad,"The hours are pumped out by the system, supervisor manager have zero authority to change it. Unwilling to work with you and you’re schedule to balance home life and university."
bad,"Management is lazy and doesn’t do anything except walk around and gossip and want associates to do everything and work miracles. I’ve done so much for this company and get treated like nothing. Made my time there a living h3ll. Store manager doesn’t care about nothing but himself. Open door policy is a big joke until you speak with Ethnics,  that’s when management wanna get serious and yell at you for telling on them. It’s alot of sneaky stuff going on with the managers in Goose Creek ."
bad,"If you can afford not to, don't work here.  Stupid rules, strict enforcement.  What else am I supposed to write here.  Writing blah blah blah to get 150."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for just over 7 years in 3 different positions all of them hourly, I wouldn't say any of them were promotions. Over my 7 years there I had several managers who were good, but most are pretty awful. I stuck with the company because I kept getting promises of interviews for management positions without ever receiving an interview over 7 years. Walmart will continually just promote favorites and yes men/women. They don't like people who critically think or question how things are done. Even if the questioning is done in a respectful manner. On two separate occasions I was overlooked for a promotion and then I was the one responsible for training the person who would then be my manager. Also they don't work with their associates at all when it comes to scheduling. In my 7 years there I never once had a set schedule. I will say the benefits were decent but they pay was awful for the stuff they require you to do for them."
bad,"you are just a person there, they do not care about you as a person or a family member. They just want production out of you. They don't care about your your personal life at all."
bad,A typical day at work for me would be to work the entire parking lot of a Walmart super-center by myself. My manager would intentionally schedule me by myself because she knew that I was capable of maintaining the entirety of the lot by myself when normally it takes 3-5 people.
bad,"Poor management, poor training, hostile work environment. High or unrealistic expectations with little to no support. Once a year raises based on personality."
bad,"You never grow there, they do not let you miss work at all, even with doctor notice, they do not appreciate yeats of work and would let you go for ANYTHING."
bad,"Management is lacking, extreme favoritism, pay is deciet for entry level, little to no hope of advancement unless you like relocating. Pto is extremely slow to earn and if you are part time forget about it till you have worked there for at least 3 years or hit full time."
bad,"I find the work repetitive. After 28 years, I would like to move on. I do not wish to be forced to work on weekend nights when my schedule is weekdays."
bad,Good place to start working however it is not a job to make a career out of. Constantly changing programs for workers to do their job which usually results in poorer performance and less productivity. They are also cutting hours and job positions creating a more stressful environment on their remaining workers.
bad,Very stressful never got breaks on time some managers were rude. Never knew of I have as going to work more hours or not. Told me one thing and did another.  Sundays never had enough people to get carts always running out of carts not enough people working for customers to be helped  when they needed   always having not enough cashier's and customers complaining about letting ng lines
bad,"Very unorganized, advancement has been based on favoritism in my experience. Management rolls people under the bus not taking responsibility for their own mistakes. Doesnt work with people with families...for example band concerts for my child, appointments, etc. Demands a lot of employees without proper associate coverage and no training."
bad,Worked in sporting goods sold fishing license. I helped customers checked them out sold guns bullets ECT. Ran background checks on customers. Helped unload trucks.
bad,"The worst company I've worked for. Huge turnover rate, cause they don't properly discipline/fire associates, lots of bullying, and playing favorites. I have been accused and written up for things I haven't done, even after they see evidence, because they play favorites toward bullies. There are only 2 good managers and 1 is transferring. And if you earn overtime, certain times throughout the year, they require you to take a longer lunch so you don't receive your overtime compensation."
bad,"If you meet a goal they want you to beat it every time. "
bad,"So a typical night would start as follows: clocked in and see how much freight came in then go to the meeting to discuss where we worked at per night mine was always pet isle then check times which were always WAY OFF! like 13 hours worth of work to be done in 4 hours then go to talk with management about how wrong thee times were they brushed it off as ""oh well your job, not mine."" then work as hard as I can to complete said task than after lunch have management come up and ask when you will be done because grocery needs help then later get asked by upper management when I'm supposed to leave why I'm still working on my isle and why I didn't have help, to begin with."
bad,Working for walmart has been a roller coaster it has its ups and down benifits are always key to a good work enviorment thats what i liked about the job
bad,Dont do it. They seem nice and actually pay okay to a certain point. But its not worth the sanity and emotional health youll lose working for this company.
bad,"If your looking for just a job making decent money it's  the place to go, definitely not the place to for a long term career.... Very stressful environment."
bad,The managers see you as replaceable. They do not care about your problems outside of work. The only good part is that they work with a school schedule very well.
bad,"Not enough hours , management does not care about you , they are not flexible, have to wait a whole year to get benefits .. too much work for less pay ... they just don’t care .. it’s an okay part time job"
bad,The absolute worst job i have ever had in my life. You are only a number to them. If i died tonight my job would be posted in the morning and then they would try to write me up for not calling and telling them i died.
bad,Poor management lead to a lot of disgruntled employees walking out they dont take you into consideration. They would work with you on your hours if it bent to there needs .
bad,Son muy poco considerado con sus empleados. No tienen empatía con sus empleados. En cuestión de derechos no los respetan. Su trato al empleado es como si fuera menos que ellos. No son cordiales. No saludan ni preguntan como estas. Bueno en fin si trato al empleado no es del 100%
bad,"This company is all about how to make 600 billion dollar or more with a little help as possible and making you feel like your job is on line every minute your there or not. Walmart acts like they are going to go out of business next week if you don't execute the program they created when the program is not built for the real world and dose not take into account issues that they create like sending in to much freight that you don't have enough people to stock. They create there own guide and hours on how long they figure it should take a very fast work versus your everyday stocker how can't stock 100 case in 1 hour of house hold chemicals. There are visit that happen during the busiest times of the year like Christmas and they expect your store to be prefect, if not you will get written up or possibly terminated. They are constantly eliminating jobs and reducing total store hours. When you tell them that something is not working it take years for them to realize they were wrong but in that time frame good managers lose there jobs because of unrealistic goals and expectations. There is always the threat of retaliation if you go over your managers head to address an issue. I have seen store manager get fire within 3-6 months after going to home office about something they had a write up overturned. The pay is very good, the benefits are very good, the paid time off is very good, but its not worth being stressed 24  hours a day 7 days a week. You can't take a day off without having either the store or your boss call you, email you or text you. There is no work life balance at all."
bad,Walmart use to be a good place to work but not anymore. For example I use to have 6 weeks of vacation but before I left they took that away and gave me a week.
bad,"If you work hard, prepare to have management give you more work while they enable the lazy workers. Pay raises don't meet expectations for work performance evaluations"
bad,I did not like working at Walmart. They do not care about their employees and customers. The store I worked at was not well staffed. Employees there got their hours cut frequently.
bad,"Tiene muchas politicas que se supone que benefician al asociado pero ningun gerente la lleva a cabo, estuve en 3 unidades y siempre fue lo mismo, te pagan siempre tu tiempo extra pero te dejan muy poco tiempo para tu vida personal"
bad,This was a poor run business. You had to work the jobs of 3 people on a poor mans budget( low pay). They did not reward success and ambition. They never praised their associates just punished for tardiness and absences as well as job performance if it was negative. management just used people as a means to an end instead of focusing on the workers potential an as a human being.
bad,I loved working with the public. it was the CO workers and the management that wasn't the best to work with. their was only 2 managers their that really care about you and the things that go on and they try to do follow ups with the management In the department you work in but the manager and general manager don't care what happens to other employees unless you are their pet and favorite and even if customers say something to management or the GM they just ignore it all and nothing ever gets resolved.
bad,"Meeting the people, helping them out, teaching associates and watching them grow were all the satisfaction at the end of any day.  As far as management, it was the luck of the draw.  Sometimes you got a decent, understanding one, and other times, you got the diplomatic, racial, perfectionist."
bad,"not what it used to be, home office ruins many things. Once a driver, always a driver and poor management that will tell you what you want to hear and then do nothing. Many two faces in ""management""."
bad,"Whenever there was an issue relating to the work load and scheduling management did not care. I was always given work which required more than one person to accomplish in the time limit that was given for that task. When I tried to explain this to management, they did not want to listen."
bad,They do not accept doctors notes so if your ill and reach their point system your screwed. The managers were hateful and unhelpful. They wanted to stand around n bark orders n want ur job done by a certain time but refused to help you obtain it.
bad,The management is absolutely terrible the store manager will not excuse any absence even for state of emergency and they show favoritism very badly. Certain associates dont have to participate in the work they were hired to do. They dont have any respect for the employee.
bad,"Managers treat associates like they are unimportant and no matter how hard you try to what you accomplish, it is never good enough.  Managers are negative to associates."
bad,Build bikes for the bike rack. Management does not give you any support on your job. The hardest part of my job is to make sur the bikes are correct and put in the right area. The enjoyable part of my job is the people.
bad,"not a good place to make a living. Had no job security and had bad management personal. Did have good wages and benefits, but what that worth if  you dont have job security."
bad,i worked in several positions at walmart i would not advice anyone not living at home to work there over the age of 20...the benefits are great but that is it
bad,Not that bad to work here they just have there favorites  they cut your hours and make you very part time they say they work with you they don't not a family store
bad,"I would be doing something the way i was told to do by them. Then the next day they would tell me to do the exact same thing a completely differentlty, and get onto me for not doing it correctly."
bad,By far the worst company I've ever worked for point blank period. Some of my co-workers and managers were cool but besides that Walmart Distribution Center SUCKED! Do not work there because that place will do everything to make you regret it!
bad,"Walmart has no care or concern for any of their employees , safety, or dedication to job.  As far as safety my position required 2 people in the shop at all times I was often alone.  No matter how hard you work, go above and beyond work on days off you get no recognition and it counts for nothing"
bad,It's an alright place to work except if Walmart decides that they need more money they will cut you as management. Over the past 2 yrs they've decided to cut half of their management team meaning hundreds of people around the world getting the boot from walmart so that they can save money. So these managers that have been with walmart for 20 plus years are being forced to either step down or take a severance package. If you want to be a part of a company like that be my guest but I say no thanks sis.
bad,Workers were underpaid and there was no work life balance the building is never closed to employees it is closed on Christmas but the overnight is still working and there is no job security and just the culture has changed.
bad,"If you take one sick day its basically the end of the world, if you miss clocking in or clocking out (also on lunch clocking) by even a min you are yelled at and the managers are horrible, i wasn't paid for my three 8 hour work days of training and they made me sign something that said i started work 2 days after i already did the training, scum bags, on top of that you get automatically fired regardless of circumstances of you use too many ""points"" in a 6 month period, the number is too low, one sick day is 3 out of 3.5 so if anything comes up and you took your sick day you are fired. also taking time off even giving weeks in advance will never happen, they will just deny your request. please find another place to work, the employees are nice but everyone just gets booted due to bad management and rules."
bad,"A job where you see minimum recongnition for hard work  dont waste your time on this job. Management is very inconsiderate. benefits are terrible, pay is terrible everything about this company sucks."
bad,"The company is pretty decent, available hours for those who want to work, but the management is like 6th grade all over again. NEVER trust an open door and managers gossip about your problems if you go to them privately. Also they play favorites if your not one you will NOT ever advance."
bad,"I've worked for this company for 6yrs and it has gone very far downhill. Managers don't care about employees, it's all about the money, not the overall well-being of the employees. They pack on more work than a single individual can handle and get upset when it isn't finished."
bad,"disappointed in the disregard for employees"
bad,"overnight stocker but very stressful enviorment to replenish shelve for customers,,unrealistic views about time to get job done before customers hit the floor for purchase..you have to get the merchandise on the shelf and do cardboard make bales and clean the main aisle action alley"
bad,the people you work with are great but the management and what the higher ups expect and push for is ridiculous. if your lucky your immediate manager will be good and push to help but the higher ups only care about the numbers work 6 days a week come in early and leave late to get things done and no one will appreciate it at all
bad,expected me to now certain things that are usually shown how or what to do instead of just vaguely explaining the ditties and left alone to do it for hours.Then told that you did it wrong.
bad,Hourly associates are pretty awesome. Everyone is nice and helpful to one another. It's the management and how they decide to run things that should not be legal.They don't treat you with respect and expect you to do alot more than your job description shows.
bad,"A stressful work environment where they farm every last minute out of you using systems that track everything you do with all of your jobs. They have cutthroat time requirements where the entire day just turns into a stressful mess where you don't feel like you can ever breathe. Just keep moving nonstop like a machine being farmed for your time. "
bad,Walmart is definitely not a job for anyone under 21 I feel like. I was a rising senior in high school. The hours are so cut throat you’re exhausted everyday.
bad,a typical day is me alone running 4 to 5 departments meant to be staffed by twice as many people. When i have other people there they usually dont know how to do their job or if they do they get pulled to other areas of the store.
bad,"The people that I worked with and for were amazing but the company was terrible, I was a department supervisor but I was getting paid $8.50 hr any overtime had to be cut by Friday. I was a hard worker, coming in at 5 in the morning and staying as late as they needed to have nothing to show for it was very sad."
bad,"I have made many friends while working there, but all are in the same boat. Walmart offers decent benefits and pay, but expects more than one person can handle and is still cutting hours and number of employees. Customers would be better served with a full staff rather than a constant skeletal crew."
bad,"This was my first job out of highschool, but I do remember Walmart being fast paced but very unprofessional.  There were a lot of people at the job who knew how to get by, by doing the minimum amount of work possible."
bad,Management was rode so hard about employee production that they were forced to hold people accountable for production rates that at many times were not able to be met.
bad,Very stressful due to lack of help. Company is striving to get long term associates to work split shifts and have them change their availability to evening shifts.
bad,Go to our assigned department and work the freight that was put in the department. Most management knew the job was massive to complete in the time available. The workplace was all ways very stressful and most of the time one of the  managers would be hounding all of the associates to get their work done. There was no enjoyable part of this job. Most associates think of working at this Walmart as just a paycheck. I did enjoy completing my required duties and helping customers or other associates.
bad,Managers here at my Walmart will lie and deceive to get the associates to do as they want. They will tell you they will work with you about furthering your career but never get back with you. I was lucky to get the one good manager or it would’ve been extremely rough to stay here.
bad,Very very poor management. Hard workers get rode until they break and quit while the “slower” workers get by.. I was told by a high up manager that everyone’s 100% is different and if someone else can only work at my 60% for what I’m doing at 100% than it’s “okay” but if I miss one thing as a hard worker it’s straight to the office
bad,"After working here for almost 10 yrs i can honestly say it's only a job to take as a last resort. Anyone can do better than this place and it is not worth the headache, stress, and disrespect they put their associates through."
bad,"Management made false promises. I along with multiple other employees were told we would get moved to other positions. This never happened, they instead hired new people. They would also schedule you outside of available hours."
bad,It was ok after a couple of year there everything and everybody just went down hill. It’s very good place to work but the people you work with should be up to part as well
bad,"This is the grossest, most moribund place I've ever had the mispleasure to work at. Management is incompetent, security is powerless and nobody does their job. Thieves abound."
bad,"Walmart is one of the worst places to work at. Now, I understand that it may be that it's just my Walmart that is so horrible due to how small yet busy it is, but do not work at Walmart unless you have no other options."
bad,Walmart has no organization they play favoritism they only worry about their profit they don't care about their Associates. The worst company that I've ever worked for.
bad,The people at the top in this company enjoy the profits. The hourly workers are treated poorly. They don't pay a living wage. This made it almost impossible to maintain a staff.
bad,"I really enjoyed working with my co-workers, but I did not care for  supervisors. I learned that all jobs were not all for people especially myself..."
bad,I really don't have much to say.I was just not pleased with the abrupt moving to various departments without discussing it with me first.Especially with management. I was really left in the dark for as to what was going on.
bad,They have their favorites and if you aren’t one of them you will know. They don’t like you if you have a voice and don’t allow them to run over you. My coworker as great but management was bad.
bad,"Management is inconsistent, There is no discipline, Management is unfair to Associates that work hard show up on time, show up to work, but they reward Associates that barely show up, don't do there job and walk around doing nothing to advance /get promoted, and they don't pay a livable wage for what the job entails  , no night differential for night shift workers which should be illegal"
bad,"Fellow workers a cheerful, bright, civil group. Some managers stellar, others (one or two) mean, racist hags who made our lives miserable on purpose. Walmart employees learn a lot about Americans. The workplace culture at this store was pretty laid-back- no cheering was required. The hardest part of the job was selling dangerous products that are bad for people and the environment. (Walmart sells a lot of Roundup.)"
bad,"Where to begin, from being pulled from your area to miscommunication to just downright terrible management decisions. Good starter job not a career..."
bad,I would have to wear roller skates to do price checks. which was not bad until employees want you to go and get their lunch for them. At break I was not allowed to remove my skates to let my feet rest be cause if they called for a price check we had to miss our break to do the price check. I learned the register phone number so I would use the department number and call that register. They are ways to work hard or work smart. It was just the employees that treated others bad.
bad,"Management hardly does their job and micro-manages yours. They only seem to worry about the operation of the store when their boss is there. The management takes a multitude of breaks, honestly an unnecessary amount."
bad,"This facility works a four ten schedule. I work Tuesday through Friday 5:00 AM - 3:00 PM schedule. You get two 20 minute breaks in this 10 hour shift with no lunch break. You are required to meet a production standard and work 364 days a year. The only holiday that is currently given is Christmas day but this may not be available for long. They do not pay holiday pay, it is not paid at any higher rate than your normal shift hours. Pay is increased for up to 2 years but you will then cap out and stay the same level of pay from then on. Very small benefits for being an employee for more than 2 years, very small bonuses given to ten-year employees."
bad,There is major favourites and you get made to feel like your not doing a good enough job or being fast enough if you ask for help. I’ve come to learn that doing your job properly doesn’t matter . You get praise for doing your job wrong and fast instead of right and a bit slower . Most of the time I love going to work but 50% of the time I know it’s going to be a bad shift when I see certain people are working
bad,"All  coworkers lack team work compatibility. The managers are to absorbed kissing up to their highers they rarely have time to speak with their employees, and when they do they use harsh tones and impatient attitudes. The place is rarely cleaned even with a fully functioning cleaning crew. They will tell you how to do you're job and then will scold you if it goes against a costumers word."
bad,"Walmart is a company who can treat its employees any way it sees fit, because it's strong-armed america into such a vulnerable position that most low-income and below individuals without connections into real places of work will have to work there to make a living in their young lives(everything here isn't researched just my lived experience and the hundreds of people I've worked with at Walmart over the course of 3 years). "
bad,you are nailed with complaints from the start they don't train you and they write you up for it when you mess up over the smallest of things the best thing about this job is it pays ok not good but ok
bad,"Walmart used to be a good place to work. It has gotten worse over the years in every way possible. They changed the way they give us raises, they took away holiday pay and Sunday premium."
bad,I know management is 'trying' their best. Regardless they keep dropping the ball. Chronically under staffed and as such remaining employees are sometimes doing up to 5 times the work load they should. The whole store is falling apart from the inside out and management doesn't care or at least they're not doing a thing about it. Poor scheduling and no regard for the health of their employees. I have no respect for a company that wont let someone going the chemo have even a day off to get treatment (this has happened more than once). They also told me that I was getting my yearly raise and they did; accept it was a raise to minimum wage and while thats not illegal its very scammy
bad,Walmart just wasnt paying enough for me to stay a float hours were inconveniently flexible there wasnt much room at all for over time also there were some management issueses at the company
bad,The managers don’t know what they are doing and don’t know how to handle associates. I worked really hard even when I was by myself I still worked really hard but I was never good enough so they fired me.
bad,"Management shows favoritism."
bad,"Expectations of job completion without adequate staffing, without the tools needed to do the job, and cutting work hours.  Company policies/practices completely opposite of what is told in orientation."
bad,"Not the best, the manager micromanaged and made a hostile work environment. There was hardly ever anything to do, too much favoritism, not enough bathrooms, etc."
bad,"stressful, no family time. they want you to go back to work the very next day after birth and no materninty leave. i worked here because of the pay, it is very competitve employesws seem like there still in high school with all these rumores and stuff"
bad,My job had little to no consistence in hours even though I had worked there for three years under them. The management could not figure out what one another was doing and by how many hours they had cut there were no employees to help customers.
bad,Empresa con poca administración lo que perjudica mucho el trabajo
bad,"Always understaffed. Pharmacists get perks, technicians treated like second class citizens. No support from management. Lots of overtime, that will take over your life if you let it."
bad,Company is more focused on profit rather than customer service or employees. Management treats employees badly. Promotion is based on favoritism not job skills
bad,"very stressful and overwhelming place to work, expected to do more then anyone person could ever do, managers are under so much stress that it brings down every employee in the store"
bad,Management often times put the load of workers calling in on those who actually showed up having their workers spread thin without the proper instructions. Often times would they stick an employee in a position unrelated to their original hiring.
bad,Management never cared about u or your family or any of that nor do they give u a deserved raise or help u with anything all they care about is there money
bad,"Have too much to say about Walmart now. Firing people for lame reasons, hiring new people part time, less money & no benefits. I would any longer recommend Walmart to anyone"
bad,The management was awful and no matter how many complaints you made to home office it never changed. Retaliation was a big problem but again was never handled. The insurance is a joke!!! It did cover anything even after my deductible was met. We never had supplies to do our job or enough working machines. The worst company i have ever worked for.
bad,"The managers are so rude and talk about everyone behind your back please do not do it is so hard to have a life when working there they will , will never let you leave sick or have a family problem."
bad,The company is try to squeeze a glass of orange juice from a single clementine.  The approach is to get one person to do as many jobs as possible instead of appropriately staffing the areas.  This was a major contributor to the downfall of kmart.
bad,i love working here the only bad thing is the personal some of them bean rude with some associated because i am Hispanic and they have some of them that don't feel comfortable with me because my nationality .
bad,"weak management"
bad,I was lured into Walmart Management by the offer of a generous income.  After two years with the company I was spread thin by the hours expected from salaried employees.  I also found the treatment of hourly associates to be less than respectful and encouraging.
bad,it ok place to work for but not good company. but you learn alot there. good job if you want a part time job there .you cant used your sick time.  at all
bad,I work from 10pm - 7am it a good god but the job ain’t for me . I had to stock everything make sure I had everything clean and organized. I also made sure the costumer fine what they needed in my electric area .
bad,"Ungrateful, rude, over worked under paid, management was awful, want and want with no positive feedback or respect....................................."
bad,"A typical day at walmart is messy, messy, and messy females. I learned that u cant trust management at all. They are the main ones in the store. The work culture is all messed up u have managers talking about associate with other associates and its sad."
bad,The salaried members of management treats the hourly associates horribly. Management gets multiple vacation over relatively short periods of time. Six months of non stop work gave a part time associate ~5 hours of PTO. PTO is non existent for associates.
bad,I been working at walmart for 12 years . The company doesn't really care about the employees. They try to see what they can get out of you without paying the proper wage. Example; when going from first to third to help out there is no compensation for you switching. You get the same wage as you were for working first shift. There is never any coverage in other departments when other associates are on third. Therefore if you are working during the day you have to cover the departments. They plan poorly and lie to their employees about many things.
bad,It was a terrible place to work liars cheating and blaming. I was fired over a rumor . Management couldn't disconnect from their phones for more then 2 minutes to do their job.
bad,"i played marco polo while working and got along with all other co-workers and it kept me busy. as soon as i clocked in i had to go to the back and unload the truck, from there i would take the carts out to the floor and dispurce them to the proper places and then unload the carts onto the shelves"
bad,"Sucks bad don’t work here unless you are willing to sell out anyone and everyone to get ahead and then become the most hated person there , cutthroat stab you in the back company with stupid made up rules to benefit them"
bad,Sam's Club Health and Wellness management is deplorable.  It is endemic from the divisional manager down to market managers.  They no longer value pharmacists as they once did.  Instead they fire the employees with the highest salaries and largest paid time off.
bad,"Walmart associates treated me very poorily. I wanted to keep working with the company,but the associates were not very professional and did not have any compassion on my situation. I wanted to transfer but no store would accept my transfer being that I have been with the company 3 years. I thought it was very unprofessional and every time I tried to talk to the store managers they were never available."
bad,"Walmart puts itself out there as a company based on respect for the individual. This is not however how the company is ran (at least in my experience). Upper management has no problem with disciplining associates on the floor in front of others including customers. In my time there I was witness to others being brought to tears, including lower level management. "
bad,i cant speak for all but the one i was at they didnt pay you enough they lie about you getting a promotion and they dont keep promises they always try to threatening you if you late you will be fired
bad,"The company clearly never cared about the people working for them, their health, or anything other than if they could work or not. Most managers were mean, and everything was so impersonal."
bad,No job security at this job it sucks to work here the management the team the building is a hazardous place to work. They have disease running around in there
bad,"Wal-Mart's ""open door"" policy did not work for minority management members. Pay was exceptional but different standards for different stores. One of the most racist companies I have ever worked for."
bad,I would not go to work at Walmart again.  The management seemed to be interested in how much they would receive for their bonuses. The management never seemed to actually train the associates for their job.
bad,"I worked many departments at Wally-world. Working up to Assistant manager, which was a joke. Pay was good, but you were expected to almost ''live"" there. Stepped down to a Department manager position which surprisingly, wasn't bad. Was terminated unexpectedly because of ""racial bias"" without going into details. And not from me. That's an opinion, not a fact. Tried to communicate with ""higher ups"" after my firing, but no response. No response here, I'm sure."
bad,I was laid off by force after being coached for something I did not do and was forced from my position. Walmart is not a company that chooses its management by what a person knows  but chooses management from the buddy buddy system. (Its not what you know. Its who you know.). The store manager  during my time as Co manager would not teach me as I requested several times to promote. The 40 hr week that all managers are told is a lie. Every day as a salaried management I was expected and told 16 to 17hr days everyday. So I do not recommend this place to anyone. Unless you like a throw of the dice living.
bad,"work environment is deplorable,constant miscommunication between management, consistently short staffed."
bad,"Showing that you are a good worker just means managers put everything on you, and everything is your fault when things aren't going well. Stick to just being part time."
bad,Te dan buenas prestaciones pero ya como segundo empleo el sueldo es poco
bad,"I worked here for a short period due to the staffs racial judgment, terminated my position. Walmart like any company hires a diverse staff to down play racial judgment. Team work was limited, and the amount of professionalization within the work environment was a huge disappointment. I am sure they will be eager to diminish my review but the truth hides behind the lies. I worry for someone who may be like myself and be bullied into submission. Walmart ethics doesn't actually help the associate who is going through these issues they just take a complaint and you are forced to deal with the outcome, as well as talking to the main manager who spoke to those associates only gave them more momentum to work against me. The booklet you are given in the beginning of orientation includes Walmart being a none competitive, safe work environment and that is exaggerating from the truth."
bad,A typical day was just another day looking over your shoulder to make sure you walked on eggshells the right way. There was much conflict with all management.
bad,"Walmart was a negitive place to work. Theres no since"
bad,"The work environment was good, with great teammates. The management was poor, bad scheduling, and a lack of concern for employees, both with ethics, and safety."
bad,"Associates and Management in this store we're lacking. Associates here at the time we're negative and unhopeful. Surrounding area around the store, uncontrollable."
bad,"If you enjoy working your heart out for absolutely no appreciation this is the job for you, the best part about the job was the schedule 3 12 hour shifts a week."
bad,I liked working for walmart but they cut back on the people for work not enuff people to work taking away jobs and finding places for them to work just wished walmart was about families that work for them instead of saying we will find another to replace u if u don't come to work if ur sick or have family problems at the home
bad,"Management is poor, work is fast paced and stressful, no compensation. Poor hours and poor pay. You get no credit or appreciation from management at all. They are stuck up and don’t care about you at all, you’re a tool."
bad,this job is stressful  and hardwork there is sweet people i lke the people i work with and you learn new jobs you do differnt kinds of foods and bakery
bad,They can barely keep anybody and everybody takes breaks at the same time meaning that either you will be by yourself working or come back and work by yourself
bad,"I would never recommend the Marshall, MN Walmart store to anyone looking for a job. Not understanding at all, horrible management, systematical flaws in data. Willing to fire anyone at the drop of a dime for any minor thing that they see fit to rid themselves of."
bad,Walmart is turning into a company not like the one Sam Walton designed.  They are getting rid of employees and having everything computer ran.  Computers are nice but not when it takes the place of an actual person
bad,Stay busy the whole time you are on the clock... Just need all the Chiefs to stay on the same page more....Instead of treating employee like yoyo's...
bad,"This is a Multi Billion dollar a year Company and they feel like they can work you like a dog, If it's busy you miss your breaks and they don't care and at the same time pay you NOTHING!"
bad,Horrible company to work for. Management is the worst. No work ethic. Short staff and you had to finish your task and every one else. No resect for the individuals>
bad,"get supples check the equipment/ scrubber / set up  / than scrub  store that night"
bad,Stressful. No advamcement.  No common sense. Managers dont know how to manage.  Managers do not know how to do their jobs. So they make others do it for them.
bad,Cashiers and customer service employees were treated horrific at the store I was at. There was no room for advancement. There were no raises. It was not a good work environment.
bad,To many managers and pepole who do not pull there weight are treated better then pepole who work as hard as they can.managers will play mind games to get you to do what they want then turn around and not do as they promise.
bad,"The only training I consistently received were the video's and interactive quizes afterwards for hours on end. Once they put you on the floor, they basically leave you to fend for yourself.  They regularly put me behind the jewelry counter with 0 training and expected me to change people's watch batteries and adjust people's bands when I have no prior knowledge about this. I broke someones watch with the watch press one time when I was changing the battery. I didn't get in trouble because I think the store knew they screwed up but I of course felt awful. The job really wouldn't be so awful if they would just train you, but they do not."
bad,Walmart simply does not care. Their outlook is they can replace you in a moments notice. No one is held accountable for their jobs. No home life when working for walmart
bad,"They have changed to a new scheduling system that does not work. I have been there 8 years and they cut me back to 10-15 hours a week. I used to get 25+ hours. They refused to make me full time even with an assistant manager and my department manager wanting me to be full time. Just because the store manager wanted to cut hours. You are no longer supposed to have any kind of availability. If you do, even if it's on slow days or days others prefer working over you, they cut hours and say that's how the computer works now. They have gone as far as to work around state laws and even cut full timers hours down to 20."
bad,"They need to hire respectable management, maybe educated ones! I never felt smarter than when I worked at Walmart! It is literally the worst company on earth. Period."
bad,"As an assistant manager I was told I would be making 25$ an HR, when come to find out I was salary. I was also told that I would work 3days on then 3days off well that never happened I always had to work more, as I worked the long shifts 7am till 10pm I was unable to take lunch or and brakes due to the fact that I was the only manager on duty."
bad,"You are nothing but a number any grievances you may have, issues with co-workers, or home issues they don't matter. "
bad,"I will never work at a Walmart again! We do not get treated fairly, it seems the mangers only care about their selves! I've worked for them sick,  having the 24 hour bug and until I'm about ready to pass out. Employees their do not get enough repspect, we are scheduled out of our availibity all the time. When we try to tell the managers our problems so we can see about fixing them , they seem not to even care. The money is good, but we're treated like we're below them."
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,was fired after Christmas cleanup for no real reason and they tried to say I came to work late with a doctored photo then wrote it up as stealing time for unemployement after giving back 30 minutes for helping a customer
bad,"I can handle the stress of walmart, if the management team did a better job. We never had the sufficient materials to do our job successfully and correctly."
bad,If you are in with the management you have it made.I tried to move up but was chosen over someone else usually younger. Education meant nothing to them.
bad,"Physically demanding job and the management is less than helpful."
bad,Management displayed poor leadership skills and were rude to those who would go the extra mile for their job. They often disregarded the opinions of associates even if those opinions were involving safety concerns. All in all they treated the associates with little to no respect and showed a lack of concern for the individuals as people.
bad,They don't like moving people up and if they do they moved the people that kiss pay raises suck they need to treat their employees a little bit better and get better raises
bad,I f Wal-Mart still held to its origional policies it would be the best place in the world to work but it no longer holds it's employees accountable to those standards and has become a place where internal theft and mistreatment of fellow employees exists from upper management down to the cart pusher.
bad,"Associates  are cross trained to do a variety of jobs where needed to cover open ;positions. The atmosphere if fast paced and can be very stressful depending on the amount of customer to associate ratio.You get to meet interesting people and see a variety cultures. Management  can be wishy washy on occasion  depending on the subject at hand, As the company continues to grow I feel that it cuts corners and benefits to it's employees. I use to support Walmart but over the years I have lost my faith in the company."
bad,Walmart has changed drastically in the last few years and is now a shadow of its former self. The days of valuing and appreciating its workers are over. There is little or no job security and your job is threatened daily. Management turnover is over 90%
bad,"Walmart, was a joke. everybody for themselves, management sucked. no room for advancement.. and there was a lot of racial profiling going on, nobody cared about anybody. the pay was okay. I had better. a lot better. they just did what they wanted to do."
bad,"I enjoyed what I did and do, but when you have three to four managers at a time telling you to do things differently it’s gets to be too much.  With a lot more training it would actually be a great place to work"
bad,"Go to work, do the best job you can do and try your best not to stress yourself out. Remember that the customers are number 1 and without them, you wouldn't have a job. And always be pleasant and respectful"
bad,"A typical day go to work, work , break, go to lunch, Break, work , go home. I worked in the back room as a stocker and we have to unload truck, put items on pallets then at night take then tothe salesfoor."
bad,The short time I spent at Walmart DC was miserable. The only reason I would've kept the job was because of the money but I still feel like the pay rate was to low.
bad,Bad place to work you have a family. Management didn’t care about anyone but themselves.  The pay was terrible I bearly received a raise and most of the time the hard workers was over looked
bad,Doesn't bother Walmart to eliminate 100's of jobs. Walmart used to be a good place to work years ago but it is horrible now. They like to get rid of their long time associates so they can save a dollar
bad,"Its an ok place to work for, if you don't mind shoddy management who don't care whether you hurt yourself or not as long as they have a body to work. my location literally only has 2 good managers. 3 if you count department managers. I definitely wouldn't recommend working here. And the scheduled hours suck!"
bad,"If you're the type to want to work and that's that, then this is the job for you. If you are a creative, then this isn't a job for you. The management treats you like children."
bad,Walmart is a machine that chews people up and spits them out. The turnover rate is high so that most employees are minimum wage. They prefer to hire people as part time so they don't have to pay benefits. Management is unrealistic and unresponsive.
bad,"I unloaded the trucks and stocked certain areas,but management wanted it done in unreasonable time periods. They also expect you to take on any and all other tasks they find along the way."
bad,"Stressful and no help. No thank you or good job. Walmart has gone downhill in the past ten years. It is no longer a family business, it is all about the money earned."
bad,"There is a surprise every day, possibility of being threatened, injured, and emotionally scarred, not for the faint of heart."
bad,"The management is horrible. they dont care about your well being while working if you get hurt its your fault if you get frost bite on your feet or anything for being in a -20 degree freezer you arent allowed to step outside for a few minutes to thaw out cause its considered time theft. if a immediate family member of yours dies, you get in trouble for attending their funeral."
bad,At the end work was not fun managers don’t tell the truth. The new dress code will not last people look sloppy. I will never tell anyone to work at Walmart.
bad,"My WalMart got the lowest ratings in the region on the annual survey. Given part time hours when full time status. Overworked due to inadequate staffing. Customers constantly complain about self check out and how they feel they are being forced to check themselves out, long lines, too few cashiers. Take offense when asked to see their receipt when exiting store. Aggressively rude customers. I have been shoved when asking for ID for alcohol sales."
bad,Walmart has gotten to the point where they don't care as long as there work gets done when they wanted it. And management was almost always hard to find except one. But all I did was stock a certain area.
bad,A typical day was fairly simple since I worked away from others. I didn't learn too much. Management was pretty relaxed. The coworkers were cool overall.
bad,"I like working at Walmart, but I prefer working a company that does not have friends and buddies that they promote.  That is the case this Walmart. Also even though I am a good team player. I should be doing other people job that is on the clock."
bad,"I am talking from a perspective of a former stockman (Cart pusher) "
bad,"Walmart has to become more cultural conscious, establish required classes for Management, In store and Corporate Level. The Culture is not what you know is who you know to continue in Management positions and applying to future your career. Applying externally is not received well in my experience. It's all work first family second."
bad,"Learning about retail and how things flow in the store, it’s amazing! The life cycle of items, pricing, discounts, sales taxes, all the variants that are around the products. How logistics and transportation also are implicit. It’s incredible how an item can be created and manufactured at the other side of the world, and purchased at this end."
bad,if you work hard you are expected to work harder. If you are lazy you get by with murder. If you want management you better be a favorite. Its not a good place to work.
bad,"I never want to work there again. The management staff was incredibly rude, unhelpful and pushy. They did computer training but not floor training so I had no idea where anything was yet they got very mad when I disn’t know where it went or how to do something. They’d also act like I was a moron if I asked questions."
bad,"Management doesn't care. About anything. I worked in the deli. I saw managers put out undercooked food. I saw employees put out roasted chickens that had fallen to the floor. Employees would argue and fight with supervisors on the store floor. I received an on the job injury once, and the ASM on duty tried to dissuade me from going to the hospital. I had to convince them I needed to go. Walmart management is horrible."
bad,Between my managers not being around when I needed something and just plain not coming into my department at all and leaving me understaffed or hiring staff that can't even do the job and adding additional departments right before the holidays my stress level was through the roof. My doctor had to put me on antidepressants just to deal with my bosses. As soon as I got a new job I didn't need those anymore.
bad,"Management talks to employees like they're trash. (This is just what I observed on the sales floor and heard over the walkie all day, every day) The majority of the clientele AND associates have 0 class. If you've never been to this location, I recommend keeping it that way. Horrible place to shop AND work. The only thing ""ok"" was the pay. Benefits were terrible as well."
bad,"The only and I mean only good thing about my experience at Walmart was working for one of the GREATEST managers I have ever met in my life, he treated us with respect and even worked alongside us at times miss working for him but WALMART as a whole...TERRIBLE company"
bad,"The pay was good but the hours are lethal. Graveyard shift is 10PM - 7 AM. On top of this, you are often overworked as there is almost never enough people - most days you will be required to work up to an hour after your shift is supposed to end. Most of the managers were alright but one was a pain. Some associates were nightmares to work with and the company would recognize this but did nothing to fix the problems."
bad,That have set a standard of speed that no one can keep up with and I'm sick of giving it my all and never meeting there extremely high expectations. Its a bad place to work.
bad,"they treat employees very poorly. over worked, under paid and told they are garbage by poorly trained managers."
bad,It is all about getting things done with unreal expectations and if they aren't done you will get in trouble. Management are children in most cases and like to argue.
bad,"The people were nice, but we were severely understaffed, were not allowed any overtime by company policy, the six month temp policy is detrimental to those who are seeking longevity and the management (higher management, not lower) were consistently rude to employees."
bad,"I worked at walmart as a high school student. They have strict hours that HS students are allowed to work. The management lets the smallest amount of power get to their head and they treat their employees terribly. For example, when I submitted my letter of resignation giving them two weeks notice that I was leaving, the management was very rude to me. One specific incident that I recall occurred when I had about 2 shifts left and we had a pretty bad storm, it had been pouring rain for hours, I was a cashier and one of the managers told me I needed to go outside and push carts (walmart hires specific people for that job). I told her no, and she was livid."
bad,"Managers were not willing to work around school schedule. Managers, and workers were unprofessional. Favoritism in the workplace, unwilling to work with employees."
bad,"A hard extremely serious job. Their is no flexibility in rules, and no excuses. I personally while working their was left to my area alone with no management or coworkers. When time for breaks witch are mandatory i had to almost beg someone to come take over at my post so i could. It is a stressful job that pays about minimum when you start, and stays around there even with raises."
bad,The management would pick favorites and yell at the employees in front of customers and talk to their employees like they were trash. Picked favorites which is against company policy and those employees never got in trouble
bad,Deplorable work conditions terrible management a fight for your job every day write up happy supervisors and forced overtime not to mention the two 20 minute breaks of which 5 mins takes to get outside the only good thing was the pay and benefits
bad,"Walmart is extremely strict and does not work with you about your health needs.  If you have any health issues, I do NOT recommend working for Walmart.  I love working with people and thought this job would be great.  When I wanted to switch to customer service, management kept telling me they'd switch me.  They did NOT send me over there very often to train even though they said they would.  When I would ask about it, they would say they needed me elsewhere and I'd often see someone less qualified be sent over there.  Then they hired a new person entirely for the position.  I always felt they try to figure out where you want to be placed and then keep  you from going there."
bad,"the store I work at hire part time so they don't have to give benefits , one week I worked 40 hrs and the next week under 20hrs .It's a small store so people has been there for years in the same position so there is no way to move up"
bad,"The upper management  really needs to be restructured,they treat you like you don't have a real life outside Walmart and not at all concerned about the individual and family matters."
bad,Horrible management in the compton store lots of favoritism and racism never uses the open door policy poor communication between management and employees
bad,I worked here for a few years and every year things change. Management is very poor. The pay is really low. Favoritism at its highest. No overtime ever.  And if they want they can make up some reason to let you go.
bad,"I would not recommend working for Walmart ever, they do not care about your well being whatsoever. they also will fire you for the stupidest reasons a"
bad,"Poorly managed, unorganized and tedious. Working for Wal-Mart in New Roads had been the worst experience of my life. I do not recommend anyone to work there. They reel you in with the ""benefits"", ""hours"", and ""pay"" to make it seem like it's a good place to work. However that is not the case. it is a horrible place to work and everyone is rude."
bad,I enjoyed my customers and my colleagues. The management could have been better. I learned how to deal with upset customers because we didn’t have what they wanted.
bad,I worked 1st shift and the management was always degrading and insulting us no matter how hard we worked. It became evident that I my position was in a questionable state so I decided to part ways to find something that recognizes how hard I work and strive to be an asset to a company.
bad,Walmart does not accept doctors notes. They have strict policys to keep their retention rates low no matter how many years you have been employed their
bad,"Worst job I ever had. Only reason I stayed was because it paid well. No training at all, just threw you in there. Employees were very helpful showing you the ropes."
bad,If you like being stressed out constantly than this is the place for you. The other associates walk around acting as if they were children still in high school.
bad,"Depending on what department you work, has different stresses.  In electronics, you have to take quizzes on a computer to get all the info on what's new.  And try to remember it all."
bad,"Just full of messy and petty people also non organization I am surprised that, that store has stayed open. Managers would make you do work for them even though a different manager told you to work on something else. Managers do not communicate to each other and you are in the middle dealing with mess from either of them. I worked there for a while and out of nowhere a manager started bugging me. I got written up twice within the first two weeks of the month (they call it ""coachings"") you can Only get three. If you got a pretty chill supervisor they will probably quit because they know about all the mess and things us unloaders deal with."
bad,All of the employees just seem so sad and depressed and it can really bum you out. Wouldn't recommend. Management doesn't listen when you have a problem. Your teammates don't do their job.
bad,"While my coworkers are mediocre with their workload, they do work as a team. They are willing to cooperate and get the job done. My current service manager is inadequate, he can't work under pressure. He has many short comings and takes it as an insult when you put address him about them. Many good workers quit for other employers as a result. I myself can not continue to work under him."
bad,"If you like to hear people complain about working at Walmart but then not do anything about it than this is the job for you. The people hate their jobs, there was really only one manager that people liked, so nothing got done."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart can be a very stressful one. Products have to get off the truck, down the line, sorted, pulled to the sales floor and sometimes stocked by the backroom associates who have to prepare for the next truck before unloading and after unloading merchandise trucks. All of whom will usually have large volumes of merchandise. As a back room associate, I had a lot of responsibilities and at times it was overwhelming. This was not a good job to start out. I did however, learn a few things. Management at Walmart was split and not always organized. One manager could be telling our team to do one task and how to do it. A different will give the same task with different specifications that will conflict with the first manager's. I learned that you have to tell the second, third and even forth manager each task given to cover yourself otherwise you can face being reprimanded. I also learned to identify the quality of management and how to respond to different qualities of management. When a good manager moves to a different store or leaves the company and is replaced by another manager to 'increase efficiency' it is wise to consider moving to a different store or seeking employment elsewhere. Walmart has a very high turn-over rate. The pay is good but I would not expect to keep the job for very long. Expect for your managers to be looking for a reason to let you go the moment you are hired."
bad,"Very difficult to grow in management, no room for personal growth, ideas not heard, no feel of value, everyone looking out for themselves. If you're exceptional in your position, be prepared to be encouraged to stay in your current position and not grow within the company. Be prepared for your 'exceeding expectations' to be the new norm for only you and not your peers and held accountable for not going above and beyond your job description."
bad,"Fun but set up to get fired"
bad,"Rain, Sleet, Snow, hot, cold. Outside in the parking lot collecting shopping carts. Keeping lot clear of trash while making sure the cart dock stayed stocked for customers."
bad,Walmart was extremely stressful. It is a revolving door of emloyees. Walmart consistantly pressures employees to accomplish tasks in less and less time without the sufficient amount of employees to cover the workload.
bad,"My experience working at Walmart Distribution is a labor intensive job. I have learned quite a bit as far as new experiences go working in a warehouse, as this was my first warehouse job. Management for Walmart is not exactly what I would see as good management, as they are quick to write you up, but not tell you what you did or how to improve. The employees there are generally good people and it can be a fun environment. I like the shift I work and the fact I do have four days during the week after working for three days. They pay well, but they use that to their advantage, as they say, ""they care about their employees."" When it comes down to it, actions do not match the words."
bad,bad store manager ... bad place bad people 1 shift
bad,Walking into Walmart doors is pretty unpredictable you are titled as one job code but doing another mostly over your pay rate which goes unnoticeable to the management team
bad,"Management lies to you all the time, they make promises of promotions and rarely come through. If your a friend of one of the managers then you'll get whatever you want."
bad,"I was given about a week of help learning how things are done, then left on my own and expected to know details of the ENTIRE store. "
bad,"From my experience, this was just a job with no opportunity for advancement. The training was non-existent.  Management really didn't see me except to give a yearly review, which they would never rate anyone the highest level, usually a step or two below, and then tell you you would get the standard 40 cent raise. A lady who started working after I had been there a year, who was typically very mean and bossy, but also somehow friends with one of the managers was promoted.  Management never asked/shared with me a career path.  I didn't feel like Walmart really cared about their employees."
bad,"Your training is computer based and if you do it wrong they will let you know but hard to get real help from management, you don't get much praise otherwise really on if you exceeded your sales for the day do it for the week and then well do it for the month now (so don't expect much) your expected to ""network"" your job essential resources because they are constantly lost i.e. hand held devices you have to have to do your job. You have many managers and they all require and/or want something different, so you will redo and move product consistently just because of whose working that day. Management will throw you under the bus to save themselves so you have to constantly cover your own self. Atmosphere with fellow associates is very much like high school, clingy and drama, not the most professional."
bad,"A typical day consists of managing inventory, placing orders, and overseeing staff. Working in three different departments, I learned much about the products I was selling, and how to use them."
bad,the management is horrible you come to work and work and they are not loyal you come to work no breaks no nothing and you just work with unattentive manager and none caring ppl
bad,the managers are gigantic on favoritism and they are all involved outside of work. They over work you and have you work in other areas that get paid more than you while you get the base pay.
bad,no communication. Horrible management . Got yelled at and accused of starting a rumor that I didn’t start while I was on vacation. Taken in by management while they took sides of someone that should have been fired years ago.
bad,The worst job I’ve ever had. The pay and benefits were good but we’re not worth a what I had to put up with for management. One of the worst managers I’ve ever worked for. Also an experienced it with a bad attitude. Awful awful place to work
bad,Management very disrespectful.. Hours are not enough and lets not speak on the discrimination of gender.. Im so glad i got away from this place.. If you don't kiss butt or have a slave mentality this place isn't for you!!
bad,"Honnêtement, c'est le dernier endroit où je voulais travailler, mais depuis 1 an, mes problèmes de peau se sont agravés et c'est le seul endroit qui m'ait rappelé. La chimie entre les employés est excellente ""dans mon magasin"", mais dans les autres magasins elle l'est beaucoup moins! "
bad,Walmart is not place to work at for any real length of time. The position was okay for a couple of months in between real work. I would never stay there for more thant that.
bad,"As a salary member of management you have to work all the time. If your store manager wants you to work 7 days with no off days, you have to work this schedule. The hours are terrible and this is not a great place to be if you have family or ever want to see them. The Hourly associates get paid less but treated better. If you want to be a manager you can be a department manager or a Support because they are hourly managers but can only work 40 hours a week and your guaranteed to get your off days."
bad,bad place to work overworked understaffed robbed of bonuses treated poorly by management and customers worse place ever worked i have nothing else to say
bad,"Manager chose favourites, favourites got extra breaks, more raise options, constant coddling. Lunch was long enough but other breaks were not. Point system was outrageous"
bad,"Is very stressful place , management treat their associates so wrong , they talk how everything is about helping other and family but when it comes to it they dont care about it.  Instead of training there associates or assistants properly they trowbthem out there and expect them to figure it out and if they dont they get coach out of the job.  Yes they raise wages but cut their hours to the minimum  ."
bad,They don't care about their associates. They give bad evaluations to people that deserve better and fire others without just cause. I highly recommend working somewhere else if your a hard worker because the upper management will just bring you down!
bad,The management at Walmart needs a lot of work they work other harder than other people and they deny your requested off days no matter what they are. They denied my off days for going to my own graduation.
bad,Walmart really lacks communication and treats us like robots.I wish I kept my job longer only if they had the old managers back I am greatful for all the skills I learned.
bad,"Once i transferred i felt insecure and hated, I loved my old store but i lived over and hour away and could no longer afford to drive back and forth. This store was difficult."
bad,I really didn't mind working there when I first started. The constant change in management is a huge downfall. The managers that had been there the longest stayed there in my opinion by using associates as scape goats for things not getting  done. In reality I saw that most of the people in upper management were very lazy and self-centered.  They would rarely have any time to help anyone and make excuses to not do things that the associates asked of them. I really do not recommended working here unless you want to be stressed out all the time and constantly worrying about your job because you work in a department where the management doesn't do their job.
bad,"in person will explain there was a lot of not so good things going on.  woud like to discuss in person if able to.  I am very detailed, reliable and ambitious"
bad,"The Walmart I particularly was awful. The management was slow and rude and mostly focused on themselves than working in a team. The area was also filthy. No matter how much you would clean the registers, there would always be roaches crawling in between the crevices of the registers. Even the supervisors and assistant store managers were rude and mostly kept to themselves. Overall, the Walmart I had worked at was the worst place I have ever worked out and makes me hesitate to ever apply to another Walmart again."
bad,Walmart employees are treated unfairly and get penalized for days they need off. It's an unfair workplace all around and I would never recommended working at walmart
bad,They have no idea how to effectively run a store everyone is just running around like they're heads cut off. Not only that you could make one little slip up And you'd lose your job
bad,Walmart was okay. I just didn't like the long hours at the time because I was pregnant. By me being new; I wasn't able to change my schedule. The start off pay was okay at the time.
bad,"Everything else with Walmart is designed to get you two steps closer to the end of you career with them....if you last more the 10 yrs...they will push you out, and then tell you it's because the company is looking to go the other way, and you just don't make the cut.Its for the good of the business."
bad,The hardest part of the job was that no one help keep things in order. And anyone can call Walmart and lie on an employee and they can get fired for that.
bad,"Lack of culture, lack of respect from management and peers. Unrealistic expectations of requests made on a daily basis. Understaffed, stressful, and overwhelming."
bad,"Walmart was my First REAL job so it taught me ALOT!. As far as customer service skills being very patient,dealing with money and  multitasking. which was great as a first job that’s all I needed to start. And now I love anything that has to do with customers service and sales."
bad,A typical day is dealing with lazy associates and coworkers. Everything was always a blame game and rating you out to make themselves looks better. Also my 10 hour shift was always like 13. My store manager would always threaten me if I wanted to leave on time. She was very verbally abusive towards me and other associates. She showed a lot of favoritism towards 2 particular male assistant managers. Culture is horrible and had the worse experience working there.
bad,Pay sucks and they will screw you every way possible. I was a Customer Service Manager every day but never recieved the pay for it. They would have me work full time hours for a set amount of weeks then drop my hours way low to insure I wouldn't get forced into full time. Some of my cashiers made more money than I did
bad,el trabajo consistía en surtir pedidos  vía Internet
bad,Not the best job i've had. Would not go back. very fast pace and very hard to keep up. They butter you up but they don't care to much about their employees. only about the numbers
bad,"Walmart if ran correctly could be a great company. However the Gaylord, MI Walmart is a joke. With favoritism is what runs that store.  Management  there is doesn't take associate concerns seriously."
bad,It's ok. It's starting to change and it's effecting the employees. They cut back hours to much and the management doesn't take care of the employees to make sure they are well off as well as customers.
bad,"Working at walmart was the beginning of my retail career. Initially I enjoyed it, as i grew and got promoted within the company i started to see the higher management see us as just associates and not as people. Life issues do not matter and we were treated as just robots designed to do a job with no emotion."
bad,"I dislike the fact that you can get laid off at anytime regardless of performance. It's understandable Walmart needs to keep up with their competitors, but there internal approach with employees is just ruthless. It is very boring and you are expected to do more with less. Check out the layoffs website under Walmart. You'll see how most employees feel."
bad,"I left when a manager flat out lied about me to get me written up. It was pretty much the same issues every day, and nothing ever changed. Customers feel entitled to your attention even if you are with another customer."
bad,"I worked at the distribution center for almost 5 years and in that time I had seen Walmart take more and more from the associates but ask for more and more out of them. While the pay was good, it wasn't worth having to not only do my job but do other's jobs as well. As a high level manager stated ""get more out of your associates"". That job was a good way to get your feet planted and to get your life started but I would not recommend staying in the company to anyone. I enjoyed my coworkers and the manager I had when I left but I had worked for bad managers and bad ops managers which the company likes to hold on to."
bad,"Mejoren salarios "
bad,"Walmart is very good at promoting internally. However, the negatives highly outweigh the positives! Walmart Assistant management is required to work 50 hours a week, but are not compensated for all that they're responsible for! They have hourly associates making over $20/hour and Assistants making $18/hour for 50 hours!!! Plus, they require you to work 12 hour shifts on overnights for a year! They rarely give you enough support for the overnight shift, so you as a ASM are a stocker yourself! Let's just say that Walmart needs to re-think how they treat their Assistant Managers!"
bad,"very stressful work environment, certain ethnic groups aren't expected or made to work depending on management, forced over time and time cuts for staying late. Termination for being given an item that was considered trash on camera while other steal money from registers and get jobs back within the week. Very unprofessional work place."
bad,horrible place to work they are all over the place they dont know what they want and where they are going. they dont pay you enough money to match the responsibilites
bad,The management could care less that your mom is sick and dying.  You had better show up for work or you won't have a job.  You have 13 hours worth of work that you better get done in 6 or you'll be disciplined.
bad,"I believe that this job pays well, but the management are not there for their employees. I felt ignored unless they had a project for me to do. They were not supportive."
bad,"Wal-Mart is not a good place to work.  For a manager, the compensation is fair but the expected hours can be overwhelming.  Also, a manager is not given tools to be successful.  The culture is focused on failure and negativity."
bad,Would not recommend this company after being employed there for almost18 years. Recent restructuring has lowered morale within the stores. Displaced long term associates.
bad,It's alot changes going on in the company but it not good changes. Alot of their core laws are not being practice among everyday associates. They have decent benefits.
bad,The company has no regards for everyday life situations that may occur. You literally have to be on your death bed for them to even not think about firing you
bad,"A nice place to work at."
bad,We were in a division one store which are smaller than super centers.  The store was ran more like a family. You always new who was in trouble or the favorite.
bad,"What i had learned working at Walmart was it was a waste of my time. I went above and beyond to get the job done and i wasn't appreciated. I was treated like i didn't matter and the job that i did wasn't important. All that mattered to management was making them look good. Management was rude and disrespectful. Didn't know how to talk to employees. There were employees that had no management skills, no people skills, were very unprofessional and were not team players were made department manager."
bad,"Company changes programs far too often, causing for a stressful work environment. Management is unorganized. Store manager cares more about backroom organization than what salesfloor looks like."
bad,"I do not recommend Wal Mart on Forest Dr in Columbia, Sc. It was the worst place i've ever worked. I was fired because someone said I stole money that was never there and instead of investigating they just fired me. They have horrible management skills. The managers can be more rude than the customers."
bad,This place is awful!!! There were like 7 bosses you had to answer to and you couldn’t ever get a project done because they always interrupted you and made you work on other tasks.
bad,"Apparently we are the worst DC in the nation, and as a team we pull about 75% daily, because we have way too much volume and not enough employees. This means regular 14-15 hour days every week, and being written up for low production weekly. I mean I come to work in the -20° freezer killing myself for these 15 minute breaks every 3 hours, just so I can get closer and closer to getting fired every week. Warehouse morality is low, and the job is lonely. Nice paychecks if you can deal with the stress and depression."
bad,"This is the most horrendous work enviroment I have ever been in.  They expect to much out of the human body.   NO matter how hard you work, its never ever good enough.  "
bad,"I greatly enjoyed the unknown daily challenges and finding a quick resolution.  I miss the customer service aspect and being part of the community. Best part was being head of the ACH Children's Miracle Network, where I won best in Region Award."
bad,I was lucky to have decent management where I worked though I changed 4 stores in a small period of time. Its walmart there is nothing much to say about it
bad,"Worst company to work for. One person does 10 jobs. No support or respect at all. Understaffed. Underappreciated. Underpaid. Unrealistic expectations. No communication/support from Assistant Managers. Head office should try doing the work for 1 week before cutting corners and assuming everything takes 5 minutes. Just like Sears closed, Walmart can as well. Oh and the more work you do, the less you're appreciated."
bad,Employees are thrown into jobs without adequate training. These employees then make errors that flow through to the other shifts and cause problems that make it difficult to get your own job done. This is not just an occasional problem that would be able to be worked through but an ongoing problem that management is unwilling to get resolved.
bad,My job experience at Walmart was horrible. They treat their employees like trash. They talk to employees any kind of way and coach employees for unecessary things.
bad,From the top to the bottom Walmart not the company for me. Work inviorment very high school ish top store story a joke new market store in five years not going to have employees self checkouts only going to need stockers
bad,It was a horrible job. I will never work there again. The management didn't treat there employees very well. They did not make it very pleasurable.  That is my review.
bad,"Walmart isn't what it is since I first started. They change policies without knowing how to explain to associates, they change the schedule without notification, ANF the point system is terrible for attendance, your not even guaranteed a bonus anymore and you don't get paid for the job you do."
bad,I don't think Walmart treat their workers well. The give me good benefits but it's just not enough to make ends meet I need another job to be where I'm at with my bills
bad,"I love that I got to talk and interact with people one on one. I even had loyal return customers, because of my attitude would wait in my long line just to say hello."
bad,"Walmart is by no means a difficult job, but is a bad experience in most cases. Not only are they very strict on almost everything, there is no real career advancement, everyone is out for themselves, all around a bad experience. Kinda like working for McDonald's, we all know it's a bad job. That is Walmart."
bad,"when i started Walmart GBS (coperate) i was told that i would have 22 stores to account for, by the end of the training i had 49 stores, then the company added more processes and work and no extra pay, every 3 months we are given more responsibility and no more money, i saved a store 200k and i was not rewarded, we get a base bonus every year, and pennies raise every year. i hate this company and i want to be out ASAP"
bad,I hated working for this company. Some of the managers really sucked. I wouldn't do over night shift ever again. They were really rude and didn't care about the employees.
bad,Worked there 2 years and ended up getting pregnant and missing too much work due to excessive morning sickness. Wasnt even offered maternaty leave or anything. Just fired and told to reapply in 6months
bad,"I was a cashier at Walmart a couple of summers ago, and my experience there was terrible. There is very little organization in management, and managers ranged from lethargic to incompetent. Customers were also generally hard to deal with, and the store was just not a very clean place. If I had the chance, I would have found a different job that summer."
bad,"Way too many employees so you go unnoticed manager barely remember you after a year of employment but it is a easy place to get hired , pay is ok but it could be better for the hard work"
bad,Company constantly changes policies and procedures. Also to many of these are not followed. Has good benefits for health care and stocks and 401k. Probly differents store to store though.
bad,You'll develop a neurosis working for this company. If you want to feel underappreciated and overworked you'll find this company is a right fit for you.
bad,"the management doesn't seem to care about you as a person all they care about is the bottom line and who is doing it. they dont care about the white people that work there they are spanish origin and thats what they want to hire, so they treat the white like dirt on their shoes."
bad,"very fast paced"
bad,"very stressful, to many rules allways changing management does not listen, hard to make production  I have been with this company for 13 years need to move on"
bad,"First day of my job had a person that would work for Walmart for 10 years walk up to me and tell me you wanted to get me fired"
bad,Everyone has a Wal-Mart story most true some not my guess is they are all the same poor management makes a bad situation worse it's not for me and no one I worked with is still employed their
bad,"management are rude customers are not the problem its management , you never know who to listen too , company doesn't care about employees as much as they say"
bad,There are too many managers with different opinions on what and how something needs to be done. An employee is required to finished several online tutorials over a 6 month period but none of the managers let you get onto a computer.
bad,Hated Walmart lack of pay for the duties performed. Low hours & lack of motivation from management not any follow through on s.o.p great for high school students but Walmart is not a very good career choice to work for
bad,"Hate walmart, supervisors stand there and watch you work while they laugh and talk. Managment never has there s*** together, scheduling is garbage, would not tell someone to apple ay walmart"
bad,They just don't compete with Costco as a quality / desirable place to work. Hold them to your work schedule! They thrive on gullible employees and expect them to stay overtime w/o notice.
bad,Everything was so relaxed. I gained no experience. The purpose of all jobs is to advance your knowledge and your experience. I would not want anyone to waste their time working here.
bad,They promote employees to management positions without first looking through and seeing if someone would be more qualified for the job and put work loads on employees wthat overwork them.
bad,"I worked there 5 and a 1/2 years, once you get to the top of your pay scale , they find a reason to let you go. So they can hire someone else at a cheaper rate of pay."
bad,"I've only worked at the one location. I liked my job. I just could not tolerate the rest.  I sincerely hope not all Walmart's have the same type of blind eye management when it comes to workplace culture. The hardest part of the job were the co-workers and management. The best part were the customers. When I accepted the job, I thought the hard part would be interfacing with so many different types of customers. They were the best part. The worst were the so called ""Team Members"" including management. If you are an individual that matches 99.9% of the employee base, you should do well if you're willing to work hard. It is physically demanding."
bad,"I personally hated my job there at Walmart, it was hard balancing school and the job because it’s so demanding. There are absolutely NO sick days workers can take off, and the point system is ridiculous to me."
bad,Walmart did not work with my school schedule it was very hard to advance there was alot of favoritism managers weren’t helpful great workers but management is very poor.
bad,"Just a number and when you have a health issue they find a way to get rid of you.  They don't care if you have family issues either, and when your done with your work your expected to do other peoples jobs that slack off"
bad,"That says it. My Husband is full-time, they're giving him 20 hrs next week. They me back to 32 hrs. I cannot afford to lose $400/mo because corporate is making cut-backs."
bad,The employees are not treated fairly an your not recognized for your hard work nor get a raise very often an only paid every two weeks most people are fired for missing days when they are sick or thier kids are sick
bad,"Walmart had no structure, no accountability, and no positive leadership. Supervisors cursing employees, lying on them to cover for themselves, and never accountable for what they do. Their only recourse is to throw the associate under the bus. Very unfair in way of treatment of employees."
bad,"Working for Walmart was very stressful. The rules changed a lot, For example, one week overtime is mandatory, the next they cute hours short. This happened consistently and without notice. Also they overwhelm employees with work that is IMPOSSIBLE to get done in the shift that you are scheduled."
bad,"En tant qu'employée à temps plein, les 3 premières années, ont été plus que satisfaisante, le gérant en place était très strict mais savait reconnaître et apprécier les bons employés - ceux qui travaillaient vraiment... "
bad,"culture of this company is not what it seems. Management's mistreatment of employees are nasty, degrading, and disrespectful. The company takes from the employees and offers less in return."
bad,"Not for me, did not like working here at all. This is a grat place for someone's first job or college student. Maybe my experience would've been different at another store where management lead by example and really cared about what is going on in th store."
bad,"Very rude and judging just by how you look, people get away with slacking off while others work hard and still get in trouble for ""not doing their job"". Hours always jump around making it hard to plan things like doctors appointments and whatnot. Management played favorites and found little things to pick at if they did not like you for any reason, even if you did your work and didn't get involved with things."
bad,"Management does not listen very well to associates, they played favorites with other employees. When they didn't like someone they would threaten associates jobs and make them feel like the hard work they were doing wasn't enough."
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. Aside from the pay, I hated this job, the managers were awful  and the Employees were all unhappy and i Hated the environment."
bad,I enjoyed to work for Walmart when I first started there. The last five years they started pushing everyone do do three different jobs. In my opinion was running off all older employee. I would have worked for Walmart toll I decided to fully retirement
bad,From the day i started to the last day. It was a joy working with the drivers on a day to day basis.  They helped me out a lot and i helped them out. It was great to see the drivers who have driven a lot of miles with accident free get a new truck.
bad,The management doesn't care about the customers . they say the customer comes first but they really don't and as a cashier you will be the one who gets in trouble because it takes someone 20 mins to come help
bad,I didn't find Wal-Mart  a company to build a career due to the small support of financial compensation that is given to an hourly worker is not enough to make it by.
bad,I was not given a fair chance to work there. I was misinformed about information. I ended up becoming pregnant so I had to leave because I did not feel safe.
bad,I worked in the bakery and it was the worst job I have ever had. It was terrible because of constant harassment and favoritism by the bakery supervisor. I was hired for a position that I never got. I was in school and they worked with my hours but gave the bare minimum. The pay was alright for work.
bad,"This was the most stressful job I had. I learned that maybe I don't have the thickest skin, and repetitive motion will take a toll on your joints. The worse part of the job was ornery customers. The most enjoyable part was when the shift was over."
bad,A typical day oat Walmart is working freight. And basically doing the job of ten people being only one. Management doesn’t care about associates and pick favorites to praise even though they don’t do anything.
bad,"Walmart managers don't practice what they preach especially following walmart policies, morals and beliefs especially having or and showing respect toward associates (individuals). They have treated me and other former associates unfairly, especially while others have broken the rules, policies, morals, and the beliefs that are supposed to be upheld by the store Manager(s), and supposed to be more responsibly upheld, honored more by all managers. thats not the case."
bad,"Manager would call associates names cuss them when you would defend them he would cuss you and get out of hand.Most of the associates that worked maintenace and cart pusher positions were or had some kind of a disability. you do not treat those people mean, if you have to explain in detail do so, never call them no good lazy sorry, or anything else to those lines.  That's what this store manager did."
bad,My experience with Walmart was negative. They did not listen to what the employees said or give breaks and meals on time. They also take the word of other employees before talking to you. There was no communication and a lack of training.
bad,they don't really care about their workers they showed favoritism to some. when it came to cutting hours they only cut certain peoples hours. they no longer guarantee hours if your full time. I went from working 78 to 80 hours every two weeks to working 28 to 30 hours every two weeks. there was no way to keep working there with me no longer getting full time hours.
bad,"They have inexperienced management, company does not care about your family, they schedule all kinds of crazy hours you have to be someones favorite to move up in the company even if you do a better job."
bad,"It would be nice if what their statement of values in print would match with the actual lack thereof. Once you are salary - you are nothing unless you cave into treating all subordinated like mules; the same way in which you are treated. And, by the way, DM's do not want the truth. So, if you are accustomed to lying and cheating your way to the top, then Walmart is the place to be."
bad,"Walmart is changing everything and making it harder and harder to have a life outside of Walmart they own you if you're a manager you can't leave until things are done you work on your days off. you were there 10 hours or more. They don't care about their people anymore some management tries to protect them but they can't protect them from the district managers and higher-ups they only care about making money. It's nothing like it used to be and it's ruining the company."
bad,Used to be if you was part time you get the same benefits as a full-time but they cut that out so don't like it they also cut OT didn't like that and they also want you to so many departments in that 8 hour shift and no ot once again
bad,I like that it's fast pace and great benefits customers are rude management don't treat staff with respect and have picks for their favorite employees
bad,"I would not recommend this job for my friends and family, because they do not follow up with what they say they are going to do. Poor management skills and only advance certain people for management opportunities."
bad,I cashiered for 5 hours at Walmart. The work environment was not very clean. It was a fast pace job making the time fly by. The hardest part of the job was working in an unclean environment. I did enjoy the people that worked with me though.
bad,I was allowed to provide great customer service and establish a great relantionship with customers. I learn to listen to people concern and make them feel happy about there choices
bad,"if management has no idea in which direction they are going then the associates most certainly do not know which way they are going,"
bad,I didnt get paid for all of my overtime when I worked there. It was before they had there big lawsuit. That was why I quit. They wouldn't fix my checks. Poor Management for the most part. I had a few freat bosses.
bad,"The people that were on the same level as me were wonderful, but a majority of the management was awful. They were rude and I dreaded coming to work with them. I will not work at walmart again or recommend my friends until the management changes."
bad,I would not recommend employment at wal-mart. I learned how to hate management. The culture was divided. The most difficult part was asking for help from management members who were clear about their feelings of disdain towards their employees.
bad,Vary hard company to work for.  Management has vary bad attitudes and are young.  Dont get raises based on performance only if you suck up to management.
bad,"During my time at Walmart I was constantly degraded and publicly humiliated by my store manager and co-manager.  I worked from 5am-1am most days and typically 6 or 7 days per week.  I had no life, my health suffered, I rarely had a full day off and when I did the store manager would call to curse at me about something completely out of my control.  As the operations manager it was my job to staff the store, I interviewed potential associates every day, but most could not pass the drug test or background check, lack of staffing was beyond my control, but yet my job was threatened and I was cursed out every day for not hiring more people."
bad,Do more with a lot less because budgets are not attainable.  Never good enough or able to keep associates due to inconsistent direction and workload.  No support from supervisors outside of the store
bad,"Everyone knows that Walmart is awful to work for. I worked for them because I needed money immediately so I went into it with my eyes open and it was exactly as I expected."
bad,The management doesn't know what they are doing. Neither do the OPs managers and even the HR people.  They benefits are awesome and the pay is amazing. But working with racist  unknowledgable people isn't worth it.
bad,"They worked you like a robot, management was horrible, favoritism, unprofessional, double standards. Lack of communication between upper and lower management."
bad,Don't really wanna put anything sorry to say hey hey hey no way mojo idk I guess short breaks change things constantly poor management that's the worst part is management I believe
bad,"Gostei de trabalhar lá, por mim ficaria um bom tempo."
bad,If you want to work long hours and have no social life then this company is for you. Typical day is working 14 hr days with no lunch sometimes and not being able to leave till the standards of the store are met.
bad,"Working at Walmart isn't too bad. Except for all the miserable jerks that shop there that ruin your day. The pay isn't worth the supervisor position. I honestly wish I stayed a cashier because its not as stressful and you get paid almost as much as the supervisor, in some cases more. There is a lot worse jobs out there though."
bad,it was like working as slave labor and no help from any managers in constant ciaos. everything you were asked to do contradicted policies. they had unrealistic goals set that could not be completed. you also got into trouble for things out of your hands or things you couldn't complete even though it was the managers jobs.
bad,There are tons of lazy managers that make lots of money doing virtually nothing while associates get screwed. Also always looking for a reason to fire you.
bad,"Basically a dead end job unless you're a kiss butt. Much like a job as an assembly worker they expect you to work until your back breaks. No recognition, no equality."
bad,"It's a job ,not the greatest one .managment needs improvementcoworkers are okay.to big of a  turnaround most enjoyable part is going home in the morning. Wouldn't hurt for managment to get their hands dirty."
bad,"Must have a confident, willing to do anything to succeed, attitude. Able and willing to do anything you're told to do, even if it's not explicitly written out in your job description."
bad,"Não gostei muito de trabalhar lá,  pois só tinha horário certo para entrar e não para sair."
bad,"Enjoyed it in the beginning then hatred it a few months in but needed the job to pay off bills. Managers will make you do extra work for the same pay rate, with make you do other job positions that are not your own, will make you stay late and in some cases a managers job title while your still an associate."
bad,"I've worked there for almost 6 years now, and know people are coming in off the street getting paid above me, There is no room for advancement because they would rather hire others than promote from within. Terrible company, greedy, selfish, unfair. 0/5 stars"
bad,I learned alot from my manager and has made me a better person and overall worker.  I conduct my tours around the store.  Inside and outside the store.
bad,"It's best to start getting buddy buddy with management so you can get what you want. Favoritism is played BIG TIME. I mean yeah it's a check. But it leaves you stressed out big time, some management and supervisors don't know what they're doing in both daytime and night time"
bad,"No hours, no opportunities. Benn there 5 years and nothing good has changed about it. I'm looking for another job that I will matter in and respect more"
bad,"A very stressful job."
bad,"They only let me do Part-Time even though I have no reason I can't work full time. They did not work with me when I had to have fixed hours when I became pregnant, instead, they just did not give me hours."
bad,I don’t have anything to really say about Walmart. The people at the one I worked are a rude and hateful people. They made every day working there the worse experience of my life. The management are bullies and don’t follow proper protocol.
bad,The work itself is simple but the people that work there are treated diffrently based on whether or not you are always there there are allot of favorites
bad,this would have  been a good job i was excited about the raise and did not investagte the reason the postion was open or i wuld have never took the job
bad,I worked their for 5 months and it was stressful and they don't appreciate your work also you stand on your feet all day and it becomes very tiring I wouldn't work here again.
bad,"Too few managers, too few experienced pharmacy associates. Work yourself to death should be the motto. As soon as we go"
bad,"The work area provided was disgusting, smelling of rot and chemicals. The tools provided to assemble bikes were the bare minimum needed, and my coworker and I would often have to fight over the meager tools. Walmart was a terrible location, and I would recommend working here as a last resort only."
bad,you had to be liked by management to get promoted it just wasn't up to your job performance and rules didn't apply if you are liked preached teamwork but they hadn't a clue about what it takes to be on a team
bad,horrible experience only black asst manager and was treated badly.   feared for my life working there. i work there doing the best i could but everyday i had to look over my shoulder.
bad,"A little like walking through a haunted house.  Just when you think you are safe, some crazy zombie jumps out and axes you.  For no good reason.  I mean, all you are doing is walking through the house."
bad,Te exigen más de lo que puedes y el salario es muy bajo.
bad,In the years that I worked at Walmart I can honestly say that I drank the koolaid.  I believed this was a family oriented company.  I did my best and received excellent reviews.  When my position was eliminated it was almost as if I had been disowned by a family member.
bad,I've only worked there for about 3 weeks. When I was interviewed I specified that I was in school at night so I was only able to work mornings and afternoons. Once I actually received the job they told me that I had to pick between the two.
bad,upon starting work you are expected to know what to do from the beginning with little to no help. if certain quotas are not met by the end of the shift you may be required to stay past scheduled hours.expectations of quotas are extremely high. management doesn't understand the toughness of the job due to not performing the job themselves.
bad,"Management didn't give brakes on time sometimes not at all, hardest part was dealing with irate customers, had some fun joking around, typical work day was long and drawn out"
bad,Management does not communicate well at all. Lack of training. Very fast paced. Too much physical labor and demanding continuously. Very tough jobs and very unorganized.
bad,the managers are very horrible at the one i was at i did every position in the store and they wouldn't give me a raise at all they use people to get things done and don't give them credit for it
bad,Absolutely awful. Management is rude. Hours suck. Front end is treated awfully by everyone. Only good thing was my cashiers. Made coming in worth it everyday.
bad,"Do not like the company, they treat hard working people very, very bad.   I use to love wal-mart working with them off and on since 2000.I had enough of there mess.    A typical day at work  over night people alway leave there work for the morning  people, I learned they only care about some worker,   the hardest part of the job getting along with  manager .  The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer, I talk to  a lot of good customer that alway ask me why are you hear at this place , because they saw some of the thing have said or done to assiocate. On the floor."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is not seeing your family alot.  It depends on the shift that you work.  Some of the management are respectful and act professional.  The most enjoyable is working with a lot of great people. You are always learning something new, which is good."
bad,This job was very active and the high production kept you constantly going. Management in some areas more than others are very rude to their associates and have no filter when it comes to how relationships should be handled at a work environment.
bad,"I would not advise this work place, you will always feel like you never have a job even if you pass the probation, management is horrible they treat employees unbelievably bad and nothing is ever done about it when asked for help. their benefits are good and pay at the warehouses if your hired on by Walmart and not drake or ect.. is good, but the managers/TL's are unbelievably disrespectful!. I would never work for a Walmart company again any where near the Cornwall area."
bad,"Walmart is the worst place i have ever worked. Every employee is expendable. They expect you to spend all your time working there and never have time off. You could be on your death bed and theyd still want you to come to work. They claim to be cooperative to employees who are trying to further their education as well as work but the minute you cant work a shift because you have a college class that you informed them of already and they scheduled you to work anyway, they cut your hours down so much that its impossible to continue to even come to work let alone go to college.then when you complain about the hours being cut they tell you there are no hours to give you because they just hired 10 new employees."
bad,"There wasn't ever much communication between everyone, they expect way too much of one person let alone a team, managers are power hungry I swear, reward the lazy not the hard workers."
bad,"Continuesd Stress with under developed management,  nothing is ever good enough, never a thank you from management,  constant down talking and no training.."
bad,"Job does not provide proper training and no support from upper management. Constantly have to cover shifts in other areas of store simply because there were not enough people scheduled. Store manager is unapproachable, condescending and unprofessional."
bad,Walmart doesnt care about you or your family.mandatory overtime with no notice you better show up.they always remind you that you can be replaced at any time.
bad,"The hours were very inconsistent. You could work a 40 hour week then a 24 hour week. You have to practically beg for hours. Working over your scheduled hours is prohibited! The pay is good, but not worth it if you don't have hours. Management is awful. Never felt so unappreciated in my life. Quick to tell you when you've made a mistake but never praise for a job well done. Management pays no mind to company policy and completely throws it out the window."
bad,"I do not like working here and I never did. I only got this job to buy a house. The only good part about the job is the pay, other than that it feels like a prison."
bad,The managers sucks. Walmart is not a place i would tell anyone to work unless they really needs a job. Walmart is not a fair place to work they have favorites.
bad,"Its like home away from home"
bad,"A typical day for a member of management is very long."
bad,"Very poor management "
bad,"No matter how hard you work, you will not get promoted with this company unless you abandon your job and suck up to the managers. If, however, you hate working and would prefer to just talk all day... This may be the perfect job for you since they do not fire any slackers unless their attendance is bad."
bad,They have a strict attendance policy.  It does not allow you to be sick for any length of time. So if you feel like you are sick they expect you to stay.
bad,"I think Walmart has forgotton about there associates. When I first started there it was a great company Sam Walter made it like a family but now it is so not like that at all, They don't care about the ASSOCIATE ARE CUSTOMER I work there 20 yrs made one mistake broke a policy an they didn't give me a second chance I was a good associate never late always there went above my job duties didn't steal or lie was very loyal to Walmart but that didn't matter . I was told by RMAPA that it didn't matter what I had done in the pass it matter about right now. So they let me go but I know of other assocatie who did the same thing but they let them stay working and they just coached them, They are not fair with all of the associate.They should treat everyone the same I know this dose not matter to yall and noithing will be done but this is how I feel about . Also there was time when customers where first now  they are lucky if they can get check out or find a associate on the floor to help them. Also no one is perfect but people make mistake but they can be given a second chance."
bad,"Very fast paced environment, many advancement opportunities if desired.  Customer service is a must.  Many shifts available, days, nights, overnights, weekends."
bad,"A typical day here is management telling you you have to get a whole list of time consuming tasks done, and they are ALL a priority. The company puts one person in charge of departments way too big, and gives them the minimum amount of employees and wonders why things aren't done in a timely or thorough manner. This company sets people up to fail, and they wonder why they have such a horrific turn over rate. What I learned is if you have a good work ethic and take pride in your hard work, you will be taken advantage of, and you will never feel like you're accomplishing anything. The company never provides enough equipment, so employees are constantly battling for resources. Even if you are lucky to work with decent people, the company itself and all it's ridiculous and delusional expectations creates an extremely negative atmosphere. And the pay is no where near where it needs to be to make working there worth it."
bad,"Working in pharmacy was fun and fast paced, not a lot of interaction with management. As an assistant manager, no fun at all, scheduling was a nightmare."
bad,Respect is a policy yet the new store manager does not have to follow it! She is allow to demote long term associates and transfer her people in. I have never seen associates being treated so badly before. Associates have made reports to home office and nothing is done.
bad,Day to day working was great because your basically by yourself so no need having to depend on someone. The job required your full attention n dedication which i loved i go hard for my work because i lead by example not talk.
bad,"Walmart was a great paying job, but the amount of stress that comes with it is not worth it! The management is very unprofessional and you can sense racism a mile away. I worked at the one in Parma OH on Ridgewood Dr and it was by far the worst environment,"
bad,"what you are told in orientation is stretching the truth as far as working with YOUR schedule. If you are available 24/7 all is good, but if you need specific times you are told you may only get 8-10 hrs a week. VERY difficult to be full time employee, you may work full time but listed as part time to avoid insurance."
bad,This is the worst store ever. No one shows any care for customer nor employees. Management is very poor and horrible. The store is horrible itself worst place ever
bad,I've been working there for 6 years  associates working a year or less would come in making more hours & a high pay rate then I have . They truly do not care I loved working there because I love helping people ( customers ) but hate the  environment !
bad,They have competitive wages but it doesn't pay for the work that's actually being done. the only positive about working for this company is the schedule.
bad,"I hated this job. The manager I had was a bully, she would throw things at me and nothing was done about it. Very immature environment. High school is to mature for a comparison."
bad,"The store manager is rude , disrespectful,and very nasty too the workers,he has caused a lot of us workers too quick, because of his nasty demeaner,he has no people skills what so ever"
bad,The managers all had there favorites and treated everyone un equally . Job description was thrown out the window because I had to do other associates work due too lack of effort on there part . Penalties for absence were unfair due too the fact that I could not drive at all under the influence of prescribed medicine.
bad,Walmart is ok if you need a quick job or a second job unless you are management; the pay is not great and the customers are very rude and demanding.  Its not for everyone.
bad,"Not much to explain here, but it is great for building customer service experience."
bad,falta de liderazgo de parte de todas las autoridades de la empresa
bad,"Company never answers their phones, leaves you on hold for long periods of time, horrible management at just about every store, the only way to get into management is to suck up to the already existing management, what I learned their is valuable experience and i've gained the knowledge on practically everything retail, but it was a really bad experience for me there. Company does nothing on complaints towards other associates harassing you, management in fact harasses you, the most enjoyable part of the day was when you get to clock out and the hardest part of the job is waking up every day knowing you have to go work there."
bad,very stessful and unorganized i learned that they could be unfair at times. some management were fair some weren'tthe job wasn't hard at all talking to the customers was enjoyable for me
bad,"Working for wal-mart you must go in with an open mind. Managers will push you to do a great job, but the benefits of working extra hard do not pay off as there is none. Trying to get promoted is one of the hardest things to do for wal-mart"
bad,"Walmart training isn't the best, you learn own your own.  You are constantly getting changes to your benefits and sometimes it's good, depending on your current status with company."
bad,"Job pay is low and with hours cut randomly, can't afford to take care of a family with these conditions. Not enough associates are scheduled to handle the work load."
bad,I just don't understand why employees are paid so poorly. Especially with the volume of freight they want pushed.managers there are more like overseers than managers
bad,"They are not as family friendly as they would like you to believe, they will cut your hours if you have an availability that is not wide open to fit their needs."
bad,The management team is not on the same page and has trouble communicating with associates. They are constantly favoring some associates and nit picking others. They have benefits with high premiums and high deductibles on insurance.
bad,"The management is terrible."
bad,Not the best manager in the world for the shop he made my life miserable and I hated working for him when I showed up in my new uniform for my new job he laughed in my face
bad,never will i return to wal-mart worst place i ever worked. They only care about making money. They will fire you for petty things... If i could go back in time i would never apply or accept the job offer.
bad,Very ignorant people working in management! The culture is ok but they are way to ableist! Ive seen people have positions in management that should have been fired long long ago.
bad,"Walmart gives great benefits"
bad,The managers don't know what they're doing but they want you to do things there way when you already know there way is stupid. The mangers all tell you different things so you will end up doing the same task more then once. They have unrealistic expectations for there empolyees. They do not like to see you happy they will find a way to bring down your mood. The most enjoyable part of the job is clock out time. Without good co-workers you will not make it throough the day without a headcahe.
bad,in my opinoin walmart was very unfair and very stresful i had a bad time working at walmart and did walmart dosen't treat there staff fairly and dosesn't care if your injured or sick you still have to to work
bad,They have changed over the years and are not as pro associate as they used to be. They give unrealistic time li e'd and u realistic expectations to associates regardless of age.
bad,never treat there employees right and they harass there employees till they quit or get fired for no reason. They pin point certain people they don't like and make there job very hard.
bad,managers sit back while the associates do all the work. They just sit back and give  They wait for us  to come into to help set up for the unloading..
bad,"The poor management of this facility is the #1 reason that I no longer work here. The training was pretty terrible and everyday consisted of constant changes to standard operating procedures making your knowledge of the job almost impossible. The constant back and forth directions from different members of management made confidence in what you were doing in daily activities not enjoyable. Most of the staff working here is funny and enjoyable to be around, they have a great sense of humor."
bad,"A typical day at work for a cart pusher involves showing up to an empty cart bay, working as hard as you can to fix the empty cart bay, and then getting yelled at by management when you sit down for 20 seconds to take a drink, or walk inside for less than a minute to use the bathroom. the management here is terrible. the company is greedy. worker's rights laws are deliberately ignored unless OSHA is called. doing so will get you fired."
bad,I get to work at 4am to start shopping for peoples orders. The hardest part is fulfilling the orders on time on a busy day. I enjoy meeting new customers. I've learned a lot about the company.
bad,Walmart pays well per hour but unfortunately it is extremely difficult to get 40 hours per week.  You have to fight for hours.  Might as well be a part time position!
bad,"Company has great ideas, policies, and wishes for their associates, but managers NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, are selfish and backstabbing. They only care about their positions and are willing to overwork their team to achieve sale goals, and other metrics. Yes the starting pay is $9 BUT expect yearly increases of 2% which translates to 2-5 cents a year."
bad,"I don't care to work with this company any longer. As an employee I don't feel comfortable and I also don't feel as  though this is a career for myself. I am looking to grow and experience more professionalism, along with higher pay"
bad,"no comment, Walmart wills  never meet what self worth is for anyone who works, long and hard for them and gives up there family to work for them. omg    the survey sucks I said my peace just want to move forward with out counting how many words I typed in here."
bad,Current mentality of Wal-Mart is profit at the expense of their employees.  Every year they try to make their personnel do more with fewer people then blame you or your supervisor for the problems this creates.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. The hours were steady, the work was not too complicated and I enjoyed working in a routine, however other associates did not treat me fairly. The women who I worked with at the Riverhead location were senior citizens who have worked for this company for a very long time and felt like they had the right to tell me what to do. I am a person who is very vocal and expresses how I feel so when they started to order me around and taking on the role of the department manager, I always reminded them they are sales associates just like me which they did not appreciate."
bad,it really depends on what store you work in.  i loved my job as an assistant manager but the upper management makes it really hard to  enjoy your job. they think we should be mean.
bad,"Employees and management knows nothing of being team players. Too much favoritism. Managers have no communication skills, nor do they communicate effectively with each other. Then if you get injuried on the job you get written up , and given a step."
bad,They suck to work for upper management was very rude they never helped me when i was under staffed as the deli manager over all bad management structure
bad,I worked here for 8 years it was gray place to work hey just go threw managers all the time I didn't like that . I worked with a lot of good people I really loved my job
bad,Walmart is great for those that need some extra money but it is hard to take care of yourself with this as an only job. Management is untruthful and they do not know the meaning of confidentiality. Management is lazy.
bad,"Walmart realize to much on a computer to meet and exceed the customers needs and wants.   As a former employee who showed up everyday to work, the management would move you from where you're supposed to be hired for and put you in another area..  Again, because of the computer system, it would cut your hours and expect the shelves to fill themselves and trucks to unload themselves..  Wal-Mart doesn't care about the employees, they don't pay them a decent wage at all.."
bad,It's a lot of favoritism that goes on in the company and the ones that do less work gets more acknowledgement then the ones who work the hardest. Everybody should get treated equally like they claim when your in orientation but it's a whole different story.
bad,"Though they pay well, it destroys your body.  They demand more work out of the same people every year and the longer you are there the more your body deteriorates."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement depending on how hard you work and who you are. Many of the managers however play favorites and don't follow up. They talk of being a family at Walmart and yet in many instances they won't work around time with your real family. The department managers and salaried managers make a decent wage, however the majority of the employees make a pitiful amount. They constantly implement new programs that become obsolete in a few weeks. They fail to put emphasis on what really matters and that is the associates and customers."
bad,At first you love the job til you learn the shady business that's going on inside. Not worth it. Some managers are great most of them are not. At first there was room for quick advancement now there are not. An the list just goes on and on.
bad,Very ghetto. All management were rude and nasty towards co workers and customers. There were bomb threats made every 2 days leaving us to sit outside in the cold for a hour or so. Worse place to work just extremely unprofessional
bad,This place has caused all types of unwanted stress in my life and no amount of money is worth my sanity! Management write you up if you sneeze to hard.
bad,even though this establishment is well known world wide the way employment is treated is poor. Most of the time there aren't enough hour available to work to receive benefits so over all a good temporary or first time place of employment.
bad,"Where do I start....they pay okay, but moving up is impossible if you are not buddy with the management, you get fired for illness or sent home for coming in with the illness. They don't really care about your doctors note or coughing, running nose, and flu like illness."
bad,Very unorganized barely had work mostly was doing alot of standing around the leads was very rude whlie in training the trainer was unprofessional wasnt giving good direction keep walking off leaving the group
bad,Its good for your first job kind of place but nothing to make a career out of it. The managers are amazing and really great people. Some of the employees are just not the greatest people to talk to
bad,"Une journee typique de travail ressemble a etre en forme physiquement parce que l on se penche et aussi les boites sont parfois lourdes."
bad,"Management did not give direction well at all. the job was temporary anyway. works on a point system, very strict about their timeclock and have to schedule off days three weeks in advance"
bad,"walmart was a great job I moved so i had to leave"
bad,"I loved working in inventory. The shift was amazing. However, the management team wasn't interested in following the inventory procedures outlined by corporate."
bad,"I did not like the management in Prairievile, La. Cashier manager was not professional, and picked on people for nothing. I worked hard for them and still was treated the way i was. I do not recommend this job."
bad,"Low pay "
bad,"Started like most jobs, I assume. First couple of years were fine. Then our store manager left and things went down hill. When he left he brought most of the better management staff. After that everything slowly started to fall apart"
bad,"From what former coworkers have said it's just the Monona Walmart, but I was put into my position with next to no training and expected to know how to do my job to the point I would be reprimanded for asking a member of management for help understanding what they wanted me to do."
bad,I enjoyed the fast pace and flow at the cash registered. The orientation module was very helpful and easy to follow.  Too many managers on the floor with no organization.  The hardest part of the job is going into a depressed atmosphere. Majority of cashier or staff on floor look miserable. The most enjoyable part of the job was having one on one with the customer and putting a happy smile on their face. Especially the senior citizens.
bad,Wal-Mart's management is awful. Wal-Mart has no regard for their employees or family. Daily mandatory overtime for months on end without any hope for time off.
bad,"The job itself was never hard. Most of the supervisors showed very little respect and regard for the hourly associates. They would often interrupt associates with delegated tasks, and scrutinize the employee when their normal tasks got behind."
bad,"Poor Management "
bad,I love my job Wal-Mart is a very good company to work for they have great benefits and great opportunities for advancement. I am just ready for a change
bad,"Walmart is an evil corporation, everyone knows that. It's no better on the store level. Managers are incompetent, rules are never enforced, pay and benefits are abysmal, job security is guaranteed and advancement is common but this leads to people becoming managers who should not be."
bad,I've only been working there about 7 months and they keep losing workers because they don't treat people right the management is terrible no one is ever around when you need them for help especially management they tend to blow customers off because they don't want to deal with them nor help them south Walmart is always out of stuff needed in deli
bad,The store managers are getting worse. The customers at Walmart are lower class and very rude here in Altoona. I worked in other Walmarts and Sams and was very happy with co workers and customers. This area is just really bad and I am ready for a change.
bad,"Walmart is thee worst place for anyone to work. I really lost my job cause I was hospitalize with pneumonia and their company does not accept any doctor slips, due to the ""hippa or hippo law""."
bad,Não proporciona Qualidade de vida não valoriza o funcionario
bad,"In all my time working there if you are not part of the ""IN"" crowd you get stuck doing what the other ""IN"" people don't feel like doing, while they stand around and talk. Your personal property suck as drinks and jackets are threatened to be removed from the front end while those who are friends with the management don't have those threats. All and all just a lousy place to work."
bad,The one thing good about Walmart is the stock options that they have of buying company stock. The 401k plan has changed since I was there to where you can contribute the Roth but it is a few years back when other employers were doing similar options.
bad,Management at the Walmart i work are not on the same page which makes employees difficult and stressful. There is no balance between work and family life.
bad,"Fast paste environment, management  unprofessional, security not safe, lack of communication. Employees unprofessional, no people skills, non decent pay. Over worked and underpay. Benefits good to expensive."
bad,"Go in the back get mc40 check it out than go to aisle and start work. Greeting, or talking to customers as they shop around and if they have any questions than I would been Glad to show them or tell them. I enjoyed the experience of doing a great job everyday and being able to be flexible wherever the managers would want for me to go. I did an exceptional job in my eyes."
bad,"The company as a whole is just a mess. It starts with the the managers or home office not giving enough hours out to accomplish their goals give out. They do not care about their employees, just making money by and means necessary."
bad,Interesting job for someone just starting out. Provides experience in material handling. Interesting to distribution end of the supply chain. Very low pay.
bad,"They make you work when they want you to, forced overtime or only half your hours. Production expectations are high. I would look for another place to work. They also promote who they like rather than who is more qualified."
bad,wal mart do not take care of their  of the people that work there you are a number not a person. They promote friend then the people that have experiment .
bad,N/a it's a job that helpings the bills  I learned that they care about their customers more than their employees There is really no room for growth the pay sucks but it's a job I will say it's a safe place to work some of the workers are ok but at the end of the day I personality don't see myself there it's people who been there over 20 years and still don't make what there suppose to I look at Wal-Mart  as a (job just over broke)
bad,After years of working at this company it has caused nothing but health problems for myself and many others. the work load  put on one person is ridiculous. regardless of pay the job is not worth your health
bad,In my opinion Walmart was too much drama for me.. my experiences there was very short lived. Defiantly didn't like it .. but cant say by the time i left there were to fond of me.
bad,"Os supervisores não sabem como liderar a equipe, são abusivos, não aceitam queixas."
bad,"Working for Walmart has given me extreme anxiety, I've always been on edge about wether or not I would lose my job. The pay is great which is why I stress about losing my job so much I'm a 21 year old single mother, and Walmart doesn't care to understand that"
bad,"It was fun meeting new people every day, but there was little to no job security and every employee was miserable there. People were constantly talking about leaving and were always afraid they were going to lose their job and no reassurance was ever given. It is seen as a low level job to hold a person over while they wait to get a ""real job""."
bad,"There was no typical workday, what I learned is  how to deal with the public and how the different departments/positions worked. The management was terrible, and they would harass employees.The culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was when it was time for you to leave and it was busy they would keep you over until they weren't busy anymore, they also did not care whether or not you were in school they would not work with your schedule."
bad,"do computer baised learning , cashier training  and then you are on your own on the job training is better cause every body learns diffrently it your basic shift work job ."
bad,they over work you even though they know you have a physical problem and I learned a job is not more important than family but they fail to see that. I will never work at Walmart again.
bad,Managers really dont care about workers.My store managers plotted to get associates fired. The job is easy but the managers stress you out and make the work environment terrible.
bad,What we got paid was ridiculous. Too many managers  and wannabe managers. The training was laughable sticking new employees in new areas and expecting great results. Don't recommend working here unless u have no bills and no responsibilities.
bad,"It's an alright place to work, if you do everything you're supposed to, you'll get by. The pay isn't bad, but you're required to get done a decent amount of training before you can achieve the pay that other associates get. The scheduling is manageable"
bad,"I worked at a very strained store, with quite a few holes in its system, so the hours were odd and not exactly enjoyable. The people who were working were 50/50 on whether or not it was good, like most places, Id say the hardest part was just working at a 24 hour store. There wasnt really anything enjoyable about it."
bad,They forgot my breaks quite frequently and did not know how to take care of their staff. Even if someone was threatening me and they heard it they would ignore it.
bad,"During a typical day of work we are required to manage our topstock in departments, zone merchandise on the shelves, unload the truck's freight, and stock our designated departments, sound easy right, 2pm-11pm. A cake walk, but no it is not.We are constantly overwhelmed with duties, we must squash all our responsibilities into a 6:30 hour timeline. If we are not finished with these responsibilites we are forced to stay over to finish them, taking time out of our personal life to get it done."
bad,This place is good to work if it weren't for the ghetto people and the point system that fires ppl left and right. It's like high school all over!
bad,"They offer a lot to those who stay for at least 6 months, but they have a hard time making sure their employees feel welcome and cared about. You may have the option to talk to supervisors, but they don't always listen to what you need."
bad,"Walmart has this policy of cutting employees hours to save money on wages, which leaves the department undermanned. There is no way possible to take care of the customer's needs when a department is undermanned. Customer's get upset and decide to shop somewhere else. So in their attempt to save 20,000 a year in wages, Walmart is sacrificing 100,000 a year in income that it would have made if they had a financial policy in place to keep customers happy. It is not smart, is not sensible, and is not sound. In addition, it leaves employees unsatisfied with the company. And when you ignore your employees, your employees will leave you."
bad,Very difficult work environment. Constantly threatening to write everyone up. very negative on a daily basis. They give you crazy amounts of work to complete and then get upset when you cannot finish the work load.
bad,"Will work you to the bone for little pay, claim that they are competitive with salaries but will fire you to prevent you from gaining a pay increase."
bad,"It's an ok job. Its good for starting out, but about after a year and you find out how things are really being run/handled it sucks. It's poorly managed and no one ever knows what actually going on."
bad,"This is a hard job that get no respect from customers or management. Walmart did raise wages last year, but it is expected that for that small increase that you will do the work of two people. Always short handed and upper management is rude and unconcerned."
bad,"I was working 7 days a week and had no off days for 2 months, and as a cashier you had to sit there and deal with customers that were not the best of people"
bad,They had no consideration for the fact the associates had lives outside of work you were not allowed to make arrangements for appointments or family requirements
bad,"Management is awful at the auburndale wal mart. they managers are not open minded as they just want you to suck up to them all day and do exactly what they say as they run around the store mingling with each other. Whether they are correct or not, they will  just try and use threats against anyone who is still in their 6 month period"
bad,"Extremely inconsistent hours. Some times of year I worked 75 hours per week then others I would get dropped below 30.  The main problem I had was the constant firing of managers and supervisors. Over the last year, my direct boss has changed 5 times and the other person who does my job the days I'm not there changed 4 times."
bad,The Seagoville Walmart was getting too corrupt . They only looked out for the ones that always having conversations with them . I just kept my distance at the Seagoville Walmart because I been at the Walmart in Pineville for a year & not once have I got in trouble with management but soon as I got to Seagoville's I get coached & everything else.
bad,Mansfield store is a bad store with terrible managers that don't know how to run the store. Bad attitudes and being ignored most of the time by them while also being treated like slaves.
bad,The Rio Rancho location let go so many people everyday and for bad reasons. I was the only one working after 8pm and had customers in 10 different departments asking me for help and when I would do my job I would get in trouble and told to stay in one department and not help anyone outside of my department.
bad,People here are typically rude and have a tendency to make you feel really small. The money was good but not worth it when compared to how I felt as an employee.
bad,Crapppy new sick time and absence policy causes many terminations. Won't accept doctors notes and minimum of 4 days to get approved sick time off thru Sedgwick program.
bad,It was my first job great way to get your foot in anywhere meet lots of people and did lots of different job duties and titles learned a lot about the business and how to run it
bad,compensation and benefits package horrible. Under staffed. Management polite. Lines too long. Cashiers have horrible attitudes.Front end staff can use retraining
bad,Walmart is known for many things I'd love to say I loved it so much and they where good to there employes but that be a le before the new management went it everything was good it felt good to go to work but once new managament went in and I injured myself they trying to intimidated me from going to the ER and even told me not to come to work.
bad,"Not for me, the management that they hire are like robots they do and say anything that the store manager says no matter what. I was sick and had no control over my health until the doctors said so and they knew that"
bad,Not the best place to work at but workable. Some good people that get along with you. Very flexible to get back and forth to work.Some good benefits but not a lot.
bad,"Although the money is great, 10 dollars an hour isn't worth being treated like garbage. You go to work stressed and leave even more stressed. Management is unreliable. Most co-workers are rude and unfriendly. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management giving you inaccurate information, working in dangerous working conditions, and the lack of teamwork. The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was clocking out and going home."
bad,Walmart by far is the worst job I have ever experienced. Management shows favoritism and will mainly listen to anyone who they personally know or has been working in the store for a long term. Hated it Hated it Hated it. Hours and pay in deli fairly high
bad,"over all my take on my time served at Wal -Mart was job security. I was improperly trained then scolded for not knowing what to do , then high array of turn over makes it difficult to know what levels of education each co worker brings to a shift, this included management.   I was never felt apart of or felt comfortable working for Wal - Mart, I like everyone else who works there are just sheep's for the slaughter""."
bad,I would never work there again bad business terrible customer service they don't support they're employees. And they hire anybody
bad,"You can expect to clock in, and get directly to where you need to go, unless a customer stops you and asks where they can find something, kissing up to others sadly is the only way to get promoted, management is very poor in terms of quality, they don't seem to care about their employees and subordinates, most of your coworkers here are not close-knit and are very cranky people to deal with."
bad,"terrible management, everyone ends up quitting, and they will make you work in different dapartments with out giving you the raise you earned."
bad,"This place is a COMPLETE JOKE,  its litterly high school all over again,  all the down to the cliqs,  and if your not part of the right 1, then your just wasted space to them,  walmart loves to act like they are such this great company to work for, maybe other stores,  but as far as this stote goes, its a joke stay far far from it!"
bad,New policies and procedures really screwed with some of us and I was terminated because of it.  Changing stores did not help either.  I was warned to beware of the store manager of the store I was going to and it sure was true.
bad,They have no regard or respect for any emergency situation that happens at home. Says their company policy of respect for the individual is fully enforced but when you make a complaint they brush you to the side
bad,WORST MANAGEMENT EVER Mr.Sam is rolling over in his grave to see how they treat their employees! Benefits and pay not worth it!
bad,"I'll start with the only pros. You get a good salary and 3 days off a week."
bad,"Management sucks. Even when you get prior approval for days off they mark you as absent, best thing to do is take a picture of your signed request form. Department mangers also pawn their work off on you, duty managers are to demanding and force you to complete work in other departments you are unfamiliar with, and they play games of favoritism. You basically have to bribe them to get your vacation time."
bad,"No . Work not a problem. To many supervisors."
bad,This job was a  learning experience for me. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and had the opportunity to make a few friends as well. My role allowed me to exhibit leadership and sharpen my skills in management.
bad,Management at walmart is very discriminative and lazy. Has associates do their work  for them while they relax in their office.
bad,E bom trabalhar como caixa mas a empresa n valiriza o funcionario
bad,Walmart is a very good job to work if you are still in school or that's your very first job and you tryinh to get experience but over all its okay some managers would try to talk to you any kind of way
bad,"It's walmart. You've heard the stories. You've heard the rumors. Take that and add any retail/corporate expereince ever and you have the general gist of it. The worst part of it all really has to be the customers however, as the self prophecy of walmart being a terrible place to work attracts only the desperate and unemployable who have no other choice and are inherently unhappy with the fact they're here. Since customers know these people are not exactly the cream of the crop or are generally unhappy, the customers feel comfortable with treating the employees, and the store, like garbage which exacerbates the problem."
bad,"management was unprofessional, lazy, rude. "
bad,"Busy day at work, learned about food preparation, cooking, and helping customers with serving deli dishes, cooking rotiserrie chicken, fried chicken and all the deli dishes, sliced deli meat for customers, too much bureaucracy, too many managers, there is not enough communication between management and employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving customers.  Got along with co-workers. Need more staff and more organization of labor."
bad,"Not a good company to work for, low pay and the management is very bad. The store manager is very rude, insults employees in front of other employees. Would not recommend for anyone to work for this company."
bad,they are always understaffed they dont do things in a timely manner. i never got my raise. some of the employees have attitudes the manager sucks. they only care about themselves and nobody else unless your white or mexican. if you are sick its a problem. i dont know if i can go back to walmart not even to shop until they change their policy.
bad,"I feel a company as big as Walmart should offer its employees more than a 10% discount!  It's requesting that I write more, but I honestly have nothing more to say"
bad,"This company has great benefits, but however, that is only because the way Wal-Mart treats certain employees and managers. It is a great company when you first get in the door but soon as you have worked there for a while that's when the stress and worry  come into play. They work you like a dog and is never considerate of your well being as a human being. The company stands for Integrity and respect for the individual, but that is all a falsified lie."
bad,its Walmart i think you can guest the things you would have to deal with working there the rudeness and carelessness of management along with incompetent supervisors its makes it a very hard place to work
bad,"Walmart was by far the most unrealistic place I have ever worked at. When I say unrealistic I am referring to the expectations of wal -mart. Nothing was ever good enough. I can honestly say wal-mart had the highest turnover rate I have ever seen,  Very!!! unorganized work place, management was very unprofessional and in my opinion and the opinion of many others did not know what they were doing. Walmart is not for their employees, or the customers, they are for the money bottom line."
bad,"when associates would be disrespectful"
bad,They expected to much an showed a lot of favoritism. Walmart also didn't show any appreciation to there employees. They dont even accept doctors note if you call of for an emergency.
bad,It was ok it was fun while it lasted it was very interest to work at Walmart i really didn't get to show them me they really didn't give me a chance but i would try again if given a opportunity
bad,"This was my first job when I was in high school. I remember I was so excited to actually have a job. A typical day at work (as a cashier) was taking care of customers."
bad,"If you dont talk to anyone, take your breaks on time, ask no questions you will be fine. You have to bust your butt, to make production and quality standards that they remind you about each day, week and month. Don't expect anyone to notice you doing more than 100%, they won't thank you. If you dont like the position you get you have to wait 1 year to transfer to something potentially worse. If you end up on their favorites list you will get T-shirts that they will tax you on. You name becomes a number when you get hired. Turnover is high, and satisfaction is very low. I love the pay and the schedule, it's the absolute only two things that keep me there. It will never get better."
bad,"Hostile, harassing, managers, never even let you manage your own departments.  All you did was their notes.  I hated ever day i had to go in.  The only thing good was the paycheck."
bad,"Management here is very bad, when it comes down to your schedule or making sure you are in a work safe environment nothing ever gets done. i was harassed constantly and certain employees were dating management so everything that was getting done inappropriately was ok to them. I was told i would get a raise after three months of being there and never once received one."
bad,"I've been at Walmart for over 3 years now. Yet I make the minimum 10 dollar-ish wage like most of the people I know. They started me off at $7.70 when I first joined. Recently everyone got bumped to 9 or 10 dollars an hour."
bad,its hard to get promoted the good people dont always get the job  and its a fun place sometimes but if management wants you gone you will be given a hard time
bad,"A typical day at work is  making customers smile and enjoy  the service of the store "
bad,The management team did not care about the workers that had been there for over twenty years no loyalty. They did not try to make things better for the workers.
bad,"I have nothing bad to say about this job, i loved it and what i did to make customers feel happy and at home. Getting promoted and moving up is easy if you're a hard worker. But this company does nothing to protect thier hard working associates"
bad,"I was pregnant at the time and working overnight.  Management was playing favorites, being disrespectful, and sometimes tried to gave me heavy to carry.  This location is dirty...maintenance does a horrible job...no one during the day does any work so overnight does EVERYTHING...the employees are very unprofessional and classless.  This location needs a HUGE turn around."
bad,"A empresa tem bons recursos,porém é muito mau administrada, Gerentes mal treinados, pessoas com poderes demais e ainda uma das únicas empresas que procuram de todas as formas prejudicar os demitem a seus funcionários na hora de demitir tentando economizar demitem a maioria dos seus funcionários por justa causa sem critérios e nem escrúpulos."
bad,"The management sucked. People were VERY rude, and I don't have much good to say about this place. I had to get a second job because this job wasn't paying the bills, and the manager wasn't willing to work around my schedule. It irritated me, so I just walked in one day and quit. That is the only job I have never quit on the spot like that. To them though, you are just another number"
bad,"Very unprofessional, will not be working there ever again. The work place is very dirty and unfortunately racist."
bad,a typical day at work usually involves taking care of customers mainly and doing any other task that is provided. your asked to do more than your job description.
bad,It was a job they just need better managers and they should show they employees more love. They should give people the hours they need and stop doing the point system.
bad,"The day to day work , was very easy . Learning and becoming better at the job that I was hired to preform , wasn't a bad experience , it was just a lot to remember and to preform on a daily ."
bad,"Not only are some of the people on the sales floor disgruntled half the time, management is very insulting towards their associates and didnt train many people correctly during my short time there."
bad,"Absolutely the worst place that I've ever worked. I was an assistant manager for Walmart and it absolutely was drama-filled, mismanaged, 12- 15 hour shifts 6 days per week, and it was a completely miserable atmosphere. I left it in 3 months. I went through the whole assistant manager training program and they sent me to a few more schools after that. It just wasn't for me it was a completely miserable atmosphere. If you enjoyed 12 to 15 hour days 6 days per week and working every holiday and every weekend then this is the place for you. An absolute nitemare from day 1."
bad,always under staffed especially at the beginning of the month and weekends when its the busiest. Management does provide help with customer complaints and concerns when asked. They always pawn it off to lower management.
bad,"I have been with Walmart for 3 years now and am very miserable. This was my first job I've ever had and it's horrible. The employees are the worst. They treat their co workers like trash, they don't care about your personal life or if you got into a car accident for example. I would advise anybody who are considering to work here, you can do better. I'm only here for a paycheck and hopefully I can find something much better soon. If I could I would of quit a long time ago. That's my honest opinion on this horrible company."
bad,Fundamentals learned are good however for the hourly wage you are doing so much work and also shifts are given evenly it was not very fun or friendly and managers often played favourites
bad,"1) Cook food, clean, assist customers"
bad,The managers there took advantage of there power and talked to us like dogs. They do not run the store in the best way possible. I learned how to work at the gas station but that was the only thing they did right. The pick favorites there. I hated my experience there.
bad,the only thing good bout walmart is the benefits. the mangers do not treat the workers right. Walmart employees are the lowest paid workers out there
bad,"Start back room of the store, Unloading trucks onto the pallets you laid out. You later take the pallets out to the  sales floor  Co Workers was friendly. The hardest part of the job was pulling very heavy and tall pallets stack with items and unloading trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was my Co Workers."
bad,ambiente agradavel otimo relacionamento com colegas e supervisores pontualidade em pagamento de salario etc...
bad,In direct violation of labor laws on more than one occasion. harassment of associates on all levels... Retaliation on many associates. discrimination on all levels.
bad,I loved my job and the customers. There were never enough registers open and the management team only care about each other.
bad,"Long hours, rude customers, hate that customers are always right because they're not. not a fun environment to be in. good money to make ends meet. worst managers ever. they don't care about your well being, just need you to be there and do your job like they ask of you. don't know how to train new employees well. TERRIBLE work force."
bad,They have a high turnover of very qualified people at the store due to the lack of knowledge by management on how to work with qualified staff. They are better working with and training new staff. They will lie to qualified staff to get that member to accept a low paying position with a promise to a higher paying position within a month.
bad,I liked working for Walmart but the management was horrible they would have favorites in the employees and there was a lot of drama that the managers let happen. If you went to work minded your own business it wasn't bad some days but most the days it was poor leadership and bad management.
bad,Treated personnel very poorly. I was management and I was treated poorly. People came to me for answers and store manager didn't like that. Thought I was a threat to her position. The way I was taught in the Military was to take care of your personnel. No matter what the question to answer it within a timely matter
bad,Working there is like being back in high school with drama everywhere. No one can work through their problems without first spreading it throughout the entire workplace and the management team takes sides and picks favorites. If you aren't a favorite then you might as well expect the lowly hours and never be recognized or advance with the company.
bad,"So many jobs never enough help. To many managers and not enough workers, You could only move up if you were a liked if you had a idea and others didnt like you it wouldnt get brought up."
bad,"Was with them for many years.  The first 8 or so were great.  Management at the top changed and so did philosophy.  All associates are disposable and expendable.  You are just a number.  No respect, thought or care for any associates.  Stress is unbearable.  Job is threatened daily.  The higher you move up, the worse it is.  Managers dropping like flies with strokes, heart attacks, suicides, etc.  When the management is miserable, this trickles down to the associates.  That's why you never see an associate at this company smiling.  They are all hating their jobs. Pay and benefits are fine, but they would get MUCH more bang for their buck with appreciating their people."
bad,"I've been working there for 7 months, was lied to about the 6 month requirement for advancement. They talk about respect, but show you none. If your considering working there, sell your soul to the devil first, at least you'll get something for it. I was disrespected, lied to, had management talk bad about me behind my back, was to believe I was getting promoted just to get me to do the supervisor job until they promoted someone who didn't know the job but was less qualified than me. I did what they asked, and they did everything they could to set me fail."
bad,"You know how everyone talks about how bad Walmart is? It really is true. Never have I worked for a company that pushes so hard to be Anti-Union. The management is so FUBAR'ed that pretty much no one can get their job done. The only plus to the job is your coworkers, they really are some of the nicest people you could work with."
bad,preparing the store for big events is quiet challenging and inventory is stressful. management needs to be more on the same page.
bad,I loved the environment. The people where always so nice although you would get mean customers to. But over all I enjoyed it I just wanted a new career.
bad,"Upper management will give you a task and when you follow through, you find out it was wrong and get terminated. The upper management will receive no punishment and continue on with life."
bad,"Reason why I'm looking for a new job is management is unprofessional and lack of communication makes the job hard, They tend to pick favorites and even with that associate having multiple complaints from customers and fellow associates they still let them off easy. The poor lack of communication makes it hard to get a lot done because sometimes you would do the same thing three or four times because you're told five different ways you need to do one task. There was lack of training for some associates who fumbled about trying to get their work done."
bad,One  can   move  up  in  a  job if  one  put  their  mind  to it. a  person  can  not  be  worried  about  stepping  outside the  box to do  this  but  look  upon  it  as a  challenge.  May  things  can  be  gained  from   moving  and  learning  other  positions  around the  store.
bad,Busy day always      I was able to apply all the skills I have learned thru the years at Brookshires where I worked for 6 and a half years and what I had learned at Walmart before when I worked at the Shreveport store for  3 and a half years     Management in the store was not good at all except for the new store director who started after me     There were a few good employees but over all the employees were not trained properly and some where just there for a pay check    the hardest part of the job was the lifting in the meat dept.    The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers!!!!
bad,Most of the employees was very rude. The managers was rude as well. They ask to much of one person. Couldn't seem to keep employees due to treating them poorly. Maybe if managers would treat employees good they would stick around. Managers don't help out at all but they expect everything to get done. Chop Chop!!! Managers get paid good but all they do is sit around.
bad,"This is the worst job I think I possibly could have gotten myself into. I was never told that I would have to work registers, which is a big deal as I have a severe anxiety disorder. I got done with my training and was thrown on register with zero knowledge. I refused to work the register after that day, even confronted my manager as well as the two higher up managers. None of the three cared or did anything about it. I was told by fellow workers that if I didn't work the register, I would be fired. I ended up quitting."
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart, you didn't know what the day has for you. I learned how to stock and use all the equipment, but I didn't like how management was. They showed a lot of favoritism to supervisor and punish the workers. Then hardest part of working there was making through the day without no drama or voicing your opinion."
bad,"At a typical day at work I would organize the shelves and help customers.  I didn't particularly like this job.  I learned how to organize items on shelves in this job.  The lower management was good, but upper management wasn't as good as the management underneath them; my co-workers were nice and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was speaking up to tell other people not to do certain things at times, like ride the bikes, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of breaks they gave me per hours I worked full-time at the store."
bad,Walmart is a company that is horrible to work for they do not care about their workers and if a member of management does not like a person they will find a reason to get rid of them. THey expect everyone to do the work of two people and do not care if something changes in your day for example if you are helping a customer you will get in trouble for not getting your work done in the unrealistic time frames they give you
bad,"A typical day as well."
bad,"After working with them once, I went back. I hated working with stafforce the second time. They were unorganized and unprofessional."
bad,"Treat you like a child, would force a rule without giving you training, or proper equipment to do the job. I don't know how many times my job changed because of the way they wanted done."
bad,Having worked in management I do believe the programs that Walmart has for success or advancement is minimal. You are either liked or you are not. Dependability and reliability are not a neccessity
bad,"la paga es poca y el tabajo es pesado para los almacenistas ya que hay que decargar cruces enteros de aprox. dece tarimas, son muy exigentes, no aceptan opiniones de los bajo nivel, trabajan a prueba y error la organizacion no es muy buena"
bad,management is a joke.. they have a open door policy that does no good but get you in trouble.. management does what they want...not family in mind
bad,as the supervisor over the maintenance department I would make sure that my employees would get there job done in a timely manner. I would make sure that the store looked 100% clean by 7am
bad,"I have enjoyed the people that  have worked with and have met over the years. The company has made changes over the years weather its good or bad you have to always look at the positive and the bigger picture you will always work with someone that doesn't understand or will get upset over the new changes in your work place and by being the "" out side of the box"" thinker I have learned to be supportive to others and help them adapt."
bad,This job is great if you are looking for a second part time job or a this would be a great starter job for student that are still in high school and want a job. I enjoyed working here and if you want to make a career out of it you can .
bad,Cleaning front of store. Greeting customers. How to be a team player. Some of management was great and fun to work with. Some were team players and some weren't. Making unhappy customers happy. Reward meals that we earned.
bad,"The saying ""it's who you know not what you know"" applies to my outlook on this company. The only way to find yourself at the top and not replaceable is to be in cahoots with upper, upper management. especially more now then ever. So I would not advise my worst enemy to work for such a greedy, inconsiderate company."
bad,"nine hour shift 1hour lunch 2 15minute breaks. your responsible for working in a whole lot of different departments,deals with alot of customers ."
bad,"As i work at Walmart all of them are not alike but at 1017 in Manning, SC they are not trust worthy, managers in positions are not fair and they are not honest with nothing that they do.."
bad,i Hated this job Management bullied everyone a poor guy cried in subway cause how the spoke to him Wal mart  doesn't care about you try working on Thanksgiving.and if you call out for that day your fired
bad,"Let me give you an idea on the kinds of treatment you can expect while working for Walmart."
bad,starter place. work here to get your feet wet in the job world. do less here and get paid just as much as the other retailers.
bad,Inconsistent with using security lock systems for high value merchandise which interferes with my work as an asset protection associate. also poor communication on the managements part. Also poor communication with supervisors and associates.
bad,"I have never been asked to do so much work with so little help. I was in the deli, an area very heavily focused on customer service, yet I was the only one in the department for 8 hours.... and I had to take a lunch sometime. Just generally dreary work environment."
bad,"Treat you slaves for a mere $7-$8 dollar salary, Customers are pretty much allowed to treat you like dirty and you can't do anything about. Breaks are horrible. People in leadership are slow. Nothing is ever priced right. Just a hostile work environment."
bad,"Job cuts and new management structure as made working at ASDA a nightmare. People being asked to do 2,3,4 people's work loads resulting in departments becoming very stretched leading to managers becoming more stressed and less approachable."
bad,"this location has the worst management ever. they go around telling personal details about the employees. i loved stocking shelves, and i loved the hours."
bad,management in ok to work with but as for walmart as a company they don't pay very well and also do not seem to care about their employees
bad,they really didn't have their rules together .. not one of the head people every knew what was going on they would be running all over the place trying to find out from another manager .. they honestly in my opinion needed to have sit downs where they disgusted things and were more organized
bad,A place where they force mandatory holiday work and dreams go to die. The managers are unprofessional and the customers are rude.
bad,"they only had a couple of good managers, but the rest would not help you, they were lazy and made other people do there work"
bad,"The schedule is always scrambled or being changed. Never have the same days on or off, constantly checking to see if you work."
bad,"Walmart is a place that you can grow in character. while being here at this particular job I find myself every moment trying to see how I can do better at customer service. Customers aren't always too happy with the company's service, but at my stores location I want to always hear that my co-workers make their shopping a great pleasure."
bad,To me Walmart was not a good work place they did not treat there workers the way they should have been treated at all. They were not respectful to any of there workers it was not just me.
bad,"A typical day at work was actually enjoyable, I got to meet many new people from the nature of the job. However, management wasn't all that good, and I did feel that the company didn't care for its employees or their needs. I enjoyed the type of work but not the atmosphere that Walmart provided."
bad,"Poor management and unrealistic expectations are just the beginning. I have been with the company for three years and for the last two years there have been no more than two people in my department. Two people!!! to fill a weeks worth of shifts. If you have a problem with management and decide to open door them to someone higher they tell them who said what, so what you think is confidential comes back to bite you in the rear."
bad,"fast paced work place. Constantly busy, constant customer interaction. Job security, always something to do and someone to help. always opportunities to move up in the company."
bad,"Walmart's low cost approach for associates leaves little room for professionalism. Internal Theft at Walmart is high, however Walmart doesn't seem to want to terminate or charge their employees until the employee has created a large financial loss to the store. This is typically the store manages decision. A lot of store managers are uneducated outside of Walmart, Their typical source of education is from Walmart's internal WIRE."
bad,Everyone Knows this walmart by the HOOD WALMart. I was only there fore three or less months. I would never work there again management was terrible!
bad,"They don't care about their employees at all. Never got our full 40 hours. They would work us 12-14 hours on Mondays and Tuesday and then would call in help in Wednesday and Thursday so we only got 6-8 hours. Doing this would give us 30-35 hours so they wouldn't have to pay us overtime and would make their numbers look good,"
bad,walmart in tallahassee on west tennessee st is not the one you want to work at  neither apalachee. the management is the worst and they do not advance worthy employees but favorable employees
bad,The job is very simple but there is no fun at work as it is a typical monotonous job with minimal wage.I want to change my job and I'm looking for a permanent full time job as my salary is not good and there are no good benefits .I have been working as a Cashier for the past three years and at Walmart I will be a Cashier for the rest of my life as there is no growth opportunity at Walmart.
bad,"no trainning just do it. it's all about times not about quality. a measure of excellence is kiss butt they my like you. Understaffing issues negatively affects all parts of their business. However, Walmart has increased their minimum hourly rate with hopes to attract more committed employees, and retain better employees."
bad,"The one thing Walmart does well is provide excellent potential in making money with and through the company. But this does not excuse the company or the stores from often treating employees as chattel. There are, of course, some pros if the store is willing to do things for its employees, which some are, but there is a large portion that does not pay attention to detail of their employees lives, or care."
bad,If you enjoy working endless hours with little to no work life balance then you'll enjoy working for Walmart. Working in management expect to give all your time to the job.
bad,did not enjoy working here but I did not have much of a choise in the matter. it is a good job but the leadership is not there and the culture is in a constant state of change .
bad,I value what I learned about human relationships while working with Walmart Employees and Customers. While working with this company I learned that the value of my integrity is worth more than any Salary.
bad,"Worked There Many Years. I Used To Love Going To Work For The First Few Years. Over Time Alot Of The Good Workers & My Friends Left.  Mostly Because In This Place You Were Just A Number.  You Could Easily Be Replaced By Someone Else.  Whether Your Top Of The Pack Or Bottom Of The Food Chain.  They Picked Favorites & If You Weren't One Of Them.  Your Time Would Come.  I Was One Of The Most Well Liked & Hardest Workers In My Area's That I Worked.  Even Made It To Management Level. The People Their Make The Place What It Is.  The Management Team Forgot That Many Years Ago.  Sam Walton Would Be Ashamed Of This Store. "
bad,When I first started to work at this job I really enjoyed but over the years it just became a job to pay my bills and take care of my children. It went from a friendly work environment and a place of being able to advance to a place where no one was friendly and you can only advance if you are friends with certain managers. I worked there for almost eight years and it took me until two weeks ago to get full time but they put new people in my department full time and told them not to say anything to anyone about it.
bad,"One day you'll be asked to stay late and the very next time you work, they'll ask you to cut that time. Which I think is pointless."
bad,The company as a whole is a little better however employers are not treated fairly. Ex availability is an option however if you have limited availability there are not enough hours offered to you.
bad,"They don't seem to care about their employees, they are severly understaffed, they are mean to the elderly that work there, they fire the good people once they reach a certain point, the stores are dirty and the customers can curse you out and ignore policy."
bad,"The work is generally easy, but for me I was doing the work of 2 people.  I handled the chemicals department and stocked it each night.  I also was in charge of the jewelry department.  It was on the other end of the store and every time a customer needed something I had to run there to take care of it.  I wouldn't have complained but I got no extra compensation and was expected to finish my work each night even if jewelry was busy.  I also was a spare cashier if they got busy.  Again, no extra compensation and had to finish my work each night--no excuses.  Some nights I spent half my shift at jewelry and cashiering and no one gave me any slack.  I got no promotions or merit raises even though I was constantly given positive feedback from management.  If I hadn't worked overnight the pay would not have been worth the job.  It really wasn't worth it anyway.  I've worked jobs half as difficult for more money than what Walmart pays.  It was difficult to get time off for any reason.  After getting an emergency tooth pulling at the dentist, I was told I had to come in the next day or get fired.  So I worked my shift with gauze in my mouth all night and didn't eat because of the gross bloody gauze.  During my orientation a manager gave me and the others who were orientating pamphlets for government assistance because, you know, their benefits are unattainable for the money you make.  If you're a lady, don't bet on getting promoted, ever.  Few women in management at the store I was at.  New management positions were given to outsiders.  It's complete bull that they promote from within."
bad,This is not a great company to work for. They work you hard for little pay and terminates you for the smallest things. They want you to be flexible but the managers are not.
bad,"The way Wal-Mart management behaves is like how my abusive alcoholic father acted toward his family every day. We are not people to them, we're warm bodies they need until they throw us away. I would recommend people to avoid working at Wal-Mart."
bad,I worked at the one on the red bank side of Lexington. Not a great experience. Just shop there. Use as gap job if you have no option.
bad,One person had to do the work of six. coworkers were never happy. management wasn't on the same page. The hardest part was difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was helping people.
bad,i learned great communication skills. a typical day at work would be just stocking . management was well but could be better. the hardest part of this job was talking to managers.
bad,"Political only if you want to move up be friends with management. You will do others jobs as they watch on.  Managers are always on your back. Sucky hours. They will take credit and pass the blame. No job security at all. Manager say they have your back then they will stab you in the back. Your hours will be cut. Barely enough pay. There are some good managers but they don't last long. Some of the other employees are really nice and will help you out.  If you make one mistake it could be your last. Don't work if you have a better job. If you have to, don't stay for long."
bad,Walmart is a place I don't think I would ever work for again. The management was terrible. The joy I got from this job were some of the coworkers and the customers.
bad,This company have no sense of direction for its employees. They will fired you over anything that does not make sense. It was not a great place to work for in the long run.
bad,"I learned how to have a good management time, and make hard decision. How to do schedule appointment,  for 360 employees. I  learned how to audit the time sheets. Do payroll for different  department. The most enjoyable of the job I learned different position at human resources."
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers and the lower management--everyone who worked was super understanding and diligent, helpful, but higher management did very little with no understanding of the individual or work."
bad,"It was ok, but the minute the management found out I wanted to move up, they started to railroad me, so I quit after working there for over 5 months."
bad,I grew a lot since I started with Wal-mart however I slowly watched as it changed in not a good way. We lost a lot of people but would never rehire to fill those positions. I felt like I was set up to fail and so was everyone else. I did a job that 3 people could of done.It wasn't an organized environment and organization is a huge part of my daily life. Unfortunately they have lost a lot of good people due to there managing skills including myself. I have meant some wonderful people from all walks of life. I will miss my co-workers tremendously. However Wal-mart was not the company for me and I hope it gets better for the people who believe they are stuck there.
bad,"They paid below to the type of work and the environment the work is performed.  They would not work with me to attend college during my employment there,"
bad,Many skills improved on and many learned. Customer service skills are used very often. Many jobs to choose within the company.
bad,Walmart has given me the opportunity to promote within the company very quickly. I've learned many different skills and am cross-trained in many different jobs. I enjoy working with my fellow associates and the diverse customers. I've improved on some skills and learned many more. I would very much like Walmart to consider each employees needs and the benefits and assets we are to their company.
bad,bringing perfect customer service is the key to sucsess is somthing ive learned through out my whole life working and thats somthing i enjoy doing.
bad,"Coworkers are amazing and help you out in anyway that they can, I use to ring out merchandise and handle money I loved working there because I loved the customers they were amazing"
bad,"Management consists of rude, arrogant, unhelpful, and unreasonable people. None of them ever have anything nice to say, are consistently sarcastic and rude. Workers are clearly unhappy with their jobs, when asked is because of the poor treatment by upper management. A typical day consists of relentless pushing a prodding, despite how quickly and effectively you do your work. The crew itself is nice, with friendly and outgoing attitudes, though they are always brought down by the management coming down on them like a ton of bricks. The hardest part is definitely trying to please the management. They are never happy with your work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you finally get to leave, as they typically keep associates long after they are scheduled to perform several other tasks."
bad,"The management staff never had good, long lasting solutions to our problems. More work was placed on us than could be completed in our normal shift, so we would have to stay over and then cut our overtime later by taking longer lunch breaks. Management had no respect for employees."
bad,"Wal-Mart's training programs are created for superior extroverts! If you aren't an extrovert prepare to be bored, scared, and grouped to death. HR always seemed to want the best for it's employees, yet never took employee contributions into effect. Management was never reliable and always took their own side of any equation. A few cents above minimum wage should not be acceptable based on the above conditions Wal-Mart's cashiers and sales associates face. There are only two chances for advancement: 1. Get to know a manager on a personal level and use brown nosing techniques. 2. Work at the lowest level of associates for 50yrs or more! "
bad,a typical day at work would include me maintaining 3 departments by myself with very minimal management training. I have learned that this company and most (not all) of my coworkers could care less that i am in need of some help when i am willing to learn and move into a management spot. The hardest part of the job would be that i have very few managers or associates that know my actual job and again the very horrible training. i do enjoy the freedom throughout the store and the freedom to talk to my vendors and make my own decisions with my departments.
bad,Walmart was the worst Company I have ever worked for. Never had any help working in my departments. Night managers played around so much that overnight stock associates never got anything done and all work was left for the Merchandise Supervisors to stock or we had to take so much merchandise back off the floor because it was merchandised in the wrong place or over stocked.
bad,"i was the supervisor over the tire lube express"
bad,"My typical day at work would be to find out which department I would be working in that day. I was job coded in 6 different departments as a sales associate. I would be given a task then once that is done I would go help someone else complete their task or I would be assigned to complete someone else task. I learned how to complete inventory, claims items, complete returns and exchanges, cash checks through Walmart system, how to work a Gemini, how to freshly pick produce, how to do price changes and how to do simple functions on the cash register. Management was very poor. They are not understanding and they take advantage of you behind your back. They cut your hours without notifying you and they may have you work 7 days a week before receiving an off day. My co-workers have never been an issue. When I'm at work I'm not into socializing, I like to get my job done. Nothing about the job was hard. The best part of my the job was interacting with customers that you see everyday and enjoys your customer service."
bad,The more you work the more they add to you until you fail. Constantly running around. Management is inconsistant
bad,"Not much to say here. The staff was always very unsupportive of each other, Unloading trucks would take several hours in unsanitary conditions. Most importantly, hard work is not recognized."
bad,"Coordinated schedules, lunches and breaks"
bad,"It started off rather similar to the job I had at Food Lion. We would stock the shelves regularly and help customers find items. Later on, after many people were being fired, we ended up being understaffed. This led to me almost being the sole person on the second shift, with the daily responsibility of unloading the grocery truck by myself (which is a 3-4 man job). It seemed as if the majority of management was worried about receiving a big bonus check at the end of the year, cutting expenses anywhere they could. It ended up being a hard job, which I don't mind hard work, but I at least expect an according amount of associates available to properly complete a job task. The one thing that I did like was the fact that every day when I came in at the same time I knew what my job was and what I needed to get done. I just wish I had more support and wasn't being overly worked, due to my high productivity."
bad,I feel the company was totallly wrong on thier attitude toward older personal about sickness
bad,"stocking, enjoying working with customers, zoning the shelves, inventory, a stable, pace work, but some management and zone manager does not work as a team like they suppose to. "
bad,"The only good thing about this job is the people you meet, Poor management and you will get written up for ridiculous reasons. They tell you coachings are no big deal when they last for  a year"
bad,"Basically you stand around all the time waiting on an assignment, "
bad,I love my coworkers. Do not love Walmart. Coworkers were a lot of fun and nice people. Management is very poor
bad,Don't ask. Would not go back there for nothing. They was not great. They find ways to get rid of full time associates. They not fair at all.
bad,I am fortunate to work with great co-workers and a sane boss unlike my previous Wal-mart. My complaint is that I have a bone spur in my foot and I can not be accommodated for it unless I move to another section and take a pay cut. This is on top of the fact that we are only allowed a 30 minute lunch in the pharmacy. I also found out that I am part time and am not allowed to get extra hours and am not allowed to get benefits for a year.I was not initially told that when hired. I was told I was receive benefits.I tried to move to full time and I was told I would have to wait on the waiting list AND  be at the new store longer for them to see how I perform.I take medication and I am uninsured and can not see a doctor for my health problems yet I work in a pharmacy of all places.Being on your feet all day makes me feel elderly and in pain and I am not even 30. I would never recommend anyone work at Wal-mart.
bad,I was maintenance and hated it it seemed like as soon as I cleaned something ten min later it'll be dirty again very frustrating the co workers were very unprofessional it felt like I was back in high school gossiping and everybody was messing with everybody not a long term job the pay was nothing to do flips about either
bad,Great working with the Customers and Co-workers management team needs more support training
bad,I'm very good at this job. But it comes at a price. It requires an enormous amount of patients and being calm. Managers are rarely on the same page.
bad,A typical day at work is getting told by four different managers four different things to do in the same amount of time. There is nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,"working there as a sales clerk, enjoying working there, but too many strong favoritism, hours cut, low pay, and no advancement on the job because of who the person know who are not qualify for the position they are not entitle for."
bad,"If you are looking for quick employment, this is your place. As an extremely hard worker there are slim chances for advancement, long over-worked hours, and few benefits unless you have been with the company for ample years. Wal-Mart's high turnover rate makes it difficult as a hard-worker to impress any management. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers whom appreciate what you do."
bad,walmart doesnt care about its associates or customers run you in the ground and shelves constantly empty always understaffed on purpose
bad,"In a typical day at work as a stocker, I am responsible for pulling all needed freight to the floor, prepping it and stocking it to its proper location on the sales floor. After stocking all freight all work areas must be neatly organized and merchandise is zoned at the end of the shift to ensure customer satisfaction. As a hourly associate  for Walmart there are very few benefits available and no support from managers. The most enjoyable part of this job is  socializing with coworkers. The hardest part of this job is coping with the daily lack of proper management."
bad,"Micro managed from the top down. "
bad,"check floor inventory"
bad,"As far as a typical day, higher level of management WAS TERRIBLE. Could not separate personal issues/life from work environment . Rude attitude, and last, but not least LIARS!"
bad,Wal-Mart should pay more for what they have their employees do.  If you work there you will be doing way more than what the job you were hired for entails.
bad,"A typical morning/afternoon at Wal-Mart is pretty much the same routine everyday depending on what's in the notes that your manager has, but overall our main goal is to work freight, double check other work from the night before and get it binned so there are no pallets full of your departments freight in receiving, in a days work not only do you just work freight to the shelves you have returns you have to check on, customers that need help and you also have mods and features that have to get done, you can get pulled from your department at any time and be put somewhere else, busy or not. You have to make sure your department is also zoned so it's easier for costumers to find merchandise and so it's neat because that department reflects on you. I've learned that no matter what to work hard and  get your job done and not worry about anyone else, don't let your work slow down or get sidetracked by things that are not important on the job, people are going to dislike you, you just have to keep going, be nice, and show that it doesn't bother you because in the end you will be the one rewarded. Management is a big part of course, you have some who take pride in what they do and some who pick and choose favorites and take advantage of their job title and know how to play victim very well and get away with it. For the most part management is very understanding and cares about their associates and want to make sure they are taken care of and treated fairly. All co-workers are different you have some who love what they do and others who don't. There are some who are hard to work with"
bad,It was a miserable job where the expectations and the amount of help did not match up
bad,The job was the worse job I ever had the management was so unorganized.
bad,"not really ok, managers never took initiative of a conflict. their answer was always ""I don't know"""
bad,I worked there for 8 yrs starting as a cashier and moving my way up in the ranks to being in charge of several different departments and supervisors as well as associates. I learned to do price changes and Merchandise products to make better sales and profits. The management team in the store that i worked in was never all on the same page and directions were not clear from one manager to another. The hardest part of the job was having a store manager that knew abosolutely nothing about running a store nor was he able to make a decision for himself without having to check with lower management first.
bad,"Does not pay well."
bad,Same as before not a great place to spend a long period of time.
bad,another school job just sitting or standing most of the time
bad,"This job had very bad structure and the company didn't in my opinion, care about their employees. There was no support structure in place and most employees seemed to just be there for a paycheck."
bad,"worst job ever! took me three years to figure out. Horrible customers, horrible management including HR, and cash office. Many opportunities if you wish to continue on in the company any times hours are constant and you do get a yearly bonus depending on store location and how well sales were. Build backbone, if you can work here you can handle anything."
bad,"hard work, fast pace, low pay, management poor, learned I would not recommend this company to work for"
bad,Not much to say.  Management is very hard to get along with.  Hard working associates but seems as though management doesn't care and you are just a number.
bad,"I am paid barely more than minimum wage and expected to work like a slave. At every corner I am harassed or threatened by management or other shift workers. We are not allowed to do our job without someone telling us ti is being done incorrectly. We have been told by management that our team is worthless and degraded to less than nothing. I was also lied to about what my position is and entails. I am often working other people's jobs while being forced to neglect mine. We have been forced to work in unsafe conditions. There are no regulations in place to prevent hazardous material spills and chemical mixing problems. (i.e. bleach on the same truck as ammonia and none of the bottles are secure). These problems have been brought to management, and management has not intentions to fix the issues."
bad,Terrible work experience with below average benefits and pay
bad,"Managers are always looking down on you, especially when you first start. Though i am sure i have not seen the worst of the Walmart experience, being a TLE Tech, It was always a constant battle with policies that conflict with one another."
bad,"Associate's are treated like children. Verbal abuse, threats and low salary. Management doesn't seem to know much about anything. Walmart is a HORRIBLE place to work."
bad,You will work 65-80 hours in leadership and you typical work day you will be stocking freight and building displays.  Upper Leadership micro manages there team and you never finish a project.  The hardest part about the job is time away from you family by working long hours.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the customers.
bad,"Its some good people there, but some are just awful"
bad,"i started working for Walmart in 2013 and it was the best experience to gain but i open door to leave and get a job at the Walmart D.C and find out i couldn't work at both places so i left and then it was a temp job and got laid off. Then i moved to the City and got rehired at a Walmart in South Gate,CA and it was the worst Experience ever. They treated me like i didnt know anything at all"
bad,"run, run, run, get yelled at for things you had nothing to do with"
bad,"Worst work enviroment I have ever encountered. If you have to,work here, if not, do not support this slave-wage company."
bad,"worked there on and off for 13 years told many times I was good at my job. never advanced but trained people to be above me. store management wanted you to complain about youre manager so thay would know that youre manager was doing there job. demanded to mutch for to little. I worked in the tle. I opened the shop ,I put out the fraight on the shelves , I changed tires on cars, fixed flats, changed oil in cares, unloaded trucks, put together bycicles,  run a cash register, all for 9.00 an hour but only 36 hours a weak. no more. I had to leave the job because I was passing out a lot at home and 1ce on the way to work on the road. doc couldn't find the problem but the day I left I have never past out again. doc later said stress. people dill with stress in different ways."
bad,"A typical work day is to do whatever your told to do and then being told you didn't do anything all day long."
bad,"When I first started their it seemed okay, but I did get suspicious when they would hammer into us it's your walmart and we value our employees. They started me as cashier, which I didn't apply for because I knew that was a bad idea, but took that position anyway. After about 4 months the store manager and a former assistant manager called me in the back and asked me if would work in the sporting goods department because some customers were complaining that I don't smile enough or was to slow. A lot of times my slow service was a result of long lines, due to a lack of cashiers and customers squawking that prices were wrong and making me waste my time trying to get an answer from the departments, which also lack staff. Especially in the evening. When they told me all this I told the assistant manager who hired me I told you didn't I, to which he answered, yes you did I'm sorry you obviously know yourself well. So I was moved to the back area to cover not just sporting goods, but seasonal, pets, toys and automotive. Most of my shifts began at 3:30 PM, at the same time the department managers were getting off. I was also usually covering these 5 departments by myself. The department manager of toys was not pleased with my performance because it was not zoned to her standards and there are only about 10 people on the night crew, who don't have time to get everything done. When I complained about this department manager not getting things done before I arrived and the lack of staff, they just said ""It's not in the budget and it's not the department managers job to stock the shelves."
bad,"nao tinha respeito com privacidade; nao era reconhecida, exercia varias funçoes, ultrapassava horario e nao recebia."
bad,"I worked in the cash office in walmart  before the clinton walmart ever opened up. I trained several new cash office managers but because of my age, which by the way was only around 18 or 19 at the time, they would not give me the position but continued to want me to train new cash office managers that they hire, so of course I quit."
bad,"Way to much Management. A typical day at work varied. You would scan your badge to find your tasks, but usually that was the least of the things you did. you would set out to complete your assignment, but the minute any management saw you, you were directed to do something else, besides customer interruptions. You may be starting one manager's assignment, only to be directed by another manager's assignment. Some assignments pay differed from your own & I thought that was unfair. That was the hardest part of the job. Most of my co-workers were always unhappy also because of this. Poor moral. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home, having insurance & getting a pay check."
bad,"No compensation strategies in place. "
bad,has more customer service managers than workers   Has no time or will  not take time to train employees.
bad,"I love working in a fast paste company.  I get to meet new people everyday, I make sure they leave with more then they came in looking for which is called add on. I learn different things about each customers that comes in they love it when you can remember their names. My co-workers are awesome fun outgoing and respectful to one another."
bad,check truck listings place co-workers in departments to work freight to the side counters.my co-workers respected me so the job went smooth the hardest part of my job was trying to please management. i learned how to supervise the night crew and to keep product flow going smooth. the enjoyable part of my job was getting the trucks processed and having the counters full and my co-workers feeling good about the job the did.
bad,the overnight management dont communicate well with each other they overwork there empolyees due to needing more empolyees. to little pay for the work they ask
bad,changing oil and tires and working with people. I learned that auto shop stay busy.
bad,Almost everyday there is some sort of new time wasting policy enacted and management has no idea what they are doing.
bad,"Interacting with people everyday giving customer services . I learn from electronic systems. Management i rather not comment. Co worker ,well people with humility and nice, very good people. The hardest part of the work is that i started as a credit coordinator since i start on that company and i was very good in my job, when i rellocate and my manager from the other store accept my tranfer to this store ,my paper was as a credit coordinator not as a cashier ,like the store manager place me once i moved to her store. Most enjoyable part of the jobs when i rellocate and after being credit coordinator , became a worker in a full bank."
bad,There really is not a lot that I can say about working for walmart that has not already been said. I did enjoy the more physical part of the job as it is busy and always something to do.
bad,I got to meet new people everyday. The people i got to work with dodnt want to do their jobs. I loved working in the toy department.
bad,Wake up early work hard with little appreciation.  Management provides little to no help but expect greatness.
bad,Walmart paid me exactly $0.71 more than I had made in 1979!!!
bad,"Arrive to work, put out merchandise, making sure clothing colorized correctly, mark down sales items,  Relieve PBX operator/dressing room attendant during breaks and lunch. Make sure department neat. Provided cashier relief during peak shopping times when needed as well as door greeter duties as needed."
bad,"Generally just not a good place to work. Poor pay rates, poor management, poor moral. etc"
bad,My experience as a Walmart Employee and a Walmart customer have not been ideal. Walmart can do much better then they are currently doing.
bad,"I was told when I was younger to work for someone who appreciates what you do, That will reward you and allow you to grow. This company is definetly not the place for that. Or atleast is was not for me."
bad,"On a typical day I would come in and make a list of what bikes I need to fill the rack. The bike rack usually has empty slots in it after I've been off  a couple days. I'll be out there making my list and a manager comes up to me and says "" why are there so many holes in this bike rack?"" I  usually tell them that I just got there after being off 2 days and they say ""well that""s just and excuse."" I tell them, we sold some bikes. that's a good thing right? They tell me to ""get it filled or you're fired. What I learned from working there is that everyone is replaceable no matter how much they do. The management there is a joke starting right at the top. They ignore the Global Ethics Policy and None of them know what it means to be a leader. All they know how to do is boss people around. None of them take any responsibility for their own actions. They just blame the workers. I didn't have any problems with any of my co-workers we were all in the same boat together just trying to make it through each day. The hardest part about the job was having to put up with the cruelty of managers who were only interested in their own well being and not the well being of the people they were giving orders to. The most enjoyable part of the job was assembling and fixing bikes for customers and seeing their reaction when they got the finished product."
bad,"A typical work day started with my manager dumping their unfinished work on me and expected me to get that done on top of what I needed to do during the night. I learned lots and received training for all the power equipment at the store. The management was horrible. I  had one serious situation where I talked to management about and they just blew it off pretty much. The hardest part of the job was working my butt off and not getting the recognition I deserved for how hard I worked. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers who were always great to work with and had a lot of fun working with them. Before I left the store I had a few people come up to me and ask me to show them how to do something their manager should have done, not me. However I took the time to show them how to do what they needed to do to get the job done."
bad,"I have only been there a month and a half and I have to bear witness to the disfunction that runs rampant at Walmart. The managers placed there are obviously chosen from favoritism and the language that is allowed is down right disgraceful for a company that prides themselves for customer service. I am ashamed to work in the back and see the lack of responsibility day in and day out. Worst of all I have a pregnant wife in her second trimester and none of the managers or customers for that matter could care less that she is pregnant. One customer tried to swing at my wife, and when it was brought up to a manager they replied by saying that is an everyday thing. I can not say I have enjoyed Walmart because for me any establishment should have some form of respect, and this store definitely has none. I wish I could say something positive about working there, but honestly I can't."
bad,"Pushing carts all day, full time not available except for managers, coworkers were incompetent, training was terrible, management and company didn't care about there employees."
bad,"não gostei de fazer parte desta familha,quando entrei estava tao motivado a realiza um otimo papel como empregado,porem na realidade não foi bem como eu tinha planejado.pois não tinha apoio da direção de empresa,faltava material de trabalho,tinha muita cobrança dos gerentes, eu trabalhava recebendo mercadorias de oito a dez docas,ou seja trabalhava por dez funcionarios e nunca fui reconhecido pelo meu esforço e desempenho,     "
bad,"I would arrive at work at about 9:30, clock in at ten, sit in the break room and wait for the nightly meeting with the managers. I learned how to properly stock shelves, how to read a barcode, how to find a product using a telzon, how to properly zone, how to make a bale, and a sandwich bale. "
bad,I loved working there for 4 years then not so good. I loved it most of time but to maney people telling you what to do and not all the same .Was good at first then after I got 5 years in things started going down the hill
bad,"working there for a little over a year. driven me crazy. "
bad,"The Store i worked for every single employee gossips about one another, not to many are trust worthy people, Cashiers Management does nothing but whine and complain about other cashiers/Management "
bad,Walmart helped me get an understanding on how the retail world works.
bad,Did lots of worknnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
bad,I would get to work at 7:00 a.m. and stock the shelves all day. I would get an hour lunch. Management was really ridiculous and almost never understanding. I learned how to stock shelves and how to be of services to customers. I had a lot of fun with most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was only having 3 sick days a year. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it was inside.
bad,"I enjoy to  help clients with complex  matters, also cross trained others co-workers in my department, typical day our department its always  busy, hardest part it's really nothing hard because I like to keep my self busy. the most enjoyable  when clients are satisfied whit my service. a the end of the day its pleasant to know that  clients are happy and satisfied and they call  my  manager to give us feed back in the service that I provide."
bad,"management is told to care about the bottom line first and only. sell, sell, sell. what the employee needs or wants doesn't matter. if the employee complains they just find a way to replace them."
bad,"Enjoyed working with most employees, many very helpful assisting with learning all aspects of working on sales floor.  Some managers were very helpful (some managers that reviewed progress for wage increase had no idea as to your everyday performance, hence, hindered advancement).   "
bad,"Co-Workers are great, Employee Discount is most enjoyable."
bad,the most enjoyable part is the customers .a typical work day is dustmopping the store take out tash spot mop management does does does not care about employees.they dont speak to other management.management do not speak to there employees make you feel unwanted.the hardest part of the job is being recognized when you are doing the right thing and the slackers get away with bloody murder.then talk about a career change or transer they find a way to get rid of you.
bad,"the management was rude, co-workers left such a mess everywhere."
bad,Typical retail except probably on the low end of quality of work expeience as well as pay.  But there is not much difference from other retail jobs.
bad,Walmart had a huge lack of communication and tended to not help the employees when it came to lack of workers. They were unwilling to work with employees with adjusting work schedules due to their children and single parents. They are notorious for pushing the work load on individuals such as myself that work very hard and not holding fellow employees responsible for staying in the back and not helping customers. It was a very stressful job.
bad,Being around people on a day to day basics makes me feel good.I keep a smile on my face its rare that im upset are even show im upset.I get alone with everyone im around.the hardest part about a job is working with people who dont want to work.the most enjoyable part of working is being in a good work plac
bad,"I want something with better pay,hours and closer to my home."
bad,"Grande pressão para cumprimento de metas, sem horários para receber ligações de supervisores cobrando e ameaçando substituição caso não alcance a meta, desvio de função ocorre diariamente, essa é a parte mais difícil do trabalho."
bad,"great customers daily , make sales and make sure customers are satisfied with the product of choice .Learned a lot in the electronics department .my co workers were very helpful. MGR`s were very kind and resourceful. I did not feel that the job was hard at all. I loved doing everything pertaining to my job."
bad,Over worked  filled grocery orders for nearby walmart super stores.
bad,"Before working at Walmart, I had been warned not to work there. Believe me I wish I would have listened.  Once I was employed by Walmart, I was told I would be given a fair wage based on experience. I soon found out that meant a couple cents more then minimum wage. I also learned pretty quick that the ''express'' in TLE( Tire, Lube and Express) didnt mean light bulbs and batteries as much as it meant painting the hoists or cleaning the walls.The Managerial Staff seems to not care about much more then costing the company money and getting paid. I would page for an on duty manager and sometimes wait up to an hour for a response from someone. This is unacceptable for a company that prides themselves on the Basic Beliefs of ```Respect for the individual```and ``Service to the customer``(2 of the 3 basic beliefs they force you to drill into your head). Working in the shop, I often had customers come in and complain about poor service. My managers solution was to just give away free services and products until the customer was satisfied. I found myself doing more free work per day on vehicles then anything else. While inquiring about a promotion, i was told that there are no promotions for TLE Technician's unless they leave the shop and work in another area. This was frustrating as I loved what I did, but knew it would never get me anywhere. I also often found myself working 12 hour shifts as no one felt obligated to show up to work and the shop manager was ``too busy`` to run the shop. "
bad,armonica mente ablando  es una empresa que trata de  cuidar muchas cosas pero des cuida alos emm pleados y alos clientes.
bad,I worked hard everyday but the position i had had me and the others fix and do other people's work and we cleaned up after everyone.  I did not feel appreciated at this job. Got blamed for things i did not do. I put forth more effort then needed staying well past my time to help shorthanded departments and I helped out where i wanted to move my position to and did not get recognized or looked at for job when they needed to hire someone and they hired someone with less experience than me and someone who wasn't certified on the equipment needed to do job properly.
bad,"The company is all about the company. Management covers money, customers cover their money. If you work at Wal-Mart make sure you cover your money."
bad,I would not recommend this place as a place of employment to anyone.
bad,"Has gone drastically downhill since I've worked there. poor management and very short staffed, therefore shelves not stocked full/properly or nothing gets zoned so has messy appearance. Always long lines up front due to lack of cashiers and salesfloor associates constantly being pulled up front to help, causing lack of staffing everywhere else in store."
bad,"A typical day at work: Helping customers throughout day- mostly."
bad,"   Stocking shelves, running the registers, answering the phones. Helping customers with their questions or to obtain locked items."
bad,I enjoyed my job at walmart meeting new people and having a chance at advancement within the company.My only complaint wa that management felt they could not work as hard as everyone else but woul dtake credit for others work.
bad,"it was dirty, nasty, messy. i did not like it at all. the management did not care if something went wrong, there was an average of three costumer complaints a day."
bad,"There is nothing good about this company to say. Every thing bad that a company can be, this one is all that. The hardest part of the job is going there. There is nothing enjoyable about it."
bad,"When I first started working for walmart. The manager there was a great manager very hands on. He was very concerned and the people in his store. He was hard on his managers because if you were an outsider every time you asked him for help with anything he would say you can find it on the web.. Let me say this Walmart is nothing like what I read in Sam Walton Book, that Walmart has long since died."
bad,"Wal-Mart D.C. Lewiston Maine.  They have a bad track record of terminating employees after 5 1/2 years. Reasons: You are at top pay and they can hire somebody new at a very much lower wage, you are fully vested in 401k at 6 years.  If they terminate you before 6 years, they get to take back some of the money they contributed."
bad,"Walmart used to be a great place to work.  I have been employed there for 5yrs.  Things have changed a lot and not for the best.  Hours have been cut and the whole attitude of Walmart has become less family oriented , customer friendly and more corporate.  Managers are not very friendly but they expect their employees to be friendly.  If your employees feel under appreciated how do you expect them to be happy and friendly towards the customers?"
bad,Unloading trucks. I learned that people are more bias than previously thought. Management could have been more diverse and fair. I liked my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managment and thier blatent acts of favoritsm. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of helping someone when I gave customer service.
bad,"Unloading trucks and then stocking merchandise."
bad,"a typical day can range, some days your a cashier, unloading a truck, pushing carts, inventory counts, changing prices, or putting away freight. You pretty much start at minimum wage and can earn up to 40 cents a year on your raise. You have an assigned assistant manager and listen to them or if they are not there you listen to any other assistant manger or store manager. my co-workers are pretty quiet. The hardest part of the job is staying calm in my opinion the communication is pretty bad and can give you a real headache.The best part of the job is the customers you meet, they can be quite interesting."
bad,Empresa nao agradavel para trabalhar!!!
bad,The job was ok but the there was a lot of back stabbing amongst employees and management too much drama at the job. Easy job the benefits was great. There was alway favortism and a lot of drama but it all depends what department you work.
bad,"wal mart de Americana tem uma diretotia e uma gerência que te coloca no ambiente de trabalho e não te auxilia nas atividades de trabalho o que se consegui fazer num dia de trabalho esta a sua vontade de apreender ou no modo que se consegui trabalhar em equipe ''tem se ter jogo de cintura ou se aquade a vivencia das pessoas'' um ambiente que não da valor aos funcionarios que são chamados de associados mas que na verdade não tem chance de opinião de melhorias a não ser que se faça parte da roda de ""amigos "" da gerência.ou seja a estabilidade depende de qual grau de relacionamento se tem dentro da empresa .Ambiente onde tem muitas pessoas com chances de vencer, gostava de trabalhar na profissão que estava mas a parte lamental foram 3anos diferença salarial dentro da mesma função e de experiencia com varias rotatividades de pessoas no ambiente trabalho.os beneficios são bons convenio medico,odontologico,vale transporte."
bad,"I realize how long this review is, however I feel it a necessary obligation to explain why I left a field and company in which I could have advanced further, and to expand upon my belief in workplace innovation and stress the need for efficiency."
bad,3rd shift worker. It was okay for most. Mangers wasn't so nice. I learned that it's best to keep quite and do your own work.
bad,The management never worked together at all. Different managers would pull people from different departments to work register and do other jobs that should have been manned. At any given walmart they seemed to not meet the required employees to work during the day. Either all the employees were out of toys on registers which made the department look rough for the next day. I've eye witness many threats on single mothers to work over time or they'd lose their job and in doing so lose their children.
bad,"a typical day at walmart is: showing up on time, cleaning area, straightening up foods and shelves, pulling truck and putting food in proper places, restocking shelves with food, pulling old food and throwing it away, and helping others when needed. ive learned that its harder than it looked to be an overnight stocker. if something is wrong with the equiptment in your area you have to fix it or find a way to fix it. ive learned that managment does care about vets who are injured. when your injured and a vet make sure you make it load and clear what you can and can not do before you get hired, so that way they cant say you didnt tell them and get fired. injured or not if you dont get your list of things to do done by the managments eyes you get talked to about it. if you get three talkings about anything they let you go. this walmart is not family type people, or care about employees families. the hardest part of this job was pulling the trucks and getting locked out when dumping trash. the enjoyable part of this job was going home to my family and the discount i got for the store."
bad,"the assistant managers plays mind games and intimidates every associate and trys to make it look like a joke i was disrespected and mistreated because they knew i had a child to look after the manager played favorites only letting the onces they liked to advance or change job title when they needed it .alot of times it was roomered of sexual favors for job promotion usually attractive females would be promoted some managers used fake reciepts scanner in a small office so they could take home whatever they wanted,i have been yelled at a few times working there, they keep a hand full of people over 6 years to make the others think they have a chance of staying in that company , i was fired for a bogus reason that i should of got a lawyer but it wasnt worth it that place is not worth it unless you can look past all the lies and backstabing.disrespect from the managers. but i dont want to let a few bad apples spoil the bunch but people with power end up abusing it.Walmart does no need bully's to manage a store make walmart union stop the bully's ."
bad,"na maioria dos dias de trabalho voçe não cosegue sair no horario em que foi contratado(a) nem na hora de ir almoçar, voçe não tem horario definido.E acaba não conseguindo chegar na escola a tempo ou em otros compromiços,mas a alimentaçao é otima voçe paga pouco almoça ali na cosinha da empresa e se alimenta bem fica mais disposto para trabalhar."
bad,"Walmart in Harrisburg is not a good place to work. It is all about men, I will never work or shop there anymore."
bad,Will not allow employee to work enough hours to make job worth the time.
bad,"trabalhava de mais e ganhava de menos. muitas reclamações por parte dos clientes e tambem da gerencia. foi um lugar aonde eu comecei a trabalhar em açougue, conheci as carnes e fiz muito bem a minha parte."
bad,I've been here almost 13 years & I don't like the way the company operates & treats it's associates. Very low morale with anyone that works for them. Not good at all.
bad,From cashier to management advancement is all about who you know.
bad,it was good all around the board to me but the pay I enjoyed working the people was great nice super friendly just hated the low pay for such hard work
bad,a typical day consisted of face to face interaction with customers i learned how to use a cash register. as far as management there were to many chiefs not enough Indians. didnt have time to interact with co-workers. the hardest part of the job was the endless groceries. the most enjoyable part was the breaks we had. and the rare encounters of good customers.
bad,Don't expect anything over minimum wage. They treat you like dirt.
bad,The company was a fun place to work 7 years ago when I first started there. The company has evolved to think more about business and making money and more about taking care of its high end managers rather than taking care of their associates. I will never work for this company ever again. I'd rather work fast food and be a fry cook than work here as a manager again.
bad,good co workers bad compensation bad chances for opportunity to advancement ..
bad,Walmart is a big corporation who has lost the ability to care at all for their employees. Employees are mistreated and used and little is done to change it.
bad,"Receive and disburse money in establishments other than financial institutions. Usually involves use of electronic scanners, cash registers, or related equipment. Often involved in processing credit or debit card transactions and validating checks."
bad,"Sadly, I was the emplyee who did all of the work while three others did just about nothing.. Then they complained about me to management and lost my job for me, how lovely is that?"
bad,"It ain't about customer ,about a quick dollar."
bad,20 years ago it was a good family oriented work place. Now they have forgotten family and micro-manage your whole day
bad,"Monitor workforce, uphold stndards of customer service and maintain high in-stock position and in-charge of half the store."
bad,"I have worked for this company on third shift for about a few years and in that time I have not advanced in the least. I still do the same job now that I did when I started. It's funny because I work really hard, yet I get nowhere. My raises aren't anything to write home about. I am overlooked for positions that I apply for. Then those same people who I observed chatting away hour after hour with other employees, and hobnobbing with the managers . . . Yes, they received the promotions and higher raises and always worked the easiest departments with a lot of assigned help. Hard work is not rewarded here. The managers can be bullies too."
bad,"This place was so bad, my husband dreaded me going to work too. The place lacked a wanting of customer satisfaction and happiness, and more concerned about how much profit they can pull in. Employee satisfaction was the last priority on their list."
bad,"I was employed for two years and thru those two years I was unappreciated, undervalued, and looked over. Wal-mart is the biggest grocery store retailor; however, their treatment of their employees is appauling, and their managers should not be managers."
bad,It can be pretty hectic and that's only because everyone is not on the same page with things. I learned how to work the money center as far as sending/ receiving money grams and also cashing checks. The management needs to be improved. Most of the managers in my store are either related to the employees or really good friends with them which makes it a lot harder on the workers like myself. Its best to stay to yourself just go to work and do your part. Don't try to make friends because in the end you'll make enemies without even knowing it. The hardest part of the job is trying to follow proper procedure from one manager when the other said to do it a different way. The most enjoyable part is being able to help the guests and everyone walks away happy.
bad,"Cashier which meant checking customers out. Also, worked customer service quite a bit with customers returning items. I learned from this job what Wal Mart is really about....greed! The management team in the beginning of my employment was great but really fell downwards as management changed toward the end of me working their. I loved all my co-workers and made some long lasting friendships by working there. The hardest part was we never had enough cashiers which made people have to wait extra long in line, and they were mad but their was nothing I could do about it. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fun I had with other co-workers and their friendship."
bad,"long hours, terrible environment, no feeling of accomplishment, not enough shifts, your raise is 50 cents but you got to beast none stop i think its impossible and I'm the best"
bad,"you would count your money if signing on a new register. Greet your custmers scan their grocery or clothing and ask what tranaction cash,credit,or debit. Bag their things for them and welcome them to come back. Co-workers was fun to wrk with.The hardest part of the job was the hours or not getting enough hours."
bad,I learn from day to day that Wal-mart is not a place for me. They do not stick to policy.
bad,a parte mais difícil do trabalho é ouvir as reclamações dos clientes!!!!
bad,I worked there for seven years and got fired for selling super glue to a 17 year old. Not to happy about that. So as of right now I don't have a lot of nice things to say about that company.
bad,I would not recommend working for walmart. The pay is average raises are yearly but minimal. Management for the most part is pretty terrible. I have brought many problems to their attention both safety issues and inventory issues. They either fail to correct issues in a timely manner or just completely ignore the issues all together. It took them 6 -8 months to fix a very serious safety issue a couple of my co workers and I had brought to their attention many times. Inventory issues which cause a cascade effect if not managed will cause either a shortage of inventory or an over abundance of inventory that ends up clogging the back room making it very difficult to get my daily tasks done especially around the holiday season. If you hear some one complain that Walmart is constantly out of stock of products...that's why. The A/M's do not listen to you and are terrible at scheduling. If you want to work at Walmart and hope to get days off when needed forget it. They do not look at your time off requests unless you bug them constantly about it. Same goes for growth in the company. If you want to change positions you have to bug them almost weekly until they give in. If you want to move up in the company you better pray you are one of the favorites. If you work in a position that takes a lot of training and you want to move to another position you better have a really good reason for moving because they will find a way to coach you to prevent you from moving. If you get coached you can't move any where or transfer for 6 months until that coaching falls off you record. They care more
bad,"Most unscrupulous, unethical company one could work for."
bad,I would not recommend this for a place of work for anyone with a family or someone who intended to do so in the close future.
bad,"Didn't enjoy the overnights and that may be why I rate so poorly, but I did work overnights at my current workplace and it seemed much more enjoyable where I am now. They don't value much customer interaction when you are stocking shelves. The philosophy was get your work done quickly and ignore distractions."
bad,"Although they have great benifits,WalMart might be the worst job to have. They are unprofessional, unorganized, and inconsiderate with their employees. While working there I felt like I wasn't going anywhere and that I would never finish school. They would schedule people just for the sake of it. Sometimes there weren't enough casheirs and sometimes they didn't have any. The supervisors would make the cashiers feel below them like they were worth nothing and point out thier mistakes instead of helping them not to make that mistake."
bad,"unfriendly, expect you to work with no equipment that is need"
bad,This company is a joke. They treat there employees with no respect. Management has no clue as to what to do in tire lube express. Not consistent with company policy on returns and customer complaints. No life outside if you want to grow with this company.
bad,"Always short staffed, constant micro management while breathing down your neck, constant pressure no matter how hard you try to get the work done. They do not appreciate their employees, always disrespect us, plus my coworkers were always getting me in trouble every chance they could just to see someone go to the office. Management just does not care as long as the work gets done without pitching in to help."
bad,Come in a little early but cant clock in.
bad,"I had a very bad experience there, it was very personal and it bothered and scared me severely. I went to management about this problem and they attempted to help me out, but in the end it didn't help me out at all and I had to quit."
bad,"I wish I would've listened to my son and never went to work for Walmart! He said they don't treat their employees very good. I have learned that in the years I worked for them. Don't trust your co-workers and especially management! They don't care anything about you, your life,family,other commitments. They say customers are number one, but management won't even show up when a customer asks for one. I use to love my job there, but day after day, it just got worse. I slowly started hating my job. They fire the hardest,honest,best workers they have, and keep the worst,lazy,dishonest ones. Why, because they are cheap! They get rid of you if you are making good wages, so they can hire for minimum wage. There should be something done for the bullying and harassing that we put up with, to try keeping our jobs! I would not recommend Walmart to anyone!"
bad,"Worked there for 6yrs with nearly a clean record and got fired for 'alledegy' stealing money (which I did not due and they do not have any footage). As a supervisor you are not given the resources to your job correctly (hours, staff, tools)."
bad,I do not have anything good to say about my experience as a Walmart employee.
bad,"There is an absolute lack of communication among managers and the favoritism is rampant. If it is true that attitude is reflective of leadership, then the overwhelming attitude of most walmart employees that they are enduring a prison sentence is definitely due to the deplorable leadership. I myself have been told on more than one occasion to not do the job correctly, but just to do it fast and make it look good. I have been told to tell customers whatever they want to hear to get them out the door quickly, and it was made clear to me that I wasn't being told what I was hearing. There was a tremendous subculture of "" this is the walmart way, and this is how we do it and they may not always be the same""."
bad,"Walmart wasn't hard at all, not enough pay, other co-workers goes around bragging about bonuses that the entire store put in but only the ones that been there longer gets all the bonuses. And they have really bad clicks been around alot of adults that still act like children. Management was head of the clicks and of course would break all the rules and had such poor attitudes. And management socialized with certain people and those certain people was the same people. I did enjoy moving the lines out meeting people. The co-workers were moody one day they want to talk to you and the next day they don't like you. Walmart had to many personalities for me to keep up with. It was never the same. I enjoy fast paced environments so I was fun for me when a lot people come in the store shopping."
bad,A typical day was stocking shelves and helping customers.
bad,Could be less stressful if management could all be on the same page.
bad,Constant customer to employee humiliation
bad,"a lot of favoritims, and there is not justice, a lot of abuse to the regular associates"
bad,I began the day doing inventory on cell phone stock. Interact with customers by explaining the details of a cell phone contract and the many different phone to choose from. Perform contracts and activations. I would help the customer with technical difficulties they would have with their current device. I would contact their current cell phone provider for them. I enjoyed being able to assist the customer.
bad,The waynesboro walmart is terrible to their associates. They will fire you on your death bed.
bad,A typical day at work:
bad,There is no communication with management and associates.
bad,"Bake various bakery goods such as breads, muffins, doughnuts, etc., clean department and prep area, stock shelves, weigh and price goods accordingly, help customers find the products they need, empty trash, stock and organize freezer, throw freight, breakout items for baking, was training in cake decorating."
bad,go outside check on how many vehicles need to be worked one. I am often pulled inside to work freight or help in other departments.
bad,I started at Walmart in high school that's when the company was fun to work at. I started at the College Drive store then later ended my career there at the Denham Springs location. Some of the people there were fun to work with while others would go around harrassing you for no reason. I think Walmart is a great job for anyone needing part time work because they do not vaule family or they don't even try and help people that are students.
bad,"wal-mart, it a job that about it, you will be over work under pay and can't not get over time."
bad,Its just a job not a career and dont expect much just do your job and go home.
bad,I am an honest and dedicated person. I cannot say the same for the rest of my co-workers and managers.
bad,"I worked at the Walmart Neighborhood Market in Rio Rancho, NM. I have never worked somewhere that had a environment this bad. I worked as part of the early morning stock crew which consisted of breaking down pallets of products then separating them by aisle. After this we put the product away. The job itself was okay but the crew that was there was horrendous. When I got hired part time everyone else in the department was mad that I was hired since it meant less hours for them and I was treated very poorly because of it. There were two employees specifically who were the most rude disrespectful people I have ever worked with. They were these low class hillbilly type who seemed angry all the time at everybody for every reason. Management was just like yeah thats the way they are so dont let it get to you and were going to something about them soon but never did."
bad,I work there for the money did not deal with the CEO at all really only dealt with management Who were not that pleasant. I worked there until I found better employment after a year I decided to just re-locate.
bad,Walmart is a place to work to get your feet wet and help you build your resume. Walmart will pretty much hire anyone. Sometimes they don't care. All they care is money
bad,"Their points system is absolute trash!!! They don’t take doctors notes at all and they get mad if you leave sick even if they see you’re sick. It’s almost like they don’t care, sure they give you PTO but once you’re out you’re done and if you still get sick after you use up your OTO they will start taking away your points"
bad,"Management was terrible during my experience. My department manager continuously lied on my to assistant managers and had me moved out of my department to a department I didn't like with NO PROOF,"
bad,Management will not care if you live or die or if a co-worker assalted you they will not move your location unless you kiss butt. They also expect employees to work agenst availability
bad,"A typical day at work was normal stocking of merchandise while also delivering good customer service, management was on an okay level have major room for improvement"
bad,New attendance policy is a joke. Lost my job because they wouldnt excuse two busted tires caused by a rock slide on way to work. Management played favorites. Nicest person in there was in human resources
bad,"Jefes corruptos, desvalorizan el trabajo  un ambiente muy tóxico, donde todos los demás están pendientes de lo que no les importa, incluyendo a los superiores."
bad,"Your just a number to them. No matter how hard you have work or did what you had to do for your associates you are not recognized. With store structures that are changing in the company all the hard work was for nothing, they have favoritism and that is all"
bad,"For new hires, you have no PTO built up. My child got sick, and I obviously had to take care of him. I got fired because of this after a manager told me not to worry about it, it would be okay. Then they changed management within the week I was out. The new manager fired me."
bad,"You can meet lifelong friends at Wal-Mart."
bad,"the company was great, but management at Fairmont was terrible, if you were not in their click they destroyed any possibility of a career, they wouldn't help after being diagnosed with cancer telling me 3 days before they terminated me about Sedgwick and they told me I needed a dr note, before I could get it they fired me. Jealousy and hatred because my work ethic was greater then theirs, they were very angry and jealous."
bad,The Walmart I worked at was a joke. Management sucked no one wanted to do their job unless it benefited them. There were a lot of inappropriate relationships going on between management and employee’s. Management played favorites. I would stay almost all day to finish my work(because no one would help) and I did not feel appreciated or valued.
bad,Walmart is all about making a dollar. I worked for years since the nineteen ninties.  The last five it has went way down. Its  not Sams place or ideals anymore!
bad,"I was fired on my off day because I was inna accident . It was hard days , it was good days . A lot of the managers are very disrespectful and won’t work anything out with you concerning life problems ."
bad,"They domt attend to their workers like other jobs, they have awful supervisors, the only thing good was the pay but it was 200$ a week and you got paid bi-weekly"
bad,"I was so excited about getting the job at Walmart in Mt sterling ky as a personal shopper. Boy was I ever disappointed, and was not impressed at all on how they train or the environment there. First day showed you maybe one time on the pick run, didn't show you the lay out of the rf scanner in case you did run into a problem, the Co workers talk bad about one anotherconstantly !!!!!"
bad,"Managers don’t treat people fairly they have their own preferences, and they will treat people unfairly , they put too much pressure on you and you’ll work a lot for a minimum pay"
bad,I worked rain snow and shine and they would not provide us with water unless it was over 100 degrees and told us we could just buy water but told us we couldn’t unless we were on break so had to wait hours between drinking anything sometimes did not feel like I was even a human in there eyes
bad,"Bad management ,but if you are friends with the right people you can move up fast with minimal experience and you team members will help train you in you new position."
bad,It’s a job if you need one. WalMart takes care of themselves and every employee is replaceable. Once you have time in with the company they will find a random reason to let you go. Anyone can come in and be a manager and most of the time they have little education or training in that field.
bad,"Supervisores asalariados,y supervisores por hora con un lenguaje súper pobre,gritos descriminacion,abuso de poder y sobre todo prepotencia hacia los asociados. Recursos humanos"
bad,They  cared more about the bottom like than employees they make you work off the clock so they don't have to pay overtime. Can't get a sence of belonging due to others feeling the same way.
bad,"•  management is lazy, even when you ask for something they dont want to do it."
bad,They show to much favoritism. They want who they want just due to the fact they drink with them or hang out. They always say associates are replaceable for cheaper money.
bad,honestly walmart isnt bad just it was difficult for me to get there and im not really one for being part of walmart's crew if i had to would work there again though because the pay is great.
bad,A company that does not care about its employees. They will overwork and underpay you then complain that you cannot do the job of multiple people by yourself.
bad,"Walmart provides a fast paced, unreasonable expectation with little encouragement environment.  The assistant manager position is a 'fall guy"" job that merely protects the store manager."
bad,Yey don't care about their staff or their customers. They don't bother training them to help customers and it costs them thousands of dollars per week
bad,"I've worked here for less than a year on cap 2, and I already have a lot to say about Walmart."
bad,"A typical day at walmart is stressful.  Don't have enough cashiers, hiring young people that does not want to work, always calling out, have attitude problems, disrespectable to customers when they asked them a questions.  Hours are harsh."
bad,Helping customers with their shopping experience and help them merchandise they may be looking for and assisting them if they have questions about the online shopping the company offers.
bad,You’ll regret it believe me Would not recommend it especially if you don’t like taking  from irate angry customers who think they should get a cheap 19.95 oil change quick despite you telling them and being able to see you have other customers ahead of them I didn’t stay there 3 weeks and ran into more mess than I did being a security Officer for 7 years I kid you not some of the craziest cheapest people come there  again don’t you’ve been warned
bad,It nothing like I expected the people where nice most of the managment cared about you  if you needed something they would try to the best of there abilities to help you
bad,"A few years ago I would have recommended Walmart to anyone that would listen to me. Now, everything has changed. Management is all about their own advancement and will step all over you to make themselves look better...even if this means blaming you for something you had nothing to do with."
bad,Poor management which basically impacts the whole job aspect. At the store I worked for personally the environment was stressful. We usually had no help from other managers when the department was failing. Honestly just not a good place to work.
bad,"I currently came back to Walmart after walking away a couple of years ago. When I needed a job again without the travel of my last job, I jumped at the chance to go back to Walmart. When I was with Walmart before, it was a great working experience. Now though, it has become a micromanaging company. All of the salaried management team is only there to better themselves, and they do not work as a cohesive unit. It does not matter how hard you work, or the speed you work at, everything you do here is wrong now. I honestly don't know what changes in a couple of years to make this company great to work for into what it has become today."
bad,"I think Walmart could be a good place for some , yet it is still mediocre... it makes you feel like you should stay after you master the POINT system... but usually people with kids that POINT system isn’t always fool proof. My manager wasn’t very good. She wasn’t worried about the employees or the over all “team” more herself an HER store HER THINGS HER register HER FLOOR just a very belittling rude witch."
bad,When I first started with them in 2003 it was an ok place to work After a few years so much changed in the company they stopped caring about there people
bad,"Management does not care about the employees, only their pockets."
bad,"The only decent thing about working for Walmart was the relationships you build with some of the customers/ co-workers. However it wasn't with very many. The majority of Walmart was very much drama oriented and there was a lot of favoritism at play. Most were extremely lazy and would leave unfinished work for the next shift with absolutely no repercussions. There was no product rotation and on several occasions expired products were served to the customers. All the equipment was either covered in mold or like in the rotisserie over the racks had years of cooked on chicken on them. Completely unsanitary. Most who would purchase the premade sandwiches or chickens would end up with a slight case of diarrhea and well I hate to break it to you, but that is a case of food poisoning. I have advise everyone I know not to purchase anything from them. Better off going to publix and paying the extra in order to avoid getting sick or even worse!"
bad,Work Life Balance was terrible. Letting the Market Manager know about time off needed he said if the stores not right it’s not right he also spent to much time threatening rather than help teaching creating a toxic environment . Also lot of bickering amongst long term associates some would rather blame Mgmt and other shifts rather than help finish the task at hand to provide  service.excellenservicederivatives
bad,"This company is fine, if you have nothing else in your life. The mentality comes across as “live to work” rather than “work to live.” My position does not allow scheduling conducive to any kind of life outside of work."
bad,Make up rules as they go. No job security.  Pick and choose who advances. Seriously be late call off and you too could be a manager at walmart. Saftey depends on what they need done and who's doing it. Would never recommend employment here to anyone. Cant wait to see if Walmart raises there wage to meet Illinois wage increase. And the distribution center is worse. Home town store has 5 checkouts and 14cselff checks cant wait till black Friday
bad,Management sucked! Benefits weren’t the best but they had ok ones! Great people to work with but management was poorly awful! Very disrespectful! Store manager was nice!
bad,"it was an alright place to work, the people were nice. Management on the other hand, was horrible. they are not very understanding of people with mental health issues."
bad,"One of my CSMs is so incompetent that she makes me wish I had never taken the job in the first place. She is constantly harping on myself and other fellow cart pushers to do our jobs, when we are obviously doing it. She will tell us to do our job while we are literally in the middle of bringing carts in. We’re well functioning teenagers and were able to do a simple job. This job is so easy a special needs person could do it. In fact, they have done it. Then he got fired. Chill out and let us do our job without getting yelled at for zero reason at all every minute and a half."
bad,"This place is a fast environment job, but stressful. Every details matters. You can get an occurrence for everything. I won't stay long there. Too much stress."
bad,"I’ve been on both sides hourly/salary.  "
bad,"Walmart would be a much better place to work if the IT department at corporate was competent enough to rewrite their inventory software to stop wasting associates' time by having them try to stock items that are already filled on the shelf. "
bad,The job wasn't bad except their was no support from management and the standing without a pad is hard on your feet and legs. There are things that management ask you to do that is unrealistic.
bad,our manager was a mean rude person that would pick someone to yell at even if they didn't do anything wrong. poor scheduling it would be good for a few weeks then they would try to schedule you when you have asked not to put you on those hours. They did this constantly every other week.
bad,"Co Manager and Store Manager make rules for everyone to follow, Assistant Managers go behind their backs and make us break those rules. They dont hire anyone and make employees learn departments they were not even hired for and drag them out of their own departments so nothing gets done work wise. I do not recommend working here."
bad,I have been working in claims for four years . The high of my job was helping associates understand how to work with hazmat and where to place there claims . My low of my job was when I found out that they would be closing the doors for Walmart . My supervisor was amazing and we worked very well together as a team .
bad,The store I worked at was horrible the only thing the managers cared about was their yearly bonus the only thing the regional manager cared about is if the store made money. Most of the management team doesn’t care about you. They’ll schedule you when ever they want for however many hours they want unless you bug them crazy out of them to change it. The benefits are worth it if you brown nose and can put up with all the bs
bad,Would never work at a Walmart again. My team was great but management was incompetent and were selfish when it came to balancing employee happiness and business success. They would also reprimand us if we went one second over 40 hours. YES ONE SECOND. It's like working under a dictator
bad,"I think the management, although very competitive, was apparently what Walmart as a whole wanted. I would not recommend a position here over a long period of time."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in, then checking the back room. If there is freight in the back room, my job is to bring that freight onto the work floor then run it accordingly. I've learned how to read labels and how to properly stock shelves according to Walmart standards. The job all around is very easy, and very repetitive."
bad,"Employees treat each other poorly and management shows favoritism to their nationality. Speaking different language in front of you. So rude. Floor supervisors act like they're so important and special. Their jobs are a dime a dozen. I only worked for Walmart to get out of the house once in a  while. We didn't need the money. So if they think they're better than you, remind them that they work at Walmart. Lol."
bad,"Not a good place to work at unless you are 18 and have no family. Managed very bad. Many workers don’t care because "
bad,Management sucks the system sucks some people are not to bad but mostly bad work environment people who work there generally hate it not enough accociates to ever get work finished
bad,"I worked two years, and as a cashier this is the worest stress you will ever have. Not only are you spoken badly to every single day but you also called stupid, deaf, or useless. Beware if your young and cute the stalker of the town may seek you out. So dont walk home alone at night."
bad,Most days I don't mind working at walmart. My position is good and pay is alright. The problem is depending on the store you are at experience can vary. Dept managers have a fairly set schedule which i like but at my store anytime I bring up a problem to management I am the problem to them. No help from management and you are expected to do everything without the hands required. 99% of the time you are short handed but expected to do 5 people's jobs.
bad,Need more respect for the individual and backup their employees.  Management comes and go so click quickly I don't even know half their names And they also need to follow the policy a little better than they do
bad,They hardly show any real compassion and appreciation for their employees. Late giving lunches and breaks. Like almost 6 hrs into shift sometimes never getting lunch break. Need to get permission to use the bathroom. If its busy u can forget it. Rude CSMs n customers. N u can get fired over things not even in you control.
bad,"To many changes, management horrible no work life balance no family time no peace of mind no me time if you have kids or family dont advance in company company I's all for themselves"
bad,"Walmart is the worst place to work at. Management sucks. The only good thing about is the pay, but not even the pay is worth staying. Don't waste your time."
bad,Not happy there customers where very nasty. Line where over packed because there was not enough lanes open. Walmart is a very busy store that need enough employees to run all departments.
bad,"Very strict on the rules, management is ridiculous. Nobody should have to quit or get fired for their percentage specially when it's slow and hardly enough work.  The way they treat people, work us like slaves. They are trying to get rid of most of Walmart people so they can hire more sovereign people. So they wont have to pay so much to Walmart people, based on my experience I've there 6 yrs I wont ever work again treated me like I don't know how to do anything and kept giving me occurrences and steps because they weren't satisfied with my production I wasn't go fast enough."
bad,"The job is okay but extremely stressful. I was by myself a lot and had to man the customers in the baker, phones as well as the deli. Asking for help is pointless they will tell you they are but help never shows up.. you are expected to do everything yourself and if you don't finish everything ,because you are not are not allowed overtime, you get wrote up. It's to much work for one person with disabilities."
bad,"When I worked at Walmart some time ago, a family member and I were working there even though we were in two different places, I was treated poorly and so was my family member, and when we had asked for different departments due to issues, we were denied. My family member had asked for an earlier work schedule so they could go home and see their own family, but they were denied as well. When I was being sexually harassed by an older co-worker, nothing was done."
bad,"The first 10 years great, the next eight years not so great. If you get sick with a disease or have to go get a tampon out of your car they find a way to let you go. The tampon part I was told if I had gone and found a manager first, or after I'd gone to get the tampon if I'd found a manager and apologized I would have kept my job"
bad,You will work like a slave with this company. You will be pushed to the point of exhaustion and defeat on a daily basis by UPPER management and be expected to do your supervisors tasks whole they are busy doing other tasks. Each department WILL be understaffed and you're required to work the load of 3 people in 3 hours.
bad,"Garbage. Constant disrespect, terrible even by retail standards. Do yourself a favor and don't work at any Walmart, ever. This job will suck your soul out in a bad way."
bad,I worked at walmart for almost 2 years up untell 2 weeks ago I got tired of being treated badly the some of the managers treat you bad and some of the employees are rude to they show favoritism
bad,I just spent way too much time organizing shelves that could have been spent doing something more to help my crew. They threw me into my job as manager with no help. I worked long hours and 6 days a week trying to keep ittogether until my new tram
bad,WalMart was a very stressful place to work they put way more work on you than you can handle I was sometimes working 14 days in a row with only one day off I was an excellent employee was able to do more than most was doing my job which was Inventory Control plus Stocking Cashier Customer Service and more and when I wasn't able to complete my actual job I would get in trouble I was always taught you do what your boss tells you to do
bad,Management was the worst I have worked with. Not giving you the proper instructions for the job that needed to be done. When mistakes made they chastise you rather then teaching you the right way
bad,Good for a first time job. But very unorganized. Your job often feel like its not secure. The rules are often changed . but one good thing will be walmart is family oriented sometimes they make you wanna come to work.
bad,Was not trained properly. Had to learn things on my own. Management was hard to talk to about anything. There has been more than one manager at this facility.  I am currently looking for work somewhere else.
bad,He is not a good boss he lies and he is not a good boss at all he puts u on days when u can’t work on those days and he said u miss a lot of works days when u don’t
bad,"Im harrased by management, they promised a raise when i changed departments and i didnt get it, the accused me of steeling when i was doing my job, i get moved to places that i dont know anything about and trained myself in most departments, racist comments from a manager, corporate doesnt care about the employees, theres too much to list. Ive experienced so many bad things at my store"
bad,Don't work at Walmart because Walmart does not care about its employees.  Pharmacy Manager was immature and sent a Store manager to tell me she wanted me transferred.  Cliquish atmosphere.
bad,Overall it's a great company if you are hourly. As you move in to salary your life belongs to Walmart. Asked to work late to complete tasks  job is never done to company expectations.  Overall lazy staff poor screening of applicants and over all lack of training. Managers hold associates to expectation without correcting teaching associates. I wouldn't recommend salary life to any job applicant.
bad,"Current employee, each store is different to a degree, depends on management. Some store managers are all about bullying, and harassment. Need to have everyone in the building written up. Very stressful environment. would not recommend it to anyone, you will be hurt in the long run"
bad,"I wouldnt recomend working here to my wors enemy. Most of the staff is fine to be around, but a couple of them just make it absolutley unbearable. Management in this brach is an ablsolute joke. The manager that they have overseeing the TLE hardly knows anything about automobiles, yet proceeds to act like they know what they are talking about. Not to mention that they have held my last paycheck hostage, and wont pay me. Horible experience. Won't even go in there to shop anymore."
bad,Its good to work at if u need money staying long term that depends they pick favorites. The management sucks there can't make up there mind on what they want u to do.
bad,"Once you have to deal with upper management is when the problem starts at Walmart, they have no respect for you at work or at home, ignoring culture.."
bad,"They are friendly at first to work with as you first begin working there. As time went on, you start to see favoritism being showed. They would not let me move to another department after doing almost two years front end. I was also a college student and they did not take a liking to my schedule changes, which caused me to be on their bad side. Management showed true colors, which was the end point of me quitting."
bad,It's Wal-Mart. Just lower your job expectations and you'll do fine. Management are sold on the whole sam Walton is God thing. Advancements are available but not easily attained. It's amazing how some get to be managers while others stay sales associates
bad,"Horrible place to work. Catty, drama-filled work environment. You’re surrounded by a bunch of older people that know they’ll be at Walmart forever, so they make your work days terrible."
bad,I worked at the plattsburgh walmart and its the worst 0 communication in the store. Managerment gets away with yelling and disrespecting the employees and when you go to the higher ups they will find something to get you into trouble or make you quit. The employees talk about everyone and anyone and when bring it to management they (managerment) do not solve the problem at all due to favoritism.
bad,I got unlucky and worked at a walmart where the Management was rife with abuse and selfish actions. That was my experience but doesnt reflect on walmart as a whole
bad,The managers at the Bartpw Florida walmart.have been known to fire people that they do not like based of bias opinions and favortism. So in short I would not work theyer ever again
bad,Was let go without cause. They don’t follow proper disciplinary policies. If they don’t like you you’re gone. Poorly staffed. I was miserable working there.
bad,Walmart has shady tactics and are very dishonest. Their network is connected with crime organizations and will enter your property illegally so if working here dont talk to anyone about anything and keep your ears open
bad,"1st day there SM was rude dismissive, and every day after I recevied rude comments such as you're stupid, none of my mgmt worth anything. Then was told I was innapropriate with associate never any proof, family never comes first and found mgmnt in office playing pokeman more then working store."
bad,"Job treats you like a kid when all of us are adults .The manager's stop the advancement of some employees because of personal feelings and thoughts, some manager's practice racism and look out for whites only.This would be a good place to work if you had the right people in charge.This is a retail giant so i guess there's no stopping them."
bad,"Barely any staff, overwork and burns out staff. Changes schedules and cut hours without proper notifications. Unsanitary. Lack of security. Health hazard."
bad,"The job did keep you busy. Unfortunately, the company wouldn't work around Honeywell hours. As result, I had to leave Walmart. I loved talking to the public."
bad,At Walmart I enjoyed it at first until the management was not taking care of serious situations like they should have been taken care of. I feel as though with many of situations it felt unsafe working there.
bad,"My experience working at Walmart was pretty good for awhile but then turned pretty dismal. I had a pretty nice manager in the shoe department, unfortunately I had a horrible CS manager who tried to micromanage and also tried to fire me after I got hit by a car. Terrible experience overall!!"
bad,"Everything was horrible. The general energy is negative from management on down. They don't train, they're understaffed so you're overworked. Just awful."
bad,"What Walmart writes and says is not what Walmart practices.  Walmart has excelled at creating an environment that takes full advantage of the pharmacist but gives little more than a paycheck in return.  More and more is asked of pharmacists and management hides behind diminishing returns on prescriptions to motivate pharmacists to do more (without increase in pay) to keep staff hours in their pharmacies.  Strangely, Walmart stock price doesn't seem to reflect this dire set of circumstances.  Maybe one day the 65+ year old pharmacists will retire and the pharmacy schools will stop indiscriminately graduating more pharmacists into a jobless market."
bad,Everything about the pharmacy is a mess. Walmart in general isn’t the worst but I would not recommend the pharmacy. I worked there for 6+ years and in the months leading up to my departure were the most stressful I’d ever encountered. Not enough staff and hours always being cut despite being behind. After weeks of being called an idiot and getting yelled at by every customer because we simply couldn’t keep up I decided to leave.
bad,With all the changes to policy walmart is going down hill fast. Assocoates are just bodys taking up space. I was canned because of a lying drama queen teen ager.
bad,"Culture is not good.  People that's been there for a long time don't like following rules, as a new manager, it was hard enough to adjust with little training plus the attitude of people makes it harder.  Higher management are the hardest people to follow rules, they break rules, specially safety, and they are setting a bad example. The most enjoyable part is working with some people that really likes you."
bad,Very stressful ☹️ manigment is very degrading towards employees  manigment and employees are not nice to customers they make u go through pathways training but do not follow what they teach
bad,"When you see new employees, beware your job may be at risk. This is an at will job and at will state ( most states are now), meaning company doesn't need reason for termination, which is Walmart."
bad,"Management at my Wal-Mart location was very poor, and most associates didn't care about the job. Employees that should have been fired wouldn't get terminated when they were supposed to, the department was never cleaned, and more."
bad,I loved working for Walmart as a Company. My Store Manager did not understand work life balance and wanted you in the store 13-14 hrs per day. She di not understand having to pick your child up from after school programs.
bad,I did not like working for Wal-Mart the management was rude to customers as well as employees they talked down to employees I just didn't like my experience there but I loved my customers
bad,"Not one individual I'm associated with can fondly look back at our time with Wal-Mart. It is possible in other towns it may be different. Through shifting management ranging from assistant managers all the way to the GM, things can be lost in passing including request for time off or even correctly informing superiors of issues brought to their attention. Though they would have you believe they ate sell a family friendly company it doesn't feel that way not even for long timer associates still with the company after so many years"
bad,"The company has gone downhill in recent years, at least with how they treat the employees.  It's no fun going in and being treated badly by both the customers and the company.  They claim there is work/life balance, but I haven't really seen it.  Morale is the lowest I've ever seen it.  There is never enough help in any department, so it really hurts and adds more stress and work on people when someone else is out, either as a call off or on vacation/personal time/etc..  "
bad,Had great management up until 3 months ago and all it is now is micromanagement. The pay is pretty good but it’s just not worth it. You can’t have any friends here they have “spies” everywhere. Also make me super uncomfortable because they watch cameras constantly spying on everyone.
bad,Walmart was an alright place to work. They are really big on ethics in the interview process. You get to know a lot of nice people. I loved my customers.
bad,Its an okay place to work if you don't have kids. Also if you got the right management in place you should be fine. Don't ever change your your availability because you will get little to none hours and they always say well you got to open your availability .
bad,Pésimo ambiente laboral y carga de trabajo
bad,under staff is a constant problem one that will be ignored by management there solution is pulling people from other departments and have them do someones else job and then get upset when there job did not get done. most of them wont lift a finger to help unless someone above them is coming in then they make sure they look good other then that good luck find one when you need help with something and if you do find them they smart off at you
bad,"If your manager is good, the place is bearable. However, the constant restructuring coming down from up top is an ever-nagging reminder of how bad corporate management is in this company. They are constantly trying new policies on a nationwide level after they ""Succeed"" at a very small seed of test stores, and regardless of associate/ managerial feedback."
bad,"Worked more than the pay was worth. The people weren't there to make friends or talk or do anything, it's just you, about 200+ pounds of merchandise on a single palette, and a whole section to be restocked. You could have also been randomly selected to help in a completely different area and still expected to get your area done."
bad,"Management is a joke, snapping and disrespectful. The more u learn, the more u do.   You can do up to 5 jobs in one shift besides your own. The new attendance policy hurts everyone except the favorites of the managers."
bad,I loved my job it was the mgmt that made it hard. They were too busy in their clicks to see the real issues. Hateful and rude. They talked down to u all the time. Unless you were in their click u didn't matter
bad,"I enjoyed working in the deli it was ok.. I love my teammates they were fun to work with, but the management was awful just going to say.. They need better management.."
bad,They won’t work with your schedule they don’t care about you your replaceable I would never work there again they don’t know how to talk to people or treat them and they don’t care if your sick or your kids sick they still want you at work
bad,Management is poor. They overwork you or out you in different departments but don’t pay you enough.. even if you’re doing a mangers work. Overall bad experience working here..
bad,The way they did things was wrong . I don’t have any more to say . I worked there for 14years and I liked the new process by the way it’s done was sad .
bad,"they dont care about their employees, rather lose a employee no matter how good they are then work with when life situations happen. some manager abused their powers"
bad,Poor management turning good employees into uncaring people too clicky only friends of management get approved work hours  or get approved hours when not scheduled
bad,They tell you that you can advance your career but it doesn't happen. Even when you passed the management assessment and keep asking them. They tell you to do something one day and the next day you get in trouble for doing what was okay the day before.
bad,I did not enjoy working there. The management were uncaring and sometimes unfriendly.If times were busy you never knew what time you were getting off no matter what plans you had.
bad,Was a great place to work for and then progressively got worse. Management barely had experience or education of any sort. Not a very professional environment whatsoever.
bad,"The staff at Walmart are overworked and underpaid. At one point a staff member had to beg an assistant manager multiple times to be allowed to go home because they were feeling ill. Management is very hard to reach which is crazy consider how many are usually in the store. By the time you finally reach a management and tell them you need help or to converse with them, they blow you off. The store, 4358, is so highly understaffed, it's completely ridiculous the extra amount of work they throw onto current staff members. For example, I was working apparel. We usually had to people working night shift to clean, fold, and fix clothes in boys, girls, men's and ladies wear all while also operating the fitting rooms, sorting and hanging clothes there, and answer and directing calls. Given that my store was a superstore thats a lot of work for only 2 people and all jobs would rarely get done and we'd still be held accountable for it. Until Walmart shapes up their management and their lack of staff, and fix their 5 point over a course of 6 months system, their turnover rate will forever be high and they will constantly lose good hardworking workers."
bad,They just want you to move fast and don’t care about the health or treatment of their emoloyees the back room of their store was in air conditioned and they rarely let you take water breaks
bad,There were times it was fun but overall it was very stressful and management was always on your back about doing things you weren't even trained to do. On top of getting injured they find ways to make it your fault when i got sick with cancer i was trying to keep my job but they let me go because they wouldn't work with a part time schedule.
bad,"Customers are rude and weird. Cashiering is repetitive, no advancement for your job, hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers because usually their angry. Lots of corporate policies, Management was VERY poor. Managers are usually not very helpful either and are always talking to each other, and yell at you for something silly and then usually do the same thing. Stressful, and not worth it."
bad,"-Management is awful and unorganized throughout the whole store. They spend just enough time walking around the store to be seen, then are in their locked office until it’s time to go home."
bad,Walmart have lack of managements but also theirs few of employees. Management doesn’t take their roles of being one at all they need more training to become one
bad,"Working loss prevention it is good pay and insurance but you have to work every holiday they're not paid off. They take your accumulated PTO if you have it and pay you extra for holiday while you work it.... Yes it is kinda double pay for the day but still I'd like Thanksgiving new years sometimes with my family. Main bummer I work 12 to 9pm most days, no work life balance and you have to be careful they will take up for shoplifter or customers over there employees."
bad,"Underemployed, you do a job that would take 3 people to do by yourself and expect to finish it, pto and vacation time got changed to company’s favor so we get less vacation and sick time, management is way to strict."
bad,Management is the worst. Everybody friends or sleeping together. This place is so unprofessional and the favoritism is ridiculous. This is a job for teenagers or for people who want to be part of a clique. The front end manager is lazy and just talks about people all day. Run far far away from this place.
bad,Management is self serving w unobtainable goals and unrealistic expectations due to a direct result in poor staffing with too little hours to get any job done 100%
bad,"The only reason people last at a job like this is because they have families or lives that depend on it entirely, not a lot of jobs around here pay as much but its for good reason, the work is extremely physical and taxes your body every day and the managers don’t know how to treat other people."
bad,Worked all the time still wouldn't let me be full time.  If you ask time off you looked at bad . They never do anything to help you . You are to help them .
bad,Wouldn’t work there again unless I really had too very stressful and demanding raises were poor and work wasn’t appreciated the way it should’ve been managers were ok
bad,Working at Walmart isnt bad when it comes to getting some money but definitely not a good place to rely on for long term career goals unless higher up in the chain of command.
bad,"If you get this job its decent pay but very stressful, it's also not really worth money sometimes because of the work environment and management. To work here also means you're willing to put up to people that have little to no common sense."
bad,"When I started working there It was truly an awesome place to work. a year later they started taking the benefits away. Now the new hires are paid better than the people who have been there a while. It is a good place to start in the workforce but it is not easy to advance in pay. Unless you become a member of management and agree to be shuffled around locations it is very hard to build a stable career here."
bad,I loved serving the customers but the management always found a way to make my job harder than it actually had to be. It seemed as if no matter how hard I worked personally it was never enough for them.
bad,"Ok job decent pay good schedule. A very safe working environment honest people . Good company to start and build a working culture and work ethic . "
bad,If you believe in modern-day slavery do not work here I repeat if you believe in modern day slavery do not work here the dry side Isles or narrow there's a mountains of toilet paper and paper towels on the floor that you either have to kick to the side or completely move that you can navigate safely through the aisles cold side is cold not too bad if you're moving but you have to stay at a ridiculous Pace to maintain productivity and to get paid incentives you had to move even faster this job completely blows oh and forget about the freezer has. Even. (He.L.L)has really frozen over in Walmart freezer I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy if you believe in modern day slavery do not work here
bad,"I was one of the ""lucky"" brave souls to push carts. In my interview, I was promised water and unlimited breaks during harsh conditions and stressful situations, etc. Also recently finding out that I was hypoglycemic, I was granted an extra 5-10 minute break on top of my 15 min break or 1 lunch. But my management was very uncomphrendable and ""forget""of what they had promised.  Not even to mention how they'd gladly recognize employees for the dumbest of things such as fixing at mat that was crooked or wearing their badge. Meanwhile I'm sweating my a** off bringing wheelchairs to older people that are almost unconscious and awaiting an ambulance and I get no recognition whatsoever. There's days I'd skip my last break as a closer to ensure that every cart was put up so overnight didn't have to work even harder. And that would most of the time be me, myself, and I, alone in one of the biggest Walmart parking lots  in my district. Over time work just became unbearable, I became depressed, lost over 40lbs, (I promise oml) and just became careless about everything I loved before. I lost friends and missed family events because of lack of schedule flexibility. Went through lots of tragedies without sympathy or leverage. Management talks to you like you're fresh off the short bus and degrades you even when you're trying your best alone. The pay was amazing but definitely not worth the abuse. Even being the most helpful, polite, down to earth person that you can be, it will never be what they're looking for, they're more wrapped up in getting to know the other new mangers better than their"
bad,"Honestly, if it wasn't for such bad management it would probably be a good place to work at. The coworkers are awesome. But again, management doesn't actually care about its associates. It claims it does and ""it's listening,""  but this is not the case. "
bad,"I began working there in 2010 and we had a Manager at that time who would bend over backwards for his employees and really went out of his way to ensure we were treated fairly and felt respected. 3 big things changed for the worse: 1. that Manager left to go work for another company and his replacement was someone who had no business in that role. 2. the overall culture and dynamic of the corporate leadership changed, the emphasis shifted to profit instead of customers and employees. 3. we changed to a warehouse that was closer to our location but was small and could not handle our orders. Pallets were never organized as they were supposed to be which essentially doubled our task times, along with damaged products (heavy things on top of light things, etc) and there was no effort whatsoever from any of the managers or supervisors to fix the situation. The problem with Walmart is that the local managers are given no control over their own stores, everything comes from the top down with no regard to store-level concerns, staffing, management, etc. Moreover I missed out on numerous pay raises because I had worked there for a long time. I was there 7.5 years and making just pennies more than brand new people with no experience. The problem is that nobody gets the company wide raises unless they are new enough and make below a certain wage already. Those who have been there for years are often left out. The only way to ever move up with pay raises is to quit and come back and hope you get in with the ""new crowd."" Outside of the amazing benefits package, I really have nothing good"
bad,"Working there wasn't so bad, co workers were fun and knowledgeable. However, management lied to me. I was in college, and went to the manager and explained my situation, told him the days and hours i was available, he said he understood, college was important, just to change my availability and he would approve it. I got back the request, and he had denied it. I then went to him and he said he just couldn't do that."
bad,"work styles are easy enough and the work was physical but being a young man that is in good physical conditions it was all fine however it seemed like everyday management had something new they wanted to complain about and yet they would yell at us and never help fix anything because there was nothing to fix they just wanted to look better, and the assistant manager in charge of the scheduling couldn't accurately schedule to save her life and had many times where lunches and breaks overlapped and left us in trouble"
bad,"A lot of nice people ro work with but Management and HR is a joke! Safety blah blah blah!, favoritism..you name it they got it! Just dont trust anyone specially HR."
bad,If you like favoritism and see ppl advance in career even though you been longer w/ them then this is the warehouse for you (Chino 8103). You still get a check though.
bad,"I worked as a cashier for a few months and I literally taught myself the entire system and everything by being tossed on a register for a week. The training process is extremely mind numbing as its just hours spent at a computer that's thousands of years old skipping questions and glossing over information then being hurled onto a register. This is mostly because the managers had absolutely no clue who was new and who wasn't, which speaks to their organizational skills."
bad,"Very unprofessional, wouldn’t suggest anyone work at Walmart distribution 6023! No lunch breaks no equipment, lack of management because they have fired all of them . No respect to associates!"
bad,"A typical day at Walmart was me going in and doing my job."
bad,"Day starts with department walk-thru. Issues are noted and a schedule to address these issues is outlined. "
bad,It use to be a great place to work...but over the last 17 years it has went down hill. You never know if you will have your 40 hours or not they have taken full time associates down to 7 hours some have no hours. Its not like the customer flow has slowed down its just what they think they should be making. If you talk union you get fired for some trumped up reason.They want less people to also do the work that the people we lost was doing on top of our jobs..then coach you for not getting it done on time.
bad,"While there is always more to a story and I did have enough occurrences to be let go I feel that my final day proves that Walmart placed zero value in me. Unaware it was memorial day I went to the bus stop at 5 am to start my shift. a while passed and I determined that I had to walk, so with no way to communicate I began walking to work. Yes, I was late but I did arrive 3 hours later. I was asked to perform for the day then at the end of my shift my manager came to me and said that because I didn't call to let them know it proved that I did not care for my job and I was fired, after walking 3 hours to work and working over my shift to finish the tasks at hand."
bad,Walmart became all about money and doesn't care for employees like they should. Being on cap 2 is stressful. Pay is good but to many managers and alot of ppl that just don't wanna work.
bad,Walmart is a good place for student..as a part time job..they do work with u.yet to get up to another position is like u need to know any of manager in a personal way to climb the ladder to a high position..
bad,I've never felt less valued or respected anywhere as I was at Walmart. Pure misery! The day I left I was absolutely beyond relieved. Not worth the rise in blood pressure. Luckily some of my friends coworkers made work somewhat bearable.
bad,Loved working at the small neighborhood market but the Supercenter sucked  . It doesn’t matter if your a hard worker if your not a butt kisser . I’m not ok with breaking laws just so that a customer won’t complain
bad,The only tip I have for Walmart is that they need to treat their employees with more respect. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers and the customers.
bad,"I started as a  basic hourly associate and worked my way up to be the dept manager of e commerce.  They are always changing policy and have no compassion for their associates.  My son was born prematurely due to my over  Exertion at work, and i was expected to return to work as soon as 6 weeks was up, reguardless of the fact he was still in the nicu on life support.  While trying to juggle my sick child and going back to work full time, i was told by management i could loose my job if i took a second leave to be with my child once he came home. I took it anyways as family was more important. . I was then pushed out of that store soon after,. They claimed it was corporates decision to get rid of my job title and i would have to step down and take a huge pay cut. I relocated to a closer store since i would be making less money and while i was training on the service desk, a position i wasnt familiar with, i supposedly made a mistake and was scammed out of money. I was terminated on the spot. When i asked to be shown proof of my mistake, i was told i wasnt allowed to see the proof.  That only sallary could see it. I spent 3 years to get to where i was in the company.  I valued my job and they didnt bother to give so much as a warning or better training, they terminated me with out the slightest care. When i asked to speak about my treatment with the store manager.  Hes continuously unavailable."
bad,"PTO hours stink, no vacation, sick personal time. Constant mandatory overtime. Work all holidays with no holiday pay. Benefits are costly and stink, high out of pocket costs. Management is lazy and arrogant."
bad,"This is a sorry place to work, they hold you accountable for production even when there is not moves in the Q and none of the yard drivers are able to get production, they also make you work mandatory over time even if you have trips plan with family they don't care and management was no clue what they are doing and the turnover rate is out of the roof due to management not treating employees fair and with respect"
bad,This company now takes more pride in their figures than their people. They care very little that their employees have a home life. They strive for excellence by exploiting their workers.
bad,"As I have stated it is a job, it will get the bills paid if you need it to. But the problem is that now if your availabilty isnt what they want it to be you will not get hours to make your paycheck"
bad,When your working it’s busy fast paced! Hot working environment! Never know how many hours a day your working until you get to work and see how much work is there. Your pay check is always different! Never consecutive! You may work 25 hours one week then 40 the next then 50 the next! Pay per hour is ok but rarely you’d get a 40 hour pay check. Get sent home early frequently for not having enough work! Have to use vacation time to make up 40 hours to get a decent check!
bad,I was an order filler if u can't make rate they will fire you.if u make any mistakes they will fire you.the picks are crazy they want you to stack pallets up to 6 feet high they are not organized.They will have you stack 60 pound boxes of juice on top of dry goods that weigh nothing.then get mad when the pallets falls over
bad,"poor management, lack of respect for associates, only pro to working at walmart is pay. short and infrequent breaks with no flexibility to schedules ..."
bad,"I had family responsibilities. I would give over a weeks notice as to what days I would need off, and management refused to work with me to allow me the days off. Because they work on a point system, I was laid off."
bad,The work wasnt bad the workers most of us were family.The assistant managers were the problem the store and still is. Yes it was stressful but I loved my job cause I was good at it.
bad,The Cairo Walmart is not a good place to build a career. I have been there 7 months and there is always something going on. Everyone there has the on clique as if we were in high school.
bad,"The store was dirty, unorganized and employees were treated like suspects. I worked midnights and the environment became too dangerous. The store closes at midnight now. Customers would enter the store clearly under the influence. Rudeness and theft were common in the middle of the night. Homeless people would sleep on the benches inside the store. Customers falling out in the parking lot became a regular occurrence."
bad,Even with only 4 or so months working at Walmart I found that the management was lacking having favorites and disliking those that needed them while they where catching up with their friends. Then the ones that were not talking to each other where allowed to slack off creating messes and not cleaning up while also doing as little as possible.
bad,When i started at walmart I loved it until we all became 1 fresh department. when we became fresh cap there was more work to do within a little bit of time and very little help even from the managers.
bad,"While working there, I pulled my back several times. They overfill pallets on every truck. The pallets are already breaking so it becomes even harder to use a manual jack. Management pulled you off of live freight constantly and they leave departments with no associates for more than half the day. The back rooms are constantly unorganized and dirty. Whenever you need to talk to management, they are never to be seen. It was hard to get anything done because someone always needed to pull you off of what you were working on to move you to make them look better. They don't work with you for attendance. If you get sick easily, they will terminate you without even talking to you. If you have ideas or anything that isn't the same as management, they will find the smallest things to yell at you for and give you points. The management is the issue at this Walmart. Also, they keep the employees that don't work and fire the ones that actually do their stuff. They also never talked about benefits to those who receive them."
bad,"Walmart, as a place to work has gone significantly down hill in the last few years. Hours that used to be flexible and plentiful are now random and hard to come by. One is given the choice between either getting enough hours or working the hours you want/need, never both, often neither. Support wise, I often find my self working with what feels like a skeleton crew. Task that were once easy, are now stressful due to lack of coverage. Management constantly seem more interested in keeping their own superiors happy then helping those below them succeed. Even if they do help, they can't do much because of how inflexible the company policies are nowadays. Creativity, once encouraged, is now highly frowned upon. Ideas that do not work are constantly thrust upon us because someone up the command chain thinks its a good idea without getting feedback first."
bad,"I worked there for two years the management sucks and they play favoritism. "
bad,They expect way to much for easy to little they put anyone that wants manager as a manager not because they are qualified just because they lau have been the a long time.
bad,You usually get a set schedule. The work environment is toxic. Management is lacking. They mislead you in orientation. Personnel is disrespectful. I’ve worked at two different locations and it’s been the same. Very toxic and very childish
bad,"Constantly being told conflicting rules every day, Poor management. You get so many projects assigned to you and no time to complete them. punished if you accidentally go into overtime."
bad,"I worked here for almost 5 years and was never promoted past over-night support manager. The company seems to only promote you to upper management if you either, have a college degree or you are friends with someone on the management team.  I have taken the assistant management testing that was available and have past it several times, but was never offered any advancement opportunities with the company in the 5 years i worked there, I unfortunately had to resign and seek other employment. I started at $11 per hour when I left I was only at $11.85 per hour after almost 5 years."
bad,I worked at wal mart for 3 years an was paid horrible an threatened to loose my job if I did not conform to there schedule. Knowing and agreeing when hired why I need to work the hours of 6am or earlier to 4pm no later. Only to be lied to an bullied. But the paper work I assure u dose reflect.
bad,"Walmart provides good pay though management is rude and no compassion for their workers."
bad,"Not a bad job but the managers' is not supportive of the employee's at all workplace is not bad, the hardest part of the job is non support from the staff. I like with with the other employees'"
bad,"Dont get me wrong, the company is a good company to work for, they offer benefits and 401k, the training is there if you become a Department Manager, you will meet workers that has been there for more than 10years. Management changes from time to time. It depends on if the Store Manager gets promoted or get fired. ASM's changes since they can transfer to other locations or get promoted too. Currently our SM isnt really the supportive one, not even motivating, so some workers are leaving the store. Even the ones who has been working there for so long. The pay when I started back in 2009 was $9 and you get raises annualy and then that's only if you get a good evaluation. Promotion depends on who you know than how you work. And then when you do get promoted, it depends on your ASM, if you get lucky and have a good one, they'll always help you out but if you get to have the new ones, you'll have to train them as well. What you learn in training is too good to be true, its hard to actually execute them when not everyone really knows their roles and responsibilities so instead of setting the whole store to success, its always on the down low BUT this review is based on the store where I work at in Fremont. Been working in and out there for almost 9 years and its been a year of worst scenarios. Each stores run differently and some are lucky to have a management team who are really doing their jobs."
bad,"I did a lot for this company over the years, as many others do. I worked to a management position, helped them until they could comfortably accommodate another, so I could go to college."
bad,"processing ,stocking ,labeling ,customer service ,cashiering . etc"
bad,"understaffed, unethical, no benefits walmart is place where kids should work while trying to figure life out. not a career unless you are on salary no benefits and bad schedule"
bad,"Boring.... Most of the time............"
bad,I just wont to work their its a great place to work I love the people that works their. Always a pleasure to assist people by helping them locate things they can't find. I also enjoyed working dairy by myself and getting things done. Graet place to work.
bad,"A typical day at walmart was me pushing a floor scrubber around the store for almost the entire shift, usually with a partner. Having a partner would have been nice if we could have chatted throughout the shift, but the scrubbing machines were to loud to talk over. Other nights were spent throwing all the cardboard from the overnight stalkers into the baler in the backroom. Having a partner for this would have been nice, but walmart will only have one person doing this task a night, which usually results in the rest of the maintenance crew scrambling to help them finish cardboard collection after every other task is complete. My manager was a very nice guy, but most of the others in my department were usually rude, and overall unlikable people. Nobody ever looked happy to me working there, and I could never recommend the job to anyone looking for workplace satisfaction, unless you were in management there, preferably a shift leader or general manager. The job is monotonous as can be, and I felt at all times expendable."
bad,"I absolutely loved working in the deli. I know almost every in and out of the place. I would continue to work here if not for the management. They didn’t give any of us the respect or thanks that we deserved. I’m not saying we acted privlidged, far from that. I would just prefer to not have a manager to talk to customers in front of us about how bad we do our jobs because of things we are not responsible for. Or just a simple, genuine thanks for us doing our job exceptionally. There were days when we only had two people to do a three or four person job, and still got berated for not being productive enough. It is such a shame that such a great company with such great benefits has such horrible management. I do hope it is only this Walmart."
bad,no words can describe my experience i learned a lot from people working with me but i do not recommend anyone trying to advance to work there base on my experience
bad,I would not recommend this company anymore. They beat down the employee instead of recognizing them. When I started it was one big family. Now everyone is out for themselves.
bad,"I wouldn't shop there anymore,just because of how poorly I was treated while working there. Amazon is the way to go. I wouldn't stop anyone else from working there because maybe they'll have,a different ending result."
bad,"Do not recommend. Dead end job management is horrible, you never see your family. The hour are bad. No one supports you or your decisions.  Management does not back you up for anything"
bad,I'm not trying to steer anyone away from here but if you have other option for employment its best to weigh those as potential employers first from my initial start date up until now the moral this place used to be run by was thrown out the window long ago.
bad,"I work hard every nite into the morning doing lots of different things. I unload meat & produce truck to zoning, getting grocery carts.Help customers find items they are looking for."
bad,"Walmart does not give merit increases, their paid time off scheme is bad. Management is always hovering over you, you always feel restricted. the Job culture is depressing."
bad,I hate it becuse the people i worked with. I did not like the job at all. The manager are always picking the people that work there longer over the newbies.
bad,A typical day at work is stressful want you to do everything in a day on top of helping the other associate do there work. Its set up to fail that's why so many of us stepped down from manager position in stead of going up in company we going down. Management has there favorites and if you not one of them you are nothing to that store. At one time I wanted to become an asst manager but as of today I don't see myself working for this company at all and use to enjoy working all the time.
bad,Every day you get a different shift. Every week you don't know when your days off are. Your life revolves around Walmart. You live to work not work to live. The customers are terrible and treat you like you're sub-human. Not an enjoyable experience at all.
bad,Walmart is a very stressful work place that nobody should ever work at. Management yells at you all the time even in front of customers. Management calls you when you're sick and threatens to fire you. Walmart is not a good experience.
bad,"Its honestly a horrible place to work, you’re treated like garbage and everyone just does what they want as far as management goes, The CSM’s do as they please and hate doing actual work."
bad,"a typical day for me was putting up  with disrespectful associate while management looked away"
bad,"At Walmart, I had to train my self how to do things. My pay was okay and the discount card was nice, but the managers had no clue what they were doing what so ever. They refused to tech me how to write an incident report when I needed to. every month they made a new rule that made everyone's job harder. I was forced to move thing that should have been moved by machinery. There is never enough staff for you to do your job so your contently getting yelled at for doing your job the best you can. All in all I would never recommend working at Walmart to anyone."
bad,"Being employed at walmart in and of itself was ok. The attitudes of management however was a turn off. Management would talk to you any kind of way. Further if you talked back to them, you would be subject to either being written up or being sent home. I'm in my mid sixties and to be spoken to disrespectfully by someone old enough to be my granddaughter was a bit much. But I did not quit!"
bad,"Not the best place to work at. Treated like children but also like you dont matter. No set hours you come when they want you there and that is it. Wants you there even in bad weather, People wrecked trying to come to work and were still fired for not being there."
bad,In my opinion walmart isn't the best company to work for. Their management team is very unprofessional and they expect you to have open availability all the time. They expect you to be open to not getting off on time or to clock in early when you barely have time before you even clock in to begin with. They aren't a very good company to work for.
bad,Management is absolutely horrible everyone thinks they run the place. Would never recommend anyone work here you would want to quit within the first three months.
bad,"When I worked for Wal Mart as a Assistant Store Manager the hours were insane. 10 hour shifts, every 6 th weekend off.  I never left in 10 hours usually 12 plus hours. Paid salary, never received more money for all the OT I did put in."
bad,Working at walmart is stressful because the company does not hire enough people to keep up with the large workload. You work hard to not be respected.
bad,"Good for first job. Walmart tends to make it difficult to advance in life. Many people have been there for years and still only make $15 per hour...I spoke with one today.  I enjoy were I work,  the pharmacy is not really part of the rest of the store. It's time for me to move on..."
bad,"I started working at Walmart in April 2007 and left Walmart in April 2008 when I was 5 months pregnant. I started of as a cashier and I wanted to advance to a CSS/CSM. They would not let me, yet they always asked me to work extra hours. After I found out they would not advance me I stopped going over and beyond for them and just did my own thing. I eventually did the volunteer termination because the thought of going to Walmart made my morning sickness even worse."
bad,do not work for or transfer to store 697 you will regret it the management only gives hours to people they know the store is usually trashy cause of the area its located it
bad,"I mean, it's a great started job, I worked there for 3 years, never called in, and always asked for more , but i never moved up, always making less than the newer employers."
bad,"What I mean is the shift I work with is great, people I work with great my managers great, but when you look at the other shifts we do over double the work with half the people and their managers can tell us what to do but our managers can't tell them anything. Back up further and look at the store as a whole and you see more issues, so much in fighting, huge lack of communication, lack of direction and consistency. Then look at it as a corporation and it becomes soul crushing. Corporate does not care about it's people constantly a wolf in sheep's clothing telling how much better they are making things while sneaking benefits away to lower their costs. Corporate wastes money by the millions because it's out of touch with the teaching of Sam Walden it's customers, employees and reality. Instead of leading the market like it should be Walmart is following the same mistakes as so many other companies."
bad,"Hours are inconsistent. Benefits aren't quite enough. Discount is on merchandise only, not food. Benefits aren't received until 3 and 6 months into the job."
bad,"The Walmart I work for is Not well managed at all. I say this for a number of reasons"
bad,They could do better with allot of things. It was very unorganized with supplies and workers. The managers could be less self centered and more for there workers than against
bad,It's a good job over all. It's quick and fast paced. Most of the managers and staff care about their work environment. It's a bit frustrating at times but over all it's a decent job.
bad,"walmart as a whole wasn't terrible, just a couple of my immediate support members. They constantly made horrible comments about how I'd ""show up late"" even though I was doing returns, helping customers, and even doing price changes. I was honestly constantly on edge because of 2 people that 1) never did their job properly and 2)Had no room to try  to talk down on me when another associate and  I basically held that department up."
bad,Rumors of getting rid of third shift have everyone on edge they are very unwilling to change your day off they tell you you can’t have certain days off and then give new hires the days you asked for
bad,It was o.k. The training was not very good. the people seemed to be friendly. the managers seemed to be friendly. when it was time for your lunch or break you had to wait for someone to come relieve you which could take up to a half hour.
bad,The people make this company but they know how to tear you down took holiday pay away your schedule can never match your personal life they make you work mandatory overtime and then cut your hours doing schedule days of work. Poor management skills most dont know how to perform the job they're ahead of
bad,"I was working 70-80 hours a week for a miserable store manager. 5-6 week orientation doesn’t prepare you at all, but the SM expects you to know everything as an external. Mine threatened my job constantly and yelled at me over the littlest things, even though I was working 6 days a week to make sure everything got done correctly. Do not work here if you want a life. The money was what roped me in and it was not worth it at all."
bad,never enough help. A really big lack of communication on the management part. expectations high but no real idea on how to reach the goal. moral very low
bad,Be ready to stack 2 6-7 ft high pallets full of products in less  than 30 min. Nearly impossible. Too crouded. You are timed for each pallet you do!  and if you don’t achieve their standards you will automatically get a write up. After 3 write  ups  they will fire you. RUN away from this. I know a lot of people who missed up their back from this job. It’s not worth it.
bad,They raised the pay but lowered hours to a minimum. Instead of giving more hours they hire more employees because people keep quitting. No full time unless you’re on overnights or truck shift
bad,"Hours differed every week, managers slow to help you if helped at all, only a 10% discount, couldn’t work many hours due to being a minor at the time, managers didn’t seem to care about employees."
bad,Walmarts management sucks. They dont care about their employees. They care about themself and hardly do anything. They make other do what they should be doing.
bad,"enjoy serving customers,"
bad,"I didn’t get many hours. For awhile I was only working 8 hours a week, & even for a small family that isn’t much to live off of. Management team, isn’t much of a team. Overall even though you make a good amount of money when working the correct amount of hours, it’s not a very good place to work."
bad,"For example, I work at the service and money center, so working their advises me to communicate and do exchanges, returns, sending money, receivements, check cashing and etc. Some customers that come to the service desk are thieves, yes I know we don’t suppose to judge but we we’re taught to use our own judgement, so I turn some customers down that I have my suspicions of. But what do the customers do, call management or corporate and management gets on to us and most definitely don’t have our back in the situation they taught us to be our own judge."
bad,"I've never worked for a more greedy and ungrateful company than Walmart.  The salary from the outside world looks so appealing until they force you to work 70+ hours a week with no holidays off and the only bonuses come if the total store makes it's sales for the year.  The market and regional level do not care about a work/life balance and will find any reason to write you up and fire you from the management position if you don't give into working their insane amount of hours.  Even if you do they still pass over you for promotions, knowing that they wouldn't be able to find another person to put into your position to work those hours.  And never have the words ""Thank You"" come from any higher up managers.  The company prides itself off hiring from within and retaining its' associates yet will continuously post job opening on only external sites and not even post them for internal candidates to apply for.  You spend 12+ hours every day getting yelled at by bosses and customers only for nothing to be good enough.  Their Human Resources are a joke.  If you try to speak with them about concerns you get told that they don't have time to chat with you and have more pressing matters.  I always heard people express their hatred for this company but never understood it until I worked there."
bad,"Typical retail job."
bad,Not a great place to work anymore. Upper management will write you up for anything and everything. They treat you like a number and not a human being.
bad,"All I'm gonna say is They did me a huge favor, Attendance Policy is absolutely rediculous after Probationary Period! I have more Knowledge and Talent then to work for a Company like this! Very Poorly Mismanaged, They Hire more Assistant store managers and Fire more competent hard workers, Makes alot of Sense Idiots! Thankfully I'm on to bigger and better things! Oh and their Security is a joke to like u cant tell shes Security walking around wearing the same thing every day in the same location! Lmfao"
bad,My time here has taught me how to deal with people of every shape and size. My customer service skills have absolutely improved since working here. Everyone would benefit from working here
bad,Walmart does not cater to a hard working employee. Your work ethic means nothing to management. They choose to follow favoritism rather than offer opportunities to employees who actually know their job and how to manage a company.
bad,"The work hours at Wal Mart are never the same so you can not plan anything with your family, One week you might be off Tuesday and Thursday and the next week Monday and Wednesday, You will hardly ever be off on a weekend until you have been there a few years. When it can time to take a vacation day or days they had to approve it first but most of the time they would not approve a vacation on the weekend or one that ran into the weekend. It might not look like a lot of work but if you are a stocker you are on the move from the time you clock in until you clock out, A lot of the items you have to lift are heavy, 50 to 100 lbs, and you must work fast to get the items stocked within your shift. The pay for this work is not enough to live on unless you have a spouse with a good paying job, you live with your parents or you are semi retired.  It would be a good place for students still living at home or in a dorm to work but other than that it will not provide you with enough to pay the bills."
bad,Management is very unprofessional and does not communicate effectively.   Hard work and dedication was not appreciated.  Co workers did work as a team however management was very poor.
bad,Learn to write absolutely everything down no matter how insignificat because you WILL at some point be targeted by a hostile manager or managers and you’ll need to protect yourself and your interests.
bad,"I would not recommend working here at all for anybody. When someone feels uncomfortable like an employee, the managers should care...THEY DON'T! I was so scared to walk out to my vehicle one night and they told me that I would be fine right after I had someone threaten me because of something stupid that happened at the registers."
bad,Great store to work with associates and you will keep busy for sure. Also the pay and benefits are all right for an entry level job. It is a job though not a career. Management is a total joke. It is a circus at best and a fight for a power. Managers will tel you  we are a family until you do your job as an LP which is not what they usually like abd then you will see the other face. Best way to keep your job is to please them and forget about your duties and integrity. But dont expect to last long and if you can stay away from walmart. Worst work culture.
bad,staff meetings. Then to department managers meeting to set goals for the day. Work with associates keep up beat.Working with so many people was very challenging but also rewarding
bad,Walmart does not have your back. The allmighty dollar is more important to them than their employees are. Will not stand behind you when you are wronged.
bad,If you are thinking of working here don't. The absolute biggest problem in the entire company is management. Way to many managers on duty with very unreal expectations. The only upside is free food every now and then.
bad,Wal-Mart pay workers low amounts of money that doesn't match the type of work you are expected to get done.  Moving up in the company does only provides a small pay increase and more mistreatment from management.
bad,Other than the pay is decent and you can get plenty of overtime I would not recommend working for shifty management and out of touch district  management who don't know the everyday store Operations
bad,"Always understaffed, never enough registers open. Literally one time everyone went to the break room to celebrate a birthday or something while I was the only register open. They also didnt schedule me within my availability"
bad,"I loved my job, simply because of the closeness of the coworkers. "
bad,You have to kiss butt to get any where working has nothing to do with it. Cashiers I am over are amazing. Two coworkers that stay with management to get what they want.
bad,"the company is micromanaged from the home office, the managers and assistants have no real authority to manage or discipline, hire or fire. they hire anyone who walks in the door, and it seems the lazy and incompetent are preferred."
bad,"a typical day at work would start off by checking out customers and helping out in other areas of the store "
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked for in my life. The management is lazy. Extremely unhelpful. They make up their own rules and go against the rules. People constantly quit because how they’re treated. I’d never suggest this place and if you do get a position look for another job
bad,They treat everyone as if they are disposable and the work conditions are not safe. I also had a work comp claim that they refuse to pay for even though it happened in front of a camera and they write you up or coach you for nothing all the time.
bad,"It's ok for a get you by job, unless your in management. They don't want to hardly ever give full-time employees 40 hours a week. They cut hours alot during the year. They have too many managers over you."
bad,There is no structure to the Baseline Walmart everyone is only there to collect a check. No one cares about people putting in extra work they randomly choose people to recognized not recognizing people based on performance. Walmart only want people to do work that most of the time has nothing to do with the job they were actually hired for.
bad,I feel like the only way to advance at walmart is if you become friends with other management. There were a lot of managers that were not qualified to be in the position they were in. I know there is a test you have to pass to become a manager but you have other managers standing behind you giving you the answers. Management at walmart is not fair.
bad,good things about the job was some employees were really cool and understanding. on the other there was wayyy too much lack of communication verbal attacks on some employees and dealt with very rude customers.
bad,"not what i expected .not a good company to work for right now. They don't treat employees fairly. Very bad management. High turn over, always people start and quit but then also fired for dumb reason that are unfair."
bad,The management doesn't know how to work with people and the atmosphere is toxic. The working hours are inconsistent and cant change at a moments notice without any notification to you.
bad,"I feel like I am surrounded by negative energy everyday. If it isn't the customers yelling at me it's the managers. I am treated very poorly. Even when I try my hardest to keep up, there always seems to be something wrong and I get the blame. The work isn't hard, but having to stand there while customers yell at you for circumstances out of your control can get to you. Every break is scheduled and I always seem to get sent early, even if they don't need me to. I even got sent to break 30 minutes after my lunch one day."
bad,One time Walmart was a A fun happy place to workAre used to like going in the Walmart to work with him and Walmart started changing you can’t have fun can’t be happy at all has to be serious you got to have a little bit a phone and she humoring her job it makes the time go
bad,"When I worked at walmart it started all right. I enjoyed the work itself and the pay was not to bad. I didn't like the night shift but thought that I may move out of it one day. But the managers are what got me, every time I got used to the instructions they had given me a week or two before they changed them, usually without telling me until I was in their office receiving a stern talking to."
bad,"Walmart is a okay place to work,but they do not care for others feeling and almost never understand a persons situation or hard working ethic. The management staff tend to think about their needs before their workers. I believe that the only good factor is that they do teach you alot, so that you can help them get to where they need to be."
bad,"I worked as a cashier at Walmart for about a year while in college, and it was honestly one of the worst jobs I've ever had.  I was constantly scheduled outside of my availability, making it difficult to maintain my grades while working.  Customers were incredibly rude and treated workers with little to no respect, regardless of what their issues were.  I would not recommend working for this company to anyone."
bad,"The position I held at wal mart was overnight fresh associate, it was a simple job that became complex and untenable by obstinate and dishonest support managers that on their own could not give you an honest answer about scheduling, changes in work requirements, or even dress code changes. They fail to communicate basic tasks, enforce rules equitably, or even take down basic information required for changing workplace requirements. The culture is relaxed, other associates are always friendly and helpful."
bad,I can’t wait to start a new career and not look back. They have good benefits. I have never had emotional trouble as I do working here. You get great pay but it is not worth my mental health going in a negative direction.
bad,This is only for a summer job. I am not thinking of working this as a career. Management and hours are the worst. Most cashiers are rude. I had one yell at me even though she is not part of management telling me that i shouldn't leave even though I am done with my hours. They can take advantage of you if you are new.
bad,On an average workday i will come in at 7 or 2. I will do the work of approximately two people in my own department while cover several hours. I am completely stretched thin while working freight and doing costumer service.
bad,typical day of work is just like any other retail work place.  but the management there is something else.  open door policy is not a priority to them for some reason.  fellow employees there are nice and easy going.
bad,"Workers are treated close to slaves. There has been times when employees were threatened disciplinary actions for not falsifying worked hours, when working overtime. Being forced to work overtime hours, and only getting paid for set hours. I have seen the store and employees be set up for failure and audits more times than i should have."
bad,"There are advancement opportunities and benefits, but you are at the mercy of Home Office scheduling.  The training is lacking and the management is sub-par, at best."
bad,I love the people I work with and the job is very fun the customers are very friendly i just dont get the hours I need my fellow employees said they don't give a lot of people full time cause the benefits are expensive but I enjoy cashiering and zoning I've learned a lot since I started
bad,Job was incredibly boring and not fulfilling. Everyday was exactly the same. Managers were not willing to work with me to set a schedule that allowed for a second job.
bad,I was asked to work overtime often. I was part-time working 39 hours a week with no benefits. I had to quit since I was also part time in college and my shift manager would continuously schedule me to work during my class hours. This was done even after turning in my class schedule 3 times to have my hours fixed.
bad,Hr team is horrible. Not helpful at all. So happy I was able to get a job where the management actually cares  about their staff. I would not recommend working there
bad,I was very disappointed in this company.  I worked for awhile for them and then my daughter died and I had to relocate fo Florida from PA and when I got here they had no job for me.  I sold my home to move to florida and my company in PA did all the paperwork for me to relocate and once I got here they had no job for me at all!  Got to love it...
bad,Terrible salary management and removing my position as grocery support manager. Upper management is slow paced and not as efficient as supervisors or hourly management. Have high demands and are very hypocritical.
bad,"management does not communicate, they are cut thought, have no common sense, and do not care about there employees. other then that there is no sense of help there"
bad,I worked for the ecommerce in Carrollton Ga.  Where they could care less about the associates and families .  Ithey change the rules daily  . And bend the rules for certain people.
bad,I loved the people I worked with and my job. However management was not organized and i received ninfirm if training with my new promotion. Everyone deserves proper training for each new position given.
bad,With all the new changes they have been making you are lucky if you are running less then a quarter of the store by your self or maybe with 1 other person. They don't like to listen to their employees and treat most of them much disrespect.
bad,"They expect you to be available from 4AM - 12AM on a rotating schedule. They don't care about family, school, or other obligations. You are a number that no matter how many years of service you give them is not appreciated. I was a 9 year employee of 4 different stores. The local management can and do destroy the moral in the stores. They offer many benefits but you pay absorbent rates for them if you qualify. I dreaded going to work every day for the last 4 years or so."
bad,"Ideally, a night on Third Shift was learning what to work on and being sent to do it.  Toward the end of my time at Wal-Mart there was increasing micromanagement and second-guessing from management, all the way up to both co-managers.  It was common for managers to add projects near the end of the shift, no matter how impractical."
bad,Lack of zero tolerance rule. They pick favorites and lack of time management. Don't think I'll work at a Walmart again because of  the manager and hr not doing anything about it kind of treated it like a joke.
bad,Done really bad on how I was let go.  I would never work for Walmart again.  I have opened my own business now and see how bad Walmart's do there people  Thanks
bad,The work place and co-workers can be great but the management has a clear disconnect  and lack of understanding of how long it takes to complete a general set of tasks. management consistently degrades and berates you if you don't work fast enough. I feel like they need robots to be happy not people.
bad,"It's not the same it's changed over the  years and not for the better. The pay isn't very good, I feel like they don't value good employees. And the day that I quit I was never thanked for my Long-term years of service there. I did do things properly and put my two weeks notice and work the last day I said I was going to work instead of calling off. When asked to do something I would generally do with without any complaining or any resistance. The one time they asked me to go out and help gather cards out in the rain. I was not dressed for the occasion and I tried to get out of doing it but because of my kind heart I ended up going out there for half an hour. It was cold wet and rainy in my shoes got soaked. I ended up getting sick and called off the next day because I was unable to work. I got penalized for calling off. They have removed so many benefits from their employees that they used to get in order to save them money. When I quit I was barely making $12 an hour after being there for Over 10 years. Their pay raises aren't very good and like I said above they do not value good employees. It seems like all they care about is making money. In fact the day that I got fired they asked for the box cutters that they had given me During my employment. My last job there was a cashier which did not require me to have any of those box cutters on my person. So in essence they did not get them back. The whole exit interview I thought was one big slap to the face and I am not impressed with the company at all."
bad,"Worked here for almost 4 years overnights. I can honestly say I never like it from day one. Coworkers are lazy and management is very clickish. Actively encouraging bad employees to be worse because they are never reprimanded. Also there is extremely high turnover rate."
bad,"Management was very bad. Not enough training and the expect a lot with little info. I worked there for a couple months but eventually, it got old.:((("
bad,"The management team did not care about their workers, except for their favorites, and the ones who have been working there for some time. They disregarded employees hours that they put in when they were not available. The employees were not trained properly on the computer training, instead they were sent to do their job and did not finish the online training."
bad,"Ambiente agradable , buena jefatura, ambiente en confianza"
bad,I've worked with this company for 20 years and don't like the direction they are heading everything is becoming increasingly about the bottom line and the employees mean nothing
bad,needs to do more one on one with customers not allowed to work more with customers to build a connection with customer to make them think the company cares about them
bad,"I advised management on a particular scheduling issue based on my prior experience as a manager, and also that separate managers told me that they ignore pages and calls on the radio.  They agreed that my points were valid and that they would do something about it.  Nothing was done about it until after I was burned.  I asked my manager to get several things to make our job time more controllable, such as a radio, scanner, and clock all but the scanners were refused and a year later, the scanners still are not there.  After being burned the first time, another manager gave us a radio.  After getting burned again, there is still no clock."
bad,If you like working with people that don't really know what their doing then this is the job for you. There are more supervisors over you than just one.
bad,"Coworkers were horrible, lazy, obnoxious, slow, rude. Walmart almost seeks out the most poorly educated people. They act like pack animals. This was one of my first jobs."
bad,It's a place to start your first job but the company changes to many rules not for the best but for the worse.... it's not a job you want to move up in management because it's a job that you gotta stay til it's done no matter what happens
bad,They can be very inconsiderate of what is going on in someone's personal life. If you feel as if you are going to have something like a crisis go on in your life Tulsa Walmart is not the way to go.
bad,I’m employed at Walmart they need a lot of help with management . They way they talk to there employees and treat them is unreasonable. They try to inforce the rules that they really don’t tell everyone to do just a hand full of people they inforce the rules with. I like my job it’s the managers that the issues
bad,"The company was way better before compared to now. Less politics, people are working hard to get to the top. Now you see people get promoted faster. Some people deserves it, some people don't. Management team thinks that you're superman and thinks that working overnights is easy as 123. The way they talk to you is like you owe them a lot. Something has to change."
bad,a happy place i meet new people and new coworkers and i learned how to communicate and how to talk to others and how to make them happy because i know they tired at work.
bad,Stressful place to work. There wasn't opportunity to move up in company. The hours we not long but the work was very physical. There were not very considerate of employees
bad,A day at walmart is the hardest thing to do yeah you can learn and move up in walmart but they managers are not there to help you do nothing or try to teach you
bad,"The only truly good thing about working at Walmart are the people you work with, the people who consider you their equal.  I give management three stars because as a cashier, my managers were the customer service managers--and they made very little more than I did--they actually deserve 5 stars because they support you 100 percent.  Hours are terrible; they don't allow you to work full-time."
bad,cajero de walmart cobro de linea de cajas y ofrecer saldo en el celular
bad,I was in charge of jewelry department but they make me work all other department. Manager tells you something to do then assistant manager tells you to something else to do. When work is not done you get in trouble.
bad,Management is what makes or breaks a place of business. In my opinion he one I worked at had port management. My managers usually came off inconsiderate of my personal life.
bad,i worked as a sales associate and always felt expendable. Walmart has changed so much since i first started. The company is a shell of it's former self.
bad,"If you want to berated and bullied all day, then go to walmart. That's unless you stick your nose 15 feet up a managers you-know-what. It's ok pay now that it's $11 an hour, but for what you put up with, it's not really worth it."
bad,"It may have changed since I worked there in 2011, but at that time they would not do reasonable accommodation if you had difficulties due to physical disabilities. They would throw you into a new position with very little training and then write you up if the supervisor didn't adequately explain the job tasks to you."
bad,I hated working at Walmart. The managers have their favorites. It's very hard to move up because they pretty much hand pick who they want to move up. As an employee you end up being responsible for other peoples' work because most of the co-workers are lazy. Managements expectations are way too high and when you don't meet them you get in trouble. If you can find somewhere else to work you should.
bad,The associates are great hard working people and for the amount of work that they demand on one person is too much. A lot of the programs that they put out do not get people in place for them so it falls on others to do.
bad,I worked hard to not get a thanks for my hard work they didn't care I lost my best friend and I had to go to his funeral they also didnt take Dr excuses cause I got hurt with a eye injury and they wouldn't accept the Dr not which I feel was wrong
bad,"A typical day at work only consists of not knowing what your going to walk into the next day. About the only thing that was good was the skills I learned there but only because I was seeking it out. Management is a joke, little to non for communication. To sum it up too many cooks in the kitchen. The hardest part of the job would be trying to fulfill the astronomical expectations."
bad,Wal-Mart will treat you like dirt and replace you the first time you don't meet their expectations. The Moral in the distribution center is terrible and nobody is ever happy to be there.
bad,"I worked at walmart for 4years, I enjoyed it at first but as time went on it became horrible there especially if you get a CSM that for no reason doesn't like you! I was a good, hard worker for them, but that doesn't matter, its all about who they like or don't like. I saw them let  longtime employees go at the drop of a hat and watched as they hired new employees (some still in high school) to start work at a higher payrate than I was making after 3years. Not all the stores have tough management, so be aware of where you apply to work. There were good incentives, (bonus, etc.) but was not worth it to endure the stress I had to put up with!"
bad,"while you may be hired in a specific department you are first and foremost a cashier or stocker, and on occasion you are expected to be a door greeter. This company will hire you at first as a part time employee with a potential to become full time. however the part time hours are only 26-30 a week if you are lucky. full time is no better at 36 hours being what seemed to me as the norm. not many employees worked 40 unless they were management."
bad,I really enjoyed the people I worked with. I miss them alot. We'd start with a pre shift meeting assigning tasks and laying out the plan for the night. I learned a good sense of  time management. The store manager was cold and not personable or friendly.Too many managers. The hardest part of the job was leaving . The most enjoyable part of the job was the majority of the people I worked with. Made so many friends over the years.
bad,walmart is a great place to work as long as you always watch your back and don't get to good at what you do cuz once they see you can work you get to do everyone else job too
bad,way to much stress it pays ok but u never want to go because managers are worthless and never want to do there jobs at all I did not like it at all it was too stressful.
bad,"I'm honestly glad I no longer have to deal with all of the nonsense involved in working at Wal-Mart. When I very first started out I was actually happy to work there and typically had a nice time. However, in recent months I experienced nothing but suffering. Between constantly being busy, never having enough associates to feed the demand of customers and the occasional uncouth customer, I had almost constant head aches. At least I did learn some good tricks along the way. Firstly, I have developed an incredible level of patience, the tolerance of having several people ask you for help at once and how best to coordinate with my teammates. Management was typically nice to me and helped out whenever possible but they were often just as stretched out as the rest of us so not always reliable.I'd definitely say the most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was being able to help people out, be entertaining and be able to light up someone's day. The hardest would be the several times I had to manage the entire Electronics department alone for hours on end with several customers in need at once."
bad,"Walmart is by far the worst place to work for. The management is so far removed from the action that they expect you to do more than your job entails. It is not rare for cashiers to go without breaks simply because management forgot about them. Management would also push you to do things that broke protocol too. All in all, Walmart is where you go to die."
bad,"Management doesn't care about anything but the bottom line.  They claim to be family oriented, but they expect your entire life to revolve around the store.  Schedules are supposed to be done 3 weeks in advance, but in the last month alone, mine has changed around 3 times a week!  I am scheduled outside of my availability and when I complain, they tell me I have to be there anyway.  Horrible place to work, would not recommend to anybody!"
bad,when i find a better job i m gone. i have been a loyal and hard working employee for over 10 years and now they are cutting my hours to more than half. once im gone i will never look back.
bad,walmart would have been a better experience if the management were better. there are managers who harass other associates and make them feel bad about theyre work or out side life. the managers were always quite rude and they also didnt have good leadership. from getting yelled at or looked down upon when you didnt understand something to getting wright ups for false allegations . this was not the best job ive had but it has very good benefits . great insurance and vision coverage. theyre really good about handling things when you get hurt or injured in or out of work.
bad,"Experience varies according to management and location. Fair and honest assistant managers are very few. Though against policy, retaliation is common."
bad,Good environment to work and fair management. I only need to change for a new challenge and practice. I want something more challenging and happier in fulfillment
bad,The whole place is just mismanaged and everyone is confused and no one knows what they should be doing and in general dont do what they are supposed to do.
bad,Company become non driver friendly. Hard to have a life outside of work. Pays great but all the new rules make it impossible to love your job. It was great when I started but unfortunately things change.
bad,was an easy job pay and benefits are not good. no overtime at all was allowed . also area I worked was cold. coats and gloves are provided. benefits were high.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about Walmart - I have much to say to sing the praises of its associates, however.  They are hard working and dedicated.  They endure much with cranky, demanding, rude customers and when you hear ""you're wanted in the office"", you KNEW it wasn't for anything good!  Praise of employees is rare indeed and there is no one that I have worked with or know now that has anything good to say about Walmart!"
bad,The managers have no clue how to talk to people. They are disrespectful and they belittle you. You have at least 5 people giving you direction at one time. No one is on the same page.
bad,"All the managers talk to everyone any type of way, Inconsistent work hours. Not really any good benefits. More hours would have been nice. Fair managers."
bad,I never really liked the management there because they are very racist. But my co workers always made my day better. They claimed they couldn’t get in touch with me is the reason I was terminated
bad,"Looking for employment , just had a new baby and looking for a good flexible job that I can grow in. Something I can move up  or get promoted in.also have some benefits and earn a nice salary."
bad,Worked for walmart in las Vegas on boulder and Nellis  could not get full time I worked there for six months and couldn't get over the struggle ever. I quit after I payed attention to coworkers who worked there for years that we're still part time!  CSM's were also part time this place was embarrassing how can adults survive on part time I probably will never work for Walmart ever again. Thanks but no thanks
bad,"Walmart as a company is a great place to work and has excellent opportunities, if you are in a well run store with a good store manager.   They value diversity and opportunity. They are open to trying different methods to make it easier to shop and work for the company.  If you don't like change, this will not be the place for you. Few people have set schedules, so it's hard to have a good work life balance. Everyone is expected to work holidays though PTO s available, you really can't use it when you want.  Cliques ruin what could be the #1 place to work."
bad,"Company have a lot of favorites if your not in there click they wont promote you and this well hold you back for advancement, this company needs to do better for there staff"
bad,Working for this company was nice at first. After some years passed I noticed a lot of changes. The employees are not treated fairly and you are underpaid.
bad,"High volume store , "
bad,"stressful day of constant movement feeling like get nowhere, i learned that what is told to you and what is in actuality are 2 separate things, hardest thing is to move up in the company"
bad,"They use to treat employees well,  for some reason greed has taken over now they do as little as they can and expect more and more.   Profit sharing was an amazing benefit of working there,  to me it showed they cared about us.  Profit sharing was the first to go,  after that more and more got taken away...."
bad,"I did not care for this job, company, or most other coworkers. Uneducated people in high places can only make a place so great. I was not given an accurate description of the work I'd be performing, nothing worked and I was not being compensated for the line being down or other problems on a DAILY basis."
bad,"No lunches, always mandated overtime, management is horrible and invisible, and lazy. Pay is only good thing here, they’re taking everything else away. Regular pay on holidays, and blackout days and weeks. You work 10-12 hours a day with only 2 short breaks, no lunches. Extreme weather instead de building too, summers are hot but manageable, winters are cold and miserable, heat doesn’t work more than it does work."
bad,hated it at the end..they fired due to me not being to show up when I was scheduled.i was in the hospital when they fired me..due to the fact I got sick at work...
bad,"a typical day at work, was dreadful. I learned that walmart is not the place to be. Or atleast the location i worked at. The most enjoyable part of the job, was when i was clocking out."
bad,At Walmart you would be forced to complete things at a fast pace even if there wasn't a full team on the clock that day. The managers would not treat you like people. If you were sick and came in there was almost a 0% chance that you could go home. They would say that you could change your position in the store but if you signed up for CAP2 there was no chance that you were going to leave that position. They also said that CAP2 was the best place to be noticed to move up to supervisor but I personally think that was a lie. They didn't tell you that you would have to complete an online training course to make more money. You would start out at $9.00 but you have to complete that online training to make the $10.00 you were promised at the interview. Overall Walmart is not a company that you would want to work for.
bad,"I work at Wal-mart, it was stressful. Although the I got along with supervisors and managers, communication was not the best. I wanted to move from a cashier to sale associate in the Beauty department; despite the opening in the beauty department, managers where recommended me to work in other departments than what I requested. However I did get my full hours (8 hrs & 40 hrs)"
bad,I wouldnt work for another walmart but they were alot different and they were a couple of nice people that showed me a good time i would reccomend anyone to work there
bad,A empresa Walmart e muito boa pq tem seus benefício nem como plano de saúde Unimed e odontologia ..
bad,I worked there three years and barely got a raise even though I knew how to do multiple jobs in the store. The management picks favorites and people undeserving of promotions and raises receive them. They do not cash the checks their mouths write.
bad,"Walmart is the definition of corporate. Expect to lock your personality away for the duration of work, lest you do something someone will take the wrong way. Still, the place pays better than most places i suppose."
bad,"Very bad place to work they would claim they worked with school schedules and never did. They were always understaffed and expect us to get everything cleaned and closed up with only two people, while also waiting on customers. They were disrespectful toward employees."
bad,When I first started I enjoyed working for Walmart. As the two years of being there went on I began to hate going to work. I began to miss days because I dreaded going in. The management wasn't good. If you were good with manger you were treated better than other employees.
bad,Management is very lacking when it comes to leadership and accountability. They will do whatever it takes to protect themselves and other members of management while throwing associates under the bus
bad,"While I worked at Walmart, management always had me doing ""special projects"" which was normally things that the support managers would do. The support managers were very rude to some associates, including me, and management wouldn't do anything about it. They were very flexible with scheduling and the pay was better than most places, but it wasn't worth the stress that management would put the associates under."
bad,"Lo bueno que tiene es la flexibilidad de horario, sin embargo, todo lo demás no es tan bueno. La paga es baja y a veces suele haber problemas, como inconformidades las cuales eran difícil de resolver."
bad,"Had a store assistant manager tell me if I looked at her again I would be fired. Many problems with managers wandering around and harassing those from departments not their own."
bad,The management is terrible and the coworkers were rude! You can’t say anything back to customers when they go off on you and get in your face! You ask for help and you don’t get it and it’s just a terrible place to work for
bad,"all managers loved to micro manage, always over your shoulder. night shift at Walmart take time getting adjusted to with the slow pace and boring shifts"
bad,I was threatened by fellow employees on several occasions. taken advantage of.My shift manager was caught along with the assistant store manager trying to steal 90k from the safe room one night.
bad,Not enough employees to make store successful. Very low wages compared to other employers in area. Management is very poor and does not listen to associate concern nor do they try to improve the quality of the store in general.
bad,You are not allowed overtime and can be fired for having it. I tried to move up in the company several times and each time was trained and never given the title or pay. Each position I applied for was given to a male employee. Even without the pay or job title i was still doing the job when the other employee was unable or wouldn't complete the job. I was cussed and screamed at by middle management. When going to upper management for these issues nothing was ever done about it.
bad,"Location is great and easy to get to however management is awful, overworked to the max. Managers schedule hours sometimes not within the availability given. Produce gets new employees and loses half of them within two weeks, it’s always understaffed and hard to start at a fast pace like that for some.  They do give good hours if you ask or if you pick up shifts in other departments which you can always do. There’s an almost unrealistic expectation of perfection to be met so if you can’t deal with constant criticism or being told what needs to be done every 10 seconds I really would not recommend working here. There’s a couple of problematic employees but every workplace has those."
bad,New hirea start .38 cpm what a joke started yrs ago at .42cpm you get shafted every day force u to use your vaction time on holiday or have ro work the day
bad,Enjoyed the work environment and working with my co-workers. I felt I was not as supported as I needed by my supervisor. I felt I did not have the opportunity to work in the position I applied for.
bad,A night at Walmart involves me going in with work from other shifts before me not complete. I was always scheduled over my amount of freight hours. Management hounds you the whole entire time. Very stressful.
bad,Not the job for me all i will say for some people who like no hours and little pay this may be the job for you but I like to make money and be able to pay bills
bad,Walmart would be my last choice as in jobs. They do not do overtime an if you were close to it they would make you go home. An some of the customers were rude.
bad,"I have to admit, Walmart has gotten me on my feet and kept me Ok. Over the years the company has had some drastic changes which weren't for the better. I've been with the company going on 5 years now, I had a set schedule in which my manager was ok with because he knew I was a strong hard worker, they changed the scheduling so that the morning crew would be FORCED in to working nights. Shouldn't they have left the old morning people with their schedules and hired the new employees for mid or night shifts. Now I'm NOT scheduled at all, they completely took me off and everyone else who has closed available it's not fair! They should take care of their LOYAL HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES! We have families to take care of and some of us are single parents! If they took care of us the way we take care of them that would make us go even hard for the company."
bad,The work environment was very quick paced and highly demanding toward the workers. Sometime understaffed in specific areas. Very stressful when working with customers and restocking items on shelving units. very unbalanced with personal life and professional life.
bad,I was an associate for over seven years with Wal Mart of Defiance Ohio.  Very few times in my years of employment was I ever told Thank You or Good Job.  The management there always pushed you to do the unthinkable but never made you feel appreciated.
bad,"If you like running around like a chicken with your head cut off, go for it."
bad,"Too corporate & cold work environment.  constant bombardment to be better than the day before but NEVER recognition or gratitude for hard work done well.  Management is sneaky & underhanded, taking credit for work that isn't theirs.  Employee discounts are laughable at best."
bad,"I ran a very efficient Pharmacy and Walmart supplies the technology for a safe department. Regarding upper management"
bad,When I first started I loved my job. Then I noticed the cliches and teams that were close nit. Made me feel uncomfortable. After I got pregnant I took a leave of absence where I decided not to go back to my job because I wanted to be treated better than I was from management.
bad,"-Typical day at work is helping customers."
bad,"Its okay. I wouldn't recommend any of my friends going there unless they dont have a choice but for me, no. The people are funny and they look down their nose at you."
bad,"When it comes to employment , the job it very easy to attain, yet also very easy for them to fire you and go to the next person that is in line for a simple job"
bad,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians which is enough to drive anyone crazy!! One boss will tell you what to do then another boss will follow behind and tell you to do something different! No overtime and No Holiday pay!
bad,Not happy with my hours never know when I'm going to have a weekend off have to schedule it can't get me a guaranteed schedule and holidays I'm there all the time I want to be with my family looking for something more permanent and more easy going
bad,The management at my locations is very rude. They talk down to their associates and don't listen to their concerns. In fact they simply don't listen. You have to repeat what you have already said to them multiple times because they are to interested in their phones.
bad,very stressful job to the point my body cant move sometimes. i was a cashier. Very long hours. Managers are rude. barely any time off. gets very  busy on weekends and sometime nights.
bad,"The managers didn't appreciate me or my work and pushed me to the point of not wanting to work. No matter how hard i worked, it was never good enough."
bad,"Employees are treated unfairly. Not paid enough by any means. You work 30-40 hours a week but are only considered part-time so they don't have to pay for benefits. No over-time is allowed, any hours worked over your shift, you have to take off of one of your days before the end of that week. For example, I worked 12 hours and still only got paid for 8.I had to make sure that I took those 4 extra hours off of one of my days before that week ended on Friday. I wouldn't wish employment at Wal-Mart on my worst enemy."
bad,"Strikes would be put on record for calling in sick or not being able to come in on storm days, depending who the manager on duty was that day. Management refused to cooperate with part time employees, denied medical leave with doctors note."
bad,"I feel that there is in equal expectations for different managers, "
bad,"I learned that some companies expect you to give it your all for their benefit, but don't compensate you as the employee. Don't know what else I learned, but made some lasting friends and met some nice people along the way,"
bad,It seems as if you are working like a slave for petty change. They do not appreciate good workers but take advantage of them. You are not recognized for excellent work.
bad,"Fluctuations in hours were frequent, as well as responsibilities beyond your pay grade. Lots of manual labor required, and management did not fulfill promises."
bad,"poor management skills and poor communication not willing to listen to what you have to say as well as degrading you verbally in front of associates , your equals and customers, if you are a hourly associate your treated a little better , but if you are salary you are treated terrible and talked to even worse."
bad,"Nothing in the warehouse is about being fair with there employees what is good for one empl yee is not alwayes good for the next. The whole warehouse is run as if they do not have anything to compare it to.It's a company that sets one up for failure. They talk alot about safetey and there facility is'nt exactly safe walking threw. As a Walmart employee we are screened before hired, but the Temp agency they have do not which puts all of us in an unsafe environment. Walmart operates as if they are above the law on all aspects ."
bad,"pay is not enough for what the employee deals with, asked to do multiple jobs that is not part of the job description and dealing with rude customrs for $9 per hour is just not enough"
bad,"typical day of work was stressful, everyday was something different as far as how they wanted things done and the procedures changed all the time which made it difficult for you to get into a groove and know exactly what is expected of you. I was able to learn new skills and software that i wasn't aware of before. Management was the worst part about the job, they played favorites and often times took forever to do anything you asked them to do for you. The culture of the store i worked at wasn't the best, some departments had better culture but for the most part it seemed everybody was dragging along from day to day. The hardest part about the job are the unrealistic expectations of deadlines that needed to get done even if you were the only one if your department that day. The every day deadlines and big workload are tough to balance if you don't have the right amount of staff. The most enjoyable part of the job are some of the employees that are there make it worth being there. Good kind hearted people. Also the amount of work you did during a shift made the time fly by, i like being a busy body."
bad,"The starting pay some claim is good, but have obviously never worked anywhere else. $9, which becomes $10 after you finishing your training is a complete joke considering management can task many things for a lowly associate while supervisors that do less and are more favored get more (up to $15!) That's also another thing wrong with this joke of a company.. the management, they play favorites and act like they're still in high school. Unless you're a favorite, don't even think once about being promoted; even if you can do absolutely everything in the store. I'd rather recommend someone work at Target before here."
bad,"to many chiefs not enough indians, not enough customer service, not enough practice in the three basic beliefs of wal-mart, customer service, respect for the individual, and strive for excellence."
bad,"Very poor direction from corporate, management with poor people skills. My management style is to lead through people, you have to sell the companies culture, new concept and lead your associates to ""buy in"" sadly walmart has the technology for metrics but lacks leadership and positive culture"
bad,Bosses/Management like the people that kiss up to them. They are unfair about ours and peoples needs and  play favoritism to employees that suck up to them regardless if that person works hard or not. You get trained but when you're on the floor no one is there to help you learn all the jobs that need to be done in a department. The best part of the job is going home at the end of the day.
bad,"Good for a first job and adds experience. If youre there long enough (about 15 years) there may be a chance of advancing. Its fast paced, especially during holidays"
bad,The job is not job security it's not enough work for production or if it is its your not set up for success  management does not st the employee up to be successful
bad,people were cool to work with but management was only looking out for themselves favoritism is very big here and if you are not liked you will get a write up every chance they can give you one
bad,Walmart doesn't care about their employees when it comes to health. They don't accept  doctors notes and expect for you to work even if you or your child could be dying. I got fired due to points because my daughter had blood disorders that cause her to stay sick frequently and they knew that. They still didn't accept the notes and paper work from the doctor. My last week before I got fired I passed out in the Walmart store and had to be rushed to the hospital. They called the ambulance for me and then gave me points for no call no show along with absence.
bad,"I worked here as an order filler for almost a year.  It was 3 day, 12 hour shifts which made for a great work life balance.  Work by yourself all day doing physical labor and only get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  Need to punch out at your station, so you lose half of your lunch break walking to the breakroom."
bad,"The managers at this store do not care about the associates, barely get any breaks, customers are very rude and so are associates , associates and managers do not work as a team , poor communication, unable to get task done in a decent amount of time"
bad,over worked under paid and not treated correctly at all. Wal mart stretches their employees thin. they expect a person to work over 5 to 15 individual departments a day while being asked to come cashier anytime called to do so. Their management does not care about their employees and does not take care of them. There is a lot of drama and problems between employees there and everyone is everyone else business . It is like working in a trashy high school again... this is not a recommended place at all . They are a place that plays favorites and allows some to get away with things while others will be fired for the same action that another got away with.
bad,1 person working a 17 lane parking lot + back and sides of building for full 8 hour shifts with basic nessisary job equipment not provided such as shag lines (special straps with hooks for preventing long strings of carts from seperating) and seeming refusal to provide or alow workers to bring their own replacements
bad,"I  was fired at Walmart for points, one of which should of came off.they put on a whole point because the comanager said i left four hours early,which idid not.ihave never left early in all  the years i .have worked for them. I made a mistake on my punch,i tryed to have it corrected to no response repeatedly."
bad,"I loved the customers. I love working with people.  the work I did was unnoticed. I went above and beyond for my customers, new management would be ideal for the store"
bad,"If it's not the rude customers to turn you off, it's the god awful management. Support managers lie to get you to do their go backs. They don't care if you don't have thw proper tools to get things done. Huge disconnect from upper management."
bad,you can make a career with this company if the right manager sees what you a worth and how hard you work . Let know one stop you from making to the top with this company.
bad,"Realizar escaneo de huecos para ver que producto cambia de precio, realizar apertura de cajas,recepción de proveedores,cierre sistemas fin de dia."
bad,"Rotated and organized stock. Sent the old food or bad food to the compost after scanning it into the handheld markdown computer. I learned a lot of new fruits and vegetables I didn't know existed. Learned how to tell when they were bad, too ripe, and perfect. "
bad,Just don't like the management and how they handle situations.  Also they have a point system that if your late or can't come to work you lose points and you only get 4 on the beginning so once there gone there system terminate you unless a manager waive the points
bad,Walmart sucks. The current store manager is a jerk and the atmosphere is deplorable. The customers are some of the most disgusting people I have ever seen and the coworkers are not much better.
bad,"The company is terrible about promoting all the wrong people, and when it comes to training, is nonexistent. They wanted me to drive over 2 hours and be away from my family for a week for ""training"" and it's not even job specific, just Walmart in general."
bad,"A typical day at work starts on working on stock that has been left  to the floor, then working on price changes and going on cash when needed.  It's a fast pace ever changing environment, they always keep you on your toes. Management decision has always been a bit scattered and not always on the same page as what they should be. The hardest part of my job has been the task being assigned and they want it done at that moment when you have been giving another task that needs to be completed first. Not   enough time to complete the task that were being assigned .  What i do like about my job is helping out customers and making sure we have product on the shelf.   Also learning new task."
bad,"A typical day would be like, one manager would come along and ask you to do something and another one will ask you to stop what you are doing and work on something else, another one would just be plain rude to you.  the hardest part of my job is the communication and management. I do enjoy working with some of the employees"
bad,"The management team can't make up their minds on anything, they don't have your back on any decisions you make after they agree with you! This is the worst place if you want management to back you"
bad,"This is a great job to have for a first time job or for a job away from the fast food industry. The job has okay benefits, but the pay is low and it is hard to get the raise after completing their computer learning. Management is okay but some managers don't care about your well being. The job security is great but even if you are full time you wont get 40hrs they can cut you down to 32hrs or less a week. it is also very hard to get full time with this company and very hard to move up in the company. This workplace usually consists of rude customers and you will constantly stand for 8+ hours."
bad,For $9 an hour you are doing hard manual labor. And you are expected to already know how to do it. The supervisors were disrespectful and inconsistent and nobody wanted to answer any questions about anything. The store itself was chaos and it took at least an hour to find the supplies we needed to do the job for the day. Permanent associates would talk down about us like we werent right there listening. Nothing was ever ordered or was always 'on the truck' but we would get yelled at for not finishing in a timely fashion. Great hours tho and I loved my fellow remodel team members.
bad,"Everyday of work was pretty much unpredictable, I learned how to work alone because working there you were pretty much on your own with everything . I didn't enjoy working there at all"
bad,Typical day is walking in to overnights not having enough help to get freight done so our job is doubled. Also being called to do registers constantly cause not enough cashiers. Plus my pay is not good enough for the positions that I fill in a day
bad,"Management at my store was terrible, always changing their mind on what they wanted. Work hours are all over the place and compensation is terrible. DO NOT work at Walmart if you don't have too."
bad,Management has their favorites and are Clicky with only certain employees and therefore overlook those who are more qualified for an opportunity than others.
bad,"Corporation is not uniform, very high turnover rate. Too much change in management, very little consistency and no integrity. Open door policy is a joke at that company."
bad,"working for Walmart in the location i did was an utter nightmare. under management had no real support structure, fellow associates stole your things, and the worst part is the store manager at the time had no clue what they were doing sometimes."
bad,"At our Walmart in Pearsall there is a lot of favoritism and unfair working environment. The management we have are very bad and don't care about what matters. As soon as one of the high school kids cry about one little thing they give them what they want but if a veteran has a problem they get told it's not their problem. I have learned a lot working at Walmart and the biggest lesson  they taught me was if you cry and complain enough you'll get what you want but,  that is not the way I want to work I love working hard and that doesn't seem to matter to the management at Walmart store #478. When I informed my head manager I was looking for other employment I was told to hope my new jobs don't call them as a reference because he wouldn't speak to them. So for anyone thinking of going to Walmart I suggest thinking it over unless you want to deal with bad management, carelessness and favoritism."
bad,I liked working at Walmart but they would not work with me when I had knee surgery. I no longer work there because of my surgery and they talk bad on people
bad,"The pay was good, but the environment wasn't always clean and it seems like management did not have your best interest. They also showed favoritism within the building."
bad,"The CSM where rude, some of the co workers were disrespectful and got away with it. They had  favorites. I like working there because of the people I meet I loved being able to help them."
bad,If management was more professional this would have been a great place to work for many years. They ignore issues just to avoid having to deal with them.
bad,This job doesnt care about you or your family is all about the customers. They told me my family or my job and yes i choose my family. The things they ask of us we dont get paid enough to deal with the rude and disrespect of the other staff and customers
bad,Management always took word of someone else instead of asking for the story of both sides. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I loved my customers.
bad,"a bad experience for me i jst didnt like the job anymore, typical work day was very slow since i worked over nights the enjoyable part was when  i got to leave"
bad,"ganhei muita experiencia com a WMS, mas é uma empresa onde não consegui ver plano de carreira e estabilidade."
bad,"walmart is an ok place to work, flexible hours and such. Some managers are good, others are not, its just typical of a retail store.  Not great, and not awful"
bad,Very fast paced and stressful because the overnight crew did not have enough employees. Everyone was overworked because we were understaffed and were being assigned multiple departments a night.
bad,the only positive thing i can really say about this job was the manager was awesome and kept us motivated. he worked with us. and if we had a problem he tried to help us out.
bad,Good job for beginners. Can move quickly up the management team if willing to put job before all else. Does require that job is priority of family or anything else. Not very respectful of religious holidays.
bad,"not much to say other than the hours are all over the place, the hard work put in for minimum pay is unfair employees are hostile to one another cashier is the hardest job"
bad,The management was horrible they would stop you from doing your job and pull you to work in another area for your entire shift and the next day you come in they yell at you for not doing your assigned job.
bad,Worst place to work at ! The pay is great but why would someone want to work in a place that has a very strict attendance policy . Even with a doctor note you still get points . The managers were the crappiest I've ever worked for
bad,"Customers were great. Management needs to have more training, they can not agree on what needs to be done and what order it needs to be done in. Overall did not enjoy the position one bit."
bad,"I would go in to work worrying about how I was going to get into trouble that day. I was responsible for stocking produce and insuring the smooth flow of product onto the sales floors. I also interacted with the customers and make sure they had a pleasant shopping experience while insuring that they found the products they wanted to purchase. This was the easiest part the hard part was trying to make management happy. Everything that happened was always never good enough, sure they gave the occasional lip service compliment something that had no feeling behind it and was cut and paste. If you have a complaint good luck having them do anything about it."
bad,"I hated this job. My work associates were great and I made friends, but the job itself was horrible. As a cashier you deal with a lot of stress and when you need a manager you have to flash your light and wait as the customer takes their anger out on you and the manger takes their sweet time getting to you. "
bad,"work load is usually very heavy on a daily basis."
bad,"My location had terrible managers, I have worked at many different jobs and my worst managers were at Wal-Mart. Want to move up in the company? not at Wal-Mart, they hired new managers from out of store and not even rom other Wal-marts."
bad,Casi no teníamos tiempo para convivir con la familia
bad,"fair pay ... nice surrounding .... great job laid back ...... ............. .              fair hours neat uniform ,............... . good for discounts"
bad,Walmart caps 2 was a fast paced and stressful environment by Managers wanting check lists done on certain times but didn't take account of other mishaps.
bad,Nothing good to say so I will say nothing at all thank you I dont have 58 more characters sorry ok is this enough?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????I have nothing else
bad,"Was not a job for me, Spent 5 years of my life there. So many negative people and unreal job expectations. Worked hard and did my absolute best and all they do is set up a time where they couch you and say you must do better so they use fear to control you. Not to mention management playing favorites. Just not worth it in the long run. Also saw first hand what Wal-Mart dose to a small community, family owned operations suffered at the influence to the surrounding area. Made for a very uneasy work place experience."
bad,"I went from working in housewares to electronics and when I finally got into the department I wanted to be in I loved it. I was happy I knew what I was talking about and it made things easier with the customers when they asked where things was or what your opinion was on something. Then I finally was moved into the personal shopper position, that was the best thing I ever did for that company. Was so much fun being able to travel to different stores to go get products that we didn't have. Made the job so much fun."
bad,The job is always busy and they don't ever let us take are breaks. We work hard for little to no reward. Sometimes we get yelled at for the work we did because it wasn't enough. There are some nice people in Walmart but its very few.
bad,"Moving from one department to another usually results in a pay cut, depending on where you're transferred, but it's nice that they give you an entire hour for lunch depending, once again, on which department you work in. The culture is terrible. The misery the employees experience on a daily basis is palpable, and the only ones who seem to enjoy their job are in management positions, and even then it seems like they're lying to themselves to get through the day."
bad,Awful place to work. Management only cares about themselves and never your concerns. Your health is not a concern to them. I wouldn't advise working here unless desperate.
bad,"A typical day at my job includes everything an assistant manager does at Wal-Mart. I am suppose to be a support manager, which my job title includes making sure customers are being handled properly, getting the assistants they need, and making sure we have staff coverage. Instead, when I walk through those doors I do not know what my daily tasks are. Most of them are assistant manager notes that the assistant managers do not feel like doing. The hardest part about my job is trying to cover the entire store when I am one person. The most enjoyable part of my job is my store manager receives phone calls all the time from customers complimenting me on how well I work and helpful I am."
bad,The company has too many bosses and not enough works. Everyone wants to give orders and not do the work. I was passed over on an advancement due to the fact that a friend of a manager also applied. I was the best qualified in every aspect of the job.
bad,I learned a lot at Wal Mart you have to be motivated ready to work willing to go over and beyond for your customers you want them to feel comfortable and always with an smile sometimes it can get hard the hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers you have to stay professional no matter what because sometimes you can lose yourself you have to keep an positive attitude and never be afraid to speak up ask question be flexibly and never be afraid of a change but the best part of any job is seeing the smiles you put on people face each and everyday
bad,Its just easy money. Every area of the store is easy to learn. But of all the different walmart ive worked for in the past 5 years. Across the board all management is terrible. Its rather easy to move up if you get close to the right manager. Then you get absolutely no training on what you're doing. But i suppose its okay in the end because you get promoted to an assistant who just walks around high and mighty on there cell phone
bad,Save yourself and go somewhere where you will be appriecated for all the hard for you commit. You are better than this company. It is not worth working here as little by little they are taking away all benefits for their employees.
bad,"Very under managed. Schedules always messed up. Management incompetent. Workers not friendly."
bad,"Wal-Mart expects more from people that is possible. The job is very hard, not enjoyable, certainly not fun and will break a person down  very fast. Don't recommend it to anyone."
bad,McDonald's was my very 1st job. I hated it l was over worked and they have there likes and I hated that. I wouldn't go back only if I have to but it was a lesson learned.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and their unrealistic goals that causes unneeded stress and also causes me to stay late most days.
bad,"Store Manager goal was only  to make his profitable status.  Most Dept. Managers have no knowledge of proper procedures and policies. Last minute scheduling. Had to do managers job, often no breaks, and late lunches.  No matter how far you go out of your way to help the store, they can lay you off to bring in people with lesser experience."
bad,"Typically chaotic, revolving door with associates & managers, Daily meetings, etc.  When I worked there they had squirrels loose in the building."
bad,Cashiered during highschool as a part time job. It was not a good fit for my schedule. The company is also to big. Any complaints that anyone had just fell through the cracks.
bad,"Awful, just awful! Customers constantly asking for price matches is what finally drove me away from this place! Not to mention it's hard to find a manager anywhere especially when things get hectic. No, do yourself a favor and don't bother applying!"
bad,"The Management is absolutely terrible, if your looking for progression in your career it will not happen here, on a typical day you stress to go in because of mostly management just simply cant do there job. The most enjoyable part about my job is that i actually love working on vehicles."
bad,Do not work here. The money is good and the work space its somewhat relaxed. The management is horrible I was mistakenly fired noumerous times.
bad,"Simply put, Walmart is a HORRIBLE place to work!!! They treat you like MUD!!! Management is always rude, irritable, and completely unconcerned about you or anything you do or what you have to say! STAY AWAY!!!!!"
bad,"Stocking grocery deli and meats  thoroughly cleaned washroom including sinks and mirrors swept snd map and waxed floors,disposed of garbage,replenished supplies,trained to use cleaning chemicals after finishing cleaning, I  star sorted and organized clothes on the sales floors"
bad,It was a verygood Experience. I learned a lot from my fellow co-workers. Although the Assistant Manager does a bad job at addressing problems and has a bad temper with associates and staff. It is pretty bad whwn you don't wanna go to workl because one team member is a rotten egg
bad,"Avoid at all cost, they only pick favorites here. What I learn here at this no matter how hard you work its won't make a difference.In the 4 years that I have work this has been the worst in terms of working with co-workers have of them don't do anything while the others are forced to pickup the slack. Management doesn't care about the employees at all!!!!!."
bad,Walmart was a fun and interesting environment to work in it required consistent work and reasonable breaks focusing on one task at a time getting all pallots turned before the deadline and i normally completed each task that was assigned to me
bad,The co-workers made the job good. But the managers make the job terrible. They can over work you. Everything that comes out of there mouth must be right. They tend to act like they are perfect.
bad,Bossy management who treats part time employees like theyre less than them but is a good work enviroment when managment is not around giving orders. If you start part time it takes a long time to advance to full time hours. almost impossible to change departments if you are not happy
bad,Un trabajo no constante de ritmo muy cambiante. encargados de la tienda tienen una actitud muy ruda y la paga no es favorable para el trabajo que se lleva acabo.
bad,"Walmart is a good job to start off your career in retail, i have learned alot durring my time there, ive learned how to inneract with customers and how to also deal with rude customers, i learned how to stock shelves and do my job right"
bad,"management does care for their employees, all they care about is making money"
bad,Good luck getting ahead if you are not an big butt kisser. They play favorites a lot to everyone that shows them just a little attention.
bad,Walmart has no empathy for there customers. They work you like a dog here for a little bit of pay. The customers are rude unbearable and impatient.
bad,"This was by far the worst place I've ever worked. They don't know how to treat their employees plus for what you do, they don't pay enough for people to put up with that nonsense."
bad,"No fun, long breaks, busy could have spent my holidays with my family. Its alright if you need money but even than the pay is medicore."
bad,"poor management, doesant do their jobs at all, lets people call in and doesant care about associates only the customers."
bad,"I worked midnights at cvs , occasionally I had good days. Management was not up to part at all, too many times the manager would leave without giving instructions with taking extended breaks. Walmart was a great learning experience, the thing to not do when given power. The hardest part about the job was managing two isles while attending to customers."
bad,No security after closing hrs. No breaks. If we missed a day point get taken off. Job had to be done before 7am. So no breaks were taken to finish the load on sundays
bad,The store management is poor arrangement for workforce. All employee levels does not have good ideas how to get the work done better and efficient.
bad,"Just like with everywhere else, Walmart managers have favorites. But it goes beyond when people are getting fired for little things with no coaching when they are supposed to have 3 after their 90 days. When asked about it they give excuses and the run around. While others are magically getting coaching taken off early and promoted due to the fact that the associate and the managers are close. Walmart claims to have a justifiable system for acting on something they hear about associates but its really just he said/ she said things and nothing ever gets done, Managers tend to push people who are actually doing well really hard do to the fact that other associates aren't keeping up, so those associates end up doing 90% of the work  with scare tactics coming from all management to ""get the job done faster"""
bad,"Everyday at Wal-Mart is the same, If you are an Extrovert who likes  fun and a social workplace you will not enjoy this place. People who work here are gloomy, grumpy and not friendly. The management team is a joke, they are unqualified and unfit to lead any sort of team. The work itself is manageable but having to deal with the managers and raging customers is unacceptable. It's ok If you're a collage or uni student who wants to make a little money during summer, I wouldn't suggest staying there longer than 3 months."
bad,Very lazy Co workers. Didn't get a break. Customers look at you like you are a joke. Managers didn't communicate with each other or employees. Schedule was always wrong. A lot of call outs
bad,ITS a good job it the people of management is not a concern about the employee at all. Lack of team work with co worker childish area and their not concerned about the customers over all i enjoyed my experience because i learn a lot and even gotten a chance to sit with corporate management
bad,ot back to work at people were very nice that I worked with but management was not reliable was given a schedule one promised I enjoy working there because I like my coworkers hey man its fun to be around I I didn't mind helping customers and I would do anything that was asked to me bowling can only workL
bad,Working for Wal-Mart was the best just sOme employees were very angry but I did my job an communicated with co workers an made there day even though they weren't very happy
bad,You can't be hired on full time and them as part time your hours have to be open to get any hour worth staying.  Then once your there and start working then they expect you to do everything.
bad,"A typical day at work: There was no typical day, your ""job title"" is a joke because they expect you to do anything and everything they need/want at any given moment. This includes, cashiering, pushing carts in any weather, unloading the truck, stocking in other departments, zoning in other departments, etc. The store I worked at had a 2pm-3pm zone hour where basically everyone was expected to go to the grocery department to zone an aisle while most of the time the managers just stood around and watched. If you got to work at the time, you may be be on the zone list, which you may or may not be made aware of."
bad,"I liked working with a mojority of my co workers but overall I would not recommend working here. It was fun at first, sad to say it has gone downhill over time."
bad,"Not much to say , only worked for a few weeks and we had miss communication ... As for them saying that , that's why the  last crew was having a problem and the new crew was going through the same . Co-workers was great to be  around but the management was not good with communicating with they employees ."
bad,"A typical day at work would be investigations and apprehending thieves. I learned a lot about the company, from working with gain and loss of money and how to manage a team successfully. Also built some great relationships with law enforcement officials. 90% of my co workers loved me and loved to work with me. The hardest part of my job was not having a manger over me in my department of asset protection. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and helping law enforcement with criminals/investigations."
bad,my night manager was very rude  .they never came to me to talk about my working skills the always talked behind everyone back
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed this job when I was busy.  When I completed what I was asked to do, it was very difficult for me to stay focused on what I should be."
bad,Overall I would have to say my time at Walmart was educational. I learned about the importance of staying organized following safety procedures. though management was a little lacking in my area of work I found my co-workers easy to work with. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was teaching new co-workers how to do the paperwork. The most enjoyable part of working there was how smoothly all the unloaders/receivers worked in a group.
bad,The job overall is not bad but production standards are ridiculously stressful. . Some trucks arrive literally upside down and a lot of the freight have so many issues and you have to keep going to the help desk or call QA  for help with problem freight and they don't take any of that into account-they still expect you to make production. The stress is overwhelming. You have to make production every week or you get written up. Most of the employees suck up to the supervisor so they can get good trucks and make production. There is a lot of favoritism. The favorites are given good trucks all the time. No one in my department have been there for more than 2 Yrs.  The turn over rate is very high.
bad,"The work portion is fairly easy, but management makes the job for everyone stressful. I love my co- workers they pretty much made the job easier. The only hard part of the job was knowing management wanted to throw us under the bus at any chance based off of someone's assumptions."
bad,"Everything you read is basically true, employees are treated as ""a dime a dozen"" depending on what shift you work some of the managers are great some have opportunities for improvement, but you find that with any company.  There is room for advancement if you can cut through the political bs, it's an ok company, but it really can't be considered anything more than a paycheck to paycheck kind of job."
bad,"WalMart is a very unorganized facility to work in. "
bad,Wasn't offering enough hours. The company didn't let you pick up shifts in different departments when asked and when shifts was available.
bad,"My  typical  day  at  work  was  to put  freight  away ,zoned ,cleaned  and  fix  packages  that  where   damaged  ,go  around  my  department  and  scanned  any  empty  area  of  merchandise  and  than  reordered  ,also  I  had  to   view  all  my  emails  and  replied  to  it  .I  also  had  to  help  my  co  workers  with  their  extra  work  load  of  skids  of  products .After  break  I had to review  my  paper  work  and  view  my  truck  log  to  see  if  all  my  products  came  in from the truck .During  the  day   I  was  also  a  cashier.   I  was  grateful  to  learned  a  lot  from  business  point  of  view  with  Walmart  .I got  along  with  every body  ,I  used  to  make  people  laugh  a  lot  .Management   did  not  carry  the  true   leadership  towards  their   employees , lack  of  compassion ,  not  enough   communication  with  the  individual  ,not  knowing  how  to  express  their  task ,and  use  wrong  approach  towards  human  kind  ."
bad,"i pushed carts and it did not bother me that it was repetitive. what bothered me was the fact that i was promised breaks and never got them, training video said if it thunders we are suppose to stay in doors for 30 mins until no more thunder. instead they constantly demanded i continue to work. on that day it was hot and sunny so i wore shorts worked a 4 person shift alone and then it started to rain while i was in shorts and a T-shirt. i constantly felt exhausted and tired. i applied for part time but was given 39.5 hours. and only 30 min lunch but they didn't pay for the whole hour of lunch"
bad,"a typical day at work if your working morning shift,we open up deli.using the procedures listed,make our daily sandwhiches,put chickens on,wait on customers,do other daily duties,our cook comes in at nine,prepares the food for hot case and the mobile case,and keeps it up all day.my coworkers are the best and we worked as a team,the hardest part of the job was when we  only had two people working a shift,it was very difficult to perform our jobs in a safe way,and having more work put on us than we can handle,making it very stressful.it wasnt done as asked,we faced coaching,our mangement was okay,but didnt really try to fix the situation,many times they had to call people off the floor to help,but alot of times we dint get that help.the most enjoyable part of the day was interaction with the customers,chatting with coworkers in the break room,it was a pleasant place to work at one time,i learned to have patience,caring,and pride in my job,i was terminated because they say i put a knife in a hoagie i was making,i dont think i did what they said,my coworkers told me because i was full time i was let go because they only wanted partime workers,i have applied for unemployement and found not negligent."
bad,Its hard work the managers mostly treat you just like a work horse don't care much about you as a person. Very fast paced and have to deal with lots of stress with deadlines. Customers are average for retail. Management are like very demanding and expect a lot of  out put in a very short amount of time. Co-Workers are average and hours can vary must be open to every changing shifts.
bad,"No two days are the same, not sure if I work there again, some co-workers were okay to work with. I did like the receiving position."
bad,Walmart is the kind of large juggernaut of company you would expect it to be. Uncaring and negligible with a cheery and politically correct facade. Their benefits are admittedly impressive. But at the cost of your psychological sanity. The managers are pressured to produce more and more profit by the second which leads them to pressure you to accomplish more and more ridiculous and inhuman feats to get through the work day. It doesn't help that this environment churns out more and more angry and unhappy workers that show a bad light on the company itself. There is a very good reason Walmart is losing BILLIONS in profits and it has to do with the very publicly known poor way they treat their employees.
bad,management is extremely poor and hours are too long even for part-time workers and the store itself is kept in poor condition.
bad,"After you work there for a few months, you know what you should be doing. but for some reason management doesnt. they don't talk to eachother at all or give each other info.... like when alarms go off. or what atf codes are. . . the people are great. the management sucks!"
bad,"Usually busy as Walmart always is. Not a fun place to work at all. The hardest part of the day was getting help from the supervisors. You either could never find them, or they take their sweet time getting to you and the customer. Management isn't nice, and you can tell they have their favorites."
bad,The deli is the worst part to work in of that Walmart Supercenter. The management never addressed complaints. People come to work hungover or didn't show up at all and management didn't do anything about it. I constantly worked short handed
bad,"Opportunities are endless if you apply yourself. But then again it's also about who your in good with in management. The higher up you go in positions the more money you THINK your going to make. But the taxes are so high you can't see a difference in the promotion verses your hourly wages AT ALL. Forced to work over time and then forced to cut it, so they get the overtime work to do the job but you can't keep the overtime to get paid for what you did."
bad,"a typical day at work was smooth and quiet,learn  how to deal with any type of outcomes,christmas  season was very fun and enjoyable."
bad,"If you are unemployed or work in fast food, then this is the job for you. As an IMS crew member/Cap 2 associate you start your day zoning (straightening up product on shelves and rotating stock)  for an hour. Then you report back to receiving to unload the general merchandise truck, here you will work on the line or in the truck. If you are in the truck you will be responsible for unloading the trailer one box at a time, and dodging falling walls of freight. The truck is the worst part of the job (and was a scarring personal nightmare for me). Working on the line is simply sorting the freight as it comes out of the truck. After the truck is unloaded you will be responsible for one of the following processes, processing breakpacks, processing apparel, or unloading grocery truck. Sorting breakpacks is essentially sorting out boxes of single item freight. Processing apparel is where you sort out clothing based on what gender and age group. Unloading grocery truck is when you pull pallets off the grocery truck and sort them by aisle. After those tasks are done you will need to deliver all this freight to their respective departments on the sales floor. The final task of the day is to work all the grocery freight."
bad,The hardest job I've ever worked the people we're very rude I didn't like it. It wasn't what I thought it would be. I would prefer my mangers be respectful and attentive to me but they weren't and I don't like that so I quit
bad,"There was too much work for so little pay. Low prices and low wages."
bad,Working at Wal-mart wasnt the worst but the manager made it a living underworld and made it very uncomfortable to come to work. They blame all the regular associates and no managers are ever at fault. They show favoritism and fire you for anything so they are severely understaffed and they will continue to fall downhill because they dont even make enough money or have the inventory they need to run properly.
bad,"They provided free food at times but over all it was not a great experience. I was forced to do many jobs without getting paid for them, a few of them not even classified under my job title."
bad,Back breaking for the minimum wage.. had me doing warehouse work for scraps. Working 5 hours a day 25 a week. The management seemed to be focused on blacks only.
bad,"stocking shells , zoning  isles putting things in order, "
bad,"Trabaje en un bodega aurrera (wal.mart) por año y medio, al principio te lavan la cabeza mostrandote en videos y juntas lo bueno de trabajar en walmart. Cuando nada de lo que pasa sucede realmente. Llegaras a trabajar en varios departamentos simultaneamente y cuando menos te des cuenta ya seras el comodin de todos (el gato) y claro con el sueldo mas miserable, y que ni se te ocurra hacer tiempo extra, ya sean 10 o 3 minutos extra por que ya te andan corriendo. Trabajar en walmart es perder tu vida social y familiar. No hay bonos de productividad ni un gracias. Al final te dan una patada y te quemaran de lo peor con otras empresas.y ni se te ocurra usar tu imms por que te descuentan el dia o hasta te asesoran las de recursos son unas gatas del sistema negrero walmart."
bad,Worst Place I Ever Worked For But I Was Young and Dumb and it was my first Job Loved Working With People hated working in the raining weather and cold weather I Was A Cart Pusher
bad,"You work there for years and hardly get better pay. The management teams play favorites, and only promote people they like."
bad,The most fun part of the job was the co-workers and customers. I enjoyed that but I did not like most of the managment. They are unorganized and disrespectful to the employes.
bad,"My manager wasn't that great of management. But the others we awesome because they new how to treat staff members."
bad,The position was very stressful with minimal management support. Low wages for High wage responsibility.  Always under staffed and over worked.  Only reward was a few long lasting friendships with ex-coworkers.
bad,"Ok place to work, if you can put up with the constant nagging and whining of management to meet their unrealistic expectations so they can get their bonuses."
bad,this particular stores management treated me with utter disrespect  they said they wanted me to succeed  but I knew otherwise. other supervisors told me I was set up to fail
bad,"they were very unorganized, they played favorites all the time and everything was all over the place. the managers were not good managers at all they tried to cover up a lot of things that were happening there"
bad,"Worst company to work for.  Employees are treated like livestock; herded around as management sees fit.  If you are struggling with a task, they will find another associate to help before they dare get their hands dirty.  The store manager has the assistant and co mangers scared for their lives, so they all take it out on everyone else.  Best part of the day is getting to leave, assuming they don't hold you after.  If you are forced into doing overtime, they make you cut it all before the end of the week.  If you get a large profit share bonus, they cut the whole stores hours the following weeks."
bad,"They don't treat people with disabilities with respect. They will discriminate if anyone has a disability. They don't give very great benefits. Each person will have a part-time status with a full-time schedule with out any benefits. It is like being in high school again, and the people who are in leadership as the bullies. If anyone can take the discrimination, mistreatment and their inability to appreciate their associates, within five to ten years a person can get a promotion within the company. However, if only a person doesn't receive any coaching, which is like getting written up, no meal violations and they get along with management and other associates, easier say than done, I must say. To work here, a person will need a survival instinct, or they will be consumed by wolves within the company."
bad,"i have been with the company for over 2 years. while i enjoy working with my coworkers, i believe some of the management could be a little more compassionate towards us. the amount of work we do is more than the daytime employees, as they leave heavy work loads for us to do. i look for challenges, and i do my job quickly and efficiently."
bad,I developed a lot of social skills dealing with customers each day. I encountered a lot of different people of different back grounds because everyone comes to Walmart.
bad,there is a negative style to upper management. for an outside hire it is not a positive experience. i feel bullied and not appreciated.i think the training was good but be came out dated as soon as i started to constant change.
bad,"I learn how to handle costumer, how managment the money, how to help and resolve very hard situation., The best part is I leran from what i see from others not from them.."
bad,"The management is never supportive and is never flexible with schedules. Lunches are rarely on time. You are lucky to get even full time hours and the second you get close to 40 hours, they make you clock out. They work you like a work horse even when you're pregnant. Worst place to work."
bad,Walmart is a very large company and barely has any staff that actually cares about their customers or employees. There is little to no room for advancement.
bad,"Walmart has great benefits but the management team are unprofessional and not supportive. I don't like working every weekend. The other associates are disrespectful and has no respect from each other. I don't find working a Walmart enjoyable, I just work there because I need a job."
bad,"Es un buen ambiente en general, pero las malas condiciones de trabajo y la escasa cantidad de personal dificulta las labores diarias."
bad,It was an experience to work for this company. Met new people and have the best customer service. It's a very competitive company and has so much overtime.
bad,"The pay is good and the benefits are great but you'll suffer for it in the "
bad,"I learned to stock ,counts and to audit bins .to pick merchandise for difrentte departments through the store this was a daily job .We also have to unload groceries truck this is the hardest part of my job pulling pallets from a truck can be pretty heavy .I get along with my co -workers .we work as a team .As far as management they can be fair if your on there good side .most of them they leave you alone as long as you do your job . i have never really had any problams .the most of my enjoyable would be our quarterly bounus and wearing our favorite NFL Jersys ."
bad,I quit because Walmart generally did not value me as an employee.It was a very stressful and unsafe environment.  The customers were always confrontational and rude...Management did not have employees back nor did they care about our personal and financial issues.
bad,"It's Walmart so I am sure you've heard enough horror stories.  "
bad,"Yes, I do love working for Walmart. But I've recently had to change my availability and now i have no hours as a single parent they don't seem to realize how hard it is to make a living. Yes, we just received a raise but they our hours get cut. I don't know how to feel about this. to give this employer all of my time and for them to to cut my hours is not fair."
bad,We was always under staff; making you cover more department. Sometimes it was one Manager to about 60 employee and customers. If you don't mind being stretch very thin.
bad,I worked for Walmart for a short time due to moving to Tucson. I was over worked and treated poorly and was not given the respect I deserved as a employee.
bad,Working with my immediate co-workers. Too much favoritism in the workplace. Too many relatives working in the same store.
bad,"Help unload trucks,move merchandise to proper locations. Put up merchandise.Sometimes there would be meetings.Answering phones& helping out at the fitting room. Management were too much into personal life of the employees.they also lied to me."
bad,"Very busy typical day,Nice co-workers some managers where unprofessional.Hardest part dealing with Rude customers.Enjoyed making customers happy & meeting new people."
bad,Managers don't care about employees.  Expect you to work your *** off and then wont give you a fair assessment or raise so they can keep there staffing costs down.
bad,"Very unappreciated here. Not really able to do as much as I could do. There were limits to what you could reach, no matter what manager told you there was not any kind of limit."
bad,"my day there was very stressful never could I do anything right. I learned how not to treat your asscs. The mgt. team was very disrespectful always talking beneath you. My co-workers were fantastic the hardest part of my job was leaving my co-workers, the most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers."
bad,mean managers who don't appreciate their employees and need to put out the store policy the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers who tried to steal and lie
bad,Walmart takes advantage of the fact that its employees often have no where else to turn to. Walmart is all they can get and is all they have ever known. That is how they can afford to pay such ridiculous wages.
bad,"A typical day as an overnight manager with Walmart was going into work at 8:30 P.M.  and leaving at 9:00 A.M..  During this time the jobs performed were meeting with the Co-managers to set up the line up for the night of stocking the store for the next business day.  Had to ensure the unloading team was completing the process of unloading the trucks and cleaning the backroom for the overnight IMS team.  Had to ensure the IMS team was performing the pick and bin process to complete a 100% score by the end of the night.  Utilized the stocking associate on the sales floor to work in an area most needed.  Applied policy and procedure when needed to ensure the associates had a clean, safe and meaningful environment to work in.  We use a certain type of equipment to perform a number of duties with and at the begining of the night before the associates arrive, I would round up the proper equipment so there was enough to use during the overnight schedule."
bad,"The job it self is pretty easy and does not require much thought. Management is definitely an area Walmart needs to review and make stronger. Management shows favoritism to employees with seniority.  My coworkers who have 1 or more years under their belt do little to no work in my department and is left for the new employees to pick up the slack. Three of my coworkers in my department have great work ethics and i believe if management is not changed Walmart will be without some great working employees. My day to day tasks are cleaning, preparing deli platters and party trays as well as cook the assorted foods on the hot bar, and last but not least serve customers, some great others not so much. I really dont have a hardest part of the job but preparing the food and interacting with customers makes my day. I love my regular customers and i love the conversations i have with all the different people."
bad,"Let me start out by saying the absolute most rewarding part of my job was to help customers going above and beyond to help. I have learned alot i started small and worked my way up i like to learn how all parts work. However, it isn't a long time career looking for a company i could retire with."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart consist of helping customers establish a line of credit  with our Walmart credit card, also I assist customers through check out and help with customers complaints and questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide for my family each day I am blessed to have a job."
bad,"Working conditions were heinous to say the least. The company has a knack for training you for a position for 1 - 2 days after stating that training will last 2 weeks, throwing you to the wolves, and, then, yelling at you for not being able to perform the job you weren't properly trained for. Furthermore, regardless of state labor laws, they feel they have the right to terminate your employment for whatever reason they deem necessary. My reason was due to illness, which, in my state, isn't a viable reason for termination. Unfortunately, my state is considered a right to work state meaning I couldn't sue for wrongful termination. Don't you just love when a major conglomerate gets to practice tyranny freely and get away with it."
bad,"A typical day at works was doing all the jobs from the previous day or shift that no one did because they didn't feel like it or because there was too much work for the amount of people scheduled.  Most  of the employees were good honest workers but they would give up trying after a couple months because management made stupid decisions that made everyday harder than it needed to be.  The management all the way up to the regional level would stab you in the back and make you look stupid just to make a single customer happy, even if that customer was a criminal or clearly wrong in what they were doing.  They never had your back and would lie to you about things as important as your benefits for the company and there was a criminal amount of favoritism used among them.  The hardest part of the job was doing all you could to be a good worker and show off your skills only to find that no matter what you did or who was watching you do it you would NEVER getting recognized for it."
bad,"I worked all kinds of hours, one day going in at 6am then the next day closing. I've learned a lot of things. Some managers are ok to work with while others are moody. Most of my coworkers were ok to work with. Some were flat out rude. Management wont do anything if you have an issue with another employee."
bad,Great company to work for although I would love for them to take more pride in their employees and the general operation of the store.
bad,"This particular Wal-Mart would be a great place to work If it wasn't for the managers. They are unprofessional, they are not straight forward and stutter. If a manager does not like you he will threaten your job."
bad,"O local de trabalho não é agradavél para trabalhar, muito quente e não possui sistema de ar condicionado."
bad,"Managment, they will not let you move up in the company. managment does not care about thier workers.They smile in your face but they really think of you as just a worker bee and nothing else.  You learn how to, be rude to one other, how to accept rudeness from managment, and then run a cash register.  Stock shelfs, unload a truck. Bake bread, pack bread, and deli stuff."
bad,Working 6-10 hours at a time w/o break. Never getting off on time. Management picks favorites.
bad,"A typical work day includes cleaning, stocking, and basically doing whatever they asked so you would not get fired. Managers are disrespectful."
bad,"Modern Day Sweat Shop in the USA.Your working for pennies "
bad,"While it is beneficial to work for the largest retailer in the world there is a constant air of tension as reorganizations constantly take place, time is monitored close and they are an extremely frugal company. I would suggest buying their stock instead of applying to work for them."
bad,Your day consists of working in numerous departments and being held accountable for peers actions
bad,"I have worked at wal-mart for a total of about 3 years, I have seen favoritism and some very shady things going on around the place. management is a joke! You ask them something they don't know the answer. While working as a department Manager, I was told I was stupid and didn't know what I was doing. Even after I had a great inventory. They are easy to hire/get a job with so when I was down on luck and needed a job. I went back, then I remembered why I left. They pay their employee's next to nothing and expect you to do a lot more than your job description entails."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. Mean and unprofessional employees, grumpy customers from long wait times due to lack of proper training."
bad,"you dont get your brakes at the time you are suppost too"
bad,A typical day would include providing customer service for customers.  Customers come first and in many ways the employees come second.
bad,Most enjoyable part about this place is some of the associates.  They are very willing to help in other departments.
bad,This store is a sinking ship and you should avoid it at all costs
bad,"Sometimes I will come in and have to work 2 sometimes 3 departments at a time, on top of balancing my breaks as well as the co- workers breaks that I work with. I enjoy working with some of my co- workers because we can come together as a team and get the job done. the hardest part about the job is having to be in 3 different places at one time and having to keep every customer happy. The thing I enjoy about my job the most is the relationship that i can create with the customers. I enjoy helping the customers with projects and giving them ideas that can help them."
bad,Its what you think it will be. Management are good people who are run to the ground making it hard to work there. The pay is ridiculously low for how much the company profits and sets a tone of greed on the companies behalf and a lack of worth for yourself working there. The best part is helping the customers. The worst part is knowing that you work for one of the biggest GREEDIEST companies in the world who don't care about their employees.
bad,llegar checar tus pendientes y cambios de precios se aprende mucho disiplina debido a la presion poca gente sacar el trabajo de cuatro siendo dos el ambiente es cordial de tu compañerismo bueno siendo que a veces aportas ideas y no te toman en cuenta no valoran tu trabajo quieren que des todo das horas extras veladas aun no logras ni aumento si pasa eso muy bajo
bad,The company is great for college students or retired people to work on the side but overall its a terrible place to work.
bad,"was threatened with a write up if i talked bad about the company with a new employee. A man was written up because when he had a seizure he lost control of his vehicle. i was written up when i asked for aid from a wound caused by a splinter.  days missed with a doctors excuse will still get you written up.  "
bad,Don't really have a typical day were are so understaffed I work at least 3 positions a day everyday is different. The most useful things I learned working here would be driving the equipment and getting use to using the machines. Management is not the most honest crew/ nicest. Most people I work with go above and beyond what is expected because knowing when one person slacks we all pick up the work. The hardest part of my job is completing it by working safe we do not have enough space to work so some things don't get done because if they were to it would be unsafe. Most enjoyable thing would be driving the forklift to unload trucks and seeing the customer truly grateful that you helped them the best/fastest way possible.
bad,"Over worked and underpaid. Managment picks who they like according to who can brown nose the best."
bad,Falta mucho compromiso de los altos ejecutivos para apoyar a la gente que trabaja honestamente y no premiar a la gente deshonesta.
bad,"pull freight,stock shelves,work with others rotate stock,working in freezer,going home."
bad,My overall experience was great but there are some improvement the management need to work on  there communication skills.
bad,every thing was good working for this company. I enjoyed working with every one that I worked with or for
bad,"One thing that is good about walmart is that they will generally work with you if you are in school or have other commitments. However, morale is very low and the general consensus is that most employees hate their jobs."
bad,"Hours were inflexible, management was unwilling to work with the associates, many coworkers were incompetent and/or unwilling to do their job, customers often took advantage of the associates, hours were unreliable and associates were rarely given enough to survive on"
bad,Good first job for teen but not so good for anyone with family or anyone with a busy schedule. NOT FLEXIBLE
bad,"As most of us already know by now, Walmart is not a pleasant place to work. It is true that they do not treat their employees fairly. For one, there is a lot of age discrimination that goes on."
bad,"I feel Walmart can be a better company. What I mean is not all Walmart are the same , but the one I worked at was not good to employees or customers."
bad,They do not work well with family life at all.They are very hard to work with when it comes to appointments and picking up your children. Also their requirements for benefits are not very reasonable.
bad,the management team became more worried about themselves. they made it difficult to try and be there for your family if needed.
bad,"Wal-mart as a whole is the worst company to work for!"
bad,"Not a good company, they cut hours, wont actually try to advance you and your pretty much stuck in less than management unless you have a degree"
bad,Good place to work pays good very heavy lifting required... it's a fast pace job always on the go. People that work there are very nice and good people to be around
bad,Overall to sum up my experiences while employed at Wal-Mart was a upper management structure that poorly manage the 'hourly associates' which is everyone else. We were so poorly trained that grand opening day wwas almost epic failure due to all associates spread through every department had ran into same issue - under trained - not equipped w right tools for duties to b performed effectively.
bad,"A typical work day is the feeling of being stuck"
bad,"Over night shift as a stocker to keep the shelves full, sometime went into the back and help sort out the carts into the isles to be put up onto the shelves"
bad,"my work includes maintaining  the store needs which often takes me to working in multiple departments."
bad,Wal mart has a high turn over rate mainly due to them terminating every employee who calls in sick even once
bad,"The store did not know what they were doing, they picked favorites they would not allow us to become full-time status so we could not make a career out of it. hardly any chances of promotion's or raises"
bad,mas o menos el trato mucho mal educado y con un caracter los jefes por eso renuncie
bad,company sucks to work for not enough people to run countours or stock
bad,very easy line of work and performance. customers care is all the vibrant is needed
bad,"way over managed, their open door policy is ridiculous, if you say something to management it is spread to the rest of the store within an hour, very low pay for the amount of work that needs to be done each day"
bad,"Job sucked over all Never got help when i asked management, I was the only one doing my job. I get yelled at for doing what i was supposed to be doing and i got yelled at for not having help"
bad,Terrible company to work for. They don't care about they're associates. I wouldnt advise working here.
bad,not a good place to work they don't give any overtime and when they ask u to work over they make u kill the overtime later in the week
bad,"I worked for Walmarts and do not recomand this company if you are looking to advance, They work you very Hard and pay you very little. The Mangament have there favorites employees and if you are not one you do not get hours"
bad,"They work you hard,give you 2 breaks and a lunch and thats about it. Most co-workers hated their jobs. Lucky for me my job was only temporary/seasonal."
bad,push carts for 4 hours take one hour lunch push more carts. job was outside manager was inside all day so they had now idea what work was being done left position under staffed for months
bad,"Fast paced"
bad,While I have heard Walmart has excellent benefits this seems to be limited. The discounts are extremely small amounts. Also the workplace is filthy. There were cracks and mold every where and dead bugs in the fruit bins. The management and the team members are very rude and no one takes action to fix anything.
bad,"There are many inconsistencies with policies and protocol. One of the basic beliefs that is mentioned during their orientation is Respect for the Individual, and there is none. As a result, the moral of the store is not good at all."
bad,Being a courtesy associate was a pretty lackluster job. Management was rather pushy and very cut throat. This company has to many chiefs and not enough Indians. 
bad,"The department I worked in began to go downhill the past two-three months before I finally quit after 8 years of employment at Wal-Mart. I felt management began to lose the ability to effectively communicate and work as a team with employees and problem solve, my department was very understaffed, especially during busy hours and weekends, and the employees were too over-worked and stressed out. I have been a college student for a long time and I take school very seriously. I cannot work past 10PM on Sundays due to my school schedule. I felt as if I was forced to work over-time on Sundays due to the horrible under-staffing and lack of concern or communication from management. As a result, I began to fall behind in one of my classes. I held a meeting with my store manager twice about the problem with overtime on Sundays and the under-staffing, and felt most of my questions and concerns went unsolved. I resigned after the second meeting in order to improve my grade. Quitting my long-time employment at Walmart was a hard, painful decision, and a huge risk because I need a job to help pay for school, but after weighing the pros and cons of working at Walmart, the cons outweighed the pros. "
bad,"I was very ashamed working here. None of the managers truly helped in traing. You could over hear the main bosses discuss personal ""sexual"" experiances in front of customers. I was happy to quit and move."
bad,"walmart is always walmart   Management not, to many members of management and not enough workers to do the jobs they want"
bad,"a normal day goes by everyone being given a specific duty to perform,i have learned that all are very helpful to each other ,the manegement is also helpful and ready to guide ,the coworkers r realy fun to work with,the hardest part of work is when you work the whole day without saying a single word ,the most enjoyable part of the job is the group work n helping each other..."
bad,"My job was very high-stress. Unfortunately, they never had enough employees to do the jobs they expected us to do. While I was promoted several times, I also witnessed many associates who deserved to be promoted get passed over time and time again. Our particular store had a problem with favortism among the management team."
bad,Hardest part of the job was when you would be the only person working. Left to do customer service and the work on peoples vehicles. Schedules were never set hardly had a weekend off. If you look at the reviews for store #199 they are very poor. probably has to be the worst job experience I have ever had.
bad,"hours vary,good breaks, work too hard for how much they pay."
bad,"A typical day for me was running about 7 departments with limited help on some days,it was stressful but the friends I have made in the 17 years I was there made it fun to go to work.The managment team was horrible,they did nothing to help anyone,your supposed to have managers to back us up,you didnt get that at walmart."
bad,A typical day consisted of working freight received from trucks. Management often seemed disorganized and lacked communication to employees and other managers. The hardest part of the job was to work 10+ pallets of freight and maintain a clean area within the time frame given.
bad,"I worked over 72 hours a week and barely saw my family. It was diffilcult but was a good first job and taught me a great deal about managing people, the importance work-life balance and myself."
bad,"The work was not hard, and it was very productive which is a plus. The downside is the management. I acquired tendonitis from riding four wheelers and told management about it. At the time they had me working in water which is the heaviest department, and out of all of the departments that I have and was qualified to stock, they said they had to keep me in water; therefore, I was forced to quit due to the pain."
bad,I am writing this because THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD....
bad,I did way too much to be just a cashier and didn't get paid for it other then that I came to work everyday with a smile on my face awaiting the next person I can make smile I enjoyed my job.
bad,If you are looking for a professional environment ..Then this is not the place to work
bad,The management was over powering and not concerned about my family.
bad,not a good place to work felt like high school mangers were very confused about nightly task
bad,Walmart management doesn't take enough time to work one on one with their employers. They pick favorites and based upon that is how your scheduling/moving up is picked. I personally was fired because my grandmother was hospitalized in Dallas. I called in and talked personally to a manager who excused my absence. A WHOLE MONTH later I was called into the office and fired for that being 'to many call offs in three months' I had not called off again after my grandmothers hospitalization. So why did i get fired a month later?! I loved my co-workers. But not management. I did learn my lesson about calling off though. and regret doing it. But it made no since firing me a month later.
bad,I learned a great many things while working at Wal-Mart. I learned how to be a manager and how to coordinate a team of people and allocate a pool of resources effectively to get the job done as efficiently as possible. It was always difficult to move up in the company as the store manager's friends almost always had first shot and the interview process.
bad,did not like how the managers treated their employees. i loved the employees and the HR process was very quiet and effective.
bad,"The typical work day would include providing customer service;scaning items, and stocking."
bad,empresa com pouca dificuldade de reconhecer o funcionario que tem.
bad,"A typical day at walmart would be counting cash at start of shift,counting all jewellry, being courtious and friendly to customers,co workers were easy to get along with,if slow in your own dept. help out others in their depts."
bad,"assist inbound customers of Sprint/Nextel cellphone carriers with day to day troubleshooting, billing error and payments. Wasnt a job i was comfortable in or even overly confident that i was truely helping people."
bad,"You are just a number here. No amount of name tags, ""pizza parties"", or pins of appreciation can cover up the abuse and forced gratefulness Walmart issues to their workers. You are nothing but another cog that can be easily replaced by this company."
bad,My job was easy and I was in charge of a great group of guys. We mainly unloaded trucks all day and moved the merchandise to the sales floor. Management love to pass off their workload to us since we can finish our work early.
bad,"Me gusta el trato con la gente, me gustaba llegar a mi caja y atender a la clientela, pero llegaba el jefe de cajas y todo era un caos, mucho stres, gritos frecuentes, clientes inconformes y la gerencia no daba soluciones a los problemas."
bad,"I would never work for a company like this again. There is too much pushing and pulling of you in every direction. You try to take initiative and focus on the tasks that you need to have done bu the end of your 8 hour work day, but it was always impossible to finish your tasks because everyone was telling you that you had to work on other things first. You would get pulled out of your department on a daily basis to go be the door greeter,cashier,or help other departments stock or straighten there areas."
bad,"I am in clocked in, walk up front to the cash register that i was assigned that day, ring the customers up for my shift, then i clock out. I learned how to work cash resgisters very well now. The management was so big i really didn't know who to ask certain questions too. Co-workers are nice but keep to selves and do their shift. There really its a hard part to this job. Most enjoyable is meeting new people everyday."
bad,"No respetan los tiempos libres fuera del trabajo, y efectúan persecución laboral fuera del mismo. No cumplen con las promesas de valores, ética y la supuesta cultura y políticas de la Compañia."
bad,it was fun working with the people at wal marty but it was also scary because management does noting when the homless are threating you or trying to follow you to your car
bad,Management does not care about employees and it is made known. Coworkers were alright but many of them quit before I had much of a chance to talk to them. Working at different locations did not make much of a difference as far as ethics and management is concerned.
bad,The only thing walmart cares about is making money they do not care about their employees. Loyalty to them means nothing.
bad,"I recently relocated from a Wal-mart store in Upstae New York to a facility in Greensboro, North carolina due to a divorce. Unfortunately I just don't enjoy being in that facility the managers have a lot to learn as to respecting the individual especially when Wal-mart is ""suppose to be based upon a family environment for its employees. When I arrived at this facility, I thought someone had reinstated slavery. I had to step down in my previous position because the store manager claimed he didn't have any higher managerial positions open at the time which he was being totally dishonest. I could offer a lot to the management team at the store but I don't want to step on anyone's toes. I'd rather take my skills to another place of business where they are appreciated and people are not intimidated by them."
bad,I worked there for four years at first it was ok the alot of problems developed as to not having enough staff to run my departments correctly managment really didnt seem to care to much
bad,"This company started as a dream, of a man who had a great idea"
bad,"When you start your shift you are busy, either 10 or 12 hour shift, either receiving, tranferring pallets orderfilling, conveyers, shipping. Some management will listen to your ideas, some don't care. Some co-workers will stop and help, others won't and some management turn the other cheek and act like they didn't see anything. During the summer it is hot and in the winter it is cold( during the summer you can wear shorts no more than 6 inches above the knees) the weather( hot or cold) is the hardest part of the job."
bad,Over 50 plus cashiers making show they had what they needed to do their job. Making sure they take their lunches and breaks on time.
bad,"typical workday is your given a to-do list that will change every hour.As the management team gives you notes to do in the huddle meeting, as soon as they walk away they call you on the walkie and the priorites begin shifting.This continues till you go home."
bad,"My typical day is when I get in find my coworker and get the keys, Help customers, receiving, put away items, Hunting/Fishing licence.Helped in other departments,turned in keys. I enjoyed helping the customers and leaving feeling that I accomplished something."
bad,It was very good place to work as everyting works perfect no discrimination
bad,"A okay place to work if you are looking for a second part time job or a first job for those just graduating, but not if you are knowledgeable about the business and want to seek a career."
bad,When you ask to check the receipt if the are stealing they go off on you yelling as loud as they can out the door for a diversion tactic. It’s very hard when your nice to everyone and they call you all kinds of names and are horrible people that have a problem stealing all the time and blame you if you catch them
bad,Poor management experience  with the associates that don’t Care about them just there for the benefits and the money.the discount was ok on buying thing
bad,They will throw you under the bus without a second thought and won't care if u have a family to support. Even thought I did my best witch was more then my supervisor could do I still was let of because of her not wanting to get fired.
bad,Loved getting to interact with customers everyday but management was horrible. Which made the work place not so pleasent. Working in a fast pace environment was also pleasent as well.
bad,Instead of proper training or looking for other ways to train employee or even transfering to another department they would rather let you go!very cut throat!
bad,Do not make this as a career they cut hours and don’t care about you ! Apply if your out of high school to get your feet wet and get some cash. Other then that your just wasting your time here.
bad,le gerant coupe des heures plusieurs personne demandait des heures et il voulait pas en donner
bad,If your not apart of the close family or friends your not moving up in the company plus there is a huge huge homophobia vibe there. The managers pick favourites and they don't know what they are doing half the time you'll see other regular associates doing their job. They do not communicate well with each other. If you file a complaint or say anything there is retaliation.
bad,"I guess Walmart would be a good company to work for. If you are in with the assistant managers and you’ll do great, but if they don’t like you they will tag you."
bad,Management is a joke on every level. Area managers are internally promoted hourlys with no managerial or leadership skills what so ever. That same trend continues to the top. Insanely high turnover by those who are competent.
bad,I don't advise anybody working for this company unless you are desperate for a job. Customers and employees are rude managers are unrealistic. Wal-Mart piles the work on you. The attendence policy is no good.
bad,Management at the store is horrible there is no team effort they don’t have any compassion for the employees at all go to work got to be hard but I went
bad,"I loved what I did at Walmart, but it’s become too focused on making money instead of making it’s employees and customers happy.  Management was not encouraging of new ideas, nor willing to listen to their employees opinions.  They rarely ever hired anyone in full time so that they could get away without paying benefits and made it a nightmare to work for."
bad,"Depending on the store, you're not always going to do what you're suppose to, expect to do other people's job. The stress isn't really worth the pay, mainly because your job depends so much on other people's work from other shifts."
bad,I highly recommend to NEVER get a job at Walmart Charlottetown as they treat you like a number not a person. Terrible management that scream at you in front of customers. Management target certain people and have it out for them. Absolutely ridiculous! Worked for 4 years and staff being hired when I was leaving were making at least $0.50 more an hour than I was. Asked for a raise and was denied due to a manager screaming at me and I stood up for myself. I was the one to get in trouble but she did not.
bad,"A typical day consists of preparing and condensing freight for stocking. I assist management with preparing feature displays, assisting customers with their shopping needs."
bad,Over the course of two years I had gone threw 12 managers. Some of with would pile so much work onto just a few of us and still be upset on how much we did or didn’t get done. The rules were enforced to a select few. Managers took credit for the work of other associates. They would tell you if you changed your schedule they couldn’t give you any hours but always complained of being short staffed. Would never give you days off you needed for doctors appointments and such. But with all the pressure from above we as a team became better friends
bad,Bottom dollar is all that matters. No work life balance. Policy changes fast and not in the best interest of the associates. More work is always created but fewer people to actually do the work.
bad,"They don't care about our family.  They don't accept No  doctor  excuses.  They want you to work sick. If you have to take some one to the emergency room,  its unexcused."
bad,"Id advise you have a very strong head , If your have children secure a sitter , expect change in schedule , remember to communicate. You must be prompt , on time , stay in motion to get though the day ."
bad,Managers care more about customer satisfaction than they do for the people who are meant to take care of the customers. My old store was great but this one is ridiculous
bad,"I was very upset to get this job I had such high hopes for working here.. the work itself was great, it keeps you busy and before you know it your shifts over ! But sadly the corporation has to many employees to really keep track of each one and make sure they have the proper training. I asked several managers for proper training and finally was fed up of being talked down to because I either “needed to hurry up” or “I didn’t know what I was doing” and  finally spoke to the store manager I explained to him what my situation was he said he “doesn’t know how they let me slip through the cracks” and fired me after 1 1/2 weeks."
bad,Walmart expects you to work. And by work I mean do your job and most of everyone else’s jobs if you’re a good worker. Unfortunately they take advantage of good employees over and over again until they get fed up and quit! The policies are questionable and you can be sexually harassed and report it but the person who harassed you gets a promotion into a management position. Oh you can also get hurt (as in breaking a toe) get told to clock out and then get an absence point for it!
bad,Managers were rude disrespectful didn’t care about your home life if you had sick kids or if you were sick. They spoke to you any kind of way. They switched schedules without us knowing and wouldn’t let us take our breaks when we were supposed to.
bad,A lot of favoritism. Lots of people get away with a lot of things while other people who bust their butt get in trouble for every little thing. Too much of a hassle.
bad,You have a great pay  great compensation for working hard  and getting your orders done as fast as you can management is so unfair and unprofessional  they have their favorites and everyone else is treated unfairly
bad,They will let anyone be a manager even if they are horrible at interactions with their workers. Hardworkers never get praised or rewarded but they lazy kiss a** people do. They are cutting positions like crazy and taking this opportunity in every store to put more useless people in higher roles with more power then they need. Basically taking people out of their position and smacking a new name on it. Dont work here unless you absolutely have too.
bad,"While pay and benefits are overall nice, the management--assistant and up--is often problematic. They show blatant favoritism, retaliatory demeanor and often ignore hourly associates' input. Getting the daily job done is a struggle because of management interference and in some cases, incompetence."
bad,"Management SUCKS👎👎👎. Yes the pay has increased, but they( Assistant Managers)do not recognize good employees... Favoritism is real, for the employee's that call out and for the employee's that don't DO WORK."
bad,The old manager there didn’t respect is employees. He also didn’t follow the rules. He played favoritisms with some of his employees. Everything else was okay
bad,Wouldn't recommend working here. not the friendliest unpper management some supervisors vewi employs as children and belittle employees into feeling as if the company is more important then your personal life and health
bad,"While I was working on a customer's car, I slipped and fell down a ladder while climbing down into the oil pit. I reported the accident to an Assistant Manager, and he proceeded to tell me to report it to my manager that was off work at the time of me falling and my manager was off work the next day. I took that same day off work and came back to work the following day."
bad,"Walmart was difficult to work for long term. There were many mangers and no that many co-workers. We worked long hours and we worked hard. The company is very hard to please. You'll sell your soul to them, but they will pay you nicely for it's use."
bad,Management does not show internet in making sure it’s associates are valued. I found it very difficult to speak with an assistant manager about issues
bad,Very slow and was not excited to be there since no one wanted to get up and work. Managers were no help. Needs a lot of work to be more efficient. The OGP department needs a lot of help.
bad,I was being harassed by an assistant manager and when I talked to the store manager about it the assistant manager that was harassing me started cutting my hours and following me around
bad,"It was good at the beginning, they really don't care about their employers, they don't except doctors excuses, I was fired for missing 5 days in 6 months, developed a heart condition and had doctors appointment which they wouldn't accept"
bad,"Has become a social justice warrior haven. Many of the new managers lack skill, but are full of idealism. Been in a store lately you see how that has worked out."
bad,"I love working at Walmart the only thing (and it’s a big thing to me) that I absolutely hate is our management, they sit on their phones all day and yell at us to get grocery done when we are understaffed. And they are all around disrespectful, accusing workers of lying about stocking the shelves and doing top stock, No one of my team feels appreciated and hates coming to work dreading having a manager or supervisor who is lazy and mean. I have been with the company for a a under a month and have been on the floor for 3 days straight and every single day was a bad experience. I will be quitting soon because I have tried to put up with it but I can’t. And talking to someone above management wouldn’t do any good either. I don’t recommend working as a stocker at Walmart unless you have good managers and supervisors."
bad,After many many years I still have to have two jobs just to live. New people come in making as much as I do. It's extremely frustrating. Working with people making them laugh or smile does help me from leaving.
bad,Home office is straight up stupid.  If I find a new job will not go back unless I have to!   Walmart recently switch to day stocking and it is a freaking nightmare.
bad,"Si vous osez leur dire que vous êtes malade, il vous envoie illico à l'urgence de l'hôpital sous peine de sanction ou de renvoie. "
bad,"As an employee, they convince you that if you leave, there is no where else that will pay as well. It can scare a lot of people, but there are other jobs. As a manager they train you to treat people this way. They raise the wages and cut the hours and staffing."
bad,"The management doesn’t really seem to know what they’re doing. They promote people to positions that have no experience in the departments and don’t even train them, and if you’re working by yourself on a busy they won’t send help if you ask them, they just like on more work."
bad,"Management here was extremely abusive & hypocritical. we were placed in slave like conditions no worker should endure. You unload the trucks in the back witch has very little air flow. My store had very little room, so when people had to make a bail. we would have to stop the truck because it prevented us from moving are pallets. the funny thing is management didn't take that into consideration and still wanted things done in an unreasonable amount of time. It dosent matter how well you do your job they will still put you down about another 10 carts you should of handled."
bad,If your looking for stability it’s not here. If you want to be treated poorly this is the place. Definitely would highly reconsider even thinking of Walmart as an option... not good!
bad,Not a fair job hard work less pay very high turns overs hard on the assoicates workers never say thank you guy for your hard work ill really appericate you
bad,Walmart is undergoing many changes that are affecting not only its employees but it’s clientele as well. Eliminating overnight crew to save money and now going into a program where employees all have to stock during the day pallets all over the store and carts all filled with boxes that have to be worked. Managers are no longer managing even the store manager is on the floor just stocking all day long.
bad,All Walmart cares about is the bottom dollar. I told my manager I wanted Sunday’s off for church and he pretty much shrugged his shoulders. They promise to give you raised and a promotion but it doesn’t happen. When I started here four years ago it was a great company but it’s going down the toilet.
bad,"Not what I had expected from Walmart Supercenter; poor management, underpaid, uneducated about firearms education protection, unaware of safety protocols for employees."
bad,half the time there managers will throw you under the bus whether then take responsibility themselves and there all among the largest hypocrites ive ever worked for
bad,Once was a great company. Great  place to work .at one time but somewhere  down the line we forgot the Walmart  culture. And we become  more about  Fear mongering
bad,poor management rough to work there was good to work for once now its awful. they need to to get better with things. a cruel joke its turned into its just really really awful
bad,"Management has a bad reputation for lying to their employees, expect too much of their employees, hardly any employees, 1 person had on average to carry 3-4 people’s workload, never got any praise or compliments, managers always looked down on their employees and talked to them like they are young kids"
bad,Some managers that werent over you acted like your boss when they did nothing except break the tules they got onto you for and sit around and do nothing
bad,I was fired for something that had already been discussed but they didn't want to listen to my side of what happened. And now I am not rehirable. I strongly disagree with their decision.
bad,unfair treatment of employees with a medical disability. Persons with a disability will be mistreated by management and fellow employees and will be looked down upon for things you aren't able to control. if you don't have a disability its a great place to work.
bad,Management knows less than employees. They can't wait to fire employees for any reason. They hate paying you and forget raises or advancement opportunities
bad,They are inflexible and expect you to make walmart the center if your life with very little in exchange they force you to work overtime it is not optional in the deli
bad,"Get ready to devote your life to Walmart. The pay is excellent but your literally there at times from 8am to 11pm until your done with the sets for the week. Upper mgmt above you,only cares about the 6 figure bonuses they'll receive by screwing you over"
bad,"Had fun working with my friends, and meeting new ppl and becoming fridnds and seeing crazy stuff happen in or out of walmart. Good part time job if your in college."
bad,"Its a job. If you walk into a Walmart and ask someone if they love their job, they will say no. That it's just a job and they have it because they need it. Management is awful and you get written up for every little thing. Even things that are out of your control.  They dont take sexual assault or harrassment seriously either."
bad,"Management,  at all levels, is incompetent. Most  have no experience  or clue when it comes to how to be a boss. Promotions based on who will be the store manager's  lackey , not on ability. Someone who starts out as a cashier or sales associate  can become a payroll or assistant manager without any experience; due to the unbelievable amount of employees (hundreds) and management who simply just quit or go on ""stress leave "" There isn't any on floor training by support or assistant managers. You only learn from fellow employees if they're not  too stressed out  to show you how to do anything. Only training to speak of is the 2 days of computer videos & quizzes on Walmart 's  policies and  procedures. Health and safety videos are helpful but employees don't  follow the training. Lots of unreported ""little accidents "". Benefits are offered to employees after 6 months, but  good luck with getting  any kind of assistance from Personnel/payroll. I waited for over a year to receive mine and had to do it for myself because 4 Assistant managers, payroll manager and Store manager knew absolutely  nothing, were of no help, nor seemed to care."
bad,"Management was horrible and out to get you. You did get to pick your hours once you're hired. The company has a point system for how many times you call out, and are not understanding at all when it comes to employees calling out sick. When I worked here, i had to do my own department managers job."
bad,"It wouldn't be that bad for a place to work if they would hire more competent people but, I guess to do that you would have to be competent yourself. Anything can be a manager there, ever a mushroom."
bad,I didn’t like North Fort Myers Walmart because the manager there is a mean person there should be a person that respect others and they say I miss a lot of days when I didn’t
bad,"Could have been better pay,better ensurance. More raises through out the year better managment that cared about the issues thats where going on in ths store."
bad,Not a great place to work. Associates were great. Management terrible. Management was hard to contact when needed. Associates were friendly and helpful.
bad,Worked for three years. Cool place to work chill. Was able to blaze on break and lunch they were coo about it long as I did my work. Other employees were immature. Favoritisms always. Lot of drama between female coworkers including a tranny. That used to work there who got other employees fired for no reason. It’s cool to work graveyard stocking at Walmart just don’t make friends. Everybody is a snake in the grass.
bad,This is a beneficial place to work if you’re strong enough mentally to handle the verbal abuse that goes on daily. I was hired in a certain department but I have the responsibilities of the support manger. Not sure why but it seems to me that management hires for popularity not who can actually do the job. At least at my store
bad,I always wanted to work at Walmart until I actually started working at Walmart. Management sucks they give u long hours they wont let u advance unless they like you
bad,They dont really care about there employees they are just a number they dont honestly care about there employees or there familys. I know alot of people that would say the samething
bad,Not worth the money they treat you like trash they have you working in the heat don’t give no water at all and just have one cart attendant out there by there yourself Special on super busy day except you to cover two side by yourself  and don’t send any kind help and got the Nerves to tell you can’t go to let not worth it man!! Don’t be a cart attendant
bad,"They do not hold people accountable for thier actions. I got stuck busting my butt, while many of my coworkers and direct supervisor didn't. My direct supervisor came to work stoned almost everyday. I informed her boss and was told they couldn't do anything about even though they could tell. She would come to work and disappear for extended periods of time. It's would of been an excellent job if it wasn't for having to deal with that and the fact of dealing with getting talked to like a dog by some other employees."
bad,"Good things: "
bad,"I work in the maintenance department at a distribution center.  Primary job is lift truck maintenance but also work in refrigerated section at times.  Very little training, you are expected to know how to fix everything perfectly the first time.  I have been in maintenance for many years and never touched a forklift but now I'm expected to be a master mechanic who diagnoses and repairs these trucks like an expert.  This was not explained to me during the interview,  The pay is above average and the hours are decent.  But the favoritism is excessive.  If your manager likes you, you're assigned special projects all day and can goof off with no supervision.  If you are just one of the regular mechanics, you do nothing but PM lift trucks and cold side error chasing.  The cold side is 24 degrees and freezer is 10 below zero.  Nobody wants to work on the cold side.  You are written up for simple mistakes like a bad time punch or not cleaning a lift truck perfectly.  HR is a joke, they say they will help with concerns but when you bring anything to HR's attention, your manager is informed immediately and you will be retaliated against.  I've been there over a year and I'm currently looking for another job.  As soon as I find something close to home I will leave, I'd go now but like everybody else I have bills to pay.  Good thing maintenance jobs are plentiful, shouldn't have to wait too long."
bad,"you get a ton of hours but with being in high school they would book me more then i was capable of working, easy to give away shifts but very poor management . Hard to find managers to speak to anyone. Very little work life balance, overall very draining job with no rewards"
bad,is good to work for the company the only this is the people the are in power their take advantage of the role. U have to be fast in this tipe of work special in the grocery section
bad,Its a good job if your a brown noser..i guess like with any job..you can advance fairly quickly..the easiest job but the most hard on your body is a Cashier..if your good with the public and can stand in one spot for a long period of time..then have at it..i got hurt on the job and they fired me after they thoughtvi had a clean bill of health..wrong! Its sad really..i was faithful to them..oh well..
bad,They didn’t want to take the time to train me they didn’t show me how to do my job properly didn’t show me correctly how to run the machines. I couldn’t do my job correctly because I had to figure how to do most of it on my own thier training videos are worthless.
bad,Job itself isn't bad. Everything about walmart is  Inconsistent. Manager  dont care about their stuff. Care more about make sure the store manager was happy. We were over worked and under  appreciated. Its typical big company.
bad,It could have been just my store but I highly doubt it. They sent me to live in a hotel for 2 months for training with 16-20 other people. NONE of us made it a year. What they teach you for those two months isn't actually followed in the stores and the store managers WILL bully and push you around for it constantly saying you are wrong. HR came to visit me personally twice BECAUSE I WAS TOO CONSIDERATE OF THE EMPLOYEES I OVERSAW. I treated them like people instead of robots.
bad,Management listens but doesn't do anything.  Small problems become major.  There is no accountability so the few associates who work hard do the work of many.
bad,They were very rude and chose favorites! Staff was not good. Not a good manager. Could use some work for sure. I got great benifets but staff needs work.
bad,The management is hard to please. They don’t want to hear it’s impossible just do it. They’ll give you 13 hours work for 1 person then get mad when it’s not completed that day. If injured there and  on light duty they will give you things against your restrictions and expect it to be finished.
bad,"It's the same as working for McDonalds, if your 16, sure, why not? If you plan on working there to pay rent for a couple of months while looking for a real job, go for it."
bad,"Job isn't very hard, at the end of the day every job there is just stocking shelves. You will learn general inventory control and customer service and a lot of hands on training."
bad,"Dont be crazy enough to work at walmart, especially as an assistant manager. They expect the most unreal expectations, 60+ hrs and no appreciation for what you deal with. If you are not a part of the cliche or the buddy system you will get treated like the lowest of low and they will throw you under the bus.  It will constantly be your fault if the market manager drops by and it's a bad visit, you better believe the store mgr or co mgr will not be to blame. The store mgr that I worked under has no respect for the individual and has a ungrateful attitude to his mgmt staff that actually works. The store manager in middlesboro, ky has no knowledge of what he is doing and cant get out of his office or get off his phone putting notes in the note app. He never sees what goes on the salesfloor and comes up with the most unreal expectations. Co mgr there is a total snob and thinks she knows what she is doing but all she does is set in her office with her buddies in the buddy system while everyone else works there butt off."
bad,"Store Managers and higher have unrealistic expectations and dead lines for the lack of help given, they tell you to hold associates accountable for unproductive actions but then scold you for being as harsh on associates as they are on you, excluding the belittlement that they show you. Salary Management can be threatened to work 16-18 hr work days when Store Managers & higher work less than 8 hours daily. They refuse to pay Salary managers OT, and can mandate strenuous work conditions on pregnant associates & Assistant managers. Average hourly rate for an entry level salary manager at Walmart is less than minimum wage, even after bonuses, if you are lucky enough to get one."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for about 5-1/2 years and was never treated well. No matter how hard you worked, it was never enough. Even though it was against store policy, there was a lot of favoritism. They would ask you to work overtime and then before the end of the pay period would force you to cut your overtime."
bad,"Ineffective and inexperienced managers. Management does not stay on the  company programs. This problem is company wide. There is a huge focus on minimum inventory levels to save money company wide. Because management does not adhere to programs the result is constant out of stocks and upset customers!!! The company culture knows the customer will be inconvenienced but believes they will learn to deal with it!! Anyone trying to run the programs correctly is ridiculed--I was a trainer and experienced this first hand!! As a result , employee moral is always low. Daily pep talks are the norm .  Compensation, --time off--insurance--sick time are near competitive but always changing. Usually the employee gets the short end of the stick when there is a change.   Bottom line===NO leadership at store levels, poor company culture,terrible customer service. If you are a "" YES MAN""  this is the job for you. I did meet many people from all walks of life. My daily interaction with them made the job tolerable. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing people under my supervision get promoted!  I personally chose to be passed over for promotion on several occasions. My personal reviews were ""ALWAYS"" excelled in performance."
bad,"Good starting job but not a fair starting job."
bad,"I have worked for unfair people and companies but by far Walmart is the worst ! Changing shifts without us knowing, unfair and hostile work environment. i threw every truck from my hire date till i left. i asked for numerous breaks and was told i was one of the better truck guys; so that is why i got worked harder. FYI if they cant do the job they were hired for then fire them. Then maybe you will be able to retain good employees."
bad,It’s very favoritisms on how everything is done in the pharmacy especially with scheduling. I’m the part time person and I close every night and I’m scheduled daily.
bad,"Treat employees like animals. No sympathy for employees doing emergencies. You have to do triple work with no help. Managers are selfish, they watch you slave without offering help"
bad,If you work for one department you will always get pulled to another. Your expected to finish your job in a few hours which is hard but you'll find ways to make it work.
bad,"I started working in Walmart about 2 weeks ago but, unfortunately I have to put in my 2 weeks notice because I need  35 hours a week as I have ADULT BILLS ."
bad,Dont work here. The company has a cult mentality. Only as a Last Ditch effort.  There are SOME Good people.  The lack of communication from management is unbelievable.
bad,"The good money is not worth it. You're just a work horse who will will do hard work for a company that doesn't really appreciate it. Management has no idea what employees actually do, and production is a joke. It doesn't matter if the conveyors are down, you'd better make rate."
bad,I dont recommend Walmart to anyone. The company use to be a great company to work for and then they forgot about family. Now it's just about greed. Disrespect with management and too much negativity
bad,"Its a great place to work as a cashier.  Till the management started to count items not scanned.  If I missed total of 7 items miss scanned I will be terminated.  How stressful is my job now?  Very stressful place to work.  So If I have 1 more miss scan within 1 year,  I will get fired .   Wow."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with. I did not like the people who wouldn't let me off work for a surgery and ""let me go"" because I had to have it. I would have stayed. I wanted to stay on. I had no problem with my hours. I had no problem with one of my managers. The other manager was not understanding about my pain level and the surgery I needed."
bad,"Tenho 53 anos , trabalhei por 3 meses , pois já havia trabalhado  supermercado por 15 anos seguidos, me surpreendi por uma gerente pegar no meu pé e achar que eu estava me fazendo para fazer as coisas,imagina eu ter 16"
bad,When I enjoyed my crew and some of the other people at Walmart but the manager and upper management where not very kind people but I enjoyed my job besides the managers
bad,Very little to no training is given. The first day I got there they expected me to know everything just because I wasted 2 days of my time sitting on a computer doing an orientation. The managers abuse their employees and give them excessive work shifts. To make it worse I constantly heard them over the radio talking behind the backs of employees who made mistakes. Most employees always seemed miserable and now I know why. Please don’t work here.
bad,My first day on the job the manager in charge of me told me nothing of my job except for zoning aisles. For the following two days I searched for her and couldn't find her so all I could do was zone. Luckily on the 4th day I was transferred to the back and told what was expected of me.
bad,"Walmart is a great place for entry level people trying to get their first job, they do (to a point) give a flexible schedule so you can work around family, schooling or whatever else you got in your life. Walmart also has a stock option, a high match for 401k, as well as dental and vision benefits for full time people that is one of the best that a company can offer."
bad,"The work is terrible, the management is worse. Don't get caught taking a second to breath or get a drink. Someone will yell at you. If you wanna be just a number this is the place for you."
bad,My job consist of going in at 4am and scanning the bins on some days putting items on a cart to to worked to the floor. Other days I go in and start working on the carts already made for stocking the floor. Then other days I go in and pull items from the very top of the shelves called top stock and put them in their home on the shelves. The hardest part of my job is we are in the middle of a remodel and I can’t help customers like I need to. becaus
bad,"It had a nice break room with a lot of accommodations for the employees like outlets to charge phones and such. The managers were understanding and relatively easy going, and the customers were sometimes fun to talk to."
bad,They Walmart has become impossible to work for. They cut hours and expect the same amount of work done in 5 and one half hours like you can barely do in 8 hours. I am a very hard worker but they dont recognize that
bad,Depends on which store you want to work for but management controls everything and the store manager at the Westbank store has destroyed store moral and i would never suggest anyone to work at that store .I would never go back. So do your homework and know what your getting into.
bad,"Managers are absolutely trash, got treated like no one else to the extent that i wanted to quit on the spot and eventually did. They treat student different because they all are middle aged and don’t get that injuries and other things come up. Staff are rarely good, trying to make friends there are hard but i was lucky to have 4 very good staff friends. It’s a rough place and not good at all."
bad,"low pay, shady management with people that you have to beg to get your hours from every week. you have to go straight to the head of the store above other managers to get anywhere there."
bad,"You are constantly under pressure about loosing your job. They change things and cause people to loose their jobs which really destroys your family and confidence"
bad,"i was on night shift and it was the worst work experiment I ever had!"
bad,But now it’s difficult to have a family life they have a way to do schedule and lack of associate who make work hard to accomplish Tashk during the day
bad,Poor leadership skills unjustified actions rude management laziness in the work place disrespectful attitude towards employees if you got overtime they made you leave early
bad,"It was a stressful fast-paced job. Cap 2 is the red-headed step-child of walmart as a whole. Expect to be looked down on by all management. Very hard to aadvance from this position because it's impossible to do a ""good"" job. The starting pay is $11 an hour with a 2% raise annually. Their PTO polixy used to be alright but has changed recently to make it much worse. You get 6 call ins' a year and the first 4 cut your quarterly bonus by 25%. The bonus is usually around $300-$500 depending on how good your store is doing. Overall barely pays more than starvation wages and has terrible work culture that pushes number over individual creativity and ability."
bad,20 or less lane as well. I never had time to stock the cigarettes or alcohol or get anything organized because I always was tending to a customer. Pay and benefits were the only pro other than listed
bad,"5 1/2 years I worked there, we close at 1 am now. Being a CSS is not worth it. Way to stressful and management does not care! They work you like a dog and yell at you if you dont get your stuff done even though you're always short staffed and have to help everywhere else. Would not recommend...currently looking for another job."
bad,"I can't fully explain how awful this company is to their workers , it has to be run by degenerates with incredible self worth issues in order to be so mean and vile"
bad,"i work there for eight years ,and i was paid 11$dollars and hour it was like able job when i first started , but it became a little stressful with the bills,and the mangers treat they people like robots."
bad,"Every day had a different expectation"
bad,Benefits are good but pay is okay . And management is really biased . No free lunch. Really cheap company.  No overtime. Sends part timers home after 4 hours every day
bad,"The managers are never on the same page, unless the store managers boss is there, which is more like bullying into conformity. They have unfair expectations, hard workers get punished while the ones who slack off get all the breaks. Constant policy changes are hard to keep up with mainly because of the lack of communication. They stack things in favor of specific departments and punish the departments that are drowning."
bad,"Favoritistas ,  entrometidos en la vida privada , obligan a trabajar turnos dobles , no hay crecimiento"
bad,"The routine is constantly changing and if you aren't on it the second the ""new"" thing drops, you are verbally abused by managers who are quick to tell you that you are replaceable and that they don't ""make enough money to listen to you whine"". They also like to rub in the fact that they make $100k a year with an $80k bonus."
bad,Place is horrible because of the store manger and all the other mangers. Always gotta watch your back. You can move up but only if they like you. So your stuck.
bad,"Management treats you like fast food, youre in one day and out the next, the only good part is the flexible hours and benefits, management does not care at all about the workers, as long as you show up whether youre sick or not they like you"
bad,Its an ok place to work because for a minium..the managers have no respect for you at all they talk to you any kind of way no care in the world for you.
bad,I have worked for this company for 3 years and all I see is more policy changes and scan and go stations and self check out areas. As a result I have been getting more compliments about how good and needed I am. However I don't feel like it's true.
bad,"I promose I am not a disgruntled employee, but alot of things happen at that walmart to me.. And nothing ever got done about it. HR did nothing to help, favored the management employer I complained was harrassing me and discriminating against. But of course nothing got done about it.. But I am not the only Lesbian, to have issues there either. Others have left because they felt the same way. I know nothing will never happen to take care of these issues that has happened... Its sad that they covers their own butts and NOT care about their associates. I'm 37 years old, I have no reason to lie about issues that has gone on behind those closed doors...."
bad,My experience supervising my associates was very satisfying. There is a lot required daily of any associate at Walmart. Without the respect of my associates we would not have exceeded as we did. The garden center thrived in my years of management!
bad,"A typical night for an overnight associate stocking shelves and keeping the environment clean for the next day's business."
bad,a typical day is a stressful day I learned to stay calm at busy and stressful events ithink the management could improve the work place culture is not too bad hardest part of my job is being nice to rude customers
bad,Since walmart changed their rules it has been difficult to work there. I enjoyed the work but the pay was not very good for someone that wants to change positions.
bad,"Walmart has changed everything trying to compete with Amazon. They tell you its not the same Walmart  as they are disciplining everyone for doing their jobs too slow, and firing the old hands to hire cheaper labor in their places. Sad place to work when you can't count on having a job from day to day."
bad,Walmart has a poor management system. If something happens and you need to take off and you don't have enough protected PTO time you will receive a point. And you have to be employed with Walmart for over 2 years just to receive paid time off sick time and vacation time.
bad,Management sucks at the Paducah location. The managers switch every week it seems like. All of management is in competition and talk bad about employees. Worst experience ever. Feel bad for that to be someone’s first job. They run around with their heads chopped off running the place horribly. Full of mediocrity!!! I think anyone could have a manager job there or supervisor definitely
bad,"I’ve worked at 2 Walmart’s & 3 different positions throughout the entire 3 years i’ve been there. The first one in Neenah, WI was a better experience than the one on South 27th in Milwaukee, WI. I worked as a cashier at the Walmart in Neenah which was a good experience. Some customers were rude but it was manageable. The managers were responsive & attentive. They had good manners & a few were easy to go to about problems. I was sure that if something was bothering me it would be dealt with. As far as the Walmart in Milwaukee.. the total opposite. I worked as a cap 1 & overnight associate at that Walmart. Terrible management, poor language use, not one inch of professionalism even with the management. Shift duties were inconsistent & always a complaint about something. Nothing was ever good enough even if it was my best & I’m not a lazy worker. No appreciation whatsoever. Favoritism up & down in the store. Rules applied to certain people which were mainly the ones that the managers weren’t “cool” with. Just overall awful when it came to the associates. My experience with customers was no where near the same as it was with management."
bad,"Not enough help and especially during the Holidays."
bad,2017 I have arrived to Walmart and I work for Walmart 3 years it was already working there I work pretty good with the coworkers I worked in different
bad,"Ugh run!!! I applied to be a CSM twice after being there a year and a half...someone who was hired recently got asked if they wanted to do it. No respect for employees, were overworked and I was over it."
bad,"While Walmart pays well,  there are many negatives that make it my last option if I ever needed a job. I was constantly having to pick up the slack for others. I was underappreciated and was often having to cover other people's shifts. I was told I need to do a better job because I didn't clean up a meds in the bathrooms that happened an hour and a half after me shift ended. Managers often  put me on positions I was untrained for and then chastised me for not knowing what to do."
bad,"Job is very fast paced,rate is not obtainable,they will fire you if you do not make rate. I hated it. They take one day and you make over 100% and they say see you can do it but they lie to you."
bad,Would not recommend employment with this company.  Dog eat dog environment. Horrible customers.  Bad pay. Worked there 9 years and made the same pay as a new hire
bad,Despite that training tells you that a vast majority of management is promoted from within it sure doesn't feel like it. If they are they certainly don't seem to remember being regular associates and most cannot even preform the simplest of tasks with any of the equipment. There are cliques and favoritism as if we were still stuck in high school favorites get free passes while people who work themselves to the bones get passed over for everything. Management does not back up their employees in any sense and more often than.not will throw them under the bus.
bad,They need to care for their employees better. Actually listen to their employees. Stop making the employees suffer. Supposed to be  a happy place to work and it definitely isn’t.
bad,I like working as a cashier because it's a fast paced. but always not enough employees and always short handed. long hours and minimum pay. The management is poor.
bad,Walmart as a company itself sucks. They do not care for their Associates like they should. They don't run the store like it should be ran. They'll take advantage of a hard worker and not care how they're doing.
bad,my time with wlamart was a waste of time. not a really a company who invest in there employees. they  are just happy to get the lowest of the lowest an dpay them the bear minimum .
bad,"You get what you expect working at Walmart, one of the largest retail corporations in the U.S. Middle management hold themselves in pretty high regards and can be pretty demanding. Overall not terrible, but it's easy to feel guilty knowing half of your products were produced overseas, likely by underpaid or underfed workers."
bad,Worked for years to try to move up in the company. Management is down grading and ignorant. Have no respect for the employees or their family. Good medical and vision coverage.
bad,"If you want to work here mind your own business and never do more then you can handle, otherwise you be end up doing everything while they stand around and watch."
bad,I have tried twice working here first time I made a mistake leaving everything was good. Now under current manager things went from good to I don't want to be here anymore because I want to have Saturdays to spend with my parents and all they want to give is quarterly and that just won't fly with me and another thing if I wanted to decrease my end time from 11 to 10 I was told the manager said was a deal breaker and I need to leave department for another spot.
bad,"They give bonuses then cut your hours,favor lazy workers,unfriendly staff,low hours,no team players,sometimes don’t get breaks ,I missed A few lunches."
bad,I think the management that I work for was not on the same page with other managers one would tell you something and the next one would come behind them and tell you to do it different I work for him 8 years I was treated right at the time but at the last the new management treaded like I was in confidence didn't know what I was doing and I know better I am a hard worker and very dependable worker had some issues with health I did the best of my ability I would never ever go back to work for Walmart because there's too many chiefs and not enough Indians and everybody wants to take a cut at you core management Squad I call it thank you.
bad,Working at Walmart is not something I would recommend. The main reasons for this is that hard work is usually looked over and an associate will usually have to pick up the slack of the lazier or absent associates. Most of the managers are completely incompetent and listen to little or none of the grievances of the associates.
bad,"It started out pretty good and then it is going in a direction I’m not willing to go. Respect level for drivers is going down "
bad,"Manager has high employee turnover"
bad,"Working as Walmart can be very stressful. They are always understaffed which makes it hard to do your job. Managers are always stressing that certain jobs get done but there isn’t enough time in the day nor enough people to get everything done and done right. There are many days (almost every time I come in) that I have to hurry through the entire department trying to do everything that is asked of me. Communication is also really bad there. "
bad,Very stressful place to work. The management is poor. Schedules are not flexible. Unfair pay. People have bad attitudes. And some people have terrible customer service skills there.
bad,"Worked there almost six years a lot of ups and downs it’s easy work to be honest but the managers can be very disrespectful and show favoritism,I did enjoy meeting some good people but the bad thing is the good people never stay long"
bad,I really enjoyed my job at Walmart but management ruined my experience and Walmart pays well but that’s it. The turnover rate is crazy and it’s less secured than a seasonal job.
bad,I hate walmart and they treat us very poorly. We are treated like slave labor and talked down to. I do not recommend working for this company at all unless you want to go back to your high school years.
bad,Enjoy doing what I do just wish things were better focus on and more relaxed. Love the people and they way I can develop new associates into new roles.
bad,"Lots of favoritism,  not organized,  no leadership. Lack of management. I work there never once got interview for positions to move up they show no respect towards employees without a title ."
bad,there was bq s   and as a worker we wear fast pase.   workers had to pull pallets out of back room put on shelfs and inventory set up endcaps  and displays  price checks and roll backs I worked  the night shift
bad,"I was a sales floor associate in dry groceries for Walmart for two and a half weeks. The bad rumors that you hear about this company’s treatment of their employees is true. Pay is just above minimum wage. There are no benefits, not even an employee discount until you’ve worked there for 3 months. Then it is only 10%. You are responsible for buying your own uniform (blue polos and khaki pants), and I feel like I just came out even buying my uniforms, has to and from work, and lunch each day, because of how low pay is. As one of the richest companies in the world, they are good at helping their employees sign up for government assistance to supplement their low wages. "
bad,"Walmart's not terrible. For customer service, it pays alright. $11 at hiring. The job is easy. Benefits are good, IF you can get full time. There are some people that have been there for 5 years and still haven't made full time, at 40 hours a week. But what kills the job the most, is the management. Management is AWFUL. They use fear and scare tactics on their employees. Lie to them while grooming them for the position they hold, as an example, a department manager grooming you for her job. And then you find out even if he steps down, you won't be getting that position and have to compete with others trying to get it in interviews before you get it and it may not even be at that store. They harass you  by threats of looking at the cameras and watching your every move while you work. And if you have a problem? And use your open door policy? The store managers will slam the door in your face and offer no solution. GO above them? You need recorded proof. You need evidence. Theres no way to solve employee problems unless someone of your pay level attacks you. That's it. It's not a good place to work. Work is solid. Management is the worst I've ever seen. And this is between THREE stores. Also, in three years time with 3 raises under my belt, I'm only making $11.23. You get hired at 11."
bad,Out of the 8 years I worked there  the company has become less about customer service and more about cutting corners for more profit. Management  doesn't seem to care employees safety
bad,always made to feel like any day could be your last day. no matter how hard you worked it was never enough.managers played favorites in every department.
bad,Wal-Mart has a wonder store I've enjoyed working at Wal-Mart I like working as a team but did not have the support scheduling did not match up with the time we needed employee did not have any order I am an order person likes to have things all together I found myself organizing the store. Wal-Mart has very poor managent
bad,what's a good play two words they only seeing what's not good is the benefits
bad,I was not treated very well by management. I was not a very positive experience. I would try to talk to my manger and she would not really care. She picked favorites.
bad,in the beginning Walmart was a good place to work but when all the good upper management left it wasn't the same anymore I been there for five years and you can't trust no one
bad,"É uma empresa ótima,trabalho em equipe excelente,convênio ótimo."
bad,"Complete disregard for running a team until higher ups start to notice, never talks to employees to explain how the department is progressing or what is changing unless it is a company wide change. a lot of disrespectful management that swears, and belittles constantly, very lazy and entitled to the point of procrastinating well all the normal associates do all the work."
bad,"I'm not proud to be a Walmart associate like all the training videos say you should. This place is a MESS. There is no communication so you just have to guess on everything. We are currently in the middle of a remodel and nobody knows where anything is."
bad,Management is all terrible with bad pay and dealing with lots of crabby customer's. People look depressed working there but it's a job. If you want a good place to work don't do retail
bad,Schedules are inconsistent and dont work around time off needed for family care. Worthless associates are not held accountable for actions but hard working associates are takin advantage of.
bad,"My typical day was, ok at first, but when I would start something I was pulled away to do something else. I learned to multi task, the management was very poor, no communication between them or for employees. The hardest part was trying to keep up with what they wanted me to do, because I was told to do something one day and then told to do something else the next. I enjoyed helping customers."
bad,Feels like I'd pulled a ship ashore with my bare hands each night. I was expected to do 14 hours of work in 8 hours or my manager said there would be trouble. Who wouldn't want to work at Walmart.
bad,This job has good benefits only. I learned this place is not what I thought it would be before I started working there.  The hardest part is not having enough cashiers to work the shift when we're super busy.
bad,it was a great place to work they just don't give you enough hours. you come to work one day and work 3 hours than your off for 2 days come back and work another 3 hours and and than they give you 3 days off.
bad,I've been working for Walmart 4 days and since day one I have been harrassed about speeding up my productivity. You have Managers who don't know how to communicate properly and want you to rush the job not understanding that if you rush you're bound to make a mistake. One of the worst company's I've ever worked for.
bad,"It started as a great place to work. Then they started taking everything away. They took away paid holidays, sick time, personal time and deferred holidays. We had profit sharing, which was taken away. We had a good quarterly incentive which is now nearly unattainable. The production rates keep being raised and are now extremely difficult to achieve. They actually attempted to give us less than the state law requires for meal periods by giving less than 20 minutes for first break. They were turned in to the labor department. They returned the 20 minute first break but second break is now about 15 minutes. In place of a pay increase, for two years they gave a bonus. Then two years later they gave an increase but took the bonus away, so we effectively received a pay cut. When they took the sick, personal, holiday and vacation time and turned it all into PTO, they gave us 20 less hours per year. The management is horrendous. Good workers don't receive promotions. Those are given based on how well you can suck up. There are many other reasons to stay away. I can't think of all of them at the moment."
bad,I honestly had the worst experience working as a Walmart cashier. It was a very stressful and dead environment. The managers were all over the place and possessed poor communication skills.
bad,"It was fun at times , stressful Picking up customers items, food and taking it to them at they car's. An make sure we was giving them the right items."
bad,The manager sexually harassed my girlfriend at the time. Whenever I went to tell the proper authorities to take care of it. He just said he willl take care of it. Then they pulled me in the office the next day and terminated me.
bad,"Everything at Walmart is micromanaged by regional and corporate offices, there is no flexibility in this. Management is aloof to concerns that are presented to them."
bad,"Daily operations were kept up by upper management"
bad,I learned how to have patience and how to multitask. It was an easy job for me and i enjoyed working with my co workers. the customers wasn't always nice but i learned how to manage working with them.
bad,"I liked my job and working in surrounding areas. It is a fast paced job, always plenty of work to do , I liked my co-workers, need management to be around more"
bad,The job is easy but management is unfair  and won’t work with you when you run into issues outside of work that are out of your control.  Such as becoming sick and ending up in the hospital.
bad,Being a cashier at this store was stressful every single day. The managers constantly watch you while barely doing their own jobs. Many front end managers were not even qualified for their position. Easy job if you can handle the pressure of getting criticized multiple times for minor mistakes.
bad,Walmart was a terrible place to work and they treated you terribly but atleast you had a job. They would only let certain peaople advance.  No wordsss
bad,"Typical day at work was completing rollbacks,price-changes,assisting customers and floor moves.I learned how to successfully classify merchandise in all departments, price control, inventory items, operate a telxon and locate items throughout the store, stock-room ad trailers.I was promoted out the store to become a project manager. I had the advantage of learning how to remodel, create and reconstruct a new store within a operating store."
bad,"It drained my energy, I'd work the 10-7 night shift and go home in the morning not able to do anything. If you're not cool with the managers, you get in trouble constantly. People are petty there and consistently try to get you in trouble if they don't like you. Managers treat you like peasants. The customers are usually nice though."
bad,Coworkers and managers are for the most part nice but being mentally and emotionally abused by customers everyday is taking a toll on my mental well being.
bad,"Walmart does not seem to have room for advancement in the company even though I have been with the company nearly 4 years. I have trained multiple people at this store including cashiers, who I am not certified at. I have also helped to train multiple managers. The pay structure is not fair either. The shop itself at times is a good place to work, but it is unsafe at other times. I have been electrocuted by a vacuum cleaner and know there are other machines in bad condition."
bad,Management would go in and change schedule with telling you. Cut hours drastically. No advancements opportunity they just switched managers around. Never go back
bad,"Walmart no longer want someone who cares for the customers in the store, if you are not a on line customer you do not manner to Walmart any longer. they feel like customers in there store can not shop any place else."
bad,this is a great place to work . however the management is awful. not of them know what exactly is going on. they are not helpful with schedules and about dealing with your health or personal life
bad,1 hour lunch is nice however mangers are rude and take advantage of some employees while other employees work slow to pass time and do the minimal to get away with their assignments
bad,"My typical day at work is assisting customers find what they are looking for irregardless if it is out of my departments,  cutting fabric, providing information on the products in our departments, assisting them with any sewing issues they may have.  Zoning and straightening out our departments when I have free time etc."
bad,Vastly underpaid; poor management. No follow up from management on written concerns. Broken commitments re very low salary and management review promised.
bad,"Walmart is a steady job for those seeking full time, and good for those looking for a partime job! There are many areas to work in a typical Walmart store, and opportunities to advance."
bad,"My immediate supervisors were phenomenal.  Anything beyond that was a joke. "
bad,"If you are single and like working nights then Walmart is for you. My experience overall was not too bad but not too good. The demanding open availability they want you to have in order just to look at your application is rediculous. Not everyone, especially parents of school age kids can be available from 7am to 11 pm. Not everyones life circumstances are the same. The pay is good though."
bad,Walmart has changed from a family oriented company to no care about family obligations.  It's totally up to your manager whether or not you are able to attend to your family and it's obligations.  The hours can vary from day to day depending on your role and what area  you work in.
bad,"You start your day off finishing the previous shifts work because there is never enough help, this is a continuous vicious cycle."
bad,Ugh I hate it its sucks the work you and expect you to have everything to gather with no time its every man fir them self management does nothing but avoid you
bad,there is a lot of favoritism and they seen to worry about inventory instead customer 1st always short on cashiers and way to many in the back doing nothing
bad,"Management on average doesn't look out for employees, at the location I worked at, there were Alot of relationships between management and employees. Would not recommend working there."
bad,My management at my location was absolutely terrible. I honestly haven't had a worse experience. Not to mention there is no moving around with your position. You are stuck at the same job. My location didn't really offer cashiers the same opportunities because we were short.
bad,The staff hired family and they displayed favoritism. This company hired me as part time only working there. They wanted me to work most weekends and when people called out which was on a regular basis or when they were not giving one of their family members a lot of hours to have a nice paycheck.
bad,Management at the dickson city store is horrible. The longer you work for them the more you are unappreciated. I liked working there in the beginning but as years went by and management changed it wasn't a nice place to work.
bad,"is a good place to work if you are a student, they do not give you a good hours, no enough to pay bills, they just give you around 20 hrs for week. they need to be better for employees"
bad,management shows favoritism and are very unprofessional. may not be the same at all locations. The work for department managers is easy to me. i enjoyed the work if only management would get off your back and let you do what needs to be done.
bad,"The rules change regularly they are inconsistent in enforcing them.  Benefits get cut regularly.  "
bad,Working for walmart has open my eyes. I have worked for two walmart companys and nothing has changed when it comes to  working double shift when you are hired as part time worker. I am hard worker and I am team player but this company needs a lot of change if they want to keep a good worker's.
bad,"Wal Mart and their employees ave a reputation, it's not a good one either. The hours drag and the work is inconstant and so are the expectations. There is little guidance and almost no expectation to succeed."
bad,"Working for this company was a rollercoaster of emotions and hours. The attention from Management on employees was poor however. I was sexually harassed non-stop by another coworker, when brought to the manager's attention I was told ""It's your own fault for doing your makeup so seductively"""
bad,"Of the two years I worked for Walmart not once did I feel respected or cared for in the slightest. I was worth less to them then the dirt on there shoes, they didn't mind working our best employees to the point of quiting, repeatedly. It wasn't rare that multiple associates left per month. Other shifts were never made to do their job, while we were stuck with everything. We were also to blame for everything that went wrong. Not to mention the lack of equipment to get your job done in the first place. There is no place I would recommend working at less that Walmart. Never have I seen such a blatant disregard for human life. I was still treated poorly after returning to work only a few weeks after the death of my father. It was then I decided to move on from Walmart."
bad,"Very inconsistent management...high turnover with managers..each manager changed the work profile and style.  Assistant managers were always afraid for their job and acted out of frustration many time.  Evidently, there was no standard management training or rewards for store atmosphere.   I felt that overall, everyone hated their job and were led to believe that they could find no other work.  If you had any back or neck injury, then you would keep it to yourself for you would be moved out."
bad,"Managements have insufficient training. "
bad,The management is the worst from top to bottom. They can’t even make a schedule to compensate for the customers. People are constantly left by themselves in the deli and bakery and are not even checked up on. They constantly blame the associates without even taking a look at themselves. Worst place I have ever worked.
bad,Working for Walmart is very rewarding and I really enjoy helping others. So many people come into my place of employment because it is one stop shop. I met so many incredible people working there.
bad,"It's a shame because this didn't have to be a bad job; solid coworkers, fair wage, and a nice benefits package. However, upper management will look at and talk to those beneath them (including middle management, and especially hourly associates) like they are less than people, grunts that don't count for anything, and they will set you up to use you as a scapegoat for their own shortcomings. There is zero communication between upper management and the rest of the store, resulting in a disjointed machine that simply doesn't work. Do not work here if you expect to be respected like a human being, or if you expect the possibility of advancement within the company."
bad,"Dept. managers very poorly trained.  Need to keep some things to themselves., talking bad about upper management,and STOP complaining about their workload. Just do it!"
bad,"The problem with Walmart is the high expectations, I was on overnight shift and they literally expected people to do double the work in a small amount of time. In order for a place to be successful everyone has to do their part, every shift is at each others throat about what work never gets completed, and ultimately the blame falls on overnight shift. Management shows favoritism, but this is everywhere. People who deserve promotions never get them because management chose to bypass those who deserve it and look out for those who do little to nothing. There is no equal balance in the work load, most of management feel to high to lift a finger but never to high to give orders."
bad,"High expectations from those who do the most , which I don't mind. But when you put someone by their self mostly likely it's not going too get done. Especially at Walmart."
bad,Walmart is a monster of a corporation. The management team makes it hard to stay and care. They pull you everywhere and don't value family or family time. Poor management and very low morale. Most of the store managers don't even know the associates. Turn over rate is horrible.
bad,They do okay working with a school schedual. Communication with task and plans aren't constant. Hourly workers are not treated fairly or with care of their mental health. Company likes to work with skeleton crew making 1 person do work load of 3+.
bad,Working there was fine until I was sexually harassed by a coworker and when I told management they told me the best case scenario was talking to him and they wouldn't fire him because I was the only one to report it.
bad,"Walmart was an amazing place to work for 20+ years ago, however, with change in leadership comes change in the people. The Management team is the worst that I have ever seen and really should be taken a look at and revamped. Walmart is bringing in MBA's to fill middle management positions and that's great except MBA's don't have the exeperience of the middle managers that get getting let go in the reorganization of the company. I hope they figure this out soon before they lose all of the good leaders."
bad,Job was ok but like any whers else family and friends always got first shot at getting the better job with better pay some only showed up for a paycheck when others had to do their jobs and others job
bad,"I worked at Walmart as a CAP Team 2 associate for only nine months and I came to realize,  just soon after the first couple of days, that management was very poor. They were indecisive on their priorities nor would they give you the tools you needed to succeed and blame you for why you didn't/couldn't get the task completed that you were assigned to."
bad,I worked here for 1year and 4 months and it was great until we got a new assitant manager and he has been targeting me ever since and thats why im leaving once i found a new job
bad,Not happy anymore.. Not worried about associates. Care only about bottom line. Feel like you are doing the job of 5 people with no help. I truly love my customer base. Been there 6 years.
bad,"Stressful workplace, poor management skills, no training, expectations - be super human. Bad workplace in general. They whine about small stuff, bad people skills ect."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Wal-Mart because we were always shorthanded on employees which made the workload double on each person and triple when there was a call in.
bad,"It is a good place if you want temporary work but the stress is not worth working there, though the people are great. the customer service desk has a variety  of people that come through and some are really mean but others are nice to chat with while waiting on them."
bad,Unless you're applying to a manager position (if it's above department manager) and/or if you're younger than 25 or just really need to work; I'd say steer clear from this company. I've seen and dealt with upper managers trying to degrade employees and even disrespecting the elder associates. Don't let them take advantage of you just because you really need a job and keep in touch with the human resources directors (off site). You have to educate yourself thoroughly with the policies because I've seen and have had to deal with PTO (personal time off) issues. Ex: you put in months in advance in the system and on paper in the office and then since a change in workflow happens it's rejected months and even days in advance. Just be cautious and I wish you the best.
bad,all you can do is work your butt off your not allowed to finish required computer courses. a doctors not is not accepted as a valid reason to miss work. and no one follows the same rules and was very hot
bad,they are so use to people coming and going that they place bets and encourage employees to leave. there is complacency in the management staff that bully there employees
bad,"No career planning or advancement opportunities for employees, rigid and old fashioned work culture with merchant finance group, real high turnover rate"
bad,this job is only good for new entries into the job market or old people looking to supplement their income or the handicapped. they care only about profit.
bad,"Based on your title and age, management treats you different. The younger you are the less they care. If you are a cashier you will get treated very badly especially if you stand up to higher authority based on unfairness."
bad,I have nothing nice to say about Walmart.  They treat their employees horrible.  You are better off working at a temp agency.  The real problem is they down right don't care.
bad,"A typical day at work was very fast paced helping the time fly by. I learned quite a few time management skills and ways to be polite while under stressful situations.  I used Microsoft office and other Walmart computer systems constantly. For the first couple of years I felt that I learned something new almost daily. The dress code was very casual which was nice. Over the 19 years with the company I always felt that I was a valued part of the ""team"" however none of that mattered in the end. The company downsized and my job was cut.  My only option to stay with the company was to start at the bottom where I had started 19 years ago. My knowledge, skills, and dedication was never taken into consideration when keeping a position in the office where I had worked for over 5 years. Now I am looking to take my skills, knowledge, and dedication to a company that will see my work ethic as something they can depend on and shape into their own."
bad,Not a bad place if you are going to college and for some career opportunities . Not bad if you have open availability or no children. Work it self is not really hard and hourly employees are great people. Pay is great for new hires but not for lifers.
bad,"fWalmart likes to say it is a good place to work.  If you have a good manager, who doesn't have frequent migraines, it may be a good place to work. If you have a fair management team, it is just a so-so place to work. My department manager was rarely available for conferences and my store manager was never available.  He was either in a management meeting or running one of two other stores.  I think he was trying to be an Area Supervisor. "
bad,working for that Company you had good days and bad days. They talked about Family but when it came to yours or yourself having a situation they showed no empathy. There was a lot of favoritism in that work Place and did not confront you or see if they could help with a situation you may have been having. it was the opposite the hard workers they gave a hard time and the workers that did nothing they would get the recognition and the pat on their back for hard work someone else did.
bad,Worked for over 10years at Walmart and am glad to be free of it it treats employees badly and expects to be worshipped the pay is wicked low and people come in the door making what long time employees worked years to achieve
bad,The job I had at Walmart was the worst one I have ever had in my life.  Management are backstabbers and Walmart HR are just as bad.
bad,They didn't care about their people. It was great when I started then they took away my hours and took away my benefits. Their scheduling was a little crazy.
bad,"Walmart is not a place for me ,  it was a okay job at first but then management changed and now management tamper with schedules and give little to no hours to those who availability isn’t open . So that u open your availability so that I can work whenever they want you don’t have set off days and that takes away your life .  Overnight Management has bad communication skills and attitude."
bad,"Depending on the area of the country, this can be a great compaany to work for. Reccommend you do your homework. You should be available to work evenings and weekends."
bad,i loved working for walmart up until the day they fired me for missing to many days they change mangemnet to much and it is a very hard compampany to try to have a family and balance a work life
bad,it was a very stressful work place and they didn't have enough people so the managers would pull you from your department to work in other department and they still wanted the work to get done in your department.
bad,"While there are opportunities for advancement, it isn't secure.  They eliminate job positions frequently.  Also, no real leadership. Most managers expect you to complete job tasks with little to no training or support. Management prefers to pass off duties instead of handling them head on."
bad,It's all in the management work ethic they don't want to help customers or really do anything more than pester the employees that have been doing the same job for years and need the bare minimum of instructions
bad,"friends are awesome, you meet tons of people. management is unorganized and problem solving plans are flawed. no one seems to know what is acceptable and whats not, the rules and regulations change so much csm cant keep up and cant agree or whats okay or not at the moment.if caught or somthing goes wrong employee has to take blame even though was guided by supervisor"
bad,"Walmart for the most part is a great company, The hardest part is there is no execution on proper policies and procedures pertaining to the culture of the business. The hardest part of the job is the teaching and training portion of the position, The associates are not willing to learn things new for the fact of poor upper management  ."
bad,Nada a reclamar gostava da minha função só quem gosta de lidar com o público entende.
bad,"I was Cap 2 so we would start at 2, once we got there we would start unloading the trucks and placing the freight on certain pallets. After we were done unloading the truck we then went to the floor and stocked freight. Management was good most of the time. Nothing was hard about this job just quick paced."
bad,"it was always stressful and hard because of the co workers, the management is bad.The Walmarts i worked at need managers with a better heart because all they ever did to me was evil works."
bad,"The job is easy but don't let the 10.00 fool you. They make you finish training before you get it, but veggie finishing training, you will be highly pressured to leave"
bad,walmart does not respect the employees  there is no job security for the employees.  it has a high turnover rate.  employees are constantly worrying that they will be next to get fired
bad,"If you need a quick job that will pay some of your bills, Walmart is always hiring. Just don't expect it to be your only job. Unless you get Asst Mgr salary, then you can expect to work 65-80 hrs a week."
bad,Wal-Mart is not a fun place to work anymore!   Time management is a very big part of what I do!      The most enjoyable part of my job is getting a compliment from customer's on the great job I did on their special order I made!!!
bad,"Training and business operation systems are very good. But Asst Manager, Co-manager and Store Managers are not hold accountable for their wrong deed. They exercises power without accountability, ultimately make them monster. There performance assessment and advancement opportunity is extremely vague and in-comprehensive. The grading like exceed expectation or solid performer, which reporting manager decides right at the day the record in the system, but not for a specific period."
bad,"Walmart is exactly what you would expect, the only redeeming quality from working there was the pay. After the public outcry of how low the pay was the company increased the minimum wage for all workers. That definitely did not make anything better. Managers would expect you to do the work of 3-5 people by yourself without offering any help, certain managers had no idea what they were doing and other managers acted like children just because they were in a position of power. Management definitely played favorites and if you weren’t “in” then good luck trying to be treated decently by any of them. The only other good experience I had here was meeting some good freinds through coworkers, we were all united in how much we hated the place"
bad,"It was a temporary job, there were a lot of unfairness to employee, the pay was low and they make work at any shift they want. the manager were really rude to employees."
bad,Walmart is a nice place to work and it is a good establishment but because of the mangers and the way they treat their employees it makes it a stressful place cause the managers.
bad,A typical day at work was very demanding. Patients would come in for either an appointment or just walk in to have their glasses fixed/adjusted. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training. After 2 weeks of training I was left alone to run the vision center a few day a week.
bad,You must be a strong-minded individual to work for Walmart and it also depends on your location. The only problems I had being employed at store number 58 was race issues and favoritism in the workplace other than that the job was ok it’s just a job I personally would never recommend for someone I cared about.
bad,it is just a job to do the pay is low and they do not want to give more even though they could pay a decent wage they want to keep it all for the executives and not give any back to the people that keep it running daily
bad,"I was basically a maintenance worker. I've learned that this place was no good. I came in and cleaned on my time there. Some of the people I worked with were friendly, and some of them weren't. The management was bad. I had a few mental disorders that they never cared to work with. When I started to work there they were more appreciative towards me, but on my later days, that diminished. The management picks favorites, and show it. The only part I enjoyed about my job was the breaks. When I could go on my own rate, I liked my results.The hardest parts were the time restraints and being hounded by management."
bad,When I Worked At Walmart I Got The Job Done At Any Means . The Work Is very easy but the manager attitude is poor .long as you do your work you'll never have to worry bout a manager poor attitude .
bad,"Poor communication from leadership.  Despite annual employee surveys, not really interested in hearing ideas or issues that disrupt established company culture, even though culture is toxic.  This company does not want people with ideas, they want drones."
bad,"There is zero stability at Walmart. They will fire you without notice. "
bad,"Working there was an experience, at least. Job was about as easy as it gets. Has it's challenging moments, but not often. Not very understanding of lifes random events."
bad,"Management at this particular location was horrible. New management ever few weeks, people quitting with no notice and inconsistent rules. The work itself was not hard, but the witnessing ""management playing favorites and hollering with those that they don't like made it difficult."
bad,"A typical day at work would be coming in and stocking merchandise to the dairy department shelves, making sure to rotate stock and the management is somewhat OK."
bad,"Too many conflicting tasks, Different levels of management will interact with you during your day and give you tasks, none of them communicate with one another causing problems. Unrealistic expectations with low pay. No job security."
bad,"the jobs are easy but management is terrible and they could care less about their employees, walmart wants to have a family vibe as explained in the training videos and their policy but the management DOES NOT show that what so ever! only work at walmart if its your only option"
bad,"Strong customer service, Dependable, Learn to work well with others good team work. Enjoyed working with all employers. Meet different people,young and old.Hardest part was leaving to relocate and starting all over different state and making new friends and new work."
bad,"Worshipped as a job haven. Workers are at the mercy of computer scheduling. My job was discontinued on a whim,  then after I left the company, a year later was re-instated. Great for college kids, or part-time workers."
bad,"good but the work schedule is changing every three weeks."
bad,This company is not a very good one to work for. poor management that has no knowledge that they do not know their jobs and how to properly do it. I do not recommend this place to work.
bad,"I was working in CAP2, so pushing and breaking your limits was every day, and the tasks were unreasonable all the time."
bad,I really didn’t like some of the customers because they were rude and mean. And some of the employees had some Attitudes. They take there time doing what ever there are doing.
bad,"High stress, always understaffed, can't perform daily duties due to being understaffed. They could care less about employees. Says they are ""family oriented""but could care less."
bad,This lack of communication between management and employees. The pay is very horrible the pay is horrible the customers are rude and disrespectful. Working those long hours is not worth it.
bad,"Probably the cheapest company i have ever worked for to be honest. I haven't worked there in some time but at the time, most of the management team was power hungry, including department management. Some had absolutely no clue what they were doing. Other stores might be better than this one was. Good luck!"
bad,"Working as an IMS associate requires a lot of hard work and dedication on everyone's part. There is a strict time limit and a lot of work to be done, resulting in a pretty strict schedule."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart although it is a very fast paced work environment, a lot of different managers for the little amount of employees they had underneath them"
bad,"i love helping people, i have great customer service skills, team player, i love to learn new things everyday, new challenges, and great attitude towards everybody."
bad,"Walmart is a good company just very stressful. Management is ok depending on the store you are at, but you also don't get paid for everything they like to have you do."
bad,"Management was known for only advancing and helping those who were out of work friends. They constantly lied and used graphs for months against employees for production, even when they were on Leave of Absence or any type of leave, as it did not actually specify days, and they refuse to show that. Management always told you one thing, and than threw employees under the bus by stating they never said it, requests for trying to get what was said in writing were ignored. They were the best at smiling to your face, but treating you like bad while doing so. We always got paid less than other companies for what we did. Walmart is a pro at telling everyone bad news, and trying to convince them its good for them. HR always sides with management and if you contest anything, they only refer you to talk to the same management that you have the issue with. The company refuses to actually help associates. The only good thing is the culture, as it is interesting and very wide spread."
bad,"This place seems to be a great place to work ON PAPER! it has competitive pay, multiple work shifts, good benefits, 401k, stock options,  health vision and dental insurance.  BUT!!!!! Working at this place for 10 years I can only compare it to a prison. They don't care about you or anything els but NUMBERS and how much of a bonus you can get them.  You are just a number to them.  The managers are poorly trained, and don't care at all about their associates.  They are too busy worrying about themselves and watching their own back to help you out.  If you are looking for a place to advance and move up,  good luck! They play favoritism and pick and choose who they want to advance, rather giving everyone a fair chance. On top of that,  they would much rather hire someone out of house who has a two year degree with no managerial or warehouse experience; someone that has manager experience at mcdonals or marshals; or someone just coming out of the military for a manager position instead of promoting someone in house who already knows the job and has years of experience. Furthermore,  Wal-Mart answers to no one! They are not unionized,  so they do what they want, how they want and when they want.  They will enforce or not enforce rules and policies to fit as they need.  Again,  they do not care about you.  You are just a number to them.  They will fire you and hire someone else and pay them less.  That place is a revolving door.   Their extremely high expectations and production goals are unrealistic. They expect you to hit high numbers,  even if those numbers are not there to hit."
bad,This place can not keep new hires long because of how management treats their associates.  They think the company is more important then an associates family.  Even though they will try to say otherwise.  They expect their associates ( even ones with children under 15) to be available everyday of the week
bad,"very stressful work environment, store is not properly staffed and management does not care about staff. management cuts hours and lets people go  then doubles workload on employees"
bad,Walmart is a company that has hurt myself and my family to no end and hurt everyone around me. They do not care how hard you've worked or what you've done for them as long as it was petty and dishonest. I will never work for them again.
bad,"Good place to work if you have very little bills or rent to pay. Only talked to the manager one time. Only worked 6 months, then moved back to Washington."
bad,"A typical work day can start off god but at the same time can become very stressful I learned the value of customer service, there wasn't a good management team we were always shorthanded which put stress on the associates. The good part I liked about my job at Walmart was the customers I developed a real close bond with the everyday customers who would shop at the store."
bad,"If you want to work way too many hours a week (as a part-timer) and never have your needs heard, this is the place for you! The managers don't listen to your needs - like if you need days off for schooling, they will ignore the need, It could have just been my store, but I don't know. i dont recommend the job"
bad,Walmart does not care about its people. They do not have a good corporate culture or work life balance. You never get your schedule on time. Management doesn't care about its people
bad,The way there termination system sucks. You can’t even be sick without going through trouble and getting fired. I had hours saved up from both sick and paid time off. The day I use my sick hours on a day I miss because I’m sick they say I don’t have any sick hours and terminate me for missing the day I missed. Even though they paid me out in the hours that I had. Walmart just isn’t a healthy place to work at and will never look that way again. Have all the proof that I had my hours but going back isn’t even worth it to me knowing what kind of environment I was working in.
bad,I think Walmart has very good company policies that would be more effective if they were utilized and followed properly.  They over book part-time employee's and do not follow regulations. The managers are not sympathetic or understanding at all.
bad,"In the 6 1/2 years i worked here the last year and a half was the worst. The store manager is very coniving and unfriendly, she is very unappreciative and talks down to people very rude. Today I quit because she was disrespectful to me. Talked to other management about me in a negative manner and I work hard everyday."
bad,"Never knew if you had a job, day to day.  Partiality was show on a daily basis.  Management would lie to cover for their mistakes.  Walmart used to be a great company to work for."
bad,"They expected you to come to work, do your job and leave. No benefits and very little pay. Its wal-mart i'm not sure what any expects from it. I quickly left there for a better paying job."
bad,"I did returns,refunds, exchanges, warranties, layaway, site to store, photo lab, clean, separate departments items, money gram, money orders, door greeter, rang up sales. Watch your back. Management had the picks and didn't care who know it. A lot of different cultures.All of it was hard. Going home."
bad,Overall it wasn't a good place to work. Management had you do tasks just because they didn't know what else you should be doing. You would also have to rearrange items several times until upper management liked what they saw.
bad,It's a good place to work as long as they didn't have pets and terminate their people for a job that they finalized. If the store manger would not pull her friends  in from outside.
bad,"The jobs are pretty easy to learn through the cbl's, which is mandatory.  The upper management(store manager and some assistants) are nasty and unforgiving and very demanding the impossible."
bad,The Walmart I worked at alway overrides your schedule. Management was the worse at I ever worked with. They use scare tactics to get people to do things. Not sure corporate knew what they were up to. Work hours were long. You work your available hours then you go to work find your scheduled to work outside of what availability is. They use to computer to do the schedule that why. Not a place to work if you have a family.
bad,"You have to be solo base to work there, with a free mind to make judgment calls that can help the customer help. It is a company that a worker can progress, but it is limited training in these new jobs."
bad,"More work added on, not enough employees, Managers are very cold people. No negotiating.anything. Constantly hounding workers. Very catty place. Employees ""taddleing"" on other co-workers like little school kids, lots of back stabbing. Pretty Pathetic place to work!"
bad,"The managers gang up on you, they treat you like trash and even tho you are the only one who actually knew the department they put someone who knows nothing in charge."
bad,This company did not appreciate their associates and constantly overworked them. The management team never kept their word and always overworked their employees.
bad,"Great Company,as long as your in a store with good Managment. I have worked in four different stores in two states...Walmart can be a great company to work for,Just not a good fit for me anymore...I provided excellent work and customer service.The managment team at my latest store were very unprofessional."
bad,"Not enough employees"
bad,"management treated you like you are stupid. management don't listen to you, and they don't train you at all. The other employees are rude to the other employees."
bad,"Management has there favorites and if you are not one of the few selected to be there favorites, then you  are and will be replaced. They will find a way to get rid of you immediately."
bad,"It's a decent place to gather some work experience, but not a great place to star my at. With the two years I've been there the career advancement is slow."
bad,"If I was working the opening shift, I would first collect the till for the register. My next responsibility would be to make sure my department(electronics) was clean and organized. I would then start to stock the shelves with the merchandise that was received the previous night. Throughout all of this my number one priority is customer service. Mondays and Tuesdays I was responsible for setting the new DVD and video game displays. I also worked the backroom assigning overstock to its assigned locations.I learned how to track merchandise and its availability in our store and other Walmart stores in the area.Most important, I learned facts about our merchandise so that I could assist the customer intelligently. My department manager is excellent, but I felt upper management did not have a good grasp on everything that it took to run our department properly. I enjoyed working with the associates in my department and e could always make a work day enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is that we were spread too thin, many times having to take care of other departments while leaving our department a mess."
bad,Does not pay well at all. They cut hours and expect you to survive on a few dollars a week. Upper management are clueless or careless on what goes on.
bad,"I believe that thru hard work and discipline anyone can achieve anything especially in the place of work. Wal-Mart has show me that is not the case. I spend 4 years doing the best I could to advance but in return I got negative feedback, stress, pressured, and a nasty attitude."
bad,"When first working, it has been stressful to maintain production to achieve a percentile and maintaining safety at the same time. Majority of the individual never yell 20 feet to indicate they are getting their pallet to be placed in its destination and seems everyone tries to keep you from getting the tasks down on time. Safety is never a priority and totally wouldn't recommend even a high school graduate who is in search of a job to work there, due to the high stressful day-to-day tasks and treatment they shown."
bad,"Walmart's turnover is incredible. One year of employment and I saw 6 or 7 employees come and go in my department.  They had to eliminate the drug policy just to get potential employees in the door.  The job became to stressful due to lack of help.  All the work was placed on a very limited number of employees.  The work and stress was not worth the paltry pay. The managers are nice, but do not go to bat for the good workers.  There is no incentive to work hard as there are no performance based raises.  I would only recommend this job for kids."
bad,slow pace and working by myself and no help so it be hard to keep carts in the bay when you by yourself. The only part i liked about walmart is an hour lunch. When management tell you what your job just stay calm and do what they tell you.
bad,Working here was stressful. the manager seemed to have no understanding for the employees. Also it was always under staffed. You were expected to work the equivalent of a 2 person position. Employees were expected to work multiple departs in a short amount of time.
bad,"Being my fist real job, I was overly excited and eager to work for Wal Mart. This place was so unorganized and the work envirent was filled with tension and anger among the assistant managers and co workers. Although, I never let that phase my work, it was often hard at times. The assistant managers would change schedules last minutes and allow their friends to half complete task. I would never work for Wal Mart again."
bad,Very nice people to work with but my hours were practically cut in half and they arent very forgiving on small mistakes. they are willing to fire you on spot. they arents very caring about their workers.
bad,managers did not care about the associates upper level managers did not care about lower level workers mandatory breaks and lunches had to take up to many positions in the store got talked to for not getting your task completed though it was a managers fault by pulling you away from previous task.
bad,"It’s a good place to work if you don’t mind never seeing your family, never getting the days you ask for off, getting called in a lot and being treated like your a kid by the management estevan walmart is for you!"
bad,I have nothing to write.will not work for them again.do your job the Walmart way or no way. they are not for the employee only interested in customer . Customer is always right.
bad,"I do not recommend working here! They lack communication, organization, they don't train new comers well, and most of the management staff never smile and they walk around like they are gods gift to earth."
bad,Never will work for a company that cares little about your other priorities. Will never recommend them to anyone. Watch your back and people that can wreck your life.
bad,"The hardest part of my job is the management. I have learned how to strip and wax floors, and to make sure that the bathroom are clean. I also know how to make cardboard and plastic bells."
bad,"Very poor Management, Conflicting Procedures that changes from whatever Manager is on shift at the time. Stressful Working conditions where fear of job security is part of daily routine."
bad,"I was a inventory control associate at walmart for one year and i had the task of picking and shelving every item in my area which would come out to sometimes close to 500 items every day. This was watched carefully and was very stressful at times the blame was put on you or the hero was . its a 50/50 if you did everything perfect you were praised if you didnt you were chastised. I was getting paid 9 dollars an hour working nights to pick and bin, amazon employeess get paid 12 dollars an hour to pick and bin with not nearly as much pressure as walmart puts on. Supervisors were watchers not doers. None the less it was a paycheck i had 2 days off they provided insurance and never had overtime."
bad,"Non hard working individuals . disrespectful coworkers and mangers , hectic work environment with minimum respect at all. Needs major improvement year round."
bad,"no room for advancement, wouldn't recommend to anyone.did random stuff never really the job i was hired for..............................................."
bad,they need better management that actually does their job. so wrongful terminations do not occur and they get bad reviews like this one. would not wish this on my worst enemy
bad,It was a job I needed at the time. I liked the job. The co-workers were nice. Some of the managment at the time were nice and very helpful. But at times it felt like they wanted too much from you.
bad,"Overall Walmart would have been a wonderful workplace if it had not been for the one manager who constantly harassed me and others about numerous things, along with the black mold i was exposed two for over six months of me working for that Walmart."
bad,I liked my coworkers and the customers were friendly. Management does not like to work with you to make you feel comfortable. And they are picky on who they want to move up to higher posititions.
bad,"Management is horrible. There is no job security at all. They don't care about seniority. They will boot you out if you don't fit their click.  They're not very good at Communicating they will talk about you behind your back everyone will know your business before you do no matter how serious it is. I would like to try to open door somebody it will never fall through nothing will ever happen even if you go to corporate."
bad,"Most of management is lost, there is no communication between management, supervisors and employees. the employees are stuck in the middle and blamed."
bad,"The work was honest labor, but the remodel supervisors messed up at every turn. During the time I was there, they fired 5 people for ""inability to complete their duties"". I knew this was false because that was the exact same thing said to me and I would say that I worked as hard as I could. The truth was that they were trying to make a quick dollar and perform labor reduction while disguising it as incompetence of the workers. What I learned most of all is that Wal-Mart could care less about their employees."
bad,Managers and corporate ignore a lot of unethical behavior from manager towards employees. Benefits are good but. The stress is not worth the headache.
bad,Working at Walmart was not a bad job. I was in high school and taking CNA classes at night. The management scheduled me way too many hours. I would ask repeatedly for less hours and they did not give them to me. I had to take to call in too many days to catch up with school or go to my CNA class. But when I was at work I enjoyed it and had tons of fun.
bad,It got my foot through the door as my first job but my position wasn't all that great. For 8 hours a day I would restock the front end with shopping carts.
bad,"Hourly employees are knowledgeable and dedicated but are typically shown little or no respect at locations in this geographic area. Condescending attitudes of management leads to resentment and low morale. The training and culture at some Academies is excellent but once assigned to a store location, one finds the culture of ""respect for the individual"" goes right out the door along with many disgruntled customers. New assistant managers sign on to manage a number of departments (an area). They are not told up front that they will be expected to manage the entire store, rotate divisions (including midnight stockroom for 6-12 month stretches) or that they may be required to stay well-beyond their scheduled 10 hour shifts."
bad,"Walmart will give exceptional care to the customer to be sure their every need is met. "
bad,"The only benefit to working at Walmart is that there is none. The management is awful, always picking favorites, the associates are unhappy and go out of there way to ruin everyone else's day. There is no room to grow, being that i have tried to become a manager several times and I've been shot down each time with poor excuses even though I am overly qualified to do the work. The best part about the day is helping the customers and having them leave with a smile on there face."
bad,Theres always a better place to work at...... ....Great place to get a raise but worst ever to get respect as a person and your life in general...Horrible management and overall personnel
bad,"Working for Walmart is in no way a fun job.  As part of CAP 2 (truck unloaders and stockers), the blame for many things is laid upon us.  The truck and/or trucks are never done fast enough (even when they are), the freight is never stocked fast enough (even if the task time exceeds our shift time), and we are often expected to do the job of an entire department's worth of people without regard to the fact that our team is shorthanded.  Management does not seem to care, and keeps piling on the workload and raising their expectations.  We are paid the same as everyone else in the store, but our job is far more dangerous.  Trucks come in some days looking like the freight was literally thrown in haphazardly, and people have had extremely heavy objects fall on or near them.  I work with and have met some great people at this job, but those people and receiving a paycheck are the only things keeping me here.  I will jump at the chance to leave once I find something else."
bad,Don't give hours! Poor management team! If you have a availability you basically want get any hours and that's not fair for people with kids! Just not willing to work with their employees!
bad,Walmart taught me a great day about running a business. I did enjoy working with my fellow co-workers who actually cared about their jobs and worked hard. Walmart management was the worst kind to ever have as a manager.
bad,"Poorly ran, company plays favorites. No flexibility at all. Very few advancement opportunities. Stores are not kept up with at all and they due things in the workplace that interfere with being able to get work accomplished."
bad,I was pregnant and the managers forgot about me to use the restroom and break.  Working with everyone was nice and I had fun until I got sick and they let me go.
bad,"The work is the most physically demanding within the store and the least compensated. My co-workers are amazing and its great working with them. The assistant managers will hound you throughout the day about the speed you are completing your tasks with your team, but the blame lies on them because it's hard to do a job that requires 8 people with only 4. Some managers are very nice and understand the scheduling problem and see that the effort is there, but the staffing isn't. Other managers will come in (newest manager hired) , change everything, and blame you and your co-workers for everything even if they make the error."
bad,"I wouldn't let my family work here. No recognition, culture is terrible. There is bullying reinforced through upper management. Not all are bad but there is a culture of targeting external candidates till they quit."
bad,"if you really need a job desperately then you do it but if not look for something else, Typical day involved getting carts every night, filling the carts with merchandise and stocking the shelves with merchandise , you get an 1 hour lunch, and going back to work where they rushing you and working you very hard if you have good co workers that helps you it wont be so hard but if not then its gonna be a LOng day."
bad,"I would not recommend working here to anyone! The benefits were nice, but the management was appauling!  They expected more from you than what you could do and never lent a hand to help, they just walked around barking orders."
bad,"Walmart is a place where there is no organization, no team work and no set dates. Day to day you run around with your head cut off trying to  make so sense of the holing thing. You don't what the when you ask a Manager half the time they don't what to do either."
bad,"Overall Walmart was a bad experience for me, managers did frequent schedule changes without my knowledge. Managers are never anywhere to be found to help associates."
bad,To unorganized but very good hours not enough team members to complete the tasks . Not enough team work to complete the task but had very good benefits .
bad,Easy to get started but management teams only care about the bottom line and are not flexible. Most of the people are outgoing and fun to be around. Things change to quickly day to day and even between shifts so most of your day is spent reworking what someone else just did.
bad,"my 17 years of employment with the walmart corporation would be described as stagnant, the company lacks progression. and fuels a very competitive environment and hires unexperienced narcissistic driven employees."
bad,"In my professional opinion, Wal-Mart does not care about it's associate's lives outside of work, your performance, or your satisfaction with the job. I have recently seen a trend happening in Wal-Mart where they are firing Associates at alarming rates for inadequate reasons. They don't care about your kids or your life. On a positive note, the pay and benefits are very good."
bad,"It's a nice group of people i work with. I don't enjoy the job most the time though, and don't really like working for the company.When you get to work you go to a CSM and get assigned a register. You go back to them after every break and your lunch too. The CSM's are then in control of when things happen for you based on your schedule and the recommended times given to them based on it.They give you your breaks and your lunch and get you off at the end of the day."
bad,Management sucks!!! they lie to you all the time they treat you like trash and expect the very best out of you at all times. I wouldn't work for them again if they offered it to me.
bad,"Mostly Friendly Co-Workers, teaches basic cashiering skills, how to handle money, theft reports, inventory compensations, accident reports, disposal safety, customer service skills, bagging skills, calculations, and return polices."
bad,Didn't really like the job because It felt like a competition all the time. I got criticized for taking too long to be trained I guess. I didn't like that very much.
bad,El ambiente es bueno les falta personal por lo cual muchas beses nos dejaban sin hora de comida y por lo tanto te exigen demasiado para que rindas mas pero sin una mejor paga
bad,well as u know walmart is the leading world in the retail industry. idk bout that. they said i was working to slow. well i was a cashier not a stock boy.
bad,"They have a set schedule and most of the employees are nice to talk to, and they have a really nice pay. They also have a good hour lunch if you work a certain number of hours. However the management was awful. They don't care about any of their employees, their benefits were horrible, and they do nothing when there are managers abusing their power and mistreating their employees. It is a terrible place to work."
bad,Bad management makes a job experience bad the management has a horrible attitude the company isn't the best to work for had hours cut and sent home early defiantly would not recommend this company to anybody
bad,Walmarts supervisors were consistent with the schedules and workflows. I worked by myself alot and didn't have to deal with the negative drama with the other workers.
bad,Over worked under paid always adding more work no help appreciation or pay. So if you want to get a job at Walmart expect to be treated like a 3rd class citizen because if it's not your manager it's a customer
bad,"Every job has their Pros and Cons, which is just what comes with working for someone .The Stonecrest Wal-Mart has their way of running things, without the support of corporate; which I can never be apart of or support ANYMORE! I would love to continue with a company that has awesome, friendly, and reliable management. I love being apart of a positive environment while working along side a team or alone. So, in closing, I wish this company nothing but prosperity but as of 2017, I will go forward with a company I can trust and grow with in the near future."
bad,"Was a job that kept me balanced, and pay was ok, was treated unfairly from other employees. I had a great learning expieriene from sporting goods on how to sell licenses."
bad,Management here thinks they can tell employees anything and get away with because they're management. Not a very good work environment. AP department is overall the best department. Manager is amazing and tries to work with you.
bad,I currently work at Walmart but I want to leave because they treat people bad for not good pay I understand you have to work hard but at walmart they wont treat you right as long as ive been there its really not a good environment
bad,If you like being treated like a convict and being miserable then Walmart 6280 e-Commerce is the perfect job for you. I have nothing good to say......
bad,"The usual work routine consists of wanting to quit at least five times during your shift, and being yelled at by managers( grown adults), to the point where you start spending your breaks crying in your car. This is the only customer service job where the customers behave more compassionate and considerate towards you then the supervisors are. Management will not be bothered to train new employees in any aspect regarding their position, so the majority of your first few months there will be filled with irate customers yelling at you to do your job, and you not knowing what that actually entails. Prepare yourself for managers to become irate towards when you finally cave and ask them for help. Because of course in the 21st century you should be able to train yourself, right? According to this company that is correct. The one saving grace you can count on is your coworkers helping you out, and taking the time to answer your questions in an inviting, non judgmental manner. Working at walmart is the equivalent of having a twenty minute long pap smear performed by your elderly neighbor."
bad,Very productive unloading the semi. All the guys in the back always had had your back if you needed them. They didn't understand family emergencies. The Princeton store has very bad management in receiving.
bad,"I worked for Walmart for about 6 months and it was a very depressing job. Granted that I did have some very nice customers(rarely) the job itself probably would not have been so bad if most of the customers were not such a bunch of absolute scumbags. The only upside of this job was that there was never a shortage of hours, but the bad side of this is also that those hours are not very flexible. Management was about as mean as you can expect from a typical Walmart."
bad,over all the management was not the greatest. i had had an accident on the job site and gotten fired and no workers comp forum was filled out.
bad,"Don't listen to what these companies offer because they lied. This company is only for gangsters and lazy ones that don't want to work. If your parents or family raised you good with good qualities and to believe in god, then I DON'T recommend it. They will ruin your life. It is very stressful, therefore it is unhealthy. I developed a serious medical condition because of the stress I was going through, oh, and I got terminated for it."
bad,Working at Walmart it was fun and they keep me busy so that made the day go by faster. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know like the way the bread is made and the donuts that was fun and it was also great working with great ladies that made it fun sometimes. I learned to just go for it and learn as you go I was nervous talking to people but then I got the hang of it and I love helping people! The hardest part of the job was I had to be at work at 4am but my body got used to it and it became nothing and also unloading the truck and putting items in the freezer it was cold but I got used to that too.
bad,"a typical day at burger king is sometimes fast paced and other times it can be a little slow. I learned how to use a register and how the make burgers. I always thought that I would be a bad cashier and that I would mess accidently give people the wrong orders, but I actually did a good job as a cashier. the management is really good. the coworkers where nice. the hardest part of the job is cleaning bathrooms. the most enjoyable part is when we close the dining area for the night and I have to mop the floor."
bad,"5 day a week . Hours fair . Good work space . Fast paced. Healthy work environment . Good co-workers . "
bad,do not work for this company they deserve to go out of business. i felt pressured to perform illegal activity on the job. the managment could careless about you.
bad,"I folded clothes, stocked food and clothes on a daily basis. I learned how to fold clothes the Walmart way and great customer service. I did not care too much for some of the managers. I loved working with my co workers. I loved working with the public ."
bad,Support Managers do not help   different section of the store only has one person working it also  the management is very rude its not a place to work if  you are trying to be a team player. break room very nasty.
bad,i loved my job. I was a fulltime cashier and i trained most the cashiers coming through. I feel the managment really were out for themselves. They just want bodies there.
bad,I was with the neighborhood market for 7 months through the process of training in a different store to putting together and getting the new Neighborhood market in Harrisonburg VA on Port Republic Rd ready for opening day .The process was awful there was no organization to the job which was very much needed. young people believe they don't have to work and if they do they do not have to do it the right way so I of course spent a lot of time going over what someone else had messed up. I very much enjoyed the customers after we opened
bad,"I don't know how I made it two years here. It's honestly awful. Management is not willing to work with you, they won't listen when you need help. Had been told on several occasions that I should be able to handle the workload of two or three people and that it ""doesn't matter"" if I was all alone all day. Work here only if you're a mindless zombie who doesn't care about having your stuff messed up all the time."
bad,A typical day at Walmart an associate will preform nearly every task in the store except what they were hired for. Different managers will delegate to you what benefits them and their coverage areas. Most associates will be unhappy at all times because they are dealing with the same treatment and poor pay. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out the process of the business as minimal training is provided. An associate for Walmart will learn a lot about inventory and customer interaction.
bad,"Management are all lazy , inappropriate , fowl mouths. Employees are lazy , and they do not keep the store clean, un-licensed life operators , under aged alcohol dispensers."
bad,It's not the job for me. I didn't like the hours there and I didnt like working with rude customers. I didnt feel that retail industry is for me to work in. I also had to answer phones which most of the time was rude customers.
bad,working at Walmart so good for me that was my first real job so everything was great its just sometimes its to busy to be so unorganized no one did know what to do
bad,"Yelling, verbal abuse, snide remarks, sideways looks, hostility, intimidation, implied threats, weapon display, physical confrontation, predatory behaviour. Etc..."
bad,"my experience at wal mart was an interesting experience. the customers were great. displaying my customer service skills was quite enjoyable. however, the problem is management. because of the fact we often had different managers to work there. being so, that made the experience there quite horrible and frustrating. work there was no longer fun. the hardest part of the job was trying to do your job, while doing someone else's job and being harassed by management constantly. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help my customers and knowing that I made their day. I enjoyed my co-workers as well. we all kept each other motivated and we all tried our best to get the job done."
bad,I really love what I do .  I just need a change of atmosphere. I sometimes feel like I'm in a circus . I feel management is never on the same page . To many Chiefs not enough Indians. Always asking us to achieve tasks that they cant even do. Love my co-workers.  Highlights of the day is making my customers happy.
bad,horrible because they dont work with school schedules if you are a college student and managment is horrible and be littles their associates.
bad,"I am a sales associate that stock freight in the grocery area, I also help customers in a fast and friendly pace when they need help."
bad,Not very kind management but the job itself was not so bad. I would not work there again though. I would get there and unload a truck for about three hours and then the remainder of my work day would be miscellaneous tasks.
bad,es muy tranquilo trabajar hay y los horarios son muy accesibles
bad,Walmart on chambers was the worst work environment i have ever worked in. The Management in the store is horrible. CSM's asking young employees for drugs and more.
bad,"Poor employee moral- the rates set for order filling are nearly impossible to meet."
bad,Worst place i place i have ever worked due to managements unfair work practices. They are able to change corp policies as they see fit
bad,"Es una empresa donde aprende mucho ya que la capacitacion es constante todos los dias, es muy apegada a alcanzar objetivos establecidos para seguir siendo la mejor empresa de autoservicio que existe. Me gusta el trato con el personal ya que somos gerentes couch donde puedes enseñarles la manera que necesitan trabajar para poder seguir dentro de la misma organizacion, es dificil porque existen meses muy malos por la economia del pais y necesitas seguir alcando los planes de ventas porque si no te sacan no sirves para la empresa, no tienes calidad de vida debido a que trabajas sab y dom y descanzas entre semana, no existe el pago de tiempos extras, navidades, dia del padre, del niño, de la madre, pero pues por satisfaccion propia si quieres entrar y estar vigente debes de saber tener un buen liderazgo porquee si no te comen."
bad,"Training was minimal"
bad,The people that work dont move anywhere and the people that dont work get promoted and the management dont help you with any problems that you come across such as issues with other associates that hinder your work performance
bad,The management was never on the same page. I loved the people that I worked with. The people that I got to train were wonderful. I did rather enjoy the hour lunch break that we got. The hardest part about that job was the constant running around and never know what you were doing one day from the next.
bad,"I recently worked at the Wal-Mart in Dearborn,MI and I must say that was the worst Wal-Mart I've ever been in.I worked in the grocery department and I must say that was the worst position Ive ever held. They were very unorganized and never scheduled enough people to work. The shop backs were horrible and backed up beyond the two people they schedules repair. Can you imagine someone coming to the store filling up buggies of food only to not have any money on their card so all of that food has to be put back. Black Fridays are terrible as well but Im sure everyone knows that already."
bad,"Wal-Mart corporation is a very good place to work because the people there treat you like family, and there is lots of room for advancement up the corporate ladder, and the wages are right up with all the rest of what other employers are paying other employees that work else where."
bad,"After working there for two months, and getting fired for getting injured. I've learned, that all the employees are miserable, unless new. The majority of the employees or associates do next to nothing productive. Than when it comes down to the work the hardest worker is the one who has to fix it, and deal with getting in trouble for other peoples habits."
bad,"The most difficult part of the job was being expected to do the work of 4 people, store is severely understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  When I first started with the company, the management did a great job!  The management has long since changed, and this has had a terrible impact on the associates."
bad,"Stock shelves, organizing products. I learned how to read number labels to place items in appropriate spot. Management was not the greatest, managers were not around very much to answer any questions an employee had. Co-workers tend to keep to themselves, wouldn't talk much to each other giving the work environment an awkward feeling. The hardest part of the job was when we'd get a truck full of items that was a bigger load then usual and we'd have to get it all done before our shift was over. All an all the job itself was very easy. There weren't many enjoyable parts of the job, it was a 3rd shift position which was very hard to adapt to, the co-workers didn't talk much and the managers weren't around a whole lot to give directions"
bad,"1. Most enjoyable part of job: People/coworkers were fun to work with."
bad,management was always rotated around.  They did not stay more than six months at a time.  The employees were hard working people but the management did not show them.  If you like retail it would be ok place to work.
bad,Typical day is clocking in going to your Manager to see which register you will be at for the day then right away start checking in and out customers till the end of your shift and of course you get two 15 min breaks and a lunch break.
bad,"When you work for Wal-Mart they don't care about your personal life or what you have going on. If something just so happens with your kids and you can't make it to work, you get written up for it. Then when you explain and not want to tell the whole situation you get called a liar. "
bad,"Provide customer service, close deli, hard to lift meat buckets, learned how to use a slicer, managers are ok. Very Tiring."
bad,"I would start at 11pm unloading the truck and bringing the merchandise to the floor. I would have approximately 8 hours subtract 2 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch, to have 4 to 5 pallets full of merchandise to have put away before 7am. I learned time management while working at Wal-Mart."
bad,"Walmart is not the best company to work for. I would not recommend it for an extended amount of time."
bad,"only take this job if you like being scrutinized all day long, the store manager is not personable and he will expect way to much. the only reason they are understaffed is because he has fired half the store or the associates left because of him, It used to feel like a family now its like being bullied everyday"
bad,"Associates are wonderful, but Walmart itself sucks.. theyre greedy and will just swipe your job title out from underneath you."
bad,I did not like working at Walmart. The employers were rude and not understanding about certain situations. but overall it was a learning experience.
bad,Working with Wal-Mart is a great way to get your foot in the door in the job market. You will be paid in accordance to your job experience and job placement. At times it is a stressful environment as you are going to be working during unconventional hours.
bad,they don't care about there workers or customers anymore they have lost so much of there pride all they care about is money anymore
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 10 years as an assistant manager and found the culture there to be one of intimidation, threatning, and above all stressful to the point that they force you to either quit, or leave for better venues simply because they mistreat their employees, and do not reward those to whom actually perform to a higher level it is frowned upon by upper management for low level management to treat associates with kindness."
bad,"Management is very immature and has favorites. Very rude and love to bully. When a situation occurs, it is all about who knows who, and they will let first shift pick and choose their off days, whereas second shift has to just take whatever off days come to them; thus creating an unbalanced schedule."
bad,"basically all I had to was run a register. I did from time to time help in different clothing departments clean up their areas, I would zone the shelves right by the registers to make sure merchandise was in the right place, I would also restock the bags at all the registers, collect all the shop back from underneath all the registers so it could be put away."
bad,not enough pay to live on unless you are upper management. the hours are constantly changing and pulling individuals from one department to another due to not hiring enough individuals to get the work done.
bad,i was very disappointed about how they treat their employees. also the over all mentality of team seemed lackin greatly.
bad,I have not learned much in the past 4 years with this company. I enjoy the employees I work with and that is about it. The managers are always being fired and hired which creates a lack of communication and confusion with the employees.
bad,Very unorganized. I was never properly recognized for hard work.  The management was horrible. Management was very disconnected from entry level associates.  Treated entry level like slaves or live stock.
bad,"Started in maintenance, consistent schedule, teamwork, i eventually got promoted to sales associate after 6 months, really enjoyed it."
bad,If you work for Walmart - Go to work for Price Costco and see for yourself how a respectable employer treats their employees.
bad,"Walmart reserves the wright to fire you at anytime they see fit, so my recommendation if you work there find another job fast because they will let you go if you rock the boat or ask questions, even to get cross trained into other areas."
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have had. My problem was not so much with the company but with the store. management was either very lazy or extremely difficult to work with. The store manager hardly ever promoted within the store, unless, it seemed, if it was someone that she was either close to or favored."
bad,long hours different people at all times. no job securitys. diverse coworkers. no set schedule. fun at times. many different events at all times
bad,"people were nice. an hour unpaid lunch, able to work at your own pace. down stacked pallets for everyone to stock the merchandise, few workers and liked 3rd shift."
bad,"I'll be honest, right off the bat. While I agree that in my experience, the company is a terrible place to work, not all of the members of management are as I will be depicting them. I just had the unfortunate luck of getting into a store that was like this."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is coming in early in the morning doing my OSA and ordering merchandise if need be. I have learned alot being in this position for 3 years. I have learned respect for the individual, customer service skills, management skills, etc. The hardest part of my job is lack of communication between management and employees. The enjoyable part of my job would be customer service, training new employees, and giving a helping hand."
bad,"Wal-Mart Management lack associate communication skills. Hardest part of job is when Management ask for task to be preformed  properly , yet they do not have supplies to complete tasks. When Supplies are ordered they do not arrive in a timely matter..ie. proper floor wax stripper , dust mop heads , plastic trash bags , ect. I ordered an industrial dust mop for the floors due to metal sleeve being broken and was told by Asst. Manager to use duct tape to fix the broken frame. I had ordered frame 3 months ago and when I left WalMart it still had not arrive....Everything I had heard negative about Wal Mart was true. I was embarrassed to say I was employed there...  Nothing enjoyable about working there."
bad,"A lecture and what feels like an attempt at brainwashing starts the day. Having set the mood the managers will usually give you work that is hard to do safely in the allotted time the computer says you should be able to do it. If you are injured on the job they will bend over backward to make sure you don't put in for workman's comp. While co-workers are more than willing to help out, no one is allowed to go into another section, even when their work is complete, and help out. And when a manager want a promotion, they tend to start giving unreasonable demands and firing people for little reason."
bad,"Very overloaded work schedule.  Underhanded work practices such as short staffing and scheduling employees hours that just barely qualify for ""part-time"" in order to save money on payroll."
bad,Wal-Mart is a big company with a lot of opportunities to move up and to have the ability to learn different tasks. The company does provide good benefits but you do not have any holidays that you can spend with your family. Depending on who is running the store is the support that you are going to get from management and what kind of hours you are going to work.
bad,"I can't give it a overall review , because my rating is just too low. A lot of the customers especially the seniors liked taking care of. A lot of the same seniors came back time after time and they were always for the most part always very special to talk to each and everyone of them. A few of the workers were alright to get along with, along with some of the management, did not work with all of them, the benefits were terrible and so was the pay for the hors I worked. Menards and Fleet-Farm and Farm and Fleet serve there associates with much better benefits and better pay to start out with than what Wal-Mart does, and they are more localized."
bad,I really liked the job itself. I had to stock the fruit and vegetables and  take out all the bad stuff it was real fun for me as weird as that may seem. I also liked the people in my department they were all really friendly and welcoming. However the reason that I gave it such a bad rating is that the managers were all horrible. There are so many of them all different levels telling you different things that aren't even relevant to what you are doing. They take you out of the place that you are trained in for the store because they don't have enough people to zone the shelves which is a waste of time and leaves your area short as well. It was great when they would just leave us alone. We got all our work done and worked as a team without their help or with them there to mess up the system.
bad,"It would be a really great place to work if management was willing to work with you as a team, not just associates do all the work while they sit in the back, well some of them."
bad,"Un lugar donde se puede desarrolar. pero con ciertas limitantes debido al ahorro de gastos dentro de  toda la compañia, tiene pros en cuestion de capacitacion constante, herramientas que simplifican la ejecucion de ciertas actividades"
bad,n/a it was overnight. alot of stocking required and tasks that had to be done at a timely fashion and before you clocked out of your shift.
bad,"Hard labor without good pay. No excused absence even with a doctor excuse. Want you to look ""professional"" but won't even offer you insurance unless you work 30 hours a week. Have no regard for your family. Hate I ever worked there."
bad,"On a typical day of work you spend long hours stocking produce and products onto sales floor shelves. Making sure all items overstocked are safely brought back to inventory. Courteous and diligent customer service for those in need of assistance with visit is a must. I have to say the best thing I learned was memorizing the sales floor departments so all shoppers that needed help could find what they were looking for in a timely manor.  Management was efficient in listening to the workers abilities, comfort and progress with a new experience. They were also attentive when I expressed interests in opportunities of advancement. The hardest part of the job was the co-workers, not the shoppers. They were young is all. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help shoppers in need of assistance."
bad,I am a hard worker I would pull freight stock shelves clean help wherever needed.my co-workers where great when asked to get things done
bad,"I went from being a cashier to a Customer Service Manager in 3 days. So pay went up, but everything else sucked. I was working with someone who belittled me and bullied me and they didn't do anything about it. They didn't let me have any days off and they gave me horrible hours. I never had time off to even be able to spend some of the money. They never listened to me and all the management didn't do anything but play on their phones. Would never work there again even if my life depended on it."
bad,"I'm great at following directions I'm also very good with communicating with my customers, but at Walmart they kind of over work which doesn't really bother me because for the most part I'm able to keep up with my work. Our new mangers are very attentive and very helpful. My coworkers are great they love my upbeat personality I get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be that we are very short on staff at the moment so we tend to get more work then we can handle. the most enjoyable part is interacting with customers as well as with my co-workers."
bad,"so yeah i worked asset protection for walmart, for those of you that don't know that's undercover shoplifter watchers. i was expected to make 9 stops in Morgan Hill, being physically impossible since everybody stole from the target across the street. I was paid $10.70 basically slave wage for my area, and i had the highest pay rate under managers."
bad,"Stock shelves, price changes, help customers, and check out customers. Management was not that great. You have to be multiple people in one day. Too much workload some days. No overtime. Work environment drains your soul."
bad,it is a good job if you can handle the general public but the Walmart  I worked at was very unorganized. one moment there were these type of rules the next a completely different set of rules. we were stretched out very thin so I would have to work in other department that were not in my job description. I would have to do the work that would usually take 3 people to complete and would get written up if I did not complete on time.
bad,"I considered Walmart very dishonesty. Rude people. Disrespectful people who I worked with and the customers were rude, too."
bad,The company does not treat their associates with respect.  They are all the time changing schedules and times of associates.  When you ask for time off in advance they get mad.  Overall it is a job.
bad,the job demands to much out of it employee for so lil pay and also by far the worst job ive had so far.
bad,checking out cstomers none stop which makes the day go by fast.
bad,"Simple minded job that didn't require much thinking. Mostly fast paced, but very tedious. Scan items across a belt, organize them inside of a grocery bag, and place in a cart. Didn't really get to know your coworkers, management was a little slow at helping, Hardest part of the job was dealing with how often customers got upset or aggravated. Easiest part was how simple everything was."
bad,"typical day is to pick up behind people all day, be cashier when asked to do so, stock merchandise"
bad,I didn't enjoy the company culture they don't train people correctly.I did enjoy working with the public.
bad,"A typical day at work staying with a positive attitude, making sure customers are being helped when needed."
bad,Need to be more help with there work people and we use have pray time and do not do that anymore .
bad,"A typical day for me was 500-600 prescriptions a day, always very busy and alot of unnecessary, unrelated to the workplace, drama... I learned to no matter what keep a positive mind and never let anything outside my job effect my performance... The management was terrible, very unprofessional and very predictable.... The carried on personal relationships and friendhships which made the workplace unfair, lack professionalism and lack equality.... If I could help it, even tho I am rehirable, I will never accept employment there or recommend them to any human being."
bad,"Wal-Mart at one time was a great place to work.  However after the death of its founder and the siblings deciding to let outside management of the empire that was a beacon of utopian employment take over and make it like any other money hungry corporate giant.  There was true care and concern for the average employee.  What they thought mattered and care was taken of each individual not  favoritism and control.  The employee mattered, was an asset to the company not a liability.  Not a robot or a replaceable part of a family whole."
bad,"A typical day at work is long, fast paced and demanding. I leaner to organize products correctly. Management was friendly and very efficient. THe hardest part of the day was the time requirements you were placed under to get the high amount of work done. The most enjoyable [art of the job would be the employee discount!"
bad,Not much good to say other than I like the people I work with. I like some of the benifits they supply us and I learn something everyday from employees not management . not hard job just some people make it harder than what it is ( Management ).
bad,"working at Walmart is okay if you keep your head clear and dont take things personally. Try to keep a low profile, they will over work you if they can. For example you may be a manager of three different departments and asked to work an additional one if they lack the help. Their turn out rate is horrible. People have generally quit within the first two weeks. even the store managers know this but do nothign to fix it."
bad,"LOVED optical, I left to have management experience"
bad,"Terrible place to work. They will hire anybody but, it is an awful job. The only way to survive is hide out in the back room as much as you can. The sales floor is awful. Sales Associates are often pulled a million directions at once. You will be worn out at the end of the day but feel like you accomplished nothing. There are also no benefits. Benefits are reserved for full time employees. Only managers work full time."
bad,"This store did not have anything together it was a mess, I dont even know who were managers or what was going on."
bad,"employees are awesome.. Management sucks"
bad,"the new managers at the walmart on florida sucks!!!! the pay is fine but its hard to get a raise, the new managers is hard to deal with, the lady yells at you and talk to you like you're a child, she gives you no kind of respect. they set you up for failure!"
bad,"Typical day of work was very fast pace and I learned alot of on hand cashiering experience.  Unfortunately management does not treat employees very well, not saying all managers are like that, just from my experience, some managers are not personable.  I got along very well with my co-workers, enjoyed them very much.  Hardest part of my job, I was not always able to please the customer, but tried to work fast & efficiently to the best of my ability and treat them as I would like to be treated.  Most enjoyable, working with friendly customers and also gained alot of good friends."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend it anyone working for this company. Poor management, no communication between managers."
bad,The main point of every speech was to work faster and do more.No matter how hard you work they expect you to do more.
bad,What can i say. they dont work with you. you have to be able to work in every department. management is mean and try to make you fail.
bad,A typial day at work for me is customers yelling co- workers fighting management hiding. The hardest part for me is when I need help and no one comes the best part for me at my job is my customers but the most enjoyable is when I can help a customer in need and leave happy
bad,Its a good place to work and advance. it so many opportunites and its fun working with so man different people
bad,"Company was ok, I worked out of Lancaster so I never went into the HQ."
bad,"As lideranças são super comprometidas,mas precisa ser dado mais foco na redução de perdas, as metas e controles precisam funcionar para que o resultado apareça"
bad,a great job just to make ends meet. great around the clock shifts. managements in unprofessional and unreachable sometimes. and they do not offer full time work for cashiers and other various positions.
bad,"There were some managers who were willing to go above and beyond for their associates, then there were some who did not care about associates unless they were friends with them. The pay was not good either. Stores vary though."
bad,"es de afuerzas el tiempo extra o si no, no te apoyaban cuando tu lo necesitabas "
bad,"-Back stabers "
bad,"I was treated very poorly by this arrogant company. I  detest the"
bad,I was a external hire and thought the company was much different about the company its a lot of micro managing. 
bad,My schedule at Wal-Mart affected my home life. I have 2 children and it caused problems. 
bad,"I hated working there. The management bullied me, I never got to spend any time with my family, they don't care if you are sick, they only let you have 3 sick days and if you take more you get in trouble, it's depressing, they don't treat everyone fairly (the management has favorites that can get away with almost anything), you do the same thing all day every day so it gets really boring, the stupid strict dress code, and I could go on forever. I absolutely hated working there. "
bad,I was there few years and then I got hurt. They fired me so that company is a company that do there people worng.
bad,Walmart has an very fun and friendly environment but has very poor management and terrible benefits. Its a nice place to work but if you're young and trying to establish yourself it isn't the best place to start.
bad,"I hated my time at Walmart and don't recommend anyone work there. It's a biased place full of hateful managers and district managers. The customers are rude and hateful, the managers treat you like garbage and you sometimes can't even finish the work day because you're emotionally upset and you just want to walk out. The best thing I can say about Walmart is that I no longer work there, especially the one in Mt. Pleasant, Texas."
bad,"I worked 32 hours a week. I was Customer Service Supervisor two days out of the four days I worked there, and never got paid for doing it. I got regular pay. I was never late, but when I got my evaluation there were 26 abscences for being tardy. The manager that did my evaluation knew I was never late because he was always there when I worked. When I would ask for days off months in advance I never received them. I was there almost two years, and I would come in to work when it was my day off if someone called in, but never got acknowledged for it. It was just a horrible place to work over-all"
bad,"Llegar a las 8 de la mañana ya los telefonos sonando para citas, para problemas de cualquier cosa agendar citas para entrega, citas para revision de negocios hacer reviciones de empaque y negocios, aprendi a ser muy tolerante a trabajar semanas completas sin dia de descanso, mi gerente, no sebe pedir las cosas las exige en un tono muy altanero. la parte mas facil simpre fue la atencion al cliente, y saber que podia ayudarlos y hacer todo cuanto este en las manos para que quede conforme la mas dificil, tener que agachar la cabeza cuando el jefe esta de malas porque si contestas te corren. pro si aprende mucho de la empresa y de mi como persona, cosas que a lo mejor no pense tener."
bad,It's a job that is very physical. You've got to have it in you to make it here.
bad,"Não valorizam o funcionario, folgas somente durante a semana e muitas vezes o mercado fecho 23h ou 24h."
bad,I was an ims backroom associate. It sounds like a highly responsible job but i was never properly trained. Overall this is the worst company ive ever worked for.. Mc Donald's is 2 steps ahead of this horrible place
bad,like a bunch of fit throwing two year olds the work is not bad just some of the coworkers do not like to do thier job and would rather sabotage someone else instead it would be a decent job if there were some team work there
bad,I wouldn't recommend them for a permanant employer. The open door doesnt work anymore. They take you in circles and back to the one that defiled your trust.
bad,Well a day at for me is going and loading cart which i take to the floor and work to the shelves.i have learned that got jobs are hard to come by.Management is ok but you have to just keep busy and do your part. Co-worker some are ok but some are immature and have an attitude.The Hardest part of my job is being there for seven year an only making 10.60/hr.The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving and going home .
bad,"I worked there for a short time. I had a lot of problems with the people I worked with, they were always very rude and would not help me to learn at all. My little 7 month old baby was very sick and I had to take her to the er but Walmart does not except dr excuses you had to get a 5 page paper filled out in order to not get fired. The management didnt try to help me at all. They were very rude and worried about how fast I was and when lunches were. The most enjoyable thing was my friend that I did work with the only person that would ever help me."
bad,A typical day at work was to be able to put a smile on as many customers faces as possible.
bad,I worked for this company for 4 years. There isn't much that I haven't learned in a retail setting. A good part of working for Walmat is that they cross train a lot.
bad,Enjoyed my coworkers and being surrounded by so many different people everyday. Work load was easy.
bad,I didn't like this job at all. Coworkers Don't get paid enopugh for just having to walk around Didn't do much but stand on my feet and walk and clean my floor
bad,"just another day but really is'nt a bad job, needed more overnight cashiers,clean,everyone was nice"
bad,"ºLa empresa es muy estable, pero su crecimiento hace que crescan personas las cuales no estan capacitadas para tomar puestos de tanta responsabilidad y por lo mismo se cometen muchas injusticias y el ambiente de trabajo es muy malo en base a los malos lideres."
bad,walmart don't really care about you. the more you do the more they expect and want from you.
bad,Wal-mart was not such a great place to work the manager skills were horrible and the policy was changed periodically without notice
bad,Management seem out to get you. Job expectations are set to high.
bad,"I am a managers wife and worked there over 6 years. Went off work on a medical leave for 10 months. When I returned, I transfered to another part of the state. Two weeks later, I was wrongfully terminated. The general manager and his assistant gm said that someone said that I had said the ""N"" word. When I told them I didn't, he said that I never said that I didn't say it. Both of these managers knew me and knew my ethics from two other distribution centers that I had worked at and knew that I would never say that."
bad,Some of the most difficult parts of the job was the issues that would take place on the over night shift. Also the retraining of management that has been in the system for plus years. Learning how to reach the diversified staff as well as the management team made the journey worth the trip to see the progression towards the end result.
bad,"fast pace, never stop, go benefits if you have the right mind set"
bad,"Fast paced invironment, lots of customers/ challages,good work ethic."
bad,"In the two years of working at Wal-Mart #0778, I've been deceived many times. If I were to re-apply, it wouldn't be for that store. I definitely would not recommend any one to apply at Wal-mart. It's hard to get hired and very easy to get fired."
bad,"I enjoyed working with this company, very stressful most of the time Management is not the best a lot of brown nosing"
bad,they under paid me i worked in produce lifting heavy product
bad,"Within working for this company for fifteen years of service, I have learned the important values that matter to me most, which is to have great customer service skills and communication skills. I have been blessed to have worked for a company, that has provided me the experience that I have today within the medical field."
bad,"they get mad at you for clocking in early 5 -3 mins early. management tell use we have to b on time wich is good,but if you clock out late for helping someone you get in trouble for that."
bad,"Terrible work environment, high work for low pay and benefits. Employees may have little or no experience, or have difficulty communicating well. Managers frequently required to work up to 50% overtime with no additional compensation."
bad,i like work in wal mart.what shifts is hard for me.i want day shift job
bad,"No different than any other big corporate company.  Give an inch they’ll take a mile, they seemed to thrive on seeing employees stressed and upset. In fact they’d question you if you’d laugh too much or be too happy"
bad,Wanted to advance in this establishment. However nepotism and favoritism were a deal breaker. Staff onapproachable with the exception of a few. Co workers were great.
bad,The bad part of working there is management. They have no respect or personality. They dont say thank u or nothing. Changing everything around at the beginning at Feb and schedule changing.
bad,Managers and office managers treat they workers like trash tell them you being harassed they still don't listen no awards for the workers working on holidays without holiday pay
bad,"Hours cut, Always hiring new people, Management is literally a joke. Only saving grace is a few good co-workers. Workload grows larger and our pay stays the same. Wouldn't recommend working here long term."
bad,Walmart makes it look good to work there by paying ok but they bring you on as a part-time worker and have you working full-time hours you don’t qualify for no benefits other than medical dental vision and life Insurance and they keep you working like that for years you finally realize you deserve a job that values their employees and not just customers thats why there is never anyone to help you when you go shopping at Walmart
bad,The pay isnt the greatest and the amount of hours is terrible so there is no way to make an actual living. If you try to get a second job to help with bills and stuff they wont work with you on scheduling.
bad,"To much changes at the last moment, it is a difficult workplace when you have no one to trust, the people in charge do not know how to solve problems, I have more bosses than coworkers."
bad,"Unpleasant front end Customer service managers dis-coordinated didn’t know what task to give me more than a few times seemed unsure/confused even asked me what I should do (like I know, I just came to do a job I was hoping they would do theirs)"
bad,I like my job and what I do. The leadership could be better. My beliefs are in order to be a leader you have to inspire. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the best people.
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart and enjoyed the fact that it kept me moving and helped me get strong. However, since working there, I have had bad knees and hips. It is also a very dirty work environment. The company itself doesn't care much about their employees and views you as a number. The pay is great and the people you work with are nice. I acquired new skills, and they have benefits. If you are looking for a career that you will thoroughly enjoy and where the company cares, I don't recommend applying here."
bad,"They dont care about there workers, they talk to you crazy, there just horrible I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. The higher ups are just plain out rude."
bad,I was happy working there at first but over time I became un happy because of some of the things that went on there I felt like I was judged for having tourettes and just liking the things I liked
bad,Walmart was definitely not the place of work for me I felt unappreciated overworked and bullied every time I step foot on their property and the management team never did anything to make me feel more comfortable.
bad,"It was a great job at first then change came constant change. I worked their 3 and half years. Laid off job was outsourced! Never was ""transparent"" as they would say"
bad,Poor management on how they treat employees. No advancing unless you’re close with bosses. Too much drama. Nothing is confidential. cannot resolve anything with higher up store manager.. Lazy management. lazy associates get moved to full time. This has been the worst job due to the disrespect. Can’t even go in and do your job and go home without feeling threatened and picked on.
bad,My review was pretty simple and casual in a laid back. Question is simple and to the point on how it benefits what the company is looking for. And if it’s right for there company
bad,They need to hire more people at night stop putting the the pressure all on the little staff that they have. When one person has more then 8 hrs worth of worth they expect for the to finish the work zone there area put up the returns and then go to another department that has the same amount of work or twice as much and want that depart done as well
bad,you get an occurrence for everything! two 20 minutes break in 12 hours and you can't go outside!! management is rude and they don't care about employee happiness... hated that place
bad,"Overworked. Mandatory to work holidays except for Christmas Day. Poor management, there's usually confusion about what is expected. Broken processes. Some people work slow or not at all, so most of the time the backroom is filled with pallets"
bad,I was a good employee there I liked being on my own and working . Fast pace meant for a fast shift.  I ended up getting hurt and needed surgery and then they’re true colors came out
bad,"IT was very hard work"
bad,Management didn't treat coworkers as equals. I wasn't one of them but seeing people go thru it was enough for me to not work at that location for long once I realized how the head management treated people while others below them in the field turned a blind eye because they were getting a paycheck.
bad,"Tough place to work but if you build your strength, you would succeed. Motivate staff but only because you won't make it if you aren't. I liked the place but it could be a little depressing."
bad,The only time you can call in for an emergency is if you have PPTO if you don’t have (which has to earned by working so many hours) and you miss a day you get written up. If you don’t get production every week you get written up even if it’s lack of freight (something you can’t control. They say they have an open door policy but from my experience it only makes your manager mad at you and gives them room to retaliate
bad,"this is a good starter job for some one still in high school or going to college or retired and just looking for something to do with their day and not just sit at home. If you are some one looking for a well develop job this is not that place and this is speaking from experience."
bad,"This was one of the most uncomfortable working experiences I have ever had to endure! I love my job description duties and customers, however poor management by far."
bad,I used to love working here. I really enjoyed what I did. The job was causing me so much stress and anxiety that I had to get put on anxiety meds. If I could've transfer to another department I would've stayed.
bad,Never got a day off that I asked for. Wouldn’t work with me when my mom passed. Breaks were sometimes back to back and not spread out. Non paid lunch.
bad,"They don’t care about you or your health. They want the job done, that’s it. Most of it is just running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Wasn’t impressed when I transferred to Bemidji"
bad,Recieved points for going to the ER for a rupture in my gallbladder that could have went septic. Called hours in advance to tell them i would be going to the hospital. Was told to bring a form saying i was there and i did and still received 4 POINTS which was grounds for firing apparently. Management was made aware when i started working there that i had cancer/chemo/radiation
bad,"I have loved all my job duties at Walmart. It's very difficult to get them done in the time they allow, you are pulled in many directions without leaving time to get your responsibilities done. Training is very lacking and no flexibility in scheduling."
bad,They work you 40 hours for five weeks and on week 6 you will get 10 to 20 hours so you cant get full time. Management has there favorites. You do your job the managers and anything else they have for you to do. They dont give holiday time and a half or double time. And you cant ask for the days off and if you call on you get to point
bad,"If you were popular in high school you'll simply adore working at the beloit Wal-Mart. As long as you can kiss up, never miss any work and can work over time when asked youll be fine. However you can be punished for being too helpful, being too hard of a worked, or trying to change departments. The managers love their people unless you try to switch then suddenly they barely speak to you. However if you are one of their favorites you can get away with time theft, giving away discounts or merchandise as well as basically wandering around aimlessly. Heck my store thought those qualities were so grand they gave that type of employee a supervision position. Customers can sexually harass you, threaten your life or blatantly scream inches from your face and management will give them a gift. Card so they arent mad anymore. They dont care about their employees"
bad,"Worked for multiple stores and none of the management could get it together. Always short on staff, and most of the management was rude. Never got to break at a decent time. Definitely not the best place to work but a good starter job"
bad,Les gérants sont mauvais. Ils mettent trop de pression sur les employés. Ils sont incompétents et ils ne répondent jamais quand nous les appelons. Je suis toujours stressée et fachée lorsque je travaille chez Walmart.
bad,"The management can't come up to a consensus what they want you to do from a day to day basis, so you're going to have a single thing to do and at least 5 ways to go about it...in the space of 10 minutes that they want it done."
bad,Overall worked at two location it was the same everyone wants to get paid but no one wants to put their all into the job for what the company is paying mangement shouold take their job much more serious  good pay great benefits... Also if your looking for team work in the work place and a little guidence from upper mangement not happening  every man for them selves no one leads by example...
bad,"I been working as a casher first, hated the position, but move into maintenance crew member and to be honest I loved my job. helping customer loading up the car, meeting new faces and welcoming old ones as well. even awesome co-workers. yes it was challenging but I still enjoy it."
bad,"The training wasn't of high quality. The co-workers saved the day. Cannot recommend irt with any enthusiasm. Poor cash register training, unable to log on to hand held device to perform job tasks. Spoke to management but nobody evr cared if you could log on or not"
bad,"I was promoted to department manager after about a year of working there and was making decent money. However, they don’t give you the weekends off they say they will and you pretty much give your life to them having to work holidays and no set schedule. My boyfriend is an assistant manager and I rarely see him. I’ve heard every store is different, but mine is just awful."
bad,"Worst experience ever,"
bad,They give you terrible hours and terrible pay. It's always busy and some people are favored over Others. Management can either be a hit or miss. I don't recommend this place unless it's your first job.
bad,I loved my coworkers. They made the job fun and less stressful. Management was pretty good during the day. Graveyard managers were the worst. I worked there for eight years and wouldn't recommend working there unless it was during the day. I'd tell everyone to pass on the graveyard shift.
bad,i have worked at walmart for 8 yrs best record possible exceeds expectations started at pay $10.80 years of hard work and dependability mean nothing to this company all you do is make the people above you look good doesn't help you covering call in's micro-managing doing managements job and work ordering food and supplies while there on vacation you will get gratitude sure recognized for it sure but they will do anything but increase your pay. i started at $10.80 8 years ago i am now at $12.80 people fall into the trap of the family culture they try to foster to make everyone in the store a close community and friends don't fall for it get what you need and leave Corporate has been messing with the pay scale doing things like pushing back raises changing to percentages there very calculating and sneaky
bad,Not a place I'd recommend . You are replaceable and they could care less about you. I'd recommend finding a job where your contribution is praised instead of ignored
bad,They work you like a mule and treat you like one too. Management treats people there like children. Co workers act like children. Customers are broke and rude. Workload has doubled over the last few years as they eliminated entire departments.
bad,Walmart isn't a hard place to work but the management is the main reason why I want to leave. The job I have isn't the hardest but it's not the easiest either but i receive no recognition.
bad,Messy coworker and managers. Unprofessional. Worked there for 3 and was only part time. Never worked more then 32 hours except holidays. Managers pick and choose he attendance they wanted to over look. Workers drink on the job and all around rude
bad,"Worst management ever ! The CSM’s are nice, always very helpful but the managers are absolutely terrible. They’re rude and not helpful whatsoever, they make me extremely uncomfortable working with them !"
bad,Cashiers get NO hours..even when you stretch your availability.. and they’re what keeps the customers from just walking out with all that stuff. Ignoring my department change interests . Some managers dont know what they’re doing.
bad,"All comes down to poor management. The stability of your job depends on how much the current manager likes you, and managers were rotated every year.  A lot of immature,  lazy people. There were some good people and hard workers,  but mostly they didn't last too long.  Good temporary job, but not a secure job for the long run."
bad,Its a good job but the mangers dont do there jobs...and they dont tell you but u have to take a test if u fail 3 time ur fired and they also have a point system after 5 points ur fired and if you do get point they take for ever for mangers to take them off..no paid holiday and no paid holiday off
bad,"Pros: Several employee benefits. Health plans and paid vacations for part time employees."
bad,not able to speak on this company due to some legal issues so one must make there own judgement if one wants to work for the company and go from their own experience
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers. The worst part was the understaffing. On many days had to do 2 jobs because of the staffing issues.
bad,"The people you work with are great. Management expects the impossible. It doesn't matter if you need 5 to do the job but only have 3, you are expected to get it done."
bad,I'd never recommend this company to anyone unless the person only needs a job while completing their high education requirements. This place works it's associates very hard trying to meet the goal of keeping costs low. One associate is expected to be able to everywhere in the store and do all job types.
bad,"Walmart can be a fun and reasonably rewarding place to work but EVERYTHING depends on management."
bad,"they don't care even if you work for so many years. never appreciated the things that i contributed to the company. and never asked why i'm quitting."
bad,"Why can get this superstore was very stressful I didn't receive enough hours also didn't advanced up how I thought I would some of the workers IE my coworkers was disrespectful they didn't have respect for anyone."
bad,I feel the management and communication with the employees could be better more organization and just overall communication they could use a whole new management team
bad,"They literally tell you that they expect you to work like three people in orientation. Which I am used to. I have been in management for 18 years. I started out in produce, moved to cake decorator then was offered management within 6 months. You are expected to run two sometimes more departments with very little to no help. The pay is a joke for what they expect from you. Then if you decide it isn’t for you and you want to step down they cut your pay more than the raise they gave you for the position in the first place! I’m no stranger to hard work! I love it! But what Walmart expect is asinine!"
bad,"They offer insurance which is great. You get a store discount which i enjoyed. They aren't very understanding when you request a day off."
bad,It’s an ok job for young adults and teens in high school but you’ll learn very quickly Walmart isn’t and should never be a career move get what you need out of the place and move on
bad,In the 16 years I have watched as the core values of the company have degraded and the expectations of how we were to treat our people were intolerable for me work there any longer.
bad,"Very hard to get production with out drinking 8 energy drinks a day. The wear and tare on your body is relentless. The pay is great don't get me wrong but your body may not let you enjoy it. You may spend your off days trying to recover from the pain of all the lifting. Sleepless nights from all the caffeine you""ll have to take just to keep your body going."
bad,The management of Walmart was very much so not employee friendly. Coworkers would gossip and report false claims to management if they wished to get someone fired. The amount of time worked was not worth the amount of of money in your paycheck. It was hard to advance even if you wanted to. There was always a line of people waiting to be moved up to even the simplest position of CSM.
bad,Most of the associates that worked for the company were great. The management wasn't as great. They tried to see each other fail. I couldn't be like that.
bad,"Over all Walmart is a terrible job. This is only made worse/better by the people working there. Sometimes you get a good manager who will be flexible with your life realities and such. Sometimes you end up surrounded by toxic depressed individuals."
bad,"Working at Walmart was a fast paced job. Good management but not enough hours.  Freight and zoning wasn’t a bad job.   I loved working for the company but because I’m moving locations, and the lack of hours it’s just not working out."
bad,"Love my customers "
bad,"I read many reviews and a lot of them where very true . It’s a lot of politics, upper management is at times unfair , treats hourly poorly and has favoritism. It’s not a bad place to work it’s management , poor leadership that makes the job unfair and you lack the passion to keep going. Eventually you end up going somewhere else where you can be appreciated."
bad,I liked working at Walmart at first then I realized how the place work they expected way more from me then they did mostly everyone else they would hire
bad,Management at my Walmart is constantly lacking... We have new store managers almost every 5 months and the managers slack. My manager tells me i'm not needed and it bugs me. It's not fun to work under someone who enjoys to squash you like an ant.
bad,"Management is always avoiding their employees, ordering damaged goods on selves, refuses to assist consumers, not enough equipment to perform the jobs"
bad,The management was very rude and mean and the workers there mostly didn't properly work and it was a hostile work environment. overall i don't recommend to work at the Walmart I worked at.
bad,"They always treated people with disrespect, very hard to get a long with. Super bad management from my supervisor and just an overall bad place to work if you have anxiety"
bad,"I’m a part time student and I applied to be a part time worker at this company. When I got hired the same day I went in for my interview, I was told I could get up to 40 hours a week and still get my two days off for school. Although 40 hours a week in just 5 days seemed a lot, I was just happy to be there. But I realized quickly it wasn’t what I expected. My first couple of days were sketchy, as I was always confused on where to go and where to be. When I finally got somewhat setteled in, they put me on the floor with a bunch of new girls who knew about the same amount of directions as I did, which was nothing. I had to learn on the job mostly, and it didn’t help that my department manager wasn’t even there for almost 6-8 weeks. For the first couple of weeks I wasn’t meeting 40 hours, which was good for me personally because I had school and still had a life besides strictly work/school. But then slowly but surely, we had many associates quit, not show up, or get fired in the matter of weeks, leaving the department with minimal workers. We would then get in trouble for not being able to complete a shifts amount of work that should be split up between at least 8 people, with literally 3 people on the floor. It started to become impossible to complete work, especially when associates called in. Also, because there was less people, we started to reach 40 hours easily, which meant 9 hours a day (for 5 days) and 2 days off for school for me... which was stressful and honestly so draining. I was going to try and put in a availability request change to work less hours, but in the"
bad,"It's Wal-Mart. The managers aren't terrible people, but the company's policies aren't the most loyal to it's employees. The work isn't hard, but I would not recommend spending the little moments of life we have working at a Wal-mart."
bad,"if you like screaming than walmarts for you, or running around the store not being able to find management. night shifts are so slow its hard to stay awake."
bad,It use to be an enjoyable place to work but now the expectations are very unrealistic and very physically and mentally stressful. The management are very robotic and uncaring about people.
bad,I cought shoplifters for walmart worked with dcpd the hours were great however the drive was long I would have stayed but do to the management I am.no longer there
bad,"Management is the true problem. They work you like dogs, and don’t care about their associates at all. They don’t listen when you bring up problems that need to be addressed. The managers watch you struggle to do the work load, and then try to hustle you when you fall behind. They award people who don’t do their jobs properly and that are lazy."
bad,"It wont matter how hard you work, or even how safely you work. The store i pushed carts at, fired me over a row of carts lost control due to high winds. The high winds 45mph to 60mph gusts. Pushed the row out at the center nearly hitting a car that was parked in front of the garage we put them into. Keep a note that cards SHOULDNT be parked in a no parking zone to start. The same manager also coached me over petty things like phone use (Even when the lot was entirely clean.) Over a feud with another cart pusher who talked inside rather than did his job. "
bad,"A typical workday consists of one of your 6 managers telling you to do one thing while 3 more tell you 3 other things to do instead."
bad,I really hated working at wal mart because of the mangers don't know how to talk to adults. They try to treat you any kind of way and don't want to get treated like that.
bad,first time ever having a job from them  and I met cool people there  its was so nice then I  was told I  could go get  food cuz they give me 15 mins to relax  then its back to work they  told me I could go eat  some were when I get  back they  fired me
bad,"If I had been asked to review this company 3-4 years ago I would have given it all 5 stars. It was a wonderful place to work, with opportunity to advance and a lifelong career choice with competitive compensation and benefits. I never thought I would leave. But things change and unfortunately it has too. Very poor leadership from the top down and I expect them to go the way of Kmart. By the time I left it was not uncommon to see several people crying everyday trying and failing to meet the unreal expectations placed on them being so understaffed. Absolutely unnecessary for it to be so stressful to run a retail store. It's not hard to do if properly staffed."
bad,"A typical day at work sometimes can be a good day, as long management does not complain about anything. I learned that you always have to do your job in the best of your abilities. Bad management who never takes responsibility for their own actions instead they point fingers at the employees which is very unfair. Management always tell you to speak your mind, but when you do, they cuts you off while you're talking. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the employees who are not managers at all."
bad,Over all was happy with Walmart employee outcome. They offer Holiday bonused. You could request for more hours. Walmart treated their customers excellant.Customers are always right. I enjoyed Walmarts career choice pathways. Walmart alwsys strive for tbeir employees to succeed.
bad,Work was sometimes ruff. Often worked alone yet got work done. Most of the associates were like family. I was a full-time associate over produce. I learned the values of fresh fruits & veggies. The funniest part of the job was the customers & I cant say there were hard times because I over came them.
bad,Walmart is great to work for until you have worked for them. The management team is lacking in the area of care for customers and employees. The management team treats the employees like garbage. The managers care more about the numbers than they do about the quality of service or cleanliness. They also need to work on their training skills. Employees are put in their positions to do their job with a few simple computer tests and no actual hands on training. A typical day at work is not expecting your managers to listen to anything you say because you are not important enough for them to bother with. I learned that not all managers are professional. I also learned that if you are a friend of a manager they will overlook the fact that you spend your break getting high in your vehicle.
bad,Not enough time or to write all  the information needed about this place they work you until they can’t no more and expect you to do everything while attending customers
bad,Walmart was very stressful you have to pack boxes and you have to arrange things that people messed up and they do not give me enough hours and they want me to work late night shift and I cannot because I have class the next day so I quit
bad,work all night hard workn fast place the people I work with  was nices  I like working around people and helping people I like working in different departments
bad,"As someone with a college education I feel as though the work was somewhat terrible. There is NO work life balance. There is no overtime yet you work 15 hour days. Lastly coming into work with the constant threat that someone above you might come in and rip you and your area/store apart is terrifying. As an assistant manager EVERYTHING is your fault. "
bad,"Unachievable, unrealistic,  and untimely directives given. Unaccountability from one manager to another is unfair and biased based on whether they like you or not."
bad,"With the new management and the new schedule program, it makes it hard for people to work a full 40 hours a week. People depend on those hours and they just don't seem to care. I am not sure if other walmarts are like this, but my store is. Lack of communication is at that store too."
bad,I took this job as a quick fix. Not recommended long term. Get in and get out. Its a waste. Not a hard job more annoying than anything. For most of the employees this is the best they will do.
bad,2nd shift order filling. Have not worked the schedule I was told since i started. Was told no weekends yet they’re constantly making us work Sunday with little to no notice. They have 0 care for a person with a family. I informed them I home school my oldest daughter which Is why I couldn’t work 1st shift. Well 2nd shift has gone from 2:30 -12:30 tue-Fri.. To 2:30 until we want you to leave.
bad,"job was fun, happy they got rid of the uniforms. pay was okay . I enjoyed working there. im a was a cashier so my day was pretty smooth just rang my customers up and kept it pushing. sometimes i stocked, well i was honestly all over the store. i did gardening. i was in the paint section the photo section. anyways they'll put you anywhere if your a great worker but they wont increase pay."
bad,"Walmart is not an employee focused company.  It's all about doing more with less.  Customers are rude.  I'm sure that there are great store managers out there.  I did not have that experience.  My store manager was very condescending .  Very much an all about me type of person.  Specifically said in a morning meeting ""I will throw any one of you under the bus to save my job and do what it takes"".  Not a team player at all."
bad,"Poor management, very productive work place indeed, getting to work with others was very enjoyable, dealing management was the hardest part of my job."
bad,"At Walmart, it's not about qualifications; it's about politics. There's decent pay, good benefits, and usually plenty of hours, but if you're looking for a satisfying, rewarding job that you can call a career, Walmart isn't the place."
bad,"hard work and unfair to associates.4 day work week is good. very slow during the winter and loos alot of hours do to lack of work."
bad,"Terrible communication. No one there is on the same page or can keep up with the constant revolving door or new rules and policies. Walmart loves to write employees up and fighting a write up you do not deserve is next to impossible. They preach about safety and leaving the way you came but set up unrealistic volume goals and are constantly shortening the time they give you for trips. Management at this location simply looks at employees as a number. Had an incident a few weeks ago that I spoke with the GM about. She clearly was uninterested and not listening. She was not sincere at all and when she told me her “solution” she repeated the problem I spoke with her about back to me completely incorrect. Clearly she was uninterested. Also, management and higher up do not listen to employees and their suggestions to make the Distribution Center run smoother."
bad,they hire people that are not properly trained and therefore i feel like the employees are not getting the proper tools to do their job appropriately.
bad,I’ve worked at Walmart for just over a year and have had mangers come to me about being promoted so I went and did everything on my end to get there. They then never interviewed me and gave the position to someone else. The floor is always understaffed and the front end is constantly pulling associates from their own work to run register meaning you no longer have the tone needed to complete the tasks assigned to you.
bad,"My manager is fantastic, the company gets worse and worse, never thinking about the well being of the associate and only thinking about what can benefit the company."
bad,"Stay away from this place. No one will believe if something goes wrong. Senior technicians are from a different dimension. They just do their own thing. Only one Multi-tech there knows what is going on. When he leaves, the monkeys will begin to scratch their butts and sniff their fingers."
bad,It is a fun company to work for but is extremely exhausting depending on the area you work for. It does have great benefits but if you are a asm you have to work mandatory overtime without pay brings you are salaried
bad,They do not care of their employees. It is all about the bottom line with them. The benefits are not as bad as others which is the best part about Walmart but they would much rather have machines employed than humans.
bad,Walmart is all about the money! They tell you that you will get all kinds of raises and when kg comes down to it they drag there feet about iy and never do your evaluation until you put your foot down about it!
bad,"My Experience working for Walmart was okay, but it could have been better. I didn't feel comfortable with how they operated, sometimes the way they gave instructions. Management was okay but it depends on who the managers are. Walmart's pay rate was okay but wasn't enough to provide for myself."
bad,"loading freight in a truck, non stop conveyor belt, 20 minute lunch, 10 minute break but you take break in shifts. you run 4-5 lanes while your co worker is on lunch. very stressful.. treated like a number and less important that the freight."
bad,"Experiences at Walmart vary from store to store/Manager to Manager. I worked at 5 Walmart's and only liked 1 out of the 5. One store had a terrible store manager always in his office never on the sales floor unless a visit from the market manager or above. He lied and had his favorites. He was later demoted to an assistant and sent to another store. The management team was terrible except for 1 assistant. There was many older aged women working as department managers that were like old hens. They were mean and did not deserve to be DM's. There was cliques in the store that reminded me of high school. One assistant would sneak around and spy on associates and try to get them fired. She ended up getting fired after some of us complained about her with an open door to the market manager because the store manager liked her and covered her. The one nice manager mentored me and helped me become promoted to an assistant manager."
bad,"As a order filler at Walmart is was very repetitive. "
bad,"Very rude coworkers some made you do their work and some dont work ever so you get yelled at for them not doing their job. Many associates took longer breaks that the requured time,  especially the managers"
bad,Pay is decent for the work that you do but the supervisors and management are terrible. They will continue to raise their expectations over time and act like it has always been the same and make you look like you are slacking off. They say they want something done quickly but then show you a long drawn out way of doing something that takes twice as long as before. It takes months to transfer to a new department even after you have been replaced 4 times. If management doesn't like you they cut your hours out of spite. It's a great temporary job but don't stay over a year
bad,Very fast paced and always busy. They don't allow doctor notes. They don't give you raises with your evaluation when it's a excellent one. Management plays favorites.
bad,"I've had decent management here now and then but they usually don't last long. If you want to move to a new position you better become best buddies with the right manager. Also expect to do your job plus others since it's always understaffed, and then get yelled at when your area isn't 100% perfect. Also the way that you are told to do things will change with every new manager even though it's supposed to be standardized throughout all stores. Training is doing some cputer modules and then usually being left on your own to figure everything out."
bad,"Walmart will over work you, and the pay isn’t worth the jobs they have you preform. As a personal shopper I’m still asked to work nearly every other department in the store, with no compensation/ gratitude being shown towards me."
bad,If you're under 150 pounds and do not work out this is not the place for you. Kinda hard to lift 80 pounds over head 15 different times within 5 minutes
bad,"Management is alright but rarely care, usually we have a lack of people to be able to properly finish our work which leads to a stressful environment, stocking freight our usual hours will be about 2-4 hours greater than the number of people we have assigned to an area aswell as the trucks rarely being on time with the freight so we usually have a later start. Overall bad."
bad,"A typical day at work would include: Planning, and creating modular inventory floor plans. Ensuring that inventory is on the sales floor when needed, cleaning the backroom."
bad,your work is never done. what i learnt is that after giving so much time they'll just easily replace you no matter what kind of situation you're facing
bad,Very strict place too work good pay and days off but work environment sucks..Money really isn't everything and this place made me discover that. They lure you in with the good days off and pay
bad,If you enjoy being treated like you are a price of garbage than this is for you.  The management likes to give you impossible tasks that can take the whole day. They wonder why turnover is 140%
bad,"This is a good job for someone trying to get their foot into the retail door. Just don't expect a whole lot from management, human resources, supervisors, co-workers, security or anyone for that matter"
bad,"Some managers will make work feel great others will rip you apart. Very prejudice vibe from some managers. Wouldn’t recommend working there, really not fair to its employees."
bad,In the mornings its the best the mangers are very respectful. The afternoon was the worst. The main boss blames you for every little thing. Myself got fired over not putting in the ups codes right and they got upset on helping me with it durning training. I enjoy the staff there rally great and love the hours i was making but the pay wasn't good.
bad,"The pay is not as bad as other places, that is one positive I can give. Wal-mart is a hard place to land a full time at. Even if you have worked part time for over a year, they are still hard to gain a full time with. No one knows what theyre doing, everything is hearsay from management."
bad,"If you need the money walmart is an ok place to work. They really hate unions and will force you to watch this anti union propaganda video and even answer question on it later. I wouldn't go there thinking you will get a promotion or ever advance much higher that maybe supervisor, I knew some people working there for 18 years who had never really had a vertical promotion."
bad,"At that time, we had overnight managers that were bias to personal/professional relationships (which was actually against policy, however, still practiced anyway.)"
bad,"Aprendi que é cada um por si, bater metas sem respaldo, correr atrás da execução de seus serviços e dos demais colegas de trabalho sem apoio algum."
bad,"fazia muito desvio de função, saia logo depois do horario"
bad,"Honestly I don’t have anything great to say about this company besides the benefits. You’re overworked and unpaid. You’re not allowed overtime, work is year round. No holiday pay, only close once a year."
bad,"Terrible way to treat associates with the recent job elimination process completely handled the wrong way there were other ways to ensure associates weren't elimated after 20, 30,+ years simply terrible"
bad,"I cannot recommend  anyone work here, the environment was just toxic. Between being reprimanded for doing exactly what your manager tells you because their boss wasn't happy with your managers decision, to the harassment complaints being unaddressed and more. this place holds no love for their employees."
bad,"Working at walmart isnt a fun or health place to work."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart would be going in all ready then go to work star cooking chickens and other meat,I then make some salads then serve customers. I learned how to cook chicken and fry up some popcorn chicken. The management was okay I was taught a couple things the first day then had to figure out where everything else was on my own. The hardest part was when the coworkers would always argue with everyone cause they didn't do it they wanted them to. The most enjoyable parts was when I was cooking and doing the dishes."
bad,"walmarts new pay program is insulting to associates who have been there a long time"
bad,"They tried to deny my work injury, switched me to a position where the staff (and customers alike) begun harassing me throughout my entire shift every day but I couldn't get in touch with the manager about this. Some even rammed their shopping carts into my person. This, on top of personal issues at home, and my work injury, led me to stop working. When I quit, I had an extreme bout of anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation and decided not to call in to quit because I didn't want to hear their voices anymore. They promote people based on how long they have been there but not by work skills/work ethic."
bad,When  I worked at Wal-mart it was a great place to work until they hired their New Store manager He came in with the ideal to Fire all the Full time employees and He has done that almost.
bad,"Depending on your job title, The responsibilities are different.  If you are a head you deal with the assignment of duties and hours.  Stockers are charged with filling shelves, and Cashiers only ring up people."
bad,"Work hard and the job will be easy. "
bad,They require your schedule to be wide open so your schedule is all over the place. Management does not care about you and are usually incompetent. They try to find reasons to get you fired if they don't like you.
bad,the management was really bad they only cared about themselves and what made them look good and did care about there subordinates. It would also take them forever to get you help.
bad,"Never a day that Wal-mart wasn't busy. Barely got time to get to know your coworkers due to management rushing you to come back from break, ALWAYS encountered rude customers."
bad,"Walmart is a company that recognizes that employees are easily replaced. They don't treat their associates very well, in my opinion. The pay is low, and there are no benefits. I haven't worked there for many years so some of these things may have changed."
bad,"Friendly and approachable demeanor helps connect to customers looking to understand their health needs"
bad,"Short breaks , poor management,  chaotic scheduling, decent pay , barely no overtime ,  advancement in company rarely happens , favoritism happens often."
bad,Not the best place to work at lots of people were using drugs but the work was okay and I did very well. I wish there was a better feeling for advancing in the company.
bad,"My opinions of WM would be completely different if the end of my career there had been handled differently.  WM was wrong and their idea of being Family is NOT true.  My Family is still around me and supportive of me.  WM jumped ship when I really needed a supporting ""family""."
bad,"some consumer and ever mangers are hard to deal with. it was fun at first but then you see the true colors of working at Walmart, stressed me out and wasn't a dream"
bad,"didnt like the service, happy work place full of smiles, management is hard to come by and the greeters are greeting, cashiers are slow, the shelves are unorganized"
bad,the job is enjoyable between employees: lack of full training from poor management for job advancing: but new very young new students are dept managers: orders of items arent paid attention to.
bad,"The most enjoyable aspect of the job is working 10 hours a day for 4 days a week."
bad,"Love helping the customers. Most of them are awesome. But management doesn't seem to care about it's employees. If there is an issue, rarely are both sides of the story heard. Very hard to get support from management. Favoritism is rampant."
bad,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for 6 years at 2 different locations.  After 6 years of personal observations, and talking with employees at other locations,  the common complaints that seem to be rampant throughout Walmart culture involve poor management, and management playing favorites. I completely agree."
bad,"No work/life balance.  Hostile work environment.  Excessive work hours without compensation if salary.  Cut hourly associate hours, uses management as free payroll. Spoken to with disrespect, and threaten with long work days or losing job constantly"
bad,"I worked in the bakery, I learned new skills, like baking bread and donuts, which was fun. "
bad,Never flexible and not enough communication. I learned that u have to treat ur employees just like the customers and have the same respect that u have with ur customers. Working as a team is what makes a business and not everyone is their for a career they are only their to get a check. Hardest thing about working for this company was walking on ur tip toes to make sure things was right. What I like about here was coming to work and knowing that my associates was happy to see me on a regular basis
bad,Worked there 6 years 11 months. Was being paid as much as new associates coming in the door. Busted my hump for that place and in the managers eye it was never good enough. I never went back after the way I was belittled. The mental anguish wasn't worth it no more. Managers should be held accountable for their actions.
bad,"Managed stock levels and proper pricing for multiple product lines."
bad,A typical day at Walmart is stressful. I have learned that people can really take your abilities for granted. If you can't take the heat do not apply for this company.
bad,They are very rude and expect you to do ridiculous amount of work in so little time and one manager is very sarcastic and just sits down while everyone else works
bad,Management micromanages every little detail of your shift. They have a lack of concern for customers. If you are sick they threaten to fire you. They have absolutely no compassion for anyone. Employee or customer.
bad,"every Walmart has potential to be a great place to work at but they have to follow whats in the best interest of their shareholders"
bad,The managers were rude to employees and they hired anybody and nothing was never done and customers were confused because they were told too many things
bad,It's a job.  If you are in a rough place work there. You get paid. Unless you are high management I don't see why you would ever want to work there for a while
bad,"Being a Customer Service Manager (CSM)  wasn't exactly a hard job. It was easy and fast paced. The day always went by fast. The only time it got hard is when there was not a lot of coverage. "
bad,"I did various jobs here, I myself did not find much enjoyment working here but paid the bills temp. Hard to get your work recognized with management. Overall experience was ok but nothing to brag on."
bad,"Management was by far the scummiest thing about the place. Work wasnt hard, hours were decent for high pay. The managers though, oh boy. They would call you to see if you would work extra hours in your department, only to get thrown into a department you had 0 training on when you got there that day and they expected you to perform. Let me re-iterate that. With no training. I was an electronics rep. I didn't know how to run sporting goods. I got fired because i wasn't performing that day"
bad,Managers are very condescending. They bury you with notes on top of your daily routines and expect everything to still be completed. Managers Hinder your work by taking associates and assigning to other departments. Managers felt like they were working against you.
bad,"Rude management and staff, lack of training and not enough to do to stay productive, lots of standing around and was very repetitive. Did not really learn a lot during training and management was unwilling to be any type of helpful"
bad,I liked working there but the policy for absences was outrageous. The managers were nice and so were the coworkers but when it came to being sick or in the hospital they wouldn't accept doctors notes for anything
bad,They hired me so that was nice. Pay is awful. Management was usually unavailable. Favoritism definitely exists. They've made some changes from what I hear but pay is still low. Great as a second job as they are part time
bad,dont be a single parent and work here. they do not work well with working with single parents who only can work certain hours. they have shifts and things to do but they deny.
bad,I would do anything I can not to go back there! The things I've seen and heard from many stores is shocking and horrible! They no longer care about the employee or their families.
bad,As a first job i would recommend walmart. As a career i would not. Most employees are cross trained and expected to fill roles they are not paid for. They tend to hire for part time however; schedule full time hours until they get to a point that they must change status to fulltime at which point they drop hours back down tl part time.
bad,Walmart does not care about it's employees and they do not pay near enough for what they want you to do. I would rather shovel dirt all day than work their again.
bad,"Management would sometimes give conflicting orders. There seemed to be little to no communication between the different departments. They would expect us to work as a team--not a bad thing in itself--but then would wonder why the smaller departments kept falling behind, and would crack the whip without hearing the staff out or attempting to fix the problem. The pay raises were nice, though."
bad,"Working at Walmart offers a paycheck but the morale is often dismissed by management. "
bad,Wal-Mart will over work expect you to come in early and stay late to do the work of two people but don't want you to have over time or get paid for it .
bad,Gran ambiente de trabajo Horarios cómodos y crecimiento laboral
bad,"I made great money for being an 18 year old man, but it was a horrible job. The managers were very unfair and rarely told the truth. When they were caught in a lie, they would brush it off like nothing. Slaved for 10+ hours a day four times a week, and often had mandatory overtime."
bad,Managers don't want you to succeed. The system is set up for you to fail. You only get 4 attendance points in 6 months. To any student that is quite impossible.
bad,Checked customers out. took returns and exchanges. Learned that you can't make every customer happy but you should always try. The associates were great people. Management was not that attentive to the associates.
bad,"Management changes their minds frequently on tasks; blamed for not completing some. Associates are awesome, and the only reason I have stayed for two years; they see the real issues in the store, and are good to talk with for ideas. Salaried Management, except maybe three good people, only cares about themselves and their advancement. If they're to blame for something, they can and will pin the blame on you; if they want you gone then they will try anything they can to get you to quit, or get you fired. It's very easy to get on Management's bad side merely by going to them about your department's issues; i.e. I work in the food area, and there is rust and mold in my department, which they don't seem to care about."
bad,"I did the deli first I made manager within four months then I went to customer service. I handled online orders that were picked up in store.  As well as any complaints, concern she and returnes"
bad,I have alot to thank Walmart for but the way they treat their employees who actually work is disgusting and intolerable.  The company talks about being there for the customer yet their actions state they are just there for the profit.
bad,"This was a fine job while I was in school, but there were so many problems with this job. managment had un reachable goals for us and that brought down moral. Mangement also blamed you for stuff you didn't do or would think you did something wrong. for example.. Managment always said i took longer breaks when I didnt or would say break was over when i just sat down. There were some good managers, but not enough"
bad,Management consists of on average 7 people daily with every other one telling you something completely different that contradicts the others. Advancement is there if you want it but be prepared to work 60-70 hours a week.
bad,"Walmart is a great job to start off with due to the fact that they give everyone equal opportunities. The pay is decent and getting plenty of hours is never an issue, for you will receive plenty of work hours."
bad,"this company stresses me out, management is no good at all, they don not treat employees fair enough to keep people or staff. they have a very high turn over. dealing with management that is no good is the hardest part."
bad,no the manager are not right they just go after becuase they think they are the bosses they do not treat you right they have favoritisim they pay you good but some mangers are not good
bad,"My shift was strictly from 3-11:30 with no rotation of weekends or day shifts. I would get to work at 3 and stat unloading a truck, after the truck was unloaded you were to stock all the items from the truck in a given time. Management was terrible as they never work with their employees strength and weaknesses. Hard work is rarely appreciated."
bad,"Going in a hundred directions at once as management wanted 10 things done yesterday and didn't tell you until today, 2 hrs before quitting time. Management expecting a task to take the same amount of time in every department, not taking into consideration in one department a task need only be completed once as the item is only in one place. Where as in another department the task needs to be performed 10 times as there are multiple places an item may be throughout the store."
bad,Managers have bad attitudes and are mean. I learned how to operate a register and how to deal with upset customers. I enjoyed conversing with customers and checking out their items in a timely manner.
bad,out of like 30 lines they only open two the only time they open more lines is when the head bosses come down then they open all of them they are fake and work you like dogs
bad,"they say they are family oriented, but they arent"
bad,"Stocking shelves for which ever department need assistance."
bad,"Don't work here, the money is great, but it is a toxic environment. Writes up are handed out for almost everything, management is disorganized and uninformed on policies. Policies are insane, for example, if you injure yourself they write you up for it. If management does not like someone they will find reasons to write you up so they can walk you out the door which winds up creating an us vs them mentality."
bad,"Walmart culture may be fine for some, but I found it to be a chaotic environment where demands were high and human relations, soft skills, and emotional intelligence were lacking, with a few exceptions. Management seemed more interested in their backroom meetings and numbers than relating to their associates. I never want to work there again."
bad,Someday's I would come into work and find we are so understaffed its ridiculous. There would be me and one other employee to unload two to three 53 foot trailers full of merchandise. We were expected to do so I a matter of two hours or less.
bad,The work at the warehouses sucks. Hard work in a hot warehouse. In the summer you're sweating so much your clothes are soaked. Only 2 breaks if you work 8 hours. No lunch break.
bad,"Me gusto haber trabajado en esta empresa ya que aprendi mucho, entre como ejecutiva y a los 3 meses me nombraron Gerente, la relacion con mis compañeros fue coordial y de cooperacion,lo que no me gusto fue que no habia descansos por falta de personal y fue dificil adaptarme a no descansar en 3 meses por eso renuncie"
bad,"Walmart were OK due to favoritism with the managers ,Besides that it were magic, Pay were good ,Customers made my day ,Dealing with customers is the best feeling in the world"
bad,"This is an overall good company. The only reason I am wanting to leave is because I don't really feel appreciated for the amount of work I do. Also I do not like being told by one manager to do one thing, and then something else by another, and then have one or the other get mad. They are however very flexible with hours, and provide many benefits. I personally just want something more rewarding."
bad,"Expect to break your back if you're orderfilling.Management lies to you and is always looking for a reason to write you up.I see good reviews,but I don't know one person there who doesn't absolutely hate the job."
bad,Very strict work environment in which it is possible to advance to a certain point. The moral is extremely low due to upper management.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart for me consisted of working re- shops out to the sales floor, attending to customers, working out freight, operating a cash register when lines grew long, attending the fitting room, and answering calls. I worked 2 to 11 four days a week, and one 6 hour shift."
bad,It's okay to work at Walmart. I love my Co-Workers they're awesome people to work with. Can't really say much about the managers. Some are cool to talk to as a person but as a worker didn't like them that much. There was so much miscommunication between the managers. That at times working at Walmart were difficult
bad,"Production quota was very high.  30 pallets per hour.  It took me 20-30 minutes just to unload most trailers, and then I had to break all the pallets down according to a height sheet.  Space was an issue, and often I found myself never having enough of it to work in.   As if all of that wasn't challenging enough, there wasn't enough forklifts and clamp trucks to go around.  So I was usually stuck walking around the distribution center, wasting precious time, looking for equipment to use.  People generally didn't want to share the clamp trucks because they were in such short supply.  All of this lead me to consistently fall short of my quota."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a year and I realized what poor people are like when they get power. All the CSM`s were the Assistant Managers girlfriends so he would never listen to any complaints about them. The zone manager would belittle cashiers in front of customers. The store manager wouldn`t listen to any complaints either. One time, an Assistant Manager called the police on a lady for asking to see the policy on price matching, and had her escorted out by security with her children. I would walk into this place and get physically sick, I wouldnt suggest anyone work here unless you just really need the money, and sadly so many of my coworkers went home depressed because they were treated so badly by management, but they cant afford to get another job. I worked black friday, I had to be away from my family, but I was ok with being around my coworkers. Management told us we couldnt even talk to each other. This Wal-mart needs to be cleaned out of its old workers. Even so, I wouldnt suggest anyone work here unless they need money!"
bad,"Working at Wal-mart can be a frustrating experience if you have an issue that needs to go past your pay grade, because most of the time information fails to travel between ranks. The work itself is fairly simple, although somethings are a little ambiguous. As long as everything is lined up correctly it isn't the worst job, but if you need to do anything other than your job (I.E. change hours, attend an alcohol serving class, etc.) than prepare to be disappointed"
bad,"Walmart was attempting to implement a new inventory management system for stocking and back stocking. Unfortunately, the hand-held devices were outdated and malfunctioned often. Additionally, there was not enough space in the back room for proper and safe storage of products."
bad,Wal-Mart can be a great place to work like it was before the management that is there now(walmart4484). Good enough pay but not good enough hours. The managers do not listen although they act like it. There are good managers but there are very few. I only mean this store in specific.
bad,"Every night is the same night! You clock in have a meeting in the break room with all of the associates and with all the overnight managers. During the meeting you are given a task from the head manger for the night to tell you what department you are to be working in and how long it should take you to put the merchandise up. Also they give incites on whats right with the store and whats bad, events or issues and lets not to mention what we can improve on associates of the store.After the meeting the associates are walking towards there departments and start working on their pallets. Some pallets smaller than others and some even taller/bigger or messier than others either way it had to get worked. Even if you have 10 hours of freight and you only had 8 hours of your shift. Wal-Mart does not provide the store with a good amount of maintenance positions so all associates would have to clean up in their own area. They don't provide enough experienced workers and don't help advance their alumni workers. Every sales associate/stocker  is provided to do there tasks and also complete other tasks that the managers don't want to do there self. There is a lack of management skills at Wal-Mart because most make bad or poor choices when under pressure. They tend to overlook constantly with what the associates need or suggest.The hardest part of working there would be dealing with the managers because they think the associates don't know whats best for the store. They definitely stop acknowledging the overnight crew and don't treat them once in a while anymore. The most enjoyable part of"
bad,They lie to you so you will take the job they tell you that you will work 4-10'a but it's more like 4 days a week 7 hours a day.they want you to do 12 hours of work in a 7 hour day and they can't understand why everyone quit
bad,I don't feel the need to explain this company. Every stereotype you may have seen or heard is very much true. Working in the backroom keeps you safest and up front as a cashier is the worst.
bad,"Management has no idea what they are doing, if they no longer want you employed they will find a way to get you out. The hardest part is learning all the departments without being helped or taught."
bad,"Provided excellent customer service by acknowledging the customer issues and concerns. "
bad,"I loved all the people who I worked with and associated with at Walmart until it got to management who were awful, with the exception of my department manager and support manager, every other manager was useless and careless about their employees. Job was super easy, just tedious, with little effort given by me and my associates after we learned that none of us were appreciated at all for the unethical place called the ""Walmart Family"". I did not learn a thing from the CBL training and got all of my knowledge from the fellow people that worked around me, once again not the management. The typical day was a bunch of redneck losers who walked in thinking they were the master race, and mixed in were some mean old people who had nothing better to do than to tell the world their life sucked and ours should too. Also if you could not figure things out quick enough you would be cussed at, or have your job threatened by the customer, which usually was a blow off since I was pretty much the main guy on my half of the store. Other than that it was not a half bad job, the pay was decent, and surprising hard to get fired for some reason that I could just not figure out."
bad,"stock shelfs, ask customers if they found everything alright, throw the trucks put the items where they belong, clean up, take a  mintue break"
bad,"They will give an arm and a leg for customers. Customers are always right.  Even  when they are wrong they are right, and make s you look stupid."
bad,Walmart is a great place it was just the store that I was at wasn't all that great. poor management and even worse employees.
bad,"Pharmacy is great, but the management sucked!!!!! As a starting pharmacy tech, they scared me from working in another pharmacy. The way I was treated was unfair."
bad,"As a junior manager I found it was difficult to communicate my wants and needs to my direct supervisor because they were always too busy, and I'm not the type to let my questions and concerns go unaddressed. On top of that I did not feel safe or comfortable at work. If it wasn't customers sexually harassing me, then it was my co-workers and again this was something I was unable to ever share with my high ups. It go to offensive that I had to quit without notice eventually after just three weeks - something I have never done in my LIFE and hopefully never will have to do again..."
bad,"I liked the place and people "
bad,"Instrucciones diarias de ejecución. trabajo en equipo, decarga de contenedores, recibo en sistema, relocalización de productos"
bad,"i was hired here during the holiday time for the big christmas rush."
bad,I clock in and see where  I need to go and then try to stock the shelves in a timely manner. When they call for register train up front I usually have to go up front and help until the lines are down.The hardest part of the the job is trying to remain calm when dealing with customers or other associates.
bad,"this job has great people to work with they had  friendly customer, and it was always safe work space good benefits and over all a ok place to work at."
bad,"rwwe got in at 4am in the morning "

bad,"A Typical day at work was always busy."
bad,they job gives you long hours which I like but I don't like that don't except unexcused absents. but they do give you long hours and long meals which is hour that okay.
bad,"ENJOYED MEETING DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS . HAVING THE SUPPORT OF OUR MANAGERMENT TEAM . THEY ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE COMMUTINES . SUPPORTING ASSOCITE IN AVANCEMENT IN THE COMPANY.•Provided assistance in the operation of multiple departments and driving sales."
bad,"Good times with coworkers "
bad,"se trabaja 8 horas de horario corrido,el ambiente laboral no es muy bueno,tenes treita minutos de descanso controlado y sancionado si te pasas,todo se paga,nada es gratis.Aprendi muchas cosas,sobre todo a no ser frontal dado a que pueden surgir inconvenientes con lo directivvos,lo que mas me gusto es la atencion al publico."
bad,"A typical Day consisted of me monitoring my area , folding clothes, putting up returns and doing freight. I learned how to stay organized and detail- oriented. Co- workers were helpers and hardworkers."
bad,"There was never just a typical day , everyday I found myself doing something different then what my job code said . I was constantly learning things about all different departments , including my own , and had to learn about every new product we started carrying . "
bad,"As a sales associate in the hardware department my duties included assisting customers in hand tools, paint etc for projects. I learned a lot about this job mostly from customers about enhancing daily life on a budget...my co-workers were from all walks of life and I greatly enjoyed working with them. The job was very simple. The managers are very reasonable people."
bad,I like to interact with customers because life will make no sense if people don't interact which each other. Wal-Mart is a nice place to work I just want to do something more professional.
bad,"Managers run this store like a prisoner camp. it is no longer enjoyable to work for this company. I love what I am doing but not whom I m doing it for.  "
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of merchandising, supervising by zones, creating ""retailtainment"" displays, inventory management."
bad,"worked as a cashier, my store location was very unorganized. Days went by fast. Management was okay"
bad,"Horarios malos no definidos, mal ambiente, malos tratos, mal salario."
bad,"You will learn a lot with this job however it can be unreasonably stressful to deal with management turnovers, and hostile co-workers who are trying to sabotage your good name. I have never worked for a company where you had to actively watch your back or where their were so many conspiracies to get you fired."
bad,Walmart is a great place to gain a lot of experience in different areas of the store. The hardest part of my job now is the lack of compensation for the amount of work being done.
bad,A typical evening at work see customers all through the night work with co workers laugh joke a lil complete assignment through the night management check over work.Coworkers were awesome management a diffren story.This job was temporary til i found what i need it got me through school.If i went back i would do part time.This is my last choice to go back to
bad,Wal-Mart is a bad place to work the management are mean disrespectful people but the work its self isn't that bad
bad,"se trata de um depósito,onde os colegas e a gerência trabalham por um mesmo ideal que é o atingimento das metas,a parte mais difícil seria o excesso de esforço físico diário,mas o coleguismo e o incentivo tanto dos colegas tanto da gerência e líderes era uma motivação a continuar e fazer o que tinha que ser feito com perfeição."
bad,"I learned that you can grow from what you already know!"
bad,"Had family issues, management would not help make a solution so quit. Never gave you the right amount of breaks you were supposed to have."
bad,Not a fair company to work for . They were not very equal to their employees.
bad,"law mart  is the worst pleas. i have ever worked."
bad,"Nights at Wal-Mart are pretty much all the same as always fun relaxed and not as many customers as the day time so that means we can get more work done. What I've learned about this job is people come to wal-mart overnight for a number of reasons, one clubs or either opening or closing and another is a easier shopping experience getting in and out because theirs not that many people in the store. Management took the jobs to heart sometimes they could be fare and working with us both most of the time unfair and letting their problems getting in the way of their jobs. My co-workers were the best people to work with we were a big family all the way around,working with my co-workers was probably the best part of my job and the hardest would most definitely be working with the management team."
bad,"During my time working for walmart I've not met a challenge I could overcome, of course working there hasn't presented any thing challenging, every thing was easy but the only thing I thought was difficult was working in an area that I was not familiar with. The people I worked with were very friendly I enjoyed working with them very much. The management was good for the most part but their operating procedures need a lot of improving when it comes to freight."
bad,Wal-mart is a parasite for workers livelihood. It feeds on people and leaves them dead on the side of the road with nothing gained from their time spent working there.
bad,"Unreasonable productivity quotas, but the overnight frozen goods gig would be great where the critical factors don't keep getting changed."
bad,"I believe that Wal-Mart is good for highschoolers and elderly. They dont pay hardly anything, and they expect you to do everything."
bad,"nothing is enjoyable about the job except the people you work with. Some managers, not all, do care about you. You xcome in to your job knowing what to do, but management changes evrything you been done ,then in a few days it should have been what you were gone do the first time."
bad,Management is somewhat disorganized but co-workers are pretty nice. Very reluctant to give out full-time status. Hardest part of the job is unstable hours. No room for advancement and was only offered a position as cart pusher.
bad,Primeira oportunidade como caixa grande conhecimento com diversos tipos de atendimento ao cliente
bad,"When i first started working at walmart the management and everyone seemed to be in a good mood, we received reguloar bonuses. Our store manager then got promoted and the new manager was not as productive and rarely gave praise or awards when deserved. There then began to be a high ammount of favoritism. If you were just there to work, you were an outsider. Most managers claimed to be there for the job, yet they hung out with employees at bars and clubs on their days off. It is not a very proffesional place to work at. There are a lot of individuals who care more about each others gossip than the job itself."
bad,"Primary duties include satisfying customer needs by applying “customer comes first” mentality, assisting customers to locate all products requested while maintaining a professional demeanor and operating register.  Also responsible for selling fishing licenses, equipment and sporting goods."
bad,Overnight stocking with drama did not the way some manager would treat the employees work extra hard and treated like your something under a rug everyone just wrong to me
bad,Working for Wal-Mart was stressful due to the fact that you have to answer to many different managers who all want you to do a particular task completely different then how the last manager wanted it done. The pay was not great and the quarterly raise system was unfair and completely biased.
bad,Working at walmart was alright alot of bad attitude from managers like there better then anyone else there.Management dont help associates that arnt happy to well. They think they can controll everyone.Pay is good though.
bad,"Walmart is a billion dollar company that underpays their employees and has terrible policies. I enjoy my job due to the people i work with, but everything else i can't stand."
bad,"Wal-mart starts you off with an extremely low pay rate. Usually barely over minimum wage, maybe a dollar (assuming you don't really have any relevant work history. Still not typically paid well even if you do.) if you're lucky. The work isn't always very difficult, but the time you spend working there isn't worth it."
bad,well i learned that good things do come to hard workes nd that its not a job if love what you do i get along very well if my co-wokers the most part i enjoyed about the job is that when im done with the job this that the customer is happy and management were ok
bad,"There are so many negative things about Wal-mart, and the negative connotation given to people who are epmloyed there. This is why the people that work there don't care about how well they do their job nor do they care about customer service. As a result, no one who works there is ever pleased or pleasant. This makes it rather difficult to want to go to work every day."
bad,"A typical day of work consists of signing onto the register, Then I proceed to assisting customer that come to your lane to check out. If there are no customer's who which to check out then I zone and clean my area. Ask cusotmer if they need any help or ready to be checked out. Assist customers with returns on merchandise that is damaged, to small, recalled or missing pieces. Also help in money center where I cash payroll, government checks and money orders purchased from walmart."
bad,Incompetent leadership
bad,I worked here for 2 1/2 years.I started working every aisle in grocery.Than i settled in frozen food.It was a big mistake because when i worked in the freezer there was no team work.Management started really sucking badly.Always hounding you and making threats in restrooms and where there were no cameras.I was hurt because a manager left me alone on a ladder in the ice cream freezer and i fell 25 feet on the cement floor. And he never cared what happened and quickly denied any wrong doing. i had to sue walmart and resign from the company. So anyone who thinks walmart is a great company they are until you are no good to them then they throw you under the bus and forget about you. So beware!!!!!.They were great to work for before things went bad.Great schedule and consistant.I enjoyed my job until that day.
bad,It was really easy and fun to work her but the supervises fired me just because I didn't get along with them. It was very unprofessional.
bad,I disliked working here. I did my job well but they store was never unorganized and the CSMs were all ways rude.
bad,Walmart in itself is not a bad place to work. The biggest draw back is that they put profits above their emplyees ability to accomplish basic tasks. They fail to adquately staff many departments and this creates an overburden on those in that department that work for very minimal pay. It is impossible to get all taskings accomplished to meet the demands of the customers.
bad,The particular store I worked at the management was rude and disrespectful and you could not advance at all.
bad,the hardest part about working at Walmart is the  Rude customers and the managers ste sometimes hard on you I dont think I learned anything from working here
bad,I would never work for Walmart again. I was put in the hospital for 5 days and while I was in the hospital I was fired. No notice. No call from a manager or nothing. I went to log in and it said I was an inactive employee. They told me they were sorry I was in the hospital but it was nothing they could do. Sad company to work for. Especially if Deon is your manager.
bad,You will never catch up or get a day off. You will have anxiety during breaks and work overtime every week. Kiss your personal life goodbye. Turnover rate is extraordinary high.
bad,"The store is understaffed in almost all areas, but despite this, we only get a few new hires every few months, most of whom don't stick around. There are also several pieces of equipment that have needed repairs for months. This has lead to a lot stress on myself and my coworkers."
bad,"Horrible company and managers, no one is happy which makes it hard to be good to customers with poor management. I have worked in retail for years before this and this was the worst experience of my life. I'd rather take a pay cut than to work here ever again."
bad,Walmart has the need to take care of all and every customer. Workers were to handle customer vehicles with care and return them back clean. Able to identify any mechanical issue and report it to the customer.
bad,"Walmart was 90 percent great in Oklahoma,  north Carolina, than when i got to new castle Pennsylvania it all changed. The people at that walmart are inbread and under educated. And if your not born there or if your iq is higher than 80 . The managers treat you as the enemy. That store should be shut down."
bad,Over my 26 year career with Walmart the company has made drastic changes to automate all aspects of its operations in an effort to reduce payroll and human resources. It looks good to Wall Street but not as good to the associates.
bad,"Working for the company would have been a lot better if my managers were better. Benefits are not too bad, but don't get sick or call in. You'll be in a lot of trouble of you do"
bad,The managers suck. All they care bout is pushing freight which you’ll never have enough bodies to do so. If the night crew doesn’t do their job it carries on down and there’s no accountability being held at all
bad,"Walmart is not a great place to work. Management doesn't treat you fairly. They treat you like you are a robot and give you time limits to get things done, but the time limits are unrealistic."
bad,There’s a lot of favoritism and just unfairness all round the store no matter the department. the whole store kinda reminds me of like jail but a little worse because at least in jail you know when your brakes are going to be scheduled.
bad,Fast pace working environment. Good department manager. Love taking care of customers  needs. When other departments needed help I took time and went to help the department in need
bad,"The hours are endless as assistant manager at Walmart. The salary is good however there is no overtime and the additional hours you have to work his ridiculous and never get those hours back either in time or in pay. Most managers treat the associates terribly because they are under so much stress. Store managers are way too dispensable at Walmart. Our store went through four different store managers in the first year I worked as assistant manager. Two of them were fired the other two are simply moved to other stores or demoted. I think the worst thing though is that managers are intimidated and even afraid of their area director. It's a terrible chain reaction that trickles right from the top. The hours are not only long but terrible, working many weekends and always short-staffed. I thought I could make a difference but I was just one small fish in a very large ocean."
bad,"It was great , but I had a doctors note to be out for work because I was sickly and pregnant and when I came back I was fired with no explanation bye !"
bad,Not enough pay. I have been there 5 years & the ppl coming in makes more them me now because of the pay the start off with today. And Wal-Mart doesn't appreciate the work of associates at all. This year they made up so many changes & not enough workers to make it happen.
bad,The Job was not fun nor was it anything someone should look for They don’t treat their employees equally I wouldn’t suggest working for Walmart nope nope
bad,Good management not very good compensation. The incentives became harder to achieve after some changes were made overall but it was a decent place to work. Without management experience not a great job to move up in
bad,Job is great for base level. Moving up is easy but very stressful and has little to no benefits. The job itself isnt hard but management is constantly indecisive.
bad,Walmart is a great work place far as the work itself. Management has no respect for the individual. When they’re called for help no one wants to help but they hold you accountable for it. You can’t finish one task before they stop you to do another but gets upset because you didn’t finish the first. You have five managers at a time giving you five different directions and they all upset you’re only finished two. Very unorganized
bad,"I worked in the Walmart Bakery for two years and six months.  I really looked forward to going to work each day.  I liked working the the Walmart Bakery.  I feel that I learned new skills every week.  The Walmart management team was a daily terror.  They complained about my work everyday.  I attempted to follow their instructions and do my work as they wanted it done.  Nothing I did made the Walmart managers happy.  Eventually Walmart fired me after lousy Christmas sales.  I learned daily bakery productions skills.  However, after leaving Walmart I could not get hired at another bakery job."
bad,Poor management and always think that they can talk to u any kind way I was a good employee also got employee of the month there are unpredictable it could be better
bad,"I had worked for almost two years and for a student it was a perfect little job to make some cash. However, there was multiple times management just utterly sucked one example is when they would schedule the minors and students outside of their availability. Making those workers have to call in, take time to go in and fix their mistake or have them fill out a new availability. The kicker was if a student or minor called in because of their mistake with scheduling they still counted it as an absence. If you were a student they expected you to come in outside your availability to work no matter how many times you told them you're not available."
bad,Very poor attitude and atmosphere.  Very unwilling to work with your Dr REQUIRED MEDICALLY NECESSARY SET SCHEDULE due to medical reasons. They will tell you you must work when ever they say and you do not have any say. Or you can just quit.
bad,"Working with Walmart can be a fun, fast and exciting place. Unfortunately for most people it’s the exact opposite, majority of people stay with Walmart just because it’s a secure job. Moving up is fairly easy as long as you put the work in for the first few months and become recognized by your superiors."
bad,I'm a single mom and Walmart told me after some time I would become fulltime and it never happend. They overworked me to the point that I was no longer functional. Very displeased with my Job.
bad,Training was a joke. Thrown out with no idea where anything or anyone was. Very cliquey. Lectured when asking for help. Very poor management and communication. Litterally thrown on the floor with no equipment or explanation on how to do the job
bad,"My job was to push shopping carts back into the store."
bad,Walmart is a very bad company not work for.  They hire at part time. But work you full time hours. No Benefits for part time. Along with management not Appreciating their employees.
bad,This company is very unbalanced to many people trying to be the boss and not enough people trying to work to solve the problems lack of communications
bad,Por mi walmart ninguna estrella con el maltrato que tienen a los empleados y en especial una en kissimmee y con fulltime personas de más 5 años solo 20 horas eso no es justo para personas que con un fulltime pagan sus cosas y le bajen tanto las horas deberían sacar esa gerente y ver cómo trata a sus empleados
bad,"Over the last decade, Wal-Mart has promoted too many unqualified individuals into management positions. Company policies and procedures are there for a reason and only on rare occasions should they be violated with good reason. Not every day. Wal-Mart will either mismanage themselves out of existence or someone will do something so illegal that the federal government will have to step in. Wal-Mart is a sinking ship and everyone is just trying to get what they can before it goes down."
bad,El salario.es mínimo.y no dan horas extras cuando dicen que abra temporada corren a la GEnte cuando se les da la gana y te hacen trabajar en exceso.cuamdomhay cambio de turno
bad,"They take advantage of you. HR plays with your hours. Some of the assistant management are nice but others are just raw and mean, will not help you if you need it. Basically your on your own."
bad,When an upper level of management tells an ASM to perform a job and then you deny to due so but they have the adensity to threaten your job and you have n o choice to then do so and then you get fired.....
bad,The store manager addressed me on the sales floor in front of customers which was rude and not professional at all.I asked to speak with her and told her she made me feel uncomfortable from there she was upset. What I've learned is u cant say how u feel to your manager or try to resolve the situation.The hardest thing bout the job was showing up on time doing what you have to do to be treated unfair.
bad,Walmart Cedar Falls is engaging in illegal drug use and both Managers and AP (Security) Personnel are aware of the problem and participate in the illegal activity.
bad,"They were rude, and when I asked for help it seemed to bother them. The costumers were rude when I couldn't ring up alcohol and had them waiting for a while."
bad,"pesimo ambiente, termine cpon burout y es agotador"
bad,"If you enjoy a living 12 hour nightmare 3 days a week, it might be for you. If you’re not jumping up to reach a shelf, you’re crawling under a shelf to reach something in the back and whacking your head when you stand up. You’re always trying to avoid other CR’s and get out of someone else’s way because way too many people work and they’re all competing to be the best. Meanwhile your stack is leaning far too much in one direction and everybody that goes by is staring at you like you’re a total idiot which you probably are. By this time, you’re a half hour over the time limit so you have no hope of reaching 100 by the days end. Which doesn’t matter anymore because now there’s 300 boxes and a giant pool of orange juice  on the floor you have to spend the rest of the day cleaning up and you still need to find a way to stack 5 huge boxes of bacon on top at the end. On top of that, your headset stopped hearing you as well so you have to repeatedly yell “say again!” Until you question your own sanity. This was only my first day working here."
bad,I worked there for one year and my mental health went downhill and I tried explaining that I couldn’t make it in too work because my mental health was acting up and I couldn’t  show up to work because I was scared to leave my house because of my anxiety
bad,This company does not care about its associates. At least not at 6059. Good pay and decent benefits but you will put up with a lot of inconvenience and trying to get the run around. Horrible morale due to treatment of associates.
bad,They start off at $11 which isn't that bad but management has negative attitude. They try to cut as many people's hours as possible so when you work you're short staffed and have to be rushed.
bad,"In my personal experience at my store, if you kissed enough butt, you got up the latter. It didnt matter how many people would quit under a supervisor, they just kept it moving like nothing happened"
bad,It is so sad when associates are treated with no respect from co managers and store manager and hr does not do the right thing  because they cover everything negative from hire management it is that bad
bad,"People walked around mindlessly like a bunch of zombies droning on doing the same things day in day out, no personality to the job, the managers do not care about you, only what you can do. Its not what you know, its who you know."
bad,They will work you. I got promoted within 2 months of me working there. I got blech in my eyes. I didnt get any days off. Still had to work but they did pay for my doctor and medicine. The managedidnt honor my availability so i had to quit. They were very inconsiderate of my time i needed to work.
bad,"Rude Managers, Veryy lazy and only care for themselves and friends, Didn't show the new workers a polite entry. Complained about a high amount of activities done in the work area"
bad,Management is unorganized. They will bury u with work if they see you are a hard worker. And when it’s time to transfer nothing is ever done right so you might as well forget about it.
bad,I loved the job when I first started and it’s not that I don’t love my job I do and the people I work with it’s management that I hate they are so rude
bad,"Its classified, what happens behind doors needs to stay behind doors. Dont spread bad moral. Ask tons of questions, dont listen to other coworkers talk to management if you're not understanding your job for the day."
bad,I enjoyed my position I was never micromanaged and that was nice. I basically came in and did what I felt needed to be done unless told otherwise. Very good.
bad,Management is terrible and will try to get three times the amount of work from  you. Know your chain of command. Stay focused and do what has to be done.
bad,"The store I worked for was not great for advancement. I learned that the hard way. If you want to move up and don’t want to wait 10 years then this Walmart Moraine, OH I worked for won’t work for you."
bad,"I can not say for the day time shift, but for the overnight management is was unbelievable how  Unorganized and disrespectful  they were. They would give you a area to stock that was to large for a person  who had not done that area to learn  in a night. They constantly  make you stay longer to help other people after your shift is over and threaten your job if you don't stay. There's a no overtime  policy,  so you had to show up hours late and still get your area stocked."
bad,"It could be a great place.run or right. don't micromanage. There is no consistency in management, or even stores. I hated working with no leadership.i would not work here again"
bad,"Stressful, high demanding workplaces with little to no training. Hourly associates are the best part of the job. They really work as a team to help out each other. Managers on the other hand are a different story."
bad,Supervisor and manager was very rude and unprofessional . Employees was nice. Very fast paced company. Easy training. they expect you to know everything but they never explain anything for u to know.
bad,Walmart was family oriented when I started back in 2001. There were great opportunities and different incentives to get raises. They changed all that. They took it all away. Management changed! The policies changed. Employees became numbers and not family any longer!
bad,"I didn't like this job. We were understaffed and overworked. All the employees complain about the most simple requests made by customers. The same ten songs play every hour of the day. The company acts like it values it's employees but when it involves some kind of expense, your S.O.L."
bad,"Unless you kiss butt and lick boots. Job wasn't terrible if you can tolerate monotony day in day out. Don't expect to be promoted for going above and beyond your job title, either."
bad,"Although I built some incredible friendships & bonds with my associates throughout my time with Walmart, overall the job culture is incredibly poor & very politically based. When certain positions are posted, the candidate is chosen prior to any interview is conducted. Never will another associate have the chance to obtain said position regardless of how well he/she interviewed. And this is a very hard thing for most associates to stomach."
bad,HR  breached open door policies by telling the person I had an issue with that I was trying to get them fired. Manager failed to address issue and some of the CSM try to make an already awkward situation worse by gossiping and trying to create unnecessary drama. Had one CSM show favoritism to a lower level cashier he was sleeping with over better cashiers. All and all Walmart is not a good place to work at.
bad,"When they changed to pto time, we lost a lot including personal time, lots of vacation hours and all sick time. Many long term associates have quit because of the great loss of our time that we accumulated all the years that we worked at Wal-Mart"
bad,"Managers treated employees unfairly, they would get mad if you had serious illnesses and didn’t seem to care if it was life threatening or not. They would all talk badly about their workers and used the “I’m your manager card a lot” to show dominance. On top of that they would pick favorites and would also pick out people and blame them for things that wouldn’t be there fault. Also didn’t know how to apologize or admit that they were wrong for doing something, instead they would just say “oh” and walk away."
bad,"I met the store manager and all the other lead managers"
bad,Want work done sloppy and fast. Expect you to do job without equipment to help finish. Only gives 40 minutes to complete 3 pallets over 6 feet tall. Do not give important dates needed off. Refuses to allow you to switch to different departments.
bad,Walmart frequently changes just about everything every week atleast making it hard on there associates to complete there work on time and efficiently.
bad,Let computers do things that a human should do like their employees schedules. Don’t care that employees  days off are split every week and the get 2 days off every week
bad,The managers treat you really bad.They don't care about their employees at all. You only get a 22 cent raise every year. Please avoid working here.smh
bad,"It was minimum wage they like to run registers with minimum amount of people they can , but doesn’t matter soon will be all self checkout.  Some managers were rude some were nice ."
bad,"Walmart is a nice enough place to shop, but I would not want to work there. The employees are required to take unacceptable amounts of verbal abuse from customers for inadequate compensation."
bad,I hate it. the environment is so stressful. it interfered with my schooling. the hours were crazy. some employees were just rude as can be. most of the customers were rude to.
bad,"I've never worked with a company that responds so negatively to employees. They choose their favourites within the store and don't treat the regular sales associates the same way as everyone else "
bad,I worked for Walmart for 11 years and never seen management be so bad and disrespectful . It is a nice place to work if managment was respectful  and not retaliating
bad,Awful place to work. No appreciation for the ones who actually try and make a difference. Unless you are one of their favorite people they don't have a clue what you do.
bad,"Ridiculous requirements, serious lack of management due to inexperience, no one cares about you, your inquiries go unanswered, and they cut your hours all the time for no reason really, so they say."
bad,"They cut hrs for a dept mgr to 30 sometimes..I'm there for a primary income not a secondary..bad management all around..lack of help,don't want to hire anyone"
bad,Walmart is stressful & the mangers are rude and do not respect workers ! They don’t kno what they are doing and expect you to over work and they do not appreciate none of their employees!
bad,"Harsh corporate punishments, overbearing over pushy management to rule focused not people focused enough. Good pay good hours but can get quite stressful. The managers can tell you not to do something and do it themselves and get away with it. They can also basically tell you what to do and you can't say no or fight back and you can barely give your perspective."
bad,"The unloading area was small and cramped with all of the people moving things nonstop.  I had barely any training done for the unloading part of my job because of how hectic and disorganized it was, and unloading was half of my job.  My coworkers were cool and patient during the training process for stocking, and it was a bit complicated to learn it all but after a while you kinda just learn where things go without checking labels.  I did tend to get yelled at for talking to a coworker on our break occasionally and the substitute manager was unnecessarily aggressive about it."
bad,Walmart is an exceptional company to work for. However the management is plain horrendous. From the store manager on down to the shift leads. The managers I worked for were only worried about themselves and acted like employees rather than manager like.
bad,"Racism, sexism, managers gossip and alienate other associates favoritism retaliation daily. Hard to work for a company that doesn't care about you. Theyll try to fire you if they don't like you personally even if you did nothing wrong"
bad,"Walmart can be a very hostile place to work and also a very hard place to stay Management at times really can care less about you being sick are anything like that they want you their when they want you their regardless. And their poi t system sucks! You get points for important things that you may have to do that just happens to land on a work day like Dr appointments, if you call in with the Flu they don't care they want you to come to work anyways and give it others and if you do and have to go home because your not feeling great you get a point depending on what time of the day you leave.if you leave 3 hours into your shift that's a whole point if you leave to hours before your shift ends that's a half a point really selfish rule"
bad,"where should i start?"
bad,The company is great to work for. It's the management team at the store the employees worked at that made it difficult playing favoritism and making false accusations.  Also being racist.
bad,I was fired for not having an obituary on hand after I was told by the SM that my 3 bereavement days would be covered. Does pay decent but it very drama and stressful.
bad,I was released from my duties even though i had a doctors slip needing to be off my feet after working alone during the vortex in extreme cold and wet conditions and my feet were almost infected and i could barely walk from the blisters and holes that formed from being so cold and wet constantly.
bad,management   does not hold the entire store to the same standards. certain associates get away with stealing time from the company but mgmt all the way to the store  director turns a blind eye
bad,"quick paced, great customers, friendly workers. love the job just dislike the benefits of the workplace no advancements, I have learned to do my best and to always keep a positive attitude and work environment."
bad,Managers are sorry and lazy. And there is too much favoritism that goes on.  Hours get cut all the time. Not sure if your going to be able to pay your bills because lack of hours. At your interview they will tell you they will give you 40 hours and they will for awhile until out of no where they dont have enough hours anymore. Tthey tell you in orientation you can make a career in walmart and move up. That is a big lie. You have to be a favorite to move up.the most sorry company to work for.
bad,Walmart have the worst management they over work they associate and they are rude and don't have respect for customers are associate and don't schedule enough associate to work on the sales floor
bad,Great company to work for depending on the quality of management. I have been very fortunate to have exceptional managers. It requires hard work at times but it not a hard place to work.
bad,"I feel myself hiding and alert like prey as soon as I clock-in cause I do not want to be annoyed by management, that all they do is criticize, backstab, and want to overwork you, I ignore them but the fact that every day I work I'm pestered, makes me upset to have to go in the next morning. If you have a coworker who is a try hard and complies with them, they want everyone to work like that one coworker. I found my coworkers applying to another job while working that is how bad the job is. Getting home sore and out of energy every day is not fun, I'm sore daily, I unsubscribed my gym membership cause I get enough exercise every week. I already have getting a bachelor's as a goal, but working there inspires me more to finish college so I do not have to work these types of jobs for the rest of my life."
bad,"The job didn’t make me really happy going every single day the set hours I didn’t like how I couldn’t change departments, wasn’t job i didn’t like it. I didn’t feel happy"
bad,"I had great managers and co workers, but never enough cashiers and always short on supplies that the cashiers needed. A lot of refugees working there so language barriers were a problem."
bad,Walmart & Management doesn’t  get along with their  associates at or  communicate them at all Management needs learn more communication better their associates like 100%
bad,"I feel I do not get paid for the amount of work that I do. I complete many different jobs there. I feel that I am being taken advantage of, which is fine if they would pay me more money."
bad,There is favoritism. People get away with stuff with and don't get in trouble for it. They need to change the people there. People there are rude. They don't have enough handicap carts there.
bad,walmart is ok to work at. the only thing is they arwe never hiring but always have a line backed up to the door.I feel they should come up with a plan to make it better for customers and employees
bad,working at Walmart is a fast pace upbeat place to work .The only problem is the lack of associate feelings and the lack of promotions if you are looking for a part-time job Walmart is a great place to work. to make a living as a full time associate the hours are not there . meaning i'm listed as a full time associate working part-time hours
bad,I worked for Wal-Mart as a manager for 20 years. Company pays well but long hours and schedule that's impossible to balance with family life. There is a 50 50 shot of working for a great store manager or one that is a tyrant and uses their management team like they are owned property..
bad,"Working here is fun, & laid back but also being at Walmart is a bad place to work bc of the lack of communication with managers, as well as no care for employees healthcare"
bad,my fellow employees were amazing management basically tries to force people out. the pay was good and benefits were decent. wouldn't advise of working there
bad,"Needs improvement on their no retaliation policy, and a better management team. Managers are not willing to give you the tools or information to do your job."
bad,"Walmart is very unfair to there people and they don't respect their managers at all.when you try to help someone they end up stabbing you in the back and everybody is out for themselves,there is no team work at Walmart."
bad,"Hoestly this job is low pay and management is beyond disgusting"
bad,"To many people doing as little as possible, and wanting advancement and praise for it. Management don't and won't getting involved until everything is melting down."
bad,Management does not communicate with each other. One manager will tell you to do one thing then another manager will get upset and tell you not to do that. It is impossible to to the job when management will NOT give you the tools you need to do the job. You will get asked to work over and the told to cut the overtime before the pay period ends. Hours are constantly cut. Working at walmart makes it difficult to balance work and home life. often have split days off so you  can't enjoy your two weekly days off together with your family. Very VERY STRESSFUL.
bad,Good pay but poor management. A lot of improvement could be done with how they treat associates. and how they go about things but is a good part time job for students.
bad,"I wouldn't want to work there again. The pay was such that I couldn't afford to eat most days. They would schedule me just enough hours so that I wouldn't be considered full-time and I was unable to get benefits. So, as soon as I found another job, I left."
bad,The Butter man will stick with all he's got; plus whip you with some fine buttery rot. He'll lick your pickle and tickle your nickle but he'll never just suckle on ones nipple. He is the butter Man and all the butter Man can do is the Butter man CAN.
bad,"Walmart DC works long shifts, very physical, and temp controlled for frozen and produce. It had all the benefits a company of that stature should offer, a very high rate of pay, unlimited turnover, terrible management, but 3 12-16 hour shifts and you have 4 days off. That was wonderful, but you spent most of those days recovering from having your body destroyed from the labor of the shirt work week."
bad,No me gusto trabajar en Walmart me lleve una mala esperencia
bad,It’s cool job. Just most don’t have enough staff which means you have to work the extra work people are nice though. If you’re a friendly person that’s a place to work for you
bad,"A day at work would start out with stretching and a meeting at the time clocks. Then after start up we go to work. Management is pretty up tight, even if you hit your number they still get mad when you are not being productive."
bad,Its a job They hire bodies I have a strong work ethic so I can adapt to the constant changes there. I like getting out at 1 pm so going in early works for me and its close to home.
bad,"Don’t listen to employees, favoritism, badmouth other employees when not around. No initiative from them to fix problems. You will be pulling others weight as they just slack off and Cadillac through the job with no reprimand from above."
bad,Policy changes and greed became a factor at Walmart . They intentionally found reasons not to give raises . Managers are  a-----retentive and back stabbers never work for them again.
bad,"Walmart is not empathetic. Through my experience, they did not care about my situation and they did not fire their management for illegally firing me and breaking the employment laws."
bad,"its all good at walmart. its a joke as far as big business goes, you do everything they ask of you but it still is never enought. dont do it. you do your absolut best and its not enough"
bad,"After nine years of working there, I was quite miserable.   I was not going anywhere in the company.  Although my department manager was amazing, I had nothing else there at the time for me to stay."
bad,Very stressful place to work with unrealistic goals and inconsistent leadership skills. If you need to make a paycheck there are better places to start your experience with.
bad,No one cares about anyone. This company is out for the money only and can careless about employee's or customers. They not only are rude to employee's but also customers.
bad,"I hated the job it was inconsistent, messy no one cares about breaks everyone was doing there own thing no worries about the cashiers . They would sometimes for get to give us breaks we would have to leave the cash register ourselves to find the csm we needed our break"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for walmart. Although my co-workers and managers are great to work with. Ive been working here for five years, as a dedicated and motivated employee, and year after year promotions and upd pay grades go to the most popular, and those who hang out with managers after work, and not based off of hard work and effort."
bad,I quit because I told them at my interview that due to court order I wasn’t able to work on saturdays or sundays but they scheduled me both those days. They don’t really care about their employees either.
bad,it a was very stressful since i was the only one working in the department i was in. Manager was very helpful when needed for big projects. but when they started changing all management there was no help to be found
bad,I felt like when I absolutely needed to call out I couldn’t. I only had one car that me and my girlfriend to share. Both of our families have health problems and we are very family oriented. I got fired for calling out to make hospital runs cause family needed to go to the hospital. Very bad company will never consider working for them ever again nor will I ever recommend people I know or talk to work there. Not worth the pay for all the BS I went through did managers job and managers kept trying to get me to move up but never promoted me. Other associates would stand around and talk while I worked my butt off. Horrible company in general. Will never shop there again.
bad,"It was a great  place to work at one time, but with trying to replace full time workers with part time, it has become unrealistic in job responsibilities. The management team does not communicate with each other, let alone to the hourly associates. Many times there doesn't seem to be much of an urgency to complete the tasks at hand. Due to this, the hourly associates are left to figure things out with any supervision or support."
bad,"You must be ready. Hard environment, no team work, Need to know and own your business.Be responsible and respect and take care of your associates and they will take care of you."
bad,Not a good place to work they constantly single out certain people and constantly ridicule the way they work and belittle them and they say that there's a way to move up in the company when there is not unless you are one of their favorites
bad,•	Extremely reliable and safety conscious with solid experience in warehouse operations to include loading and unloading trucks; shipping and receiving; order picking / packing; staging and stocking.
bad,"MAnagement is always so uppidy and rude,tend \s to take the blame and shift it to the lower associates,same with Humbodlt Walmart. Even when you are a customer i is bad,Same With Humbodlt Walmart"
bad,Great job for those who love to interact with people on a daily basis and standing for long periods of time. The job is very easy once you learn the basics and management is always willing to work with you if you inform them in advance.
bad,"The produce department was run very ragged and management was horrible. Cashiering was better, and the liquor store position I have has been a godsend. Looking to expand my horizons and make a career and I feel that won't be the case if I still work for this company."
bad,"working there has to be an job that you dont depend on. The management is poor. The location i worked at was very unorganized. respect wasn't an important factor. If you wasn't in with the in crowd "" you received little acknowledgement. the management at the Hanover location can be very judgmental."
bad,"Everything you have ecer heard about working at walmart, it is true. It can be fun, but it is also a bad work environment.  Only apply if you absolutely need a job."
bad,I loved my job at first but then they weren't very friendly always giving customers attitude and associates gave u points when u didnt notice sent me home for a no sale of alcohol I would go back if tjere was difderent managers they also don't fix the errors that they make. When u request a day off on a certain day they will not give it to u or if U request not to work past a certain time they still schedule u for that time.
bad,Overall working there was alright it did get stressful for and towards the end of me leaving it was very hard for me to go to work. I loved the people I worked with but the overall part of working there was just too much for me.
bad,"It is a good working place only if you can make more money there. I have work there three year's and I have not move up yet. they have me doing the support manager job, but doesn't want to give me the pay."
bad,good will training job trade work skills holsum bakery work creative art center  food skills keep job training day  train skill work week end day shift
bad,"When started, I was promised 30 or more hours. Well, my first two weeks had some decent hours. Now, i'm off more than i work and i'm now job hunting to be able to afford my bills. I've asked for more hours but that doesn't work."
bad,"It was like highschool all over again except we were getting paid min. wage. Worst coworkers, management didn't care, customers were rachet. Had multiple altercations with a racist coworker who did nothing but make every day I worked with him a hate filled toxic nightmare and management did nothing until it was to late."
bad,Walmart was a great place to work when I first started but in the last five years we have gone through six Manager .  The Co- Manager and Assistant Manager do not help to develop us .
bad,fast pace lot of workload hours seldom help know my department by heart. I trained a lot of new applicants who went to better job at Walmart or else . management not competent and unhelpfull
bad,"Walmart over works its employees, manipulates hours at their own will, moves people between departments with little to no advance notice and often times raises productivity without compensating for lack of manpower"
bad,"The pay was well for someone just starting. The co-workers were very friendly, got the job done well. However, the management treated us like we were their children. They played favorites. My manager in the deli, didn't like me because of my personal relationship. Before i was even hired."
bad,"I really hated this job. The management here, would consistently schedule people (not just myself) out side their availability. They do not care about furthering educational opportunities; if your school schedule does not meet with Walmart's requirements then tootles. Quite frankly I did not particularly care for my co-workers either. I'm not saying that everyone else who gets hired there will have the same issues I had because you are talking like two-years ago, but just based on my own previous experience, no I would not recommend anyone to work there (unless you literally had no other options)."
bad,"I have to do my work and others "
bad,When I was at Walmart they had very bad management and they pull you from your job to fill someone else's in because they wont hire more people. I would highly recommend that you find a better job
bad,"overall nice place to work, depended what store you worked for. must adaptable and willing to change. workplace culture is good but followed through, company needs to be a whole."
bad,"If you looking for a job and your desperate go for it, if you keep your expectations low and don't expect to be treated as an actual person this a job for you."
bad,"I would never recommend this company to any one to work at. The company has gone down since Sam Walton passed and the share holders took it over. They treat the hard working associates as if slavery had never gone away. The slackers are treated like royalty and the managers are severely under trained and useless. When you give 100%, management expects 10 times that out of you just to pick up the slack of the people they don't want to deal with. I was once told that the company hires 10% of people to do nothing and you are expected to pick up the slack. I was hurt on the job back in 2016 and as I was financially taken care of, the mangers looked at me in disgust and rarely asked how I was doing. When my wife had our first child, I had just been promoted to Department Manager of furniture and took my 2 week leave and when I came back, I was coached because the department had fallen apart. That had happened again a few years later when my second child was born. The managers are there to work you to death and not care about anything you have to say. There are so many horror stories I could tell or write a book about that would make you think twice about shopping there again."
bad,"clean the ground"
bad,The people are nice management not so much if they do not like you even if you are a good worker they will not let you move up and they will have you do everyone else’s job
bad,District Managers do not care about their associates.They allowed someone to sexually harass/touch female associates after it was reported many times.
bad,I worked over night at several locations at Wal-Mart. Most of the managers were unfriendly and uptight. The pay was below the cost of living in my area. I felt relieved when I left after a couple of months.
bad,"Management team is my only complaint, but otherwise the job itself was simple. The company is great offers room for advancement and good benefits. But upper management is terrible!!!!"
bad,"A lot of walking, dealing with carry outs being outside on nice days. The job is pretty easy with a push cart. dealing with all the trash being on the lot is a hassle."
bad,"I don't normally speak bad about a company but I am sorry Working for Walmart is like working in a Jungle litterly. "
bad,"They promise a lot and deliver little. They do not hire you as a full-time employee, therefore they do not have to offer the benefits they say they are available, because they are only available to full-time associates. Mis-communication and cross-direction is a common flaw at management and supervisor levels. If they think they can push you to go faster, they push you until you break."
bad,"Bom foi uma empresa que abriu minha mente pra varios objetivos de vida. la aprendi em varias funçoes no qual me identifiquei, trabalhar com o publico me faz muito bem. Oportunidades na qual jamais esquecerei porque me fez acordar de que sou batalhadora e se quiser posso chegar ao topo. Foi uma empresa que me recebeu bem ,meu salario era certo, como toda empresa nada é perfeito mas consegui manter bem minha vida la não tenho o que falar ."
bad,"Major cutbacks"
bad,"Good benefits, low pay, bad management, would not approve unemployment after  61/2 years of employment. They lie and treat employees poorly. Employees are basically expendable."
bad,The only really good thing about working at Wal-Mart is that there are a couple of people you meet that can be forever friends. Most of the management are lazy and expect you to do their job of training new employees.
bad,Lacking of general communication with their associates and customer more focused about money and less about customer experience.Generally disappointing. Too many supervisors above you and not a very good communication system within.
bad,"Point system should not exist. People revolve life while working for you dedicating themselves  to you. And if more crisis happens in their than points allows you Walmart fires you while employed they fire you.  while working for Walmart, they are not reasonable nor considerate with using their position  given to override your points. They will drop you like your  worth nothing, they show no respect for your  work no understanding with the unexpected life crisis."
bad,"I like meeting new people and making new friends.  I like the fact that I I get to 15 minutes break and an hour lunch. I don't like how the Associates are acting like in high school, gossiping and starting rumors. The company is not recommend to anybody to work at."
bad,"Seré muy franco, honesto y crítico, si bien el ambiente laboral fue maravilloso respecto a los compañeros de trabajo, nuestros superiores era personas muy arrogantes, prepotentes, injustos y humillaban a sus empleados, uno de ellos, un subgerente regaño a las empleadas externas porque ellas le dijeron que no traían celulares, pues estaban prohibidos y él de manera muy grosera dijo que las tenían en sus vaginas, usando una palabra despectiva para esa órgano de la mujer, también humillo a una empleada al tirar dinero al piso para que lo recogiera, la gerenta humilló a muchos empleados, incluso los mando a la cárcel por robar comida que iba a tirarse y a una cajera por echarse $5.00 al bolsillo, yo he sido cajero y nunca he robado, yo podría comprender porque ella hizo eso, quizá le pidió prestado a la caja, y si hubiera robado quizá era para completar para su camión pues los salarios son demasiado bajos y sus empleados se merecen ganar mucho más por todo lo que les ponen a hacer, quiero hacer hincapié en ésto por ser incongruentes ya que a una empleada interna la pusieron de serillo y literalmente le robaron todas sus propinas."
bad,"This company has gone down hill as far as customer, employee and product quality is concerned. I can understand being the low price leader effecting product quality, but should never effect how employees or customers are treated negatively."
bad,"the department manager was rude, always yelled at her employees, was never around when an employee needed help, very rude when asked a question, never showed up on time"
bad,"extremely high stress cutthroat environment. pay was non competitive, raises were not merit based. I learned how to be rude and selfish when working together because management condones such attitude towards others. Worst place i have ever worked at."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to any of my friends. They are horrible management and don't care bout there employees.They have this open door policy they don't even follow and make there employees work like they are animals. If management is doing something wrong to you and you call Walmart main office all they will tell you is they know about the problem, but won't fix it."
bad,I would never work for Kannapolis Walmart ever they nosey back stabbing gossipers the management is terrible they talk to you any type of way lack of respect for employees just overall a negative place.
bad,"inventory of the merchandise"
bad,Buena ser constante te ayuda a lograr buenas metas
bad,"Just got in a new position , but I feel as if I'm not learning anything. We are so under staff that I'm having to work in other departments to help out instead of my own are."
bad,"Its a stressful environment. I wouldn't recommend the position, to anyone. I would recommend any other position in Walmart. They do have good sales throughout the store."
bad,it's like arguing (trying to make a point) with a brick wall!!!   certain department managers are held to different standards than others.  perception varies from person to person and unfortunately is overlooked by management.
bad,A typical work day at Walmart is to clock in and check for your assents that you had for the day. The management was not on top of what people had to do that day they wont even talk to one neither
bad,"Supervised and coordinated special projects and store remodels.  Installed systems, cash registers, and lighting fixtures.  Completed onboarding for field project supervisor role, additional classes of study, and OSHA training.  Trained three to 30 associates on completing tasks.  Spearheaded completion of tasks without accident."
bad,all employees are just a number and are disposable to the corporation. The environment is great and the employees are some of the best people ive ever worked with. Just wal-mart as a corporation is terrible!
bad,"I worked here for 2 years, towards the end of my time here, they started a new scheduling system done at home office and college students only get 10 to 15 hours a week now."
bad,"company has changed policy so much you cant keep up with them. One of the dumbest rules/ policy is that they do not take doctors notes for illness unless you are out for more than 3 day and have to take a AOL. The only thing excused with this company is death or jury duty.  People do get sick once in awhile and can not help it, but people loose their jobs because illness is none excusable."
bad,"I was a good tire technician let me go for medical reasons poor support from company and managers store 1705 non stop considering nice job done or it concerns over all good associate,s"
bad,"A typical day at work is always busy "
bad,"I gave my all for four years at Walmart, 3 of those years as an manager, then just to be demoted and have a paycut for something very petty and small is terrible and heartless. the management has no communication and they don't train well and a lot of favortism"
bad,"Entry level positions were under payed. Management could be better."
bad,I love working at Walmart for the most part. I was working in the back room and IU loved it. My managers were very supportive and encouraging. I had not had a public job for a while and was very nervous. I have proven to myself that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to.
bad,walmart was fun really enjoyed learning as much as i did. but after learning as much as i did i still wanted more the employees taught me so much customer service is one of the biggest key to Retail.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart you'll never know if you're going to lose your job when coming in to work. They micro manager and if you're a salaried manager expect to work very long hours. There's no time for your family or personal time. They give you a lot of PTO hours, but make it difficult to take time off. All they care about is they're bottom line even though they are a multi-billion dollar company. The customers are difficult and complain about every single thing. Customers can be a joy and some can be challenging, but they most difficult is the lack of support from upper management. If you're married to someone and you decide to go in to management with Walmart, expect to be divorced soon."
bad,At Wal-Mart the culture of the people is everywhere. Meeting new people and getting to know your customers was the best part of the job. The company itself can work on a better salary.
bad,"deal with angry customers everyday, follow strict rules, no overtime, low pay, management is ok but wont offer much help, deal with insane/stupid things."
bad,"A typical day at work is quite stressful. The bonuses are never there. The management is very poor and are never around to help in situations. No one does their jobs except the associates. The hardest part of the job is being on the front end with all the customers because when you need help, management takes forever."
bad,"Walmart is a very busy job. There never ceases to be work to be done. I loved the job so much. "
bad,"Honestly, one of the worst jobs I've ever held. A stressful work environment with terrible, inflexible hours. The pay is decent, probably to compensate. I was never more miserable than when I was working this job."
bad,"The pay isn't worth the work. Hard to make a living off minimum wage. Don't get me wrong it was a job, if you like living paycheck to paycheck for the rest of your life."
bad,"I worked Custoner Service manager,Dept Manager,price coordinator,Accountung office,Inventory Control..the more u know its convenient gor them..but i did like my job."
bad,I would not recommend anyone that has experience to work for Walmart cuz they pay way lower the minimum wage for people that have two to three years experience they are a rip-off the employers my daughter work there and now she quit
bad,"I loved my job but they put me in a dept that I wasn't hired to be in and then they lied cause they didn't move me like I was told after a week, evening knowing that I was high risk pregnant and they put me to close the deli alone which normally takes 3+ people at the least."
bad,"the work was fine and the people was friendly to work with."
bad,"sometime fun learn how to deal with the public..management needs improvement..The work place is high risk...the hardest part of the job is watching out for robbers, but you will enjoy meeting new peoples everyday"
bad,"Wal-Mart has really started not to care about their associates.I really like interacting with people,you learn so much about people and yourself. The hardest part of the job is being mistreated by management. Feeling like you can't say are do anything without being retaliated against. But I've learned that everyone is not pleasurable,but to be pleasing any way."
bad,My last store was wonderful and ahead on everything. I get a promotion to a different store and it was the worst decision on employment with Walmart. I am looking for other employment.
bad,Es una empresa con ambiente agradable con oportunidad de crecimiento laboral y personal.
bad,Muy bueno mucho de que hablar muy facil crecimiento
bad,"Was a good place to work until they started making changes, now it's one of the worse places I've ever worked.  Incompetent managers, lack of communication, improper scheduling, most management is rude and disrespectful of Associates. Unsafe and outdated equipment, backroom process inadequate, too many managers not enough Associates, most management accounting responsibility for their actions, the my share is more like no share, they say customer service first but dont hire enough Associates, and the number of inappropriate and unethical actions by management. I loved the customers and Associates"
bad,"The management was very impersonal, the supervisors were pretty good people, however. The technology in use was very old and frustrating to use. The culture was very propagandized and made me feel very uncomfortable. The only good things I can say about it were the very lenient call-off policy and the availability of benefits."
bad,"I ordered deli, frozen foods, produce and dairy products on a daily basis. It was to much micro-managing. The place was always busy. There was nothing hard about the job."
bad,I hated Walmart. It is the worst place to work. You have different hours and work different days week to week. I did not learn a thing from working there. Management was not the best.
bad,very demanding.also fast pace work.working with truck drivers and their bills.management constantly trying to get you to more than the shifts.but not concentrating on safety.
bad,nobody really cares and treat you like a slave and the store manger only cares about they mangers only and they lie alot and they use the manger position  so u can work harder for no reason at all. They are all bad . N they complain when you try to use the bathroom and you cant have sick days without you being fired for it . No overtime nothing walmart sucks DONT WORK FOR WALMART
bad,"all i can say it was a easy job until the weather good bad in the winter"
bad,Long hard days with no air conditioning  and cut throat mangers. Co-workers were very nice unlike the management. I did enjoy the paid time off alot. The hardest part of the job was to actually do your job and not get in trouble for actually doing your job. Sounds odd I know.
bad,Having to come in and leave in a peaceful state of mind. How to improve my work ecthic. Management only promoted the people they wanted to not giving everyone a chance. Sometimes peaceful sometimes chaotic. Trying to say sane after you blame for your department not being up to expectations and your not even the department manager. My co-workers
bad,Walmart don't care about their people.  They are just out for themselves.  They don't pay near what your worth to deal with cranky customers.   They treat their employees terrible
bad,"I think Walmart is a ok company, I just feel like they don't appreciate their workers. You could ask for days off months ahead and they still won't let you have it off."
bad,"A core belief of Walmart is supposed to be: respect for the individual. When I first joined Walmart that was true. When I left the company three years ago, I would have to say that is not the case anymore."
bad,"Loved working at this place, paid well and was fun to work at. Within less than 3 months of working, I got laid off for no reason, and the same thing did not happen to anyone else. Learned how to cashier, by checking id for alcohol, as well as scanning purchases for the customers."
bad,It was a fun place to work but the management sucked for real and everyone wasn't on the same page . Management made friends with the workers and showed favoritism
bad,the hours were crazy and you couldnt miss work for nothing even if u had an excuse after three marks you lose your job I didn't like it at all .I wouldn't recommend the job but if u need good money and can tolerate a lot then this is a good pick
bad,"Entras con todo bono y utilidad y a los tres annos de trabajar ahi te salencon que no es empresa walmar sino una agencia operadora walmar ,,,ya no abra utilidad en el 2018 y bonomenos no te respetaran.aguinaldo de 30 dias pues es no es conforme a ley y eres cajero y te quieren.poner en.piso de ventas ,, hasta de lumpieza a mopear ,,, no trabajes en esta empresa ni es buena y menos para jubilarte"
bad,I've worked at Walmart for 2 years and it's too stressful because the managers expect  way too much that is impossible for us to do at times such as stocking two pallets in a two hour period is ridiculous
bad,Hard Work long hours work was continuous.. ok pay i worked with walmart with a temporary position. overall om work environment. alot of standing and walking
bad,"Management is not organized, job positions are left open for months, requiring other departments to cover to the detriment of those departments.  The department managers however are very competent, but overwhelmed by not having help in the departments."
bad,"Not a family friendly place.  Great to work at if all you want is money, but if you value family and free time, it is not the place that you want to work at."
bad,repair plumbing clean floor's. company overworked and under payed worker's were not happy.Management was under a lot of pressure to get to much out of worker's.hard to get job done with amount of worker's.
bad,"I, unfortunately, had to stop working with Walm-Mart in January of 2011 because I was disabled from an injury I sustained in the Army. I worked for them for nearly three years. I was doing more than a cashier's job. Was disrespected by management."
bad,"The workers and management was very poor. Never had anything in order, everything was all over the place.Learned to always stay positive even if that means you will have a bad customer."
bad,"The business model is very strong, but the execution and communication is very weak. On-line training is terrific. On-site training is at best mediocre. Very cliquey environment. Some very nice people who work there, and a few extremely rude people."
bad,"A typical day at work, meant no air conditioning or heat when it was needed.  My immediate managers were great! They helped out if you needed it, they were fair. The culture was very versatile.  My particular shift was good, everyone showed respect and got along.  The culture between the days and the nights, was not so great.  The two shifts were kind of pitted against one another due to the store manager and the different ways the 2 shifts were treated."
bad,"No hope for a future, good pay,or teamwork. Only there until I pay a large debt. You trust no one. Teamwork does not exist anymore. Sam Walton is rolling in his grave."
bad,"Opportunistic employees, cold and calculate employers, workplace culture was acceptable, every day before work everyone was debriefed on nothing but failures, and I was partially disabled for a year thanks to them."
bad,Management was super awful. What everyone hate the most is hat you have to always work on the holiday no exception. Good hours
bad,This job is basically like you have to learn on your own. True enough with the training courses that you take but the management is very poor and they don't have guidelines and in order.
bad,It was a great work community and great people. I wasn't getting the hours I needed to provide for my st. Other than that it wasn't a bad job.
bad,Certain management is not there for their employees and they get upset with employees alot when work is not done. Employees are fun to work very cultural.
bad,I do so much for my customers and feel under appreciated. Im not happy working for this company. I need this job to pay bills but do not feel appreciated for all the great service and hard work I do provide for the company.
bad,All around Walmart is a nice to work but the employees that i worked with never worked with me on my asthma. There were numerous times where it would be scotching outside which bothered my asthma. Even after i got documentation showing proof of my asthma.
bad,If your a good worker they will work you to death. They work you all holidays are mandatory. They will ask you to always stay longer then your 8 hour shift. I got an award the first yr then they stopped giving out awards.
bad,Yeah its ok. Not great. Not bad. Not good. Time consuming. Stay busy. Do you. Overnight shift can be a headache if you let it. The hardest part is getting up to go.
bad,The management is the worst enemy of WalMart. Too many mediocre in the management. The workers are good and ready to work but most store management do not understand how to encourage employees.
bad,i had to deal with alot of discrimination and verbal abuse from my mangers i was forced to quit because of everything i had to deal with even after i cried out for help.
bad,my typical day at Wal-mart is sometimes good and sometimes horrible. we have cashiers and customer service managers (CSM) and salary management that don't know how to do their jobs. we have one csm thats likes to be on her phone instead of working. she would be on her phone right in front of a customer on facetime. this one csm makes it seem like she is looking to only harass me and no one else. she always hides in the csm office if she dont want to do no work. wal-mart also looks past the fact that some employees who have been there for a year or more should be transferred if requested. instead they promote people who dont like to work at all. The store manager dislikes confrontation. he likes to hide in the back or he will send another manager to deal with the problem.
bad,Many times directions are not given in a timely manner and expectations are often unrealistic.  Another downfall for this company is that people are not held accountable for their actions and then some are held accountable for things in which they had no control.
bad,"My opinion about typical day at work was relaxing and enjoyable for daily job. I learned a lot of hands on experience. Management was amazing. My co workers were amazing, friendly and always someone I could go to for million questions I had about my new task I was assigned to. The most hardest part of the job is starting a task that I didn't have a clue exactly what I was assigned to do. The most enjoyable part was having the chance to keep learning."
bad,It started out ok but from the lack of real management to more than one person trying to be a boss it just became plain confusing to work there.
bad,A typical day for me is putting out needed items on the floors helping anyone that needs my help. Greeting customers. Its a ok company to work for I just would like to move forward better myself.
bad,"My daily routine at work is to check out customers, make out orders for customers and return and exchange items out for customers and making sure they get good service as they walk thru the door."
bad,"Walmart had a lot of nice people I enjoyed working with and was a decent work environment, but when it came to working around my school schedule and other commitments. comprimises were not met"
bad,Co workers didnt get along. They think work comes before family. Not very understanding. Didnt want to work with schedule. It was hard to do 10 things at once like they expected.
bad,"Wal-Mart shows a lot of favoritism towards races by selected managers, unfair labor of the assossiates and lazy department managers. A good place to make friends. A typical day at work is being left a list of duties to do from my manager that hasn't done anything all day and expect me to come in and do it all before I leave and go home. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with the inabilities of the work performance of some of the managers and leaving a harder and more difficult work load on the assossciates.."
bad,"Management is not very supportive at all. Often talk down to you and show very little consideration towards you as a person. Hours are not flexible and often collide with what you have put down as your actual availability. Coworkers are usually great, we all grew together and learned new things. Many times we'd have many challenges that we'd need to learn to over come together. The job is very routine, nothing every really changes. A lot of drama between the coworkers. You will often be treated as a number rather then a person."
bad,Warmly greet the customers and helped with the location of the store merchandise.Built relationships with customers and received and processed special orders
bad,"Training is horrible. I enjoyed my job.  I loved being a department manager, the only concern I had was the lack of training and having to learn the job on my own basically."
bad,im use to structure and there was no structure here. the training wasnt really imformative at all. I had to figure it out on my way.
bad,"Walmart, ugh.. Bad management good pay. Loved working there I  just couldn't gel with the politics of  the company. I received a curfew ticket while employed and they did nothing about it."
bad,At the time it was the best place to work for all the older cats i worked for are not their any more but alot of kids work their and they dont ever have anything for variety but still good place to shop thats it.
bad,"go in at 4 am turn on donut glazer ,dishwasher,oven  start breaking out my donuts and cut the bread.the hardest part of the job is that they are not enough people there to help"
bad,Start at 10 pm did not get off tell 7 am they had a high turn over rate. i learned how to use a fork life and pallet jack.The time frame was tough some time. the hour lunch was the best part.
bad,"A typical work day includes preparing your area for stocking freight to the floor, organizing freight for stocking, stocking freight in a safe and organized fashion and cleaning up the area.  All the for mentioned tasks are timed on a task master and are expected to be accomplished within that time."
bad,"Typical day at work was busy and even busier during the holiday season. I learned we were not fully staffed at the front end to get customers checked out within a reasonable amount of time. The company was hiring but cashiers didn't seem to stay around for long periods of time for various reasons. Some members of management were easy to work with and would even help out by getting on the register to get lines down. Other members of management didn't bother to help out when needed. Overall working with co-workers was great; however, the company started to hire a lot of high school age people and didn't have enough cashiers after 9:00 pm during the week. The hardest part of the job was company not being fair to the associates. For example, younger associates got on their phones at the register instead of working, while others were eating on the job and nothing was done about these situations. Also an issue of few allowed absences in a short period of time. For example, being a single mom and having to take care of sick children, I wasn't allowed to stay home. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and waiting on regular customers."
bad,"Management rarely seen, not much communication. Not alot of team work. Most of the time employees are left on their own the entire shift without interaction except for on breaks, which I dont mind, but after stocking isles I was given and ringing up customers, I didn't know what to do and management was nowhere to be found. Common problem with overnight shift and most employees I worked with had the same feedback."
bad,"A typical day at this job was get right in and start your work with a smile on your face. I learned great team work and wonderful communication is the key to make a company successful. Management on the other hand treated most employees with disrespect, sadly to say. My co-workers were absolutely wonderful and I gained a lot of great long time friendships. Family almost! The most difficult part of the job were honestly the Holidays with trying to keep things in order and properly priced. The most enjoyable part of working there was meeting new people everyday. And seeing original customers everyday."
bad,I enjoyed the people and the managers but that's about it.  A lot of favoritism.  One manager that doesnt like you could make you stay in the same spot for 6 months.  They also force you to take an hour long lunch when the handbook says just a 30 min is acceptable.
bad,I like working I am very good with people I have patients with the public.  I like to learn at my job . it was ok I like the fact that they will transfer you to a different Walmart
bad,for me it was just a job i needed for the moment and they took me in and gave me a chance. apart from that it's a job not a great one but a job.
bad,Wal-Mart does not stand by its employees management treats employees like trash if you aren't in the right group then you cant be promoted
bad,I stocked all day. Learned that i liked helping customers. We Had really bad management. I loved all my co workers. The hardest part of my job was watching our store manament go to heck.I really loved my job. Store was just not ran the same after Sam Walton passed away.
bad,Typical Day At Work Doing Layways Returns Provding Great Customer Service Skills I Learned Patients Is The Key Being Friendly And Smiling Thru The Good And The Bad Some Of The Mangement Was Excellent The Hardest Part Was Dealing With Rude Customers But Still Smiling Thru The Process The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Is Knowing That The Customers Are Pleased And I Provided Great Customer Service To Their Needs
bad,"felt like an outsider looking in, when all same race helped each other and I was over looked cuz I was new/transferred from another state, wasn't giving a chance to get use to the speed required and fear of loosing my position any day."
bad,"Walmart is going through a lot of changes.  It really use to be family oriented and the people there where there to serve you.  Now it is more typically about nothing other than earning a profit.  Management and workers are overworked, underpaid, and not appreciated.  The work environment is steadily going down due to poor customer service and worker's inability to be trained well.  The seasoned workers are leaving and the new workers are never taught what Sam Walton stood for.  Respect for the Individual, 10 Ft Rule, amongst others have went out the door."
bad,Its a comfortable place to work. Benefits are awesome. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy tires or dealing with exaggeratingly mean customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to drive the new cars the come by the store.
bad,"management suck"
bad,my co-workers were nice people it was good to have them there!
bad,"A typical day at wal-mart is challenging , you have to be strong minded and ready for what ever comes. Walmart is  very fast paced but unorganized at the same time. You have 50 people telling you what to do and that's time consuming because you have to figure out on your own what's the most urgent."
bad,"Es una empresa que ofrece estabilidad laboral pero desde mi punto de vista no valoran tanto a su personal ya que es este el principal motor de la compañía, siento que falta motivación por parte de gerencia y lideres de departamento."
bad,fast paced and stressful. Team work lacked and structure. overall very humbling experience
bad,"I will keep my opinions to myself.  Favoritism is a disease in this company, and if you don't meet their certain standards, regardless if it coincides with the companies policies or not, you won't last there.  They pick and choose who they like and want to keep there.  That is all I'm going to say."
bad,"adequate:  I do not want to do this review.  I am supposed to tell you more, so I am."
bad,long days .very few opertunities to advance lousey hours. a very horrible place to work
bad,"The company claims it encourages education. If you try to set your hours to go to school they cut your hours dramatically. If you are working the sales floor you have pretty set shifts. If you are on the front end, there is no telling what crazy shifts they will give you. Sometimes they give you split shifts like 6am-10am and then com back 2pm-6pm. and you are wrote up if you work 1 minute over your weekly hours.The Health Benefits are great. The co-workers are wonderful, but the management is horrible."
bad,I really enjoyed doing my extern at urgent care. It helped me to improve on my skills
bad,Operate cash register and process customers transactions.
bad,"My the place i work is got to many bosses every boss is got a different idea about something and thy can not make there mine up."
bad,"Enjoyed decorating and making customers happy."
bad,No matter how hard you try to self improve they will not be up front with you. Supervisors get involved with Drama.
bad,"Having to go into work and always feel like one had to be on guard. Learned how to assemble shelvings to display merchandise. As far as management goes there abiltiy to manage is very poor. As far as co-workers are concerned they were very rude and unfriendly and some even cross a line that they should have not. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer, because without the customer one does not have a job."
bad,I would clock in and proceed to my register and begin helping customers with their groceries and whatever they needed.
bad,"Management is having difficulty setting schedules based on department need to run smoothly.As well as ordering and finalizing product orders from the warehouse based on on hands, inventory, and daily mark downs."
bad,I learned a lot about various different medications. Restocking over the counter medication. Provided excellent customer service. Proper telephone etiquette. Strong team of pharmacist and tech to help me answer customer questions
bad,"Walmart est une entreprise très riche et qui ne veut pas dépenser pour ses employés. Les gérants se croient supérieurs aux employés. Ils nous envoient un peu partout dans le magasin, disant qu'on peut se débrouiller sans formation particulière. Comment répondre à un client dans le département de l'horticulture sans formation alors que mon département originel est la chaussure?"
bad,te evalúan de a cuerdo como te disciplines en el aria de laboral
bad,Walmart left a bad taste in my mouth. Instead of changing my schedule for a class they scheduled me to work and screamed job abandonment when I went to my class.
bad,"Work with your schedules, give you the days that you want or need"
bad,My very first job in the beginning I loved working here. It was a nice job to have while in high school however I got really ill and they kicked me to the curb and after recovering from it asll I had no job. I wanted to take legal action but it wouldn't even be worth it. I was discharged involuntarily and wrongfully. I wouldn't work for this company again but I love the prices.
bad,Walmart is a typical job for an average person who has no life and lets people walk over them. yes walmart has some perks for being there employee but it not worth the disrespect that comes with it from co-workers and customers.
bad,"A typical day of work for me with walmart is always hectic, from the unresponsive at time rude managers to them never scheduling enough cashiers for the shifts.What i have obtained from this job is an expertise in customer service. The management was horrible they were not only rude to the employees but they were also rude to the customers.My co- workers were kind of half and half you had those half who only looked to walmart as a stepping stone as myself and the other half who were content with walmart. The Hardest part of the Job to me was the fact that management are never really on the same page when it comes to running the front end of the store. The Most enjoyable aspect of the Job to me was dealing with the public."
bad,"management was horrible, too repetitive, wasn't really much help offered"
bad,"A typical day at my job is not enjoyable. If an incident was to happen you would be held accountable even if you had nothing to do with it, you also suffer the consequence of another employer even if a member of management knew you had nothing to do with it. this list goes on and so far on."
bad,"breaks where short, over worked, and  didn't get paid enough"
bad,Shortage of people mainly stocking half of the whole store.  Management doesn't have any sympathy.  Overall tiring
bad,A empresa era excelente e direção maravilhosa os colegasde trabalho show sair por buscar novos desafios e mudar a rotina de trabalho
bad,I have been at wal mart since 2007.  The job I do is working as a sales associate.  I have learned a lot about working with the public multitasking but the job itself is very easy and at this point in my life I would love a more challenge every day at work.  I would also love to challenge my skills a lot more and work in a more professional environment.  While working at wal mart I have been able to work with all different people and has helped me grow and learn in a working environment with having to deal with all different personalities.
bad,working with stock and preparing the store for the next day.
bad,"I have worked at wal-mart in apple valley as a unloader for the second shift for temporary part-time. I learned and trained to do different job duties. I always on time, puntual, independable, and get the job done, but this the most enjoyable postion as a backroom inventory associate."
bad,"Walmart is a vey busy retail business.  It is very demanding and will keep you on your toes at all times.  I learn more and more everyday on  how to satisfy customers and good business practices from management.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with something that happens unexpectedly at the last minute especially when I'm ready to clock out, but it's also the part I like most.  Everyday is different and different keeps you on your toes."
bad,"very fast paced, hard work,had to deal with un-happy customers, and a tough management team!"
bad,"..none....................................•	Assisted in Training of all new hires on money center procedures."
bad,produce floral all kinds of stuff i did stocked salesfloor put up freight
bad,"welcome customers and ask them what they wish to get. "
bad,"worked as a o/n stocker on the GM and Grocery side. would stock anywhere from 3 to 4 dept. a night then help zone up grocies. I learned how to match the bar code from the merchandise to the shelf label, learned how to use a telezone. I worked with some great people,we worked as a team. I really enjoy stocking because Im good and fast at it."
bad,"aprendi bastante coisa , parte mais dificil reverter situação com cliente insatisfeitos com a empresa. agradavel quando se trabalhava tranquilo sem aborrecimentos.,"
bad,You don't get to have a life if you are in Wal-Mart management. 
bad,"A typical day at work begins when I scan my name badge and I am assigned a register. Depending on how busy it is, the system may forget my break and I will recieve it whenever a supervisor realizes I have been skipped, so I usually have to remind one of them. As the day goes on most of my breaks are late and then it is time to go."
bad,Clock in scan badge get assignment for the day. Do assignment then go home. I learned that no matter how much work you are given its always good to keep a great attitude towards your customers. Management sucks they are always pulling you to do someone's job when they could of scheduled someone there. then they yell at you for not completing the task you were originally assigned. The coworkers most of them are very friendly but like everyone if you have too much pushed on you they tend to get cranky. The hardest part of the job would have to be tolerating management and them always changing your schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customer satisfaction when you have helped them with the questions they needed solved.
bad,I was a tire and lube tech and enjoyed working with the public. Me and some management had a few run n in what was suppose to be open door but I feel like retailation was the reason for my termination. They were looking for any excuse.
bad,"lack of communication with management, main concern of company is money not the people that work there. HATED working there would not recommend to worse enamy let alone a friend."
bad,A typical day with this employer was very stressful. The expectations upper management team required of their supervisors and associates was not realistic. What I learned was how NOT to manage my workers. The hardest part of the job was going to work in the first place. The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting with fellow associates during break times.
bad,"Greet customers, solve customers issues, count inventory, unload freight."
bad,• Answering Customer Questions
bad,This job does not appreciate the hard work that is being done by their associates
bad,"This is a warehouse that doesnt truly have Sam's ethics as they say. In orientation you get drilled, safety, open door policy, no retalliation, all lies. Very unsafe warehouse, when i was there a new girl had an accident, wound up having her hand amputated after two surgeries to save it from accident on reach lift first day of her being on equipment. I was almost ran over several times by veteran employees, a veteran knocked a pallet out of the very top rack and it would have been fatal, but i was too scared to mention it. I brought up a dangerous near miss with floor scrubber and was ridiculed by fellow employees and supervisor's after that, threatening to write me up and fire me. I asked a veteran there what happened to open door, his exact words were that is just what they tell you when you hire in. Dont work here, you wont last long, tick them off as i did, they will ride you until you decide to quit or you mess up enough to be fired. Go somewhere else and save the trouble of wasted time, very high turnover because its just a bad place to be. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!!!! that is why they are always hiring, your not important to walmart, your safety for sure. Bad atmosphere there, you are of no value to them, just their percentages and hours. POOR MANAGEMENT, BAD ENVIROMENT, YOU WILL GET HURT HERE !!"
bad,"The store is always in a wreck when night shift begins, associates are placed on a very unrealistic productivity time, management are not on the same page one group tells you one thing and the next tells you to do the total opposite, management make up rules as they go that are contrary to walmart policies, they are currently cutting hours for the associates that have been there for a while in attempt to be "" out with the old in with the new"" inorder to save on payroll, the open door policy is just an attempt to keep out unions and to bounce you around until you get tired off talking to different people about a certain issue, job is made harder rather than easier to accomplish"
bad,"To ensure each cumtomer has a positive shopping experience and that the customer is top priorty.Replenish shelf, bin area. Maintain a safe work eniviroment."
bad,"The pay was minimum wage and you felt taken advantage. You're never treated like a human being but just as a slave. Customers get upset with you and yell at you and there is absolutely NO support from your management. Instead, you are always made to feel like you are wrong and like you are stupid. The best thing was getting out of that place."
bad,stocking shelves and zoning. the management is out of controle. the co-worker made it better but over all horrible place.
bad,un dia tipico detener alas personas que rroban en la tienda
bad,"Walmart is a great place to work for high school students but if you want to try and climb the ladder, walk away. Walmart's management is terrible and will throw their employees under the bus fast than we can blink. The whole company has gone twisted when Sam passed away. His children need to remember it's not alll about money and to think of the people that keep the company running...the hourly employees. The management is just was bad as Sam's kids."
bad,"m gusto muxo en aprender muxas cosas y mas cuando yo era la segunda de mi jefe y trabajar en equipo,ser puntual y no faltar ser responsable con el trabajo."
bad,"1- stock grocery shelves, really did not learn anything new I had previous experience, Walmart management does not know how to treat there associates with respect,got along great with my co-workers, hardest part dealing with management,most enjoyable working with co-workers"
bad,Continously was lifting heavy boxes that said they needed to have two people lift but the manager wanted only one person lifting. Had to meet quota every day no matter what the item was whether you were doing tvs or toliet paper.
bad,Really enjoy my job it taught me how to better my self with customers and im just a overall people person so my expierience was great just lookin for something more
bad,As an employee there I had no idea what my job was. Everyone with any kind of seniority over me would tell me to do something & so I was like a pinball being sent all over the place.
bad,i worked for wal mart 6 months and it hsas been nothing but drama the people at work would talk abouy each other fight in and out of the store great pay but run far from 28208 wal mart
bad,Not having the peace of mind when you are on your off time for fear you may be pulled across the state for a special project is not the work life balance im looking for
bad,Just come in to work to do what you need to do and don't worry about others. The less you worry about the better it will be. Live happy save more okay
bad,"They absolutely have a problem picking favorites here. They don’t train the people who want to be trained and throw their favorites in headfirst without any training. If you want to get anywhere as a cashier, be their favorite. The CSMS don’t listen to any rules from management."
bad,Over all working at Walmart was not a bad job to start at after high school. I believe they teach you the basic needs to start a career. I would not recommend staying there for a career as they have poor management skills. Again Walmart is a starter job to get someone on their feet.
bad,"Fired!!!! Plan, I didn't get to retire from there,instead after 18years of moving up twice and giving them all my time& always available when they would call me in or call& ask work related questions while I was on vacation I still gave them my time! Walmart was my life and every day I would leave for work I would look at my kids& realize how important work is!"
bad,Managers were all about covering their self and only cared if their direct supervisor cared. If a worker needed anything for their convince and it didn’t convince the management team it was a problem.
bad,I mean overall great experience besides terminating me for no reason basically a mistake which they resolved and acted as it was alright. I wish they had a better management crew as well its honestly terrible I say a bunch should be fired.
bad,walmart as an individual  store isnt good. i left regular walmart at 12.75. after 14 yrs u can get on for 12 an hr but u will prob get put as part time. and individuals Weatherford is one of the worst walmarts to move up in the company. #9193 they dangle the carrot over ur head figuratively speaking. didnt get 1 interview for advancement in the 14 yrs i worked at walmart in Weatherford tx.
bad,employees and work environment where great just management was somewhat difficult in ways of understanding an employee situation or their personal situation.
bad,I left Walmart because over the time I worked there they went from.being a family oriented company to being a corporation that was ran by numbers with no personal interest in the employees any more.
bad,The environment had allot to do with the location. It was a small town so everyone was close cut. The job taught me allot but there were personal downfalls with the people. Overall not the worst
bad,Lots of managers with bad communication in between. You are constantly compared to others and threatened with being reported rather than being taught how to properly do things. Bad management. Unhappy employees.
bad,"My time at walmart was very unfortunate i got alot of disrespect from most of my managers, my direct manager treated me like garbage and kept messing with my hours."
bad,"At first the job was easy to do and somedays it feels rewarding but it didn't stay that way for long. The managers that help and support the team was let go being replaced by ones how don't help and walking around on their phones. Ever since year two a typical day will be like me running around trying to fit everything on the shelves no matter what as long as its reasonable, trying to please the managers. The most enjoyable part of this job is talking to the costumers and my fellow stockers but the hardest part is to finish the all the work in your areas when the team is stretched thin, which is often. All management cares is if everything is done, if they ask you how you doing they actually asking is your area almost done. With this job I did learned about how to read labels, organize overstock, and help costumers in any way."
bad,hay muchas cosas de los productos que promocionan y mayormente estanhagotado
bad,poor management and not very many opportunitys to advance in the workplace to higher up job. mostly just a flex for highschool students until they found something more permanent or secure in the future.
bad,"The management is lazy for the most part. The workers do all the work & get paid nickels & dimes. Especially because they’re constantly cutting hours! Good luck ever getting 40 hours/week unless you’re related to a manager, a manager yourself, extremely close to your assistant manager, willing to work multiple departments or it’s a holiday (oh yeah, Walmart is only closed on Christmas & they pretty much force you to work on the holidays."
bad,"Lack of competent management stressed out employees ruining the working experience. However, there were very cool employees but we where not allowed to talk to each other while working."
bad,"I found myself having to step up and do most of the work in my department. Sure I got paid $12 an hour, but the cost of living is far too high where I live to even really pay my car insurance and phone bill each month with what I would make. The pay is not realistic."
bad,"Management was Very biased. Rules were broken by my manager and his preferred employees."
bad,Managers Pas the buck so they don’t get into trouble themselves that is what I experienced at my location all the stores are different could be a good job elsewhere
bad,Good benefits but just a bad place to work overall worked there for almost six months never got 40 hours at the end of the day you are just a number and everyone is expendable
bad,I met a lot of good people working at Walmart but  most of the management really doesnt care about its employees at all. The day to day processes and work is pretty basic. Customer service is a must.
bad,Management needs some stepping up to do. Playing favorites won't get the job done. You got some hard workers there who get no respect. This place isn't a good place to work. Don't waste your time.
bad,like I cant work nights or evenings well with that they wont even look at ur application and that's not right at all I worked in layaway jewelry cashier and pharmacy cashier loved the cashier in pharmancy but that's all
bad,"If you're looking for an easy hire, Walmart is the job for you. They hire just about anyone and they make it look like an exciting prospect. You have lots of opportunities to grow and move around the company, however managers never seem to know how to do anything right. Low level employees do not last long if you're not looking to be a ""lifer"" (working there forever). They do not care about you or your personal life, expect to be treated like garbage."
bad,my experience at walmart was horrible. I worked there for two years worked all my time worked overtime when asked and helped out when needed. try to advance several times. made a complaint aganst a manger nothing was done. it was awful work experience and would not recommend them.
bad,"Working at Walmart with the crew that i worked with was great, they were all friendly and caring, management ran the store the way they were supposed to, Walmart Corporate however has become in my opinion, very unfair to their workers."
bad,"While the job itself doesn't seem difficult on paper, and the pay/ benefits are appetizing, the stress due to lack of workers, along with upper management issues, are more of a problem than the pay/ benefits are worth."
bad,Es buena pero uno llega a buscar algún producto y no lo encuentra y preguntas y dicen que no saben si hay
bad,Every manager tells you different you get in trouble for following one manager orders. Then we asked no one knows nothing very stressful job Walmart doesn’t  appreciate their employees as much as they should customers are always rude and sometimes threaten you management does nothing about it Always gives customers their way even if they’re wrong but train there employees to go by the book but they don’t even fellow the book very confusing and the management is very poor.
bad,"In my 17 years at Walmart I worked almost every position. Everything from starting off pushing carts, to working /stocking the dair department, meat department. Most recently worked Asset Protection/ Security, then online grocery picker was my alt job title before I left."
bad,Management is horrible.  If you are not liked they will single u out and come up with a way to get rid of you. Gossip is bad by managers and co-workers.  Get wrote up for dumb stuff but not important things.  Management lies to cover up their own mistakes.  Work short handed.
bad,Discrimination in the workplace. Favorites are rewarded and unfavorable punished. Based on who you are friends with. Management above you may not know as much as you do but expect you to complete tasks that they aren't even able to accomplish.
bad,Working at Walmart I learned some things. I learned to productivity is important and I learned that when u work in a group work gets done faster. But management is horrible I’m talking about when you do something good they don’t speak on it and when something bad happened like when work doesn’t get done on time they complain about it .
bad,"The only reason why I stayed is because my son,the title I had , my customers,my coworkers and benefits. Overall there was poor management about maybe 8 managers or 10 managers. Out of all of them there would be about one or two good ones that was still help you out and understand you. They expect us to do a lot of things that wasn't impossible I felt like I was being mistreated a lot and they were condescending  and belittling us all. I felt like I was threatened by my job in a certain way that I can't explain but definitely not recommending walmart to anyone."
bad,"Gave you to many hours, not enough employees, they don’t care about what you go through outside of work, always had rude customers, super stressful and messy"
bad,"As a Department Manager, I had no staff to delegate tasks to, so I had to do the work of a full team by myself, and was repeatedly reprimanded for failing to meet work expectations that no one could possibly have achieved. "
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart until I found out that they were really just a bunch of hypocrites, not all managers but some were. They weren't all on the same page with each other at times which made it hard to know what to do when something came up. Forever changing rules, didn't always know how or when to do things because not everyone was told, at times, I would find out days later, did my head just spin lol.  I'm sorry sounds like I'm nitpicking but I'm not I'm just being truthful. That's what an employer will get from me truthful, punctual and hard working."
bad,Working for the company is very stressful. At times upper management place so much on you it is at time impossible to finish your daily task. There is no constancy it is always changing. Your told to something one way and the next day it is different.
bad,"Spent most of my time outside and away from the Main management structure, that being said, many don’t understand how the job works and often asks me to preform a 3-6 person job with myself and the aid of a cashier."
bad,Wal-Mart likes to change your hours when they hour and promise full-time.  There sick time that old employees save up they made it were they can't take it.
bad,They use and abuse you! They will over work and under pay are and only like to help you when they need something. the company would be great if they valued their workers like they value the customers.
bad,The over all feeling that I have for Wal Mart is that it's a very stressful work place with very little help. Management will not help with any of your concerns or problems.
bad,Made to meet unreasonable goals with the amount of man power and available help. A lot of unfinished work falls on salaried ASMS. Company seems to be more focused on controlling labor then customer service
bad,Biggest issue was with some of the management the last manager i had there didn't seem to care about the employees of the departments she over saw as she knew i was working 2 jobs and because i wouldn't quit my part time as i could not afford it she scheduled me for 1 day of work for 2 weeks
bad,"walmart was am enjoyable company to work for, i have worked with them almoast 12 years. apparel is where i worked while there. i love to merchindise.."
bad,"A typical day at work is very unorganized. "
bad,You could work hard while others would stand around and get paid the same hourly wage.. management didn't no day to day how long we would be there for..asked you to work 14 hours a day even if you pulled a hundred percent in your schedule hours
bad,Working for Walmart is great had no problems till management lost their touch in associates and picked favorites and treated others like a piece of gum on the ground. Worked with life and school schedules great
bad,"The company itself is great, the management is what makes it so difficult to go to work everyday. They don't care about the associates. Its not WHAT you know in. Wal-Mart anymore, it's WHO you know. Theres a ""Zero tolerance"" for harrassment but I was Harrassed several times and nothing was done about it, even after I followed the Open Door Policy."
bad,I work for Walmart and don't get me wrong I love working for Walmart it's just that the managers there sucked and didn't do much of anything it seemed like the work would never end I would come in at 5 in the morning and sometime leave 5 6 maybe 7 at night I overworked myself it was very stressful it's not a team thing because everybody is not going to stick around to make sure the job is done so trying to do it all it stresses you out if you had more healthier with the management team it would be a better place to work I don't know something maybe got it together now and they trying to get me back
bad,"Stressful Job , No good hours or time off , low pay , no good management , no moving up or transferring and they go by point for attendance so its really easy to get fired the first 3 months"
bad,Managers are rude and they have no respect.  But I learned a lot from being there through myself and the customers. The hardest part of the job is rude customers and mangers.
bad,"This is a great company for growth within your place of work. Unfortunately, they do not take care of the employees. They have unrealistic expectations, with very limited staff, and the wages are well below par. If you are in certain levels of management, you are unable to foster employee productivity, due to having high amounts management staff, and a low amount of subordinates."
bad,Some of the employees where so helpful but the do not accept doctors excuses and i was sick as a temp you can only have 3 days and i had 3 but was going to have 4 even after i was told it was ok it would be handled
bad,"Typical day at work was miscommunication, false promises, and stress. The work is not hard. The problem with Walmart is the lack of communication between other managers. One manager would tell me one thing to do, then another manager would come and get me. When I was finished with the other task the first manager would get mad at me."
bad,"I learned while I was there that there is more ways to steal, cheat, an brown nose that I never would have dreamed of. Management was all for the customer even if they watched them steal something."
bad,Walmart was a great company to work for but over time they have made so many changes that does not benefit their associates in any way shape or form. You would think by giving this company over ten years of your life that they will treat you with respect and value you. No management is so rude and nasty towards the associates.
bad,"absolutely terrible job. coworkers don't care, management doesn't care, work expectations completely unrealistic. They try to make you do 14 hours of work in a total of 5 hours of productivity."
bad,"I love what I do at my job but working for walmart for almost 5 years, I make $13 an hour. A cart pusher could be hired tomorrow and start out at $11 an hour. I deal with people lives in the pharmacy. Definitely under paid. Customers don’t take the technicians seriously. We don’t look professional only the pharmacist does. Wish we could wear scrubs."
bad,My opinion on walmart is that it was an amazing place to work at but it was over managed to the point that it was too difficult to work at. Every step forward was two steps back.
bad,"Did not like management at all, only 4 absences allowed per 6 months, they do not care about your personal life, only can change job time availability once every 6 months."
bad,"The company itself is run poorly, and does not care about the employees. Individual stores vary, but the hierarchy of Walmart is always present. I did not enjoy working here, but would do it again if I had to."
bad,"Just like a lot of my co workers , Walmart was a temporary position that lasted well beyond my time table. The work it self is fast passed at night making up for the work that is neglected during the day but there is no family at Walmart you are a number to them. they assume to replace positions than watch people grow"
bad,"Wish they had a better organized team, head management are very unorganized, you have to work extra hard because of the lazy other team workers , the benefits were awesome"
bad,"Walmart does not care about their employees, they do not care about their customers, all the managers are concerned with is getting their bonus every month, If they have to cut your hours in order to receive a bonus they will, they do not accept medical excuses, they are inconsiderate to those with kids. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WALMART TO ANYBODY"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with new co-workers. Walmart was my first official job, startted off at cashier moved over to produce to receive a raise in pay."
bad,It was some time a good place to work and spmetimes a bad place the mangers there did not know what they where doing and the place was not that clean but there where good people there too
bad,Did not enjoy the Management. Did not enjoy the hours I worked either. Day in and Day out was the same boring routine. My management I felt played favorites.
bad,"Majority of the customers, always rude and I didn't like that. Some of the employees didn't want to take the time to train. Majority are lazy. Unorganized and short staffed."
bad,I was fired due to doing more work than I was given just because the supervisor changed his mind. I was coached several times for not cleaning breakroom around 4:30 am and missed a few things in my cleaning of breakroom. they are very rude to their employees and on power trip to think that we as associate are to do managements job for them.
bad,Terrible pay and benefits... especially for a dept manager. By far the worst benefits. Management is ok. Not very understanding though. Dont miss a day... even if you have staff and work in a food dept bc you will lose your job. No job security whatsoever.
bad,"The customer service was good. Helping people as much as I can, and making sure they find what they're looking for, and they're happy, and if I don't find what they looking for I'll find somebody who does know . Plus when they return to the store and they look for me to help them again, it makes me happy.  I also go all out for the customer to find what they're looking for in back stock. When it comes to my area I make sure everything is price point, in the right place, and is zoned good. When certain managers asked me to do a project for them I do it I do a good job and I do it with no problem, and I gets it done.  Plus if a customer is working on a project and they don't know how to do it I give them ideas as how to work on their project or recommend something else that they can use as a substitute."
bad,Other associates are pretty cool. The management lacks common sense when it comes to getting things done. They would rather bark orders and harass an already short staffed team rather then getting in and helping. They actually punish you for being slow by taking more people from the areas you need and expect you to work faster with less people. Refuse to hire other people to save money in the only Walmart in a 40 mile radius of a bustling city filled with college students.
bad,"lack of communications between shifts and its scheduling wasn't working out for me , however it was a fast pace and the days seemed much shorter not spending  all day there"
bad,"To fast paced and rude people that do not appreciate others, not enough hours for fulltime, no pto in case of sickness, very busy all hours of the day"
bad,Walmart is an ok place to work unless you work for a CSM on the night shift that likes to lock herself in the cash office and take naps while making you do not only your job but hers to.
bad,"I liked the people in the deli, I did not like the management it seemed every few months we would get another manger over the deli, that don't even know anything about the fresh department Very demanding they expect the almost impossible."
bad,"Free wifi"
bad,they work you to hard and the pay should be more then it is and every week they come up wit a new rule that is the worse place to work I would never work to that place again in life
bad,"just to much online training,  but then vary good at working and getting to know you and healing in anyway they can but works you hard and vary kind. !"
bad,Es una gran empresa la cual te ofrece oportunidades t ofrecer un sueldo competente con política estrictas
bad,"Ganhei varias coisa e um título nacional, eles não me  promoverem. Promoviam que não fazia nada, aqueles que puxava o saco os cliente viam e comentavam dentro da loja."
bad,"This company isnt the best to work for they don't care about their employees we are only a number to them or a body...when u work for Walmart if u don't agree with wht they say they will block u from moving up in the company., until u have had enough and quit..."
bad,"Showed up on time everyday,  Did the job quickly and right. Got along with everyone there ..Even tried to with the 1 manger that didn't like me for whatever reason..race or gender You pick..  3 weeks of not told times to come in. or what my schedule would be tomorrow, The day after, This week, Next week, ....Then told i have only 2 days a week to work.2 days Save your time  and BS Your better off working ..well you cant go anywhere but up"
bad,Long nights. Good job for entry level or uneducated people. Kept you busy but there are some odd people that work there so be prepared to deal with it.
bad,My experience working at Walmart was average. I learned different skills about serving customers on a daily basis. The team members I worked with help me understand my role with the company.
bad,I hated my job in WalMart pharmacy due to my manager. He was very rude and thought he was so much better than everyone else. He played favorites and would speak badly about employees to other employees.
bad,the workplace was not up to shape and the management was not worthy of their position. they don't care for their associates or if they get hurt on the job.
bad,The management team is the biggest issue in working for Wal-Mart and the fact there is a lot of underhanded business going on. I would not recommend Wal-Mart even to an enemy
bad,this job has good and bad things going for it i think i like my job just not the people who run it the management has bee known to steal lie and disrespect people a least at my store
bad,Job is very stressful. There is poor management. The open door policy is broken. Too much expected from associates. Not enough staffing to meet store standards.
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service. No matter what anyone else is doing, you can provide the best customer service as far as it depends on you. Customers really appreciate the effort you put into making their experience positive. "
bad,"as a cart pusher, I would always be working outside in the florida heat. It was enjoyable being left to myself for most of the day; I would be able to kind of go at my own pace while still getting a lot of work done. However, it was very difficult to find the people from personnel whenever I was told to go see them or whenever I needed them. You could tell the company didn't really care for its employees much. Sure they'd have free food in the break room every now and then, but most of the time moral was very low and if you wanted to be switched to a different position it was very hard to do so. When the busy christmas season came around, my co workers would either call out or they didn't have enough of us employed at a certain time, leaving me alone to do most of the work. Then I got a coaching (3 and you get fired) because they didn't think I was productive enough. Keep in mind this is a whole walmart parking lot for just me to do--around christmas! I told them I had a leg injury and they didn't care. I asked to be switched and they said I wasn't valuable enough to the company yet. I was also often called into the building while I was busy to help customers wheel out and load heavy merchandise that I myself couldn't even lift. I will NEVER work for walmart as a cart pusher again."
bad,"I spent most of my time pushing carts for a couple of hours before taking a break.  After taking a break, I would continue to push carts again for another couple of hours.  I learned how to bring in carts fast.  I had some good bosses like Fil, Tabatha, and Mitchell.  Job was simple.  I was probably the one of the most valuable cart pushers they had when I was working."
bad,"Walmarts not bad easy work but a lot of it but the bad part about working there is the mangers of course, they are just unorganized and there are about 20 different ones telling you what to do and expecting to know what they want. "
bad,"In my opinion, I liked several managers, and there were several managers I did not enjoy with.  I worked in the apparel department and liked that department the best."
bad,DHL really sucks when it comes to Temps over permanent workers you are a Nobody to co they really need more perfessionalizem skills they do not give equal work opportunity rights
bad,"Its not a great place to work ,management is terrible. Favoritism is like religion. If your young you would probably like working here.not much to say... just look away."
bad,management does not care about their employees the say customers are always right which I understand but that doesn't mean treat your employees unfair.
bad,Walmart can be a fun place to work but I think management needs to listen and help more then just be bosses they should be management we are understaffed
bad,"Very busy!!! if you are working at any Wal mart make sure you have you mind set right because it is every hecked all day long, morning ,noon, and night, but I loved it. I would go back if I had my weekends off."
bad,The work was easy. Running the register and cleaning up isn't hard and there is enough to do to keep you busy if you take your job seriously. Management can really determine if you like it or not. Some are nice and some just act like you owe them the world.
bad,"I hate this job, save yourself a lot of drama and trouble and DO NOT apply. "
bad,it was nice im glad was hired by them. o I would recommend this job to people that need stepping stone. I am glad I can shop there as a customer and not employee
bad,"I excelled at this job, simply because it was unbelievably easy. Just stand around and scan items, it was very repetitive, but in all honest you'll make more than the effort is worth."
bad,"it was a hard position considering i was pregnant at the time."
bad,"Typical summary, retail can be frustrating at times, serving the public can be stressful and very rewarding, a positive attitude and good work ethic maintain the balance needed to excel and enjoy the environment that is constantly changing due to consumer needs. Typical day, unload freight, communicate with fellow employees on needs to ensure a timely unload, bring freight to sales floor, ensure the shelves are stocked properly, communicate with fellow employees and supervisors on needs to complete the stocking goals for the shift. Supervision would be slightly different as the position I held was fairly new and most of the decisions were made by myself with suggestions and feedback from more experienced management, ensuring employees follow Wal-Mart guidelines safety protocol and other procedures to ensure accurate inventory to provide the consumers the merchandise they need. Hardest part of the day, there wasn't one. Most enjoyable part would be customer service, compliments and ensuring customers feel wanted and treated exceptionally well to create an environment the customer "" enjoys "" being in."
bad,"The job was easy, the busiest days was the best because before you knew it the day would be gone. I made some really good friends. The policy's was horrible and the managers were mean and very rude to not only the employees but the customers too. They have a open door policy but what they don't tell you is they will not really look into helping you fix your problem. They are more into the money than the people."
bad,inventory control. stocking grocery shelves. Assisting customers find items. assisted in cashiering as needed. dress up days for holidays. casual days for record goals met.
bad,its was an easy job but just very low pay for a person who worked almost 30 hours a week I enjoyed helping others the hardest part was the customers attitudes but I respected them no matter what.
bad,"foi uma empresa onde aprendi varias habilidades como lidar com o publico,"
bad,Maternity leave was only two weeks at the location i worked at. They went 24 hours and had no understanding or consideration for people with children.
bad,I do have to say managers definitely need to step up in there job. Yes their was drama with the csm managers. They talk about their employees when they shouldnt.
bad,"y no hay problema por el contrario existen otros que demandan mucho esfuerzo en ESPECIAL EN TEMPORADAS  COMO NAVIDAD, BUEN FIN, Y CADA TEMPORADA EN LO GENERAL "
bad,"Everyone is always in a happy mood and willing to help you out. I learned about team work, jumping in and helping someone. Management was always there to support you. There wasnt a hard part about the job."
bad,I can't judge all the walmarts but this one in particular was very unorganized!!!!  I wouldn't recommend working at this one
bad,"- Excelente ambiente laboral, se da énfasis al respeto por las personas"
bad,"Coupure des postes de gérants sans avis, j'ai perdu mon emploi sans avoir été informé des coupures de poste."
bad,"8 years of hassel, money and advances taken away, job security was none. Had an accident and injuried my knee, was talked out of getting it wrote up,big mistake I suffered with pain for years til I had a replacement."
bad,"Hardest part was getting all the demands done within the time frame they gave us. Very frustrating at times, but fun sometime. Co workers was okay, but management was unorganized and unbearable"
bad,"I think they should improvement on there policy with there attendance and other things with this company."
bad,the fact that job security is very low for this place. after losing my job after only three months showed that no matter how hard you work that it doesnt matter to either upper management or the owner
bad,Will never work for this company again. far too high of a stress level.  corporate management could not care less of everyone's daily struggles. all about profit not the people like they say they are.
bad,"Disorganized schedule."
bad,"Worked part-time while in school. Paid you next to nothing and expect you to break limbs for them. Only 2 out of the 6 managers of the store actually cared about you and how you felt about the job, the others could care less. Co-workers were the best part of job. Overall worst place i have EVER worked"
bad,"* muchos clientes mejores ventas mas ganancias "
bad,"spreed sheets, meetings, customer sv, sales, inventory, "
bad,"The management team does not back you up when trying to manage the department correctly. The co-workers have attitudes that make it hard to work there. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everything is going accordingly, and all positions within the department are filled appropriately. Management only helps those that they think deserve it. I learned that no matter what you do it is still not good enough for Wal-Mart managers and the above management team."
bad,".I enjoyed my job as a good worker I was always given plenty to do,more than most of the others. Some of my co-workers were also good workers.Sadly some were not so the hard workers always take up the slack. The only problem with that was it seemed Management made no effort to get the ones performing poorly to improve."
bad,"Uma empresa com um porte muito grande, que poderia investir mais  nos seus colaboradores, para que tenha um desempenho melhor."
bad,Good working environment. Management just needs to provide more hours to work.
bad,"Typical workday varied, management wasn't very professional, co-workers were awesome, hardest part of this job was doing everybody elses job."
bad,"Very busy, 7 departments the 5 years I was at Store 1087, we had the best of the best in Management, co-workers were awesome there are no words there are a few people there that need to be recognized. The Clean up and being able to stay on task, without being pulled from one department to the other. Most enjoyable would be after work, getting together."
bad,"I usually am surrounded by customers who all want to be helped at once. I've learned about new products, how to sell cell phones, and now have more experience in customer service. Management isn't the greatest here. They often blame associates for any problem in the store. The co-worker can be good, yet sometimes difficult when they don't get their work done. However that's with any job. The hardest part was trying to keep from upsetting customers by not getting to them soon enough, even when there is a line in front of them. Or if we don't have a product that they want. My favorite part is meeting new people and getting to exchange ideas and theories about different subjects."
bad,"When I was working for Walmart, we had sales problems, so hours were always low. Other than that, no problems at all."
bad,I did not like the corporate policies. People were not treated fairly. Favoritism occurred a lot.
bad,"met some great people that became life long friends,"
bad,Walmart Is a good company but the individuals who work in management positions could work way harder and better to make each store better.
bad,"very fast paced busy envorionment"
bad,"The management for the walmart i worked at was very rude, and offered no help if needed i will never work for this company again."
bad,I would come to work and check the floor for old merchandise or  merchandise that may be ready to go out. I would then check all orders to insure that they were ready to be picked up. I would then call any customers who had a cake ready or to verify the date of pick up. I would bake fresh bread and cookies for the following day .I would then stock the floor. Once all was done I would clean and sanitize all utensils used. I learned how to decorate cakes and to design cup cake cakes. The management was really helpful and they gave clear directions. My co workers taught me a lot and we enjoyed working together. The hardest part of the job was getting the icing on the cake just right. The best part of the job was seeing the look on the customers faces when they picked their cake up.
bad,I was a cart pusher and when I tried to climb the latter I pretty much was only aloud to side step
bad,I would never work at walmart again. I hardly ever got support from my supervisor when I called for help. If you can't keep customers happy even when they have to wait this is not the place for you.
bad,working here at this job keeps you on your feet and moving at all times. I learned how to work on the the IMS team and I learned how to take inventory. The managers her try to take their names to far like the assosicates are beneath them. I loved to team i worked with here. Hardest part of this job is climb ladders when you are afraid of hieghts. The enjoyable part is the customers.
bad,"Management supports are limited to lower employees, should be more oriented in promoting employee happiness."
bad,A typical work day was 5-9 I would come in lit my stuff up to the back check in than go to the front get assingend a station and would start work check many customers out and turn off my light at nine and go clock out
bad,"I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses and at the time I was in and out of the Hospital, due to this they let me go."
bad,"I have never been treated so bad!"
bad,I would not recommend working at Walmart if you have any other options. The customers can be extremely difficult to interact with. Hostile environment. Rampant theft and mistrust.
bad,"Typical day is you work as hard and fast as you can you finish your job and are expected to help the other people finish their job, and a lot of time they stand there and witch you work"
bad,This company is all about making numbers and expecting employess to handle approx 5000 packages every day.  The pay was decent but the work environment and management was less than tolerable
bad,"Pay is low, work is ok. Lucky if you get your paid breaks (2- 15 minutes) mandatory hour unpaid lunch so you'll be there 9 hours for an 8 hour pay. No benefits, no advancement opportunities."
bad,"its walmart. It's pretty bad overall but what would you expect. The customer base is awful, the people are awful and it's the most soul sucking job i've ever had."
bad,The only thing I don't like they are not fair to any employee if you're not part of the click and it doesn't matter how many years you been there if they want to get rid of you and they'll just come up and get rid of you  terminate.
bad,"While being a pharmacy technician is great, working at walmart is awful. The managers do not care about you and you will be very underappreciated. I would never recommend it."
bad,Initially I was very excited and ready to work the first couple of months were great..then i began to get harassed by many of my co workers and managers it got so bad i wouldn’t want to go to work at all my aunt passed away and i called in to go to her funeral and I addressed this with my manager and she said everything was fine because “she didn't work that day” and a week later she fired me for that
bad,Biggest issue I see at Walmart stores. Is they are quick to let a 10+year associate leave just so they can hire someone new at a lower rate. The store I worked for was a joke management only followed rules that were convenient for them. And the head manager was like a high school girl and the store was handled much the same wa
bad,You are a number; overworked and underpaid. They do not appreciate you. Upper management is out for themselves and their bonus's not for the peon doing all the work!!!!!!
bad,The employees were amazing but the over all job was not at all great. They we high demand and expected unrealistic results. I would never ask my worst enemy to here. It is good for students but not for long time work. They are draining and stressful. Not good for mental health
bad,"i hated this job, they also don't care if you're sick, if you have an emergency or anything. i wouldtn recommend this to anyone unless it was last resort"
bad,"Staff was very rude , they over worked me and paid me little to nothing , the schedule was horrible it was just a mess I wouldnt Dare go back , even if it was my last choice"
bad,"In my four years working there, managers had relations with associates, and helped them get higher positions. Threatened associates with force then would help protect their own when reported by moving them to another store."
bad,"My boss after every shift would tell me I hadn't done anything after 8 hours of being there. He'd threaten me with cameras too but, never followed through. Got so tired of it I quit."
bad,"Overall Walmart only cares about the customers not the employees. Benefits are horrible, the working environment is bad. You get two twenty minute breaks for a twelve hour day, but for some reason  the ten and eight hour shifts also get two twenty minute breaks. The favoritism has gotten really bad. The pay is okay, but when it is slow your paycheck suffers."
bad,"Walmart was great sometimes, I worked with my ex and he made it a nightmare which resulted in me quitting because he was good with the managers and I was not"
bad,Walmart isn’t a terrible company. It’s management that makes it terrible. After recently quitting because my manager treated me like trash & and made direct comments to me being right out rude. I decided I could be there anymore because of her.
bad,If you want to work for a company that doesn't care about you treat you like a robot works you like a slave and pay you peanuts then work for Walmart.
bad,"Dont work on cap 2, management routinely cleanse house there by burning out the workers and pushing them out the door, terrible work environment, everyone's dramatic"
bad,Walmart offered variety to ensure everyday wasn't the same however i really didn't feel like i belonged when my tasks at work weren't exactly clear. i would help people check out but i did shop backs when it wasn't what i was assigned by the manager random supervisor had me doing other tasks that weren't assigned
bad,"Would recommend this for kids coming out of high school that need to be introduced into hard work. This isn’t for everyone. Holidays, you’ll be working. Only REAL holiday you will get is Christmas and it’s only because that’s the only day they close"
bad,"Mismanaged awful place. Maybe it was just that store but I dreaded going to work every day, as well as almost every other person that worked there. Good for a teenager maybe"
bad,You have to kiss butt to get recognized for anything. I worked there 8 years no raise and management play favoritisms. I was only making 12.80  after busting my butt for 8 years!
bad,I have  very good experience as a number one Department manger in the Walmart store. I have good experiences about any kind of manage and problem solve
bad,"Truly the most miserable place on Earth to work.  You are expected to give everything you've got.  The management is pathetic, and the other employees are either drunk, high, or hateful.  Sometimes all 3."
bad,"Wal-Mart is cut throat. The managers, HR, etc. are unprofessional. They favor current employees over others and work the s**t out of the one they don't care for(me being one of them). They give me plenty of hours but expect me to do 2 or even 3 other jobs aside from my own. My job description says one thing but I can't tell you the last time I actually did my real job. I will do every little thing they ask me to do but it's still not enough for them despite walking 5+ miles in a single shift and lifting probably around 300+ pounds throughout the entire  shift, not all at once mind you. Overall, don't apply if you are not willing to break your back for this horrible company."
bad,They claim you get fflma for family emergencys but when my car broke down the kept passing the buck and wouldn't work with me and fired new then said I quit when air called everyday. Never met half my managers in the 6 months I workers there
bad,"Dont work for walmart. They dont care about you, or how hard you work all they care about is making money. NOT keeping customers/employees happy. They dont even care about your availability."
bad,It’s a iffy type of job they don’t respect the employees and they treat you as an associate like dirt the management is doing the workers and thinks that is alright would not recommend
bad,"Looking for a good job to start your career? It's not too bad honestly. Do not get brainwashed into staying forever though. More than likely your location will have horrible management and leaders, it's just inevitable, and it is unbearable."
bad,They stuck horrible company and they didn't know what to do or talk about it in the am 6and and I am on the next couple weeks and they are there for the
bad,"Walmart is not a fun or engaging workplace, they do not care about their employees and only think of you as a number. They will not promote you no matter how long you have been there. Huge turnover rate for a reason."
bad,"This place only cares about the numbers, not you. Management looks out for themselves only. Trust no one in this company. They'll never have your back."
bad,When I was there I feel like I was set up for failure from the start. I had a target on my back from day one. I had to leave because I was told I never did anything which was not the case. Managers all have each other’s back and don’t listen to associates. This is not a good place to work. They don’t care about their employees.
bad,Poor management Sometimes know one to relive you for your breaks. Some employees got. by with everything.Not enough supplies to work with. Worked with out date food.
bad,Good Experience good people learned alot of new things moved up from cashier to maneger in just a matter of years it was a great experience for me and family
bad,This is a company that only cares about profits. They will work employees like dogs and then punish them if they miss a day or call out with legitimate complaints or reason. Holidays you will never get off because Walmart wants to make money but yet up higher in the food chain they will get to be home relax with their families but the hard working people at Walmart nope.
bad,Horrible management! In higher up management they do not back you up with anything even with proof! They do not allow for any sick time. They fraternize with their employees and whoever they choose.
bad,It really a just one of those just another day in the office type jobs but also something new everyday which is also something I find to be interesting
bad,"the pharmacy that I worked in was staffed with good people. we laughed, we joked and had a good time but we still got our work done. I would recommend this place to anyone."
bad,Don’t work for Walmart . I’m pretty sure everyone who works there agree. But bills don’t stop coming just because you don’t like your job . Or because you’re underpaid .
bad,Working at Walmart is depressing. Management is awful  and literally hardly care about you they treat you as if your lie revolves around working there
bad,"I enjoyed my work, it is a very fast paced environment ware you always need to be ready to take whatever is tossed at you. I was harassed by my direct supervisor every day, making me feel very uncomfortable. After reporting nit almost daily to HR and seeing no reports I was forced to quit. I later found out that none of the my complaints were every filed. They covered it up for him allowing him to harass all the young girls on his shift."
bad,"Working at Walmart was incredibly depressing and stressful, the management staff do not help out and will pass off their duties to their employees. The only good thing about that place is your fellow employees."
bad,Nao tem respeito com os funcionários e falta de preparo de alguns superiores
bad,I was working at walmart and while getting my lunch at burger king I looked down and saw a fifty dollar bill on the floor NOW I COULD HAVE JUST PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND I WOULD STILL HAD MY JOB but I wanted to find the owner of that 50 dollar bill so I told the manager I found it and if the owner came looking fir it that I was in the bakery to send them to there I also told four of my coworkers I had found the 50 dollars if the owner came looking for it remember I COULD HAVE KEPT IT THE NEXT DAY A ASSITANCE MANGER CALLED ME ON THE WAY HOME AND SAID COME BACK TO THE STORE i TOLD HER I COULD NOT BECAUSE I HAD TO GO TO MY SECOND JAB AT PIZZA HUT BUT WOULD BE IN THE NEXT DAY THAT DAY SHE WASNT IN AND TWO DAYS THEY later they fired me we had no store manger at the time on my exit interview the assitance managers lied I went to globael ethics and open door and they upheld the termination without ever talking to my five witnesses the new I was trying to find the owner AS i POINTED OUT I COULD HAVE JUST KEPT THE MONEY AND I WOULD STILL HAVE MY JOB AND THE FIFTY DOLLARS WHICH TURNEN IN THE DAY THEY TERMINATED ME
bad,Walmart has horrible communication skills and not everybody is treated fairly management is demanding there's more bosses then leaders management take credit for what the worker do
bad,"Overall a good job to work, you gain skills and learn new things on a daily basis everyday is a different day! Although management treats employees with disrespect, not everyone at this company gets treated equal they have favoritism."
bad,Nepotistic atmosphere. Your managers treat you like dirt. Your given unrealistic expectations. The only upside to working there was the fact that you could use a app and get paid early but alot of places have that as well.. So it still sucks to work there.
bad,"customers where rude. especially when your shifts about to end and u had to run to avoid the point for late clock out. managers don't care about your availability change when it's time. oh, and they even put you on schedule even if you have approved leave of absence threw sedgewick. don't go here."
bad,No overtime. There systems was messed up. Never wanted to work with anyone. They was always rude. Didnt want to help anyone when a customer asked for help
bad,"When I started, Walmart was amazing. But homeoffice is sending down ridiculous rules and changes. I understand wanting what’s best for the company, but what about what’s best for the customer? H/O does not deal with customers daily, these changes are losing the company money"
bad,The corporation is well structured but the location that I work at has had a systemic and catastrophic failure of the top leadership as well as middle management and unfortunately due to policies in place by the corporate office it is impossible to transfer to another location to try to salvage some type of career out of the dead end job I am stuck in at my current location so as soon as I am able to find another job I will be leaving sadly. there are a lot of good people that work there but everyone I have talked to is frustrated with the situation and looking for other employment.
bad,"its a good place to work at , you learn new things the hardest thing is having to deal with rude customers and if you take your time everything will be okay."
bad,"Trabaje como auxiliar de casino, donde la maestra me trataba solo con groseria y abusaba de su poderio, una tenia que almorzar corriendo mientras ella con sus amigas se demoran 45 minutos a una hora, almorzando..la de recursos humanos le dijo a la maestra que me iba a echar porque no le hice unos panes con chorizos el 17..de septiembre ya que mi salida era a las 8 y ella llego faltando 10 minutos para las 8...ella no me iba a pagar  hora extras, que todos estabamos fn sus manos..me pregunto quien es el jefe y pirque todos quieren mandar ?"
bad,los empleados no son tratados de la mejor manera y siempre les exigen demasiado
bad,"They have no respect for their employees, unorganized , doesn’t except doctors excuses , and works you 39 hrs just so you they can keep you as part time"
bad,"Was fired for attendance issues caused by 3rd party outside if work, attempted to speak to manager about concerns on attendance, was told they couldn't change schedule, so wound up losing job as feared, I won't even shop that store again, ever"
bad,"Walmart has gone downhill quickly, it has good benefits and some managers are great, but overall it has been an unenjoyable experience with obvious favoritism."
bad,Los encargados son buenos exepto en perfumería abusan de que son mujeres
bad,walmart is a good job but each area has different managers all trying to direct employees at the same time so it was a bit chaotic the overnight crew for unloading trucks was a fun job
bad,"Management is not good, poor conditions, physically demanding job with little pay, managers did not communicate well, worked in below freezing conditions."
bad,"Liked the job but there are managers that feel they need to be competitive with the workers. Other than that, it is a good place to work other than the low wages. It's a good second job!"
bad,"Wal-Mart is a detriment to mental health. You're threatened to make sure you don't get overtime unless the corporate overlords say you can. But they never actually tell when they're offering overtime, you have to guess. And, if you guess too many times, you don't get any overtime."
bad,I was in the hospital for a whole week and I missed one day of work and forgot to call out so I was fired. I do not recommend working here. Run away!!
bad,I have been gone from this job to long to give a proper comment.  When I was there it was a decent place to work but I don't know about hope it is now so I have no comment.
bad,"Cult of personality, Nothing is certain here, If you are a concrete type personality you may want to look elsewhere, If you don't like the phrase run the play and you want to innovate, Search elsewhere"
bad,While I worked for Walmart I was trained for a few days then I started working on my own. During this time I needed extra support and i did not revived support as I wished.
bad,It was a terrible time at Walmart I could barely pay bills while trying to still come up with food for my children and the management was terrible completely disorganized
bad,Walmart is such a terrible place to work it’s unbelievable. I had to speak with my manager 5TIMES to get my schedule changed cause he didn’t believe I was going to college.. I work in the deli and there is no respect for anyone there. None from co-workers and certainly not from managers. Manager has wrote me up for leaving boxes on a cart that was supposed to be taken care of by a different team in a different department  first chance I get I’m leaving I warn all of you...DO NOT WORK HERE!!!
bad,"It's awful. If you're a slacker, go for it, you'll fit right in. If you're a hard worker, they'll push you to do everyone else's work. Favoritism, low pay, strict schedule, ridiculous pto and sick time policy. This company is just horrible to work for."
bad,"its not what you know for this company but who you know, they overlook their good associates for the non performers. very stressful work environment, no coverage which has to be covered by customer service managers."
bad,"good vacation days wasn't that bad a little fast paced"
bad,"WalMart was a decent place to work. I enjoyed my time there. Some challenges that I faced was, ongoing training. They wanted me to get a certified business license."
bad,"Walmart pays well for the town I live in but with recent changes in how stores are structured, they have eliminated shifts and positions and have not been helpful in placing displaced employees in positions that work with their needs (schedule, hours, days off, etc)."
bad,I would not go back to Wal-Mart because they don't care about customer service. I literally get reprimanded if I spent anytime not stalking the shelves because I was helping a customer.
bad,Walmart is a cool working Job love seeing a bunch of people come in and out of such a big store like Walmart and helping out as much as I can just to see a smile on their face
bad,The management team need to get in sync.and have more approachable people skills not just with customers but with their associates(employees)and they need more communication skills.
bad,Didn’t like working there. Management was rude and tests employees poorly. No organization. Paid poorly. Treated poorly. Didn’t get along with anyone there
bad,over all not a good job. managers cared about the bottom dollar more the workers. made working there a living nightmare . would fire workers for the smallest of offenses
bad,overall its not that bad. but management are not very helpful and can be really rude. depending on what shift your on they always understaffed. and expect you to work faster and do more then what is even humanly possible. lots of employee theft and not bad for a first job
bad,"Horrible place to work, managers do not care about their employees. Managers talk a lot about their employees behind there backs. Only care about them"
bad,"Poucos funcionários e  poucas ferramentas necessárias para a busca de um bom resultado. "
bad,"I have countless stories about how obnoxiously capitalistic but this one takes the cake. IT IS TRUE!"
bad,"Everyone is out for themselves, none of the managers care what you need to do for your department and will bounce you across the store without asking. Most of the managers themselves do noting but complain stuff while never picking up a box themselves, some aren't bad but at the end of the day they rather cover themselves that help you. The attendance system sucks, they only give you a certain amount of call outs and if you do then you lose your bonus per quarter and on certain days it counts twice. The stores are always understaffed and the front end is a chaotic nightmare. Over all...just save yourself the annoyance an work at any other venue."
bad,The problem at this walmart was not enough people working together most were just focused on their daily tasks at hand not to much worried about put forth an team effort.
bad,Walmart use to care about it’s employees... besides benefits they have basically took everything away from their employees . Long term associates being phased out .. they cutting hrs which causing them to leave and losing their benefits
bad,"Was age discriminated and never paid my last pay check, would not recommend ever working here unless you like being treated poorly! Walmart has a terrible management staff."
bad,At 1279 it's a favorite over there everybody do their own thing I've been there 10 years and I never got moved up how to manage to do their own thing they don't do no work I just tell people what to do the story is not in order customers complain all day and no work has been done bonus and raises we haven't got that's the worst or I ever worked at
bad,My wife had post partum depression and psychosis after giving birth to our daughter and when i would be off to go to hospital i would get the days off counted against me and with 6 bad marks in under 6 month you will be terminated
bad,"There is no room to stock the shelves because they are overloaded with merchandise and they just want more crammed in, but yet they tell you to keep it neat but get your numbers, it’s a catch 22! This module is not built to hold all they want to sell and it looks like a disaster. Have to meet a daily goal and weekly goal and if you don’t meet it no matter how hard you are working you will get occurrences. The management doesn’t care at all!"
bad,"I was hired as a full-time employee, only worked about an average of 25 hours and was told they didn’t have enough hours for staff. Their solution was to hire 15 more cashiers so hours were cut In half. Also, if you have nothing better today than to scream at a Walmart employee for something they can’t control you’re the scum of the earth"
bad,"Management is rude and cold hearted. Quick to tear you down, now respect to those under them. Does nothing for work morale. Very high school clique type of work environment"
bad,"I really don't have much to say about Walmart Supercenter, hopefully they change they way they treat customers and employee's. Walmart is a place I'll never see myself at again."
bad,Csm were so rude to us cashiers in front of customers . Yelled at and embarassed in front of customers. Ive seen csm rolled their eyes because we called them to help us with a customer. And overhear them talk bad about other workers. No respect for cashiers and no confidentiality
bad,"I was working there for a bit. Negative work culture and uncomfortable workplace. I only worked there part time , All employees / managers were gossipy ,focusing only on negative things about company and how badly run it is ,which is true. You will work every single weekend and when you ask for day off. Manger will just threatened  to cut your hous or write you up.No surprise since they treat their employees with the utmost disrespect with constant yelling, pressure and passive aggressive withholding of information  (schedule changes , trying to force me to change my availability to work longer hours )poor work life balance, culture of having to watch your back and pretend to agree with your Manger."
bad,Would not work  for them again for any reason.  Management only is after there sales bounces.  Do not schedule the staff right.  Work 8 days straight  with no days off
bad,"The place wasn’t bad but the management was rlly poor and inexperienced "
bad,This company does not appreciate it's employees. They work long hours and are always short staffed. This job is really overwhelming to us older people.
bad,Do not work at first colonial Walmart .. they are so messy and unorganized they will hire you and not give you any hours at all !!!! Especially if you can’t ALWAYS work nights .. the store manager is RUDE & NASTY !!!
bad,Walmart always hires more associates for morning and evening shift's but when it's time for night crew they will hire very few employees. You have to give your 200% than also they will not appreciate your work. If you are an outsider than you will not get promoted to higher positions and when you raise questions they will reply that you are over educated. Dont work for night shifts.
bad,"You are expected to do the work of five, type of vibe. You are reprimanded humiliated if ever you lose the Mark. Despite the years of meeting expectations. Unprofessional Managers that will do things that will make you cringe. Stressful environment were you are told to get the impossible done as a helping tool if you are meet with unforeseen circumstances."
bad,"Working for Walmart is kind of like today's public school system."
bad,"Terrible management with lots of favoritism and no consideration of workers situations or lives. ""Benefits"" are not worth the cost unless you have no other option or are paying an arm and leg for the best plans."
bad,Now Walmart was a ok job it was a great place to work until they got a new store Manager they change alot of things but the pay was ok poor customer service
bad,"Management was an absolute mess, & there was little to no store wide communication. My current job values coworkers socializing between each other & believe it’s key that we are all connected; all employees are automatically entered into a group chat. Where as Walmart has none of that, making it impossible to find people to switch shifts w & xyz"
bad,"i worked as an orderfiller it, it was extremely hard on your body.  poor management and production was hard to maintain. id never work there again it was horrible"
bad,"I worked for Walmart for two and half years, and I was so happy when I quit. I decided to take a job that paid $4 less an hour than what I was making at Walmart and if that doesn't tell you how bad I wanted to get out of that place then I don't know what will. Such an easy job that anyone can do, but the amount of stress and everyone you work with wanting to be the boss and not wanting to help you only make things dificult will drive a person crazy. The company also treats their employees like they don't matter and are 100% replaceable (because they are) and you must work there at least 3 years just to generate any type of PTO and the attendance polcies are very strict, they will not work with you at all. Only work the he11 out of you."
bad,Hello hey hey just checking for you and build the phone to find somewhere to your break or not have managed and provided excellent information for the information and
bad,Mucha presión y mal ambiente piden mucho y dan poco a cambio
bad,Working at Walmart is like going back to High school. If you don't make friends with the right people you cannot advance. Management and supervisors did not do their jobs correctly.
bad,Most Stressful place to work. Management is poor and they have favorites. If you're not one of their favorites they will give you a hard time and/or fire you.
bad,Good job great people to work with very easy. Payment was bi weekly. Indeed is forcing me to make an review about jobs I’ve worked at before..........
bad,Walmart most of the time was a bad was a bad experience for me it was like other people can sit around and not do nothing but when I was working it was always up in my face and always wonder what I'm doing instead of worrying about what the other people doing the ones that one doing what they were supposed to do they have enough money to give people raises but they won't give people raises I'm stealing this is how it isenough money to give people raises but they will not give them racist I'll tell you who said
bad,Horrible place. Horrible managers nothing but liars and morons incapable of telling the truth just a absolute joke and horrible excuse for a company. They need to give their managers a I.Q test before they hire them. Most of them do not have enough sense to manage a lemonade stand!
bad,None none none and none i do not want to say anything only that Walmart is the worst place to work they are rracists  they treat us like slaves and not pay anogh and they don't care about their employees
bad,"Es demasiado pesado y la paga es poca, además con lo q paso en el 2017 con el robó d utilidades t das cuenta q es una empresa q no piensa en sus empleados."
bad,"Long story short awful company to work for , the hiring progress is for children and they expect you to work magic around xmas time because THEY cant stop to figure out there ordering WAY to much products to fit on the shelfs and they wonder why the employees are stressing so hard to find places to put these items messing up other peoples set ups . One of many stressfull things walmart do"
bad,"They don’t work around your schedule, especially if you’re a high schools student. The managers are always on your azz  but when you seen help they don’t help you at all. They’ll tell you to do go backs and when you do, you’ll get called into the front center and get in trouble because you were assisted to go do something another manager asked you to do. The Walmart On Long Beach above and Arlington is a bad working place."
bad,"Management is not appropriate. Keeps trying to co"
bad,"Severely unstaffed casheirs, had winding lines for the duration of my shift with no break to the line. Poor management skills and a major lack of respect from management. Was hired for full-time yet only got 20 hours a week if I was lucky, when asked if I could have a few more shifts to meet.my contractually obligated hours I was told ""beggars can't be choosers"" they do not care about you I'd go home at the end of the day so sore I could hardly walk."
bad,Everyone was related to everyone else.  Walmart showed favoritism to those related to each other.  A stranger just didn't have a chance working there.
bad,"I would not recommend Walmart to my worst enemy."
bad,"I have been employed at Walmart for 4 years to long. Management is horrible, Dont even ask them to do anything for u because it want get done. There is alot of favoritism there, if ur not one tht they like u want get anything, Days off will be denied, Vac, Dr. apts NO COVERAGE is what it will always say and u will see employees on vacation all the time but it's no coverage. This is by far the worstplace  I have ever work"
bad,"You get paid a retail level wage to do warehouse level work. The managers don't listen half the time, and the other half they just do what they want. For example, put you on the schedule for volunteer work that you didn't agree to. No one communicates with each other, managers say that they respect if you're getting an education and then do the exact opposite. It's not worth it."
bad,"Trust me."
bad,"Very unfair, not consistant, favortisim, jumps to conclusions without asking first, allows Human resource to date store manager,  goes against their own policies, already has people picked for positions before jobs are posted, talks negative about associates, store managers treat her own team of management unfairly, management can never do wrong only hourly suffer consequences, do not care about their associates, no communication with department managers, management use foul language, management dating associates"
bad,"Managers are very rude and they expect you to work like slaves. They don’t care about you, just you getting your work done. Customers are also rude and nasty to you because they know you may need your job"
bad,"Management seems to lack basic human empathy, treating employees as replaceable cogs rather than actual people. They care only about whatever junk corporate sends their way, such as whatever is detailed in Walmart's ""one best way,"" though they often seem to disregard that for no apparent reason too."
bad,"I will never recommend walmart to work for. Extremely stressfull work place. Drama among other employees and clicks like its high school."
bad,"management is there to make numbers work"
bad,"If it had better communication more teamwork, and a better understanding of its employees .Walmart could be a better place. It does have its good points and its bad points."
bad,"If you start out as a Cashieer or any other front end associate, relocating to any other department is close to impossible. I was unable to relocate to another department while working there, and many of my front end associates had the same problem even after numerous years of working there. It is very frustrating."
bad,"I don't even know where to begin, the management is so terrible at the  Walmart I used to work for. They have one Walmart favorite who gets a higher pay raise than everyone else, and she only got to where she is because she dated a csm. They will fire you for no reason without any warning and lie to the workforce about why you were fired. The hours are good when you start but terrible 3 months later. ""Valued Managers"" will always be prioritized over hard working employees. The store manager and assistant managers will only promote you if you kiss their a** and make others feel like lesser people. These managers are the very definition of CORRUPT."
bad,Being maintenance associate isn’t a bad position I just feel as if no ladies should be out there gathering grocery carts and bringing them back into store. Definitely should be men doing that part of the job
bad,Working at Walmart was a living nightmare.. they stay flip flopping your schedule and you never get weekends off that you request.. if you have kids I hope u have somebody to help you with them.. Walmart is very strict and the point system is no joke..
bad,The benefits were pretty good at Wal-Mart. The work environment for the locations I worked was horrible. Management did not adhere to company policies and tried to penalize me for keeping proper policy.
bad,Management is awful and they only hire part time rarely will you get hours. Management takes partial to certain employees so if they like you you’ll be ok.
bad,"Got hired in externally. First was great now after 2 months and only 7 people on cap2 plus myself, 5 days working because they wont hire a second supervisor and the management wont bring me more people itnuas become obvious this isnt the career path i want to take. Making 17 an hour isnt bad but not worth it when im forced to stay till 3 am 4 days a week. Walmart still has the good ole boy  system"
bad,A typical day at Walmart was always filled with more tasks than could possiby be accomplished. This is done on purpose. They want you to push yourself hard constently. I learned that people can live on backstabbing and rumor spreading. The workplace culture reminded me of high school. The hardest part of the job was knowing which manager to obey since they were not a team and always looking for help to accomplish the overwhelming amount of tasks they were each assigned. The most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out.
bad,"Got a job as a ""Personal Shopper"" but in reality I worked in a warehouse,no air or heating, heavylifting and on your feet 9 hours a day,  when I asked when I would be trained for the job I applied for they said I wouldn't and that was that"
bad,I loved the customers & Co workers But that wasn’t the place for me I want to work for a company where I have a chance to grow within the company  Walmart
bad,Management is very divided and the market and regional management will lie to cover for themselves. There is no work life balance. Company only cares about market share and money.
bad,Not worker friendly. Doesn't not adjust work duties when you're disabled or pregnant. Lack of communication within management. Low pay rate with little chance of increase.
bad,"If you have shopped in Walmart, you understand my review. No matter who's in charge you can't make it a better , faster place. Yes customer are always #1 and my best part of the day. Walmart didn't provide us the tools we need to get threw each day. We ran out of bags every two weeks , short staff as always. It's just not my first go to for a job. It's not like how Walmart was when I was a kid."
bad,They do not care about their employees. They will ask for help and when you give it to them they will look for ways to get you fired so that they no longer look like they dont know what they're doing.
bad,Management lacks communication. Constantly getting yelled at for no reason. Hard workers get frowned upon while the lazy get promoted. They will force u to take a really late lunch. Management will bully u if they don’t like you.
bad,Walmart is not a company to work for if you have a sick child with cancer. When I needed time off for my daughter you have to go through another company to put in for leaves.
bad,Managers are mean dont speak to you work u like a sweat shop dont know how to talk to you like a human being mangers forget breaks be stuck on a register for hours they dont communicate with one another very un organized
bad,Kept wages small to compensate for large corporate bonus. Paid sick leave was based off of hours worked leaving some people with no time to care for parents/children/self while sick
bad,"Leadership has no idea how to run a store, only cause problems and not solutions.  Leaderships inexperience and rate of change causes undue turmoil and organizational chaos"
bad,"Doesnt seem bad at first, until you show them how good you are at your job. Then you can count on doing 5 other people's jobs, while also getting yelled at for not getting your own done. "
bad,I would work hard everyday for the company to get the customers order out on time. Every morning we/I would hear our boss tell us we didn’t do a good enough job. But I feel it was because whomever had control of how much work was released to pick did such a bad job that at the last 10 hours all sorts of work would come. So I believe we got blamed for their inability to release work on a more timely matter.
bad,Watch your health insurance they put what they want in there the benefit them and you find out later after you hurt yourself. You’re definitely overworked and under paid not enough help in the stores at all
bad,"a lot of favoritism and gossip even among managers and upper staff. a lot of employees wouldn't do what their supposed to do and never get caught, so you have to pull more weight than your own very often. never get recognized for doing your job well, only when mistakes are made"
bad,Great customers other than the managers. Managers dont do there jobs.  But other than that i loved working their. People may say different but we all have our own oppionins
bad,"Management is inconsiderate, plays favorites, and sets you up to fail on a daily basis, by providing unreasonable expectations and not allowing change of any kind"
bad,Very stressful atmosphere to much favoritism not a good place to work. Poor management schedules are never consistent when they can be. Bully goes on disrespecting associates you report nothing gets done about it.
bad,"The company has really started to focus on one thing and one thing only. Cutting costs. Hundreds of thousands of people were laid off as a result of a policy change here, which resulted in keeping people who had no understanding of what they were doing. Customer service managers have become the same way. The cashiers are having to train customer service managers on how to do their jobs, and freight stockers have to do the same thing. All to cut costs."
bad,"Average 30 hrs a week, managment was some of the worse I've ever seen all the way to the top seemed like no one knew what the other was doing,very poorly planned work days, benefits were on the pricey side with very poor coverage"
bad,"<Stressful>poor training<Poor Management>Stressful workplace, dealing with too many chiefs, some of the co-workers made it a bearable place to work,,,"
bad,"They tell you that you will get more hours of you open up your availability and if you get a secondary but that's all a lie they still cut people's hours thinking thats ok, they dont tell you when they change your schedule they'll say why dont you look it up yourself cause we have a app to show us our schedule but that's not what you should do once its changed you should call the person and I was off that day too"
bad,"Walmart is ag rest company to work for if your not a manager. The pay is very good but too much is expected of you Walmart will hire the least associates to do the most work, the turn over rate is astronomical everyone gets fed up and quits leaving the work to fall on others who stay"
bad,I cant say anything for other stores but I worked at one of the underperforming Neighbrohood Markets. Outside of the basic online training you get management refuses to teach you. I had to rely on a coworker to learn what I actually needed beyond protocol. Place was heavily disorganized no matter how many times I'd set something I turn my back and it's a disaster again. Management was insufferable and suffocatingly micro. Communication and work supply was nonexistent. Management refuses to listen to anything you say unless they didnt like it.
bad,They treat you terribly and make you do more then your position describes without paying you more money to do it. If your pregnant or sick and go to the doctor and can’t come to work they don’t care even if you bring an ER note stating so. They treat their staff terribly and the managers disappear and talk trash about customers and staff sometimes even to their face. It’s a good first job but not for long term at all.
bad,respect an the hardest part of the is when your buy yourself on the parking lot i learn how to run the cart pusher the most enjoyable part of the job is when u take lunch
bad,This company makes sure that new hires and people that has worked for them for over a year never get to full-time status. As long as they can keep you at part time they don't have to provide you with any insurance or benefits.
bad,"Worst place to work, they work you to death for little pay. The point system for absences is ridiculous. They advertise flexible hours but that is not true. I would not recommend working at Walmart."
bad,"It's a place where the managers if they pick on you and hate you,they will send you everywhere move you around just when you feel good at a cash register;they like to get you in trouble for not doing anything bad at all;yet they will come up with something invent it out of the blue to make you look like a ""bad guy""no matter how hard you try to do the job right :("
bad,Work loads were very unfair in certain areas oof the store do to lack of staffin that was never handled in a timely manner. Management team was very uncommunicative with each other when work issues were addressed
bad,"Was fired for a fight between my partner and a shoplifters that I wasn't involved in. No video evidence was shown to me, but the fact that management said they saw me was a complete lie."
bad,It was an OK.job at 1st until I saw there true colors & how they was wot curtain people than they was quick to give out this point system but erased points from other people that they like
bad,its so unorganized there and hectic that the only type of people who choose to stay there are usually those who cant fit anywhere else because of language barriers or personal problems.
bad,"Very stressful and poor management. If you wanna grow up in any way this is not the place you want to be. Management always angry and screaming at you in front of costumers and other associates, very disrespectful."
bad,Great company that is constantly changing. Retail is tough but when you are the big dog everybody is gunning for you. I would like to see them get into banking and implement more technology.
bad,Nothing much to say except its walmart. You never got overtime and when you did you got written up. They make you work full time hours and when you become eligible for fulltime benefits the bump your hours back. After starting to pay 11 and Hour you did anything wrong it was immediate termination. They didn't warn you. The management staff wants money without the work. The only person who made this Job tolerable was our Associate Manager over Automotive.
bad,"really bad. "
bad,Wal-Mart doesn’t appreciate our hard work and on top of that supervisors and managers treat us bad. It’s very stressful working there. I would never work there again.
bad,The usual night at walmart consists of being confused and being understaffed upfront because no one knew how to schedule or do work. I mean come on! It's simple if you see someone struggling lend them a hand and don't tell them they're slow before you toss them to another department then immediately pull them back onto the floor.
bad,"Walmart, at least at the store I work in, is a terrible heck of a location. Would not recommend at all. Do not even think of it, no matter how good it may seem to be. It is simply not worth it."
bad,"intake funds through cash, credit card, checks, vouchers, gift cards greet customer, clean stocking and count inventory assist with go backs and overtime."
bad,Walmart is not a place I would every recommend to anyone to work. We were forced to work through our breaks if a customer needed help. If you got hurt at work and it was not your fault they still treat you like it was.
bad,"Walmart is a negative place to work.  Management pretends to care about their employees but only see them as tools to serve their own needs.  They constantly talk about the ""One Best Way"" but refuse to follow it and few know it.  Things are constantly changing not because the company is evolving but management has no clue what they're doing.  There seems to be no real reward for the good performers and no real encouragement for the poor performers.  My team has been stuck with poor performers for years because my management team won't back my decision to let some go or to conduct the appropriate disciplinary actions."
bad,Not speaking for all Walmart but this place has really bad trained employees. It's a circus show. But I'm sure a lot of employees do work hard for this company as it is a job. But definitely not a favorite of mine.
bad,"My hours were never consistent the work was slow and hardly anyone wanted to do the work that did need to be completed. "
bad,"Walmart does not care about its employees. They are not attentive, work you way too hard, don't listen to their employees and they are prejudiced. I hate working here."
bad,"General Manager yells and screams at you on the floor.  Mandates you to work on your off day with not notice whether vacation is scheduled or not.  Intimidating, demeaning no work life balance.  GM's quote, I dont care how many days or hours you have to work.  Oh by the way he only works 5 days a week 7:30 am to 3:30.  My average day 5:00 am - 5:30 pm 6 to 7 days a week."
bad,Don’t work here if you want to have a life don’t work here if your rent is higher than 900 because you won’t get it never again will I slave my self for a company that doesn’t Care about their employees
bad,The management was all over the place and I ended up with a bladder infection because they would not let me go to the bathroom. Don't ever work at this place.
bad,"Drug tested for Customer Host, long periods of standing, bad management, unorganized, always understaffed.Good breaks but I worked 35 hours and didn't receive full timer benefits."
bad,"ABC rises above any other employer out there by putting all of us associates first. Among the many opportunities that ABC provides, tremendous employee engagement fuels our fire. Overall ABC is a friendly, rewarding, supportive, fast paced and positive atmosphere to jump into. I am truly honored and proud to work for ABC. If you want to grow as an individual and be apart of a great team"
bad,"I started there because my boyfriend got me an interview. I started out in the photo lab. Then the toy department. Then the accounting office. It wore a lot on me and management wasn't fair to people. The hardest part was dealing with my disabilities, I couldn't always do everything I needed to do. My boyfriend helped me a lot. But it was very wearing on me."
bad,"The upper management does not support new managers. If you try to implement the training from the academy to this store, you will be black balled and called incompetent. Managers talk about employees behind their back and will have you destroy friendships with your co workers. If you are not liked by upper management, they will micromanage and force you out."
bad,"I have been at Walmart for over fifteen years. I have been the department manager for two departments for fourteen of those years. A couple months ago, they came in and told us we were no longer department managers. They were dividing us into three groups. Leads, academy trainers and sales associates. I was offered an academy trainer position on nights for the same pay. I can’t work nights, so I declined. They told me I would have to see what positions were left after everyone else was offered their positions. This took over a month waiting to see if I still had a job or not. They finally called me back to tell me I would be a sales associate on days if I signed consent to a ten percent wage deduction. I had no choice but to sign it. Now, I am doing everything in six departments I was doing before in two without the pay. I have to work every weekend and my days off are split up. I’ve always been an asset to this company. The store managers and assistants have always given me great evaluations, my attendance is outstanding, the customers love me, but now I feel very bitter and can’t wait to leave this company. The people they picked to be leads were undeserving and received a big pay increase. Now, the departments I used to run look horrible, everyone is lost in other departments, so customers are getting upset because no one knows anything. Everyone is unhappy now and going in there every day is now a challenge."
bad,I had a very bad experience  as an employee at walmart. I have heard of a lot of bad stories of working there. This company is unprofessional and unethical.
bad,There are not enough words in the dictionary and I do not have enough time in my life to describe the sheer disgrace that Walmart is. I wouldn't even use their toilet if it means going into one of their stores again.
bad,"This was my first job, things may have changed in the last few years. We were overworked, would get in trouble for using the bathroom (any break from working). Very confrontational management, i had a situation where a manager got in my face as if he were going to hit me (which led to me leaving). Not a good environment for the workers. Managers were not on the same page, so employees would be tasked with multiple tasks in different areas in the store. Overall my experience, as well as my coworkers was not very pleasurable."
bad,"long hours hard work stressfull, back stabbing , throwing others under the bus , its all about make yourself look better by making others look bad, old boy network , horrible place to work ."
bad,"Long days of cashiering for rude & impatient customers."
bad,Managment is the worse at the main street store and they look for reasons to get rid of you. All the manager play different roles and do not do the role they should. Theft is so bad at this store and they do nothing about it.
bad,"Treat your workers better. It's not shocking that you lose cashiers at the speed of light. You encourage a toxic, cult-like management environment and when you do hire good managers, their stress inevitably leaks out on the associates. Do better."
bad,I worked in side the store at Walmart  helping people who came into the store to shop help them find what they were looking for. I loved helping them shop plus i all so greeted people worked in the liquor store two.
bad,Every day is fast paced. You must have good time management skills and expect things to change every hour. You quickly learn that you are there for the customer and they make your day
bad,"I have never felt less like a human being as I did while working here. Management at all levels cause problems for associates. They were clueless about the departments being supervised and refused to help when we were understaffed. The understaffing came from upper management and seemed intentional. The Store manager would look for any reason to coach/write people up. For example, one guy got in trouble with the store manager for not being enthusiastic enough when acknowledging his presence. The pettiness and favoritism were disgusting. You as an associate are expected to take all kinds of disrespect without complaint. Some people could get away with doing nothing and if you brought this up with management they would just tell you to pick up the slack. There is not much room for promotion even for people eagerly pursuing such. If you get injured or sick and need to go to the doctor, good luck trying to keep the job. Even having documentation will not prevent you from getting punished by their rigid attendance policy. They offer a quarterly bonus but if you ever have to call out for any reason, you won't be getting it. Even those qualified randomly don't get their bonus. I think the only good experience I had working here was with the in-house HR department who really went out of their way to help the associates. "
bad,awful company to work for.  No direction of where they are going and none for where you are going or wind up in the company.  They just are interested in working you like a slave and nothing more.  It was the worst experience of my life.
bad,maybe if it wasn't the walmart on Shawnee mission it would have been different but the work experience i received was seriously lacking. Not to mention they had poor management if any at all.
bad,"I thought this job was a fun way to learn about cars and help pay my bills. "
bad,"Most days were ""fine"", but nothing ever seemed to be good enough to please management. Only in the presence of customers did management appear to take care of us. Behind closed doors, we were told everyone is replaceable and that we're not important by management. Extremely lackluster benefits for full-time employees. Only thing I enjoyed from this job was the daily work out."
bad,"Walmart was not my best job experience as there seemed to be no clearly defined management support and it was an atmosphere of not what you know how to do, but who you know to get what what you want."
bad,working at Walmart was ok but very stressful and I would not recommend it to anyone and my things I had to was zone crafts and help others and pick up reshops
bad,i would never work for another walmart again they dont treat their employees rite. the pay was not the best they could do better they need to offer better trainig to employees
bad,I worked at Wal-Mart in 2008 to 2009 and the management was poor at the time I don't know how the management is now but could not advance and applied for other store positions never got a reply.
bad,Great people to work with but the over all corporate company is horrible. They take everything they can and act like they give you the world in return but they are just pinching the penny.
bad,A few years ago it was a good place to work but within the last few years it’s gotten worse.   No holiday pay but they expect you to work on the holiday or else you get double points for calling in.   Management will hire people that know absolutely nothing about the job rather then experienced people for supervisors or lead roles.   And also expect you to stay longer then your shift to finish someone else’s department but won’t allow you to keep your overtime.   And now bonuses for hourly associates are getting smaller then what they previously were due to the new changes they made (probobly to save them money)
bad,"the management is very poor, always managers messing with you schedule and cutting hours, never approve vacation time and to get them to approve your PTO Sick is super hard"
bad,"the store does not care for it's employees. there are no such thing as doctor excuses, so you lose points for missing shifts no matter the cause, even if it was a legitimate medical reason. they are all about making money and not about caring for their employees"
bad,I worked there for 8 yrs almost and I learned customer service and how to work with others. I learned how to use a ladder and pallet jack correctly...
bad,"Coworkers were friendly well some.. "
bad,"I had worked at Walmart for 14 years.  I was never late for work, and only missed less than 10 days due to sickness. I was a very competent, thorough, speedy stocker.  I began in produce, then used in almost all departments, concluding in meat wall.  I was called in by an assistant manager who informed me, as well as others, that our hours would no longer be given at the local level, therefore they could not assure any amount of hours of work, but indicated that they would be drastically cut.  I felt that I had no alternative but to resign due to this uncertainty and lack of appreciation for my years of faithful service to my job."
bad,"We Unload Huge Trucks And Stock Everything Management Does Not Care About You Nor Respect They Want There Freight Done And Every Department Or They Will Be Upset They Don’t Care What Your Excuse Is , Lots Of Customers Come In There And Make Me Laugh A Lot"
bad,They offer great benefits and a chance to advance in the company. They really need to retrain management. Walmart did not like the fact that you had a life outside of the company.
bad,"When working at walmart, They were highly aware of my medical condition. I ended up have a seizure a week after I put my 2 weeks in at the company, the manager in the department I was in told me that since I already put my 2 weeks in and I couldn't would the day after my seizure (keep in mind I just got 8 staples and 2 stitches on the top of my head) he told me there was no point in me staying my 2 weeks. He tried to fire me a week before my quitting date because of my medical condition. I wouldn't refer anyone to work at walmart. They are disrespectful and treat employees like they mean nothing."
bad,"Every day you tend to do the same areas, but they do try to get you into other areas to learn. While I worked there I learned grocery, hardware, Automotive, Sporting goods, and toys stocking and bin areas. Plenty of work so your never bored, if you get done you move on to help your coworkers, or they come to help you get done. I don't think anything was hard about the job really just some days you had a lot of work and may have to get help from a coworker to get done. Working with coworkers was the best part of the job, they kept it from getting boring and you could get done with an area faster and easier."
bad,I love the job I hate who I work for... Walmart is hard to work for they keep maki g up all these rules but last week after 4pm you are doi g 5 people's jobs
bad,"I needed a job at the time. It was not the best, but it paid the bills. The management was always not in the best mood when speaking to us and it was always like walking on eggshells with them"
bad,I love to move up in a place but walmart didn't recommend that u stay in position u got hired in and I been there too long to not move up and u had to park so far away from the job
bad,"Great place to work, great associates, sometimes the work can get overwhelming between dealing with the workload and customers but overall its a grest place to work."
bad,I could not wait to leave. Negative work environment. They do not care about you. Very low annual raise. My Share bonuses were almost nothing. Everyone seemed unhappy including management.
bad,Work ethics are backwards. No communication with management. Hardly any training. Plays favoritism. They don't post all job openings and fill by playing favoritism. Pretty much told me it was my fault that I showed up at work on one my days I normally work just to find out they changed my schedule without notice. I had the same schedule for six months.
bad,"I would get less hours & I’ll get paid less too.  It was a good job, but it didn’t really get me anywhere at all. Im looking for a good job at this moment."
bad,"Started out fairly new to the workplace, never stocked an area before. Manager on duty wanted me to cover three departments all by myself and keep up with someone who had been there for 15 years."
bad,they have good benefits and good working hours but is very stressful and competitive but don't work in customer service cause that's worse do cashier it's better for you to move up in company
bad,"Typical day at work is pretty much go in stock shelves and etc."
bad,"I worked at Walmart in high school because it was one of the only stores in my hometown that would hire students. I didn't like it, and the environment was very unprofessional. I haven't been to a Walmart in two years."
bad,Management at Walmart is poor. They do not care to much for the customers or their employees. They are willing to bend the rules of Walmart regulations to finish a project.
bad,Management is to be desired at the location work you like a dog and still want more out of you pay is not worth the headache of the management is not on the same page with anything. I do not recommend working for this company
bad,Poor management and they will lie to you at the drop of a hat. And say they didn't say that. And the safety follows you around alot and can pull you over for speeding and write you up and put you on a step. They will tell you anything that you want to hear about how great walmart is. When sam Walton died walmarr died with him. It's like working for a corporation all you are is a number. When you call in it doesn't matter that they know you they will ask you for your driver number everytime. It takes 3 dollars a mile to operate and have a walmart driver pulling a load. If management can save the company money and make there bonuses fatter they will put that load on a train and save the company money. Or get a outside carrier to pull the load. Awhile you sit around waiting for a load you don't get paid. Only if your on the dock waiting to get unloaded.
bad,"Walmart just sucks in general but honestly working there wasn't bad in terms of scheduling, getting ur desired hours/time off and breaks. actually a really good place to work besides the incredibly rude customers."
bad,"The only reason I'd suggest working here would be if you have no other options. The company cares absolutely nothing for its employees, and shows absolutely no support for them. I personally saw a manager tell a woman she had to choose between Wal-Mart and her sick child."
bad,"There isn't anything good to say about this place except for the wonderful people I work with that make my day better, and the great benefits Wal-Mart provides. I have worked with this company since 2006, and boy has it changed. I don't care to stick around to see what happens next."
bad,The job was pretty easy but the management team was rude and unyielding. They expect you to work harder and harder without giving positive reinforcement at all.
bad,"Walmart is great for starters in the work field, but long term i do not see it as an asset to my productivity. i do not want to work there ever again."
bad,Never liked it after the managers were treating us differently. The managers are rude and disrespectful wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. I can’t take it .
bad,"Do what Aldi does and make people pay for the carts with a quarter? "
bad,"I would walk in and restock and help the cashier for the cashier and I would have to provide breaks for the cashier on the floor whenever needed. I would the excess items and do any and all price changes. "
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work at Walmart they have poor management skills those store managers are even horrible they're not a good lead they don't Advance anyone to do anything different but the same people that have that picks and chooses they don't follow a policy guidelines what they got in the Posse they don't follow that rule at all. So is no need for Walmart to even have a policy because they don't follow the policy at all and Walmart they got a thing where they get in groups and they all lie on you they do conspiracy at Walmart they just do all types of illegal stuff that they don't supposed to do and they don't follow the HIPAA Law at all. And they the even the Personnel manager stay or horrible they do so many other color dirty so they let people day favored people work that still ours just do all types of stuff so I wouldn't recommend that job for anyone I wasted 5 and 1/2 on Walmart when I could have been doing something better at another job only thing that was a good benefits in me wasn't Insurance other than that they are horrible very horrible.
bad,Walmart does not care about its employees or their families. I was fired due to the fact that i had to have surgery for a gall bladder removal and since Idaho is a right to work state they could fire me legally for any reason they wanted.
bad,"Explotación"
bad,"employees were nice. When you get hired they tell you that your shift will be all over the place then if you get done like i did, youll get nothing but closing shifts. Employees who managers favor seem to get away with way too much."
bad,they dont want anyone to better themselves unless its with them. No working around school schedule. When you try and give them information they wont do it unless its a benefit for them.
bad,The managers treat you horribly and they dont inform you at all about benefits and such to help with medical emergencies and such to make sure you get paid for those days and what not. Some associates are rude and I rate walmart a 0 out of 10
bad,consentrar Enel trabajo todo el tiempo trajar vien
bad,Started working there during the honeymoon period after the founders passing while people were still positive.  By the time I left I was shouted down by customers just trying to get in the door each day.
bad,The job was decent until my sickle cell happened to take course and missing many days was something they weren’t okay with. I brought in doctors notes but apparently someone threw them away causing headache.
bad,"work environment very stressful,management does not follow through with promises.Management show no support for team associates.Employees are treated like numbers not people."
bad,"i went in got a radio did push ins, first i collected carts out in the parking lot, i learned to work effintently , i learned to be aware of my surroundings management was good"
bad,"Expect to deal with rude customers, managers who do not care, and co-workers who do not shower. The days are long, Nothing is ever done on time, and there is a lot of employee drama."
bad,"Walmart has progressively gotten worse over the years. They laid off whole  departments with 2 weeks notice. They laid off the safest truck drivers on the road, to hire temps. This was so they could cut costs. If an associate gets injured, they are usually fired within weeks of the injury. They treat you like you are replaceable. But besides all this I loved my job and my coworkers."
bad,Walmart is a job for teenagers  .It does not fit the lifestyle of an adult with bills.The managers were rude and inconsiderate to real life problems .
bad,"When I was hired with Walmart, I was told they would be willing to work with me and my child care schedule. Only to find out that they threatened to fire me for not being able to work my schedule due to lack of child care. I had given notice that I was unable to find child care before my shift started to allow them time to find a replacement. They were unable to work with that, resulting in me giving my notice and leaving employment."
bad,C est un bon magasin surtout pour les mères monoparentales
bad,I had to work Fulltime hours for like 3 weeks and then the 4th week got barely any hours with Minimum Wage and wouldn't work with previous works work schedule
bad,i would not recommend working for the alexandria ky walmart at all. they are biased and some managers are even racist. The pay is not worth it at all.
bad,managers have favorites. coworkers will watch you mess up than help you fix a problem. i loved it at first but over time i got to see how the coworkers an managers really are they dont care about if you need to switch with anyone or didnt care you switch your days to your days off. i needed my days off to be moved for my wedding an they told me to move my wedding date to my days off
bad,Its good job I just feel like they dont pay enough they need to rasie the pay because cost of living it's getting crazy and they should provide transport
bad,"I liked my job at first, I was able to get good hours and still be home at a decent hour to be with my child however once you make a mistake whether you even know you made the mistake or not you're pretty much done there, I will never recommend anyone ever apply there, I unknowingly made a mistake and it cost me my job and maybe even my reputation."
bad,"Working in this particular position increased my ability to multitask, handle difficult situation/customers, improve my productivity rates as well as increase customer satisfaction by routine"
bad,Productive and fun. Easy to advance. Well managed and nice treatment. Employees are taken care of and treated fairly. Hours and pay are fair and reasonable
bad,"You would come in and immediately have to clean up returns, then you would go to your designated area for the day. "
bad,The promise of Respect for the Individual and No Retaliation are not true.  If upper management has an agenda no matter how righteous your claim it will be ignored and your manager will prevail.
bad,Working here was basically to easy. No response in moving up. Managment was always in a hury to put blame on the first person they saw. Each dapartment was against eachother for some odd reasons.
bad,"I just like to talk to people so it was a good place to start. I enjoy conversation, I like to meet new people, I enjoyed getting to know customers who come in a lot, and making people smile"
bad,"Showing great customer service also while providing great stocking skills. Working with a team is fun, working together to finish a certain goal is amazing"
bad,"Fast pace, offers little to no benefits, they try and keep most workers part time, do not want unions involved, if you get injured...good luck. I wouldnt recommend,but do what you have to do to get by."
bad,Walmart no longer cares about their employees. It is no longer as family oriented as I saw when I was growing up watching other family members work for Walmart.
bad,They don’t care about you you are another body on the floor that’s it. They won’t help you or accommodate anything the way they see it is they can treat you as bad as they want because you are replaceable
bad,"It's an awful job unless you are desperate for one. It kept me paid, but the managment is awful, the company as a whole cares more about it's customers than it's workers by a long shot, and they overwork even their part time workers."
bad,Walmart was cool something to pass time and see what’s it’s like to transition from the military to the regular civilian world. Won’t work there again but an ok job
bad,"The management department is filled with snobby people who look down upon anyone who is not taking home a salary."
bad,I didn't care too much for the company but the people I worked with made it somewhat tolerable. Customers were something else. Co-workers were  a hit or miss.
bad,This company really doesn't care about their associates they treat them as if everyone is a thief. They want more work and give less time of breaks. They really don't have a correct way of investigate any concerns or accusations.
bad,Walmart is an easy job takes no brains to work there but the management sucks. They have to many people that want to be in the bosses position that it makes working there suck.
bad,Turnover rate was 97%. Treated associates poorly and took 5 minutes off each break just to increase their numbers more because amazon was destroying them.
bad,"this place is bad all around bad no pay no future this place just all around sucks as a place to work. i cant recommend it to any one friend or family,"
bad,"stocking shelves is very important when it comes to rotation so you don't end up with so much expired product.  And my work time there showed many who really don't care what or how they get the product on the shelf, probably because of low pay and work people like slaves"
bad,"Hey man, 11 an hour is cool and all but this job made me more suicidal because management sucked. However, other team members are cool made friends with some of them."
bad,"I walked behind a buffer cleaning floors."
bad,I like to work for companies that are for their customers and for their employees. Some systems are not set for the employees to actually have the tools to do their jobs.
bad,Did not provide livable wages on hours received and the management was terrible and did not care about the associates or how they feel or what they needed at all.
bad,A typical day would start at six. We would circle up and stretch. Then we would work for the next 10 to 12 hours straight. The faster you are the better chance you had at keeping your job. Unrealistic daily goals
bad,"Management sucked. The company cares nothing about its employees hence “Save More, Live Better” that’s not for the customers or employees that’s for owners all the way down to the top manager. Don’t be fooled"
bad,OK Company. Fun work day at this Company. Interesting Management style. Pay is great when you advance with the company. Nothing negative to say. Thanks
bad,"Just don’t apply they don’t care about you plain and simple  trucks are unsafe "
bad,"Overall I really think it depends on the walmart you work at. I had amazing assistants, but a store manager that runs everyone to the ground and show very little appreciation. I've been with the company 9 years this month, but I'm looking into another job because of the recent changes of management leaving and everyone leaving."
bad,I would get into trouble for things that i wouldn't do. Management didn't care about there employees at all only about if theu were going to get there bonuses.
bad,"That is majorly it, besides the management being really dull. If the upper chiefs do not like you, you will not rise up anymore than Part Time. Also the hours are lame."
bad,Very loud and no help anywhere. You’re trained on a computer so you’re on your own on the floor. Help comes 30 minutes after you’ve asked. You get no hours and they pay is not good enough for how busy it is.
bad,Never again will i ever work for wal-mart. The management has no concern or care for their employees . You have to learn to work the whole store without any raises.More work for less pay.
bad,"The manager and dept. manager I worked for were great people, but working at walmart was not good, low pay, no overtime, some managers were verbally abusive."
bad,"Bad management..over worked ,low pay for the work thats done , work never completed, mandatory overtime,3 points and your  gone,computer training only"
bad,I met a lot of wonderful people when working for walamaet. It was just some of the management there who were rude. They didn't care if you got sick they made you come in.
bad,Boring and confusing poor training not enough information or training but the job ain’t bad is just how the show people and teach people it’s wack not great
bad,"I had a certain amount of time to get a department stocked, even the really heavy departments.We were constantly understaffed. The company thought we were over staffed. Too much work, and not enough pay for what they put us through."
bad,It's a job that allows you to move throughout the company to search for whatever suits you. Given an amount of time you are free to change or switch your position and if it's available you can try something else.
bad,I was 6 months pregnant when I started working there. NEVER got to the bathroom fast enough and passed out more than once from the heat of the building in the middle of the summer
bad,Nasty customers short breaks plus you are  on your feet all day.nasty management the pay wasn’t good. Long lines because most lanes are closed . Employees stealing
bad,To many managers in charge of one department. No one manager wants to be responsible for making a decision on problem. Very unorganized. The drama among co-workers is never ending.
bad,"I learned how to Transport freight items to the sales floor. Stock shelves and make sure all items are brought forward. Maintain items on shelves, making sure they are not opened, damaged, or expired. Help maintenance clean up the aisles and help prepare the store for the next day. Gather all pallet jacks and shopping carts at the end of the night and place them in"
bad,Not enough management to short of time to restock the shelves not enough helpToo little pay Walmart is a very fast-paced I was on on third shift did not really care for the third shift not enough help to unload truck 53 foot trailer haul floor load it
bad,The store that i worked in offered no room to grow your career despite the fact that i worked in almost every department i was unable to be transferred to another department even though the one i was working was over staffed and they let me go for no reason
bad,Walmart will honestly just take you around the bend every chance they get and more often then not refuse to work with you in most if not every single case.
bad,I enjoy working for Walmart it's just that I have two kids and they do not give me many hours and my checks are tragic I'm looking forward into something better!
bad,"I hate this place, if you’re a cashier. If you are a minute early or a minute late you get written up. Oh and if your late clocking out you’ll get written up As well."
bad,"I appreciate Wal-Mart hiring me while attended Iowa Wesleyan, but the managers provide no one with respect and they cut hours whenever they deem it is necessary in their mind. Would not recommend working there."
bad,My experience there I learn how to unload a truck I learn how to be a meat Associate. Walmart you learn how to work in different departments when he short on staff
bad,"I was paid minimal amount of money for a large amount of work, no way worth it to anyone trying to live with bills. There was no room for error for the hires and no enthusiastic atmosphere to work in."
bad,Managers do not care about associates and treat them badly. Constantly cutting hours and finding cheaper routes. Doing away with sooo many positions my job doesn’t feel secure
bad,I wouldn’t say that Walmart was the worst job for me. It paid me very well but the management was not good at all and the job itself can get very boring
bad,"terrible job. stressful and unenjoyable. supervisors didn't know how to do their job. Paid well, but dealing with unpleasant customers and being forced to work holidays was horrible"
bad,el trabajo en vention medical me gusto porque aprendi cosas nuevas sobre productos médicos y que tan importante es esa industria . En Walmart me gustaba por el servicio al cliente en las dos empresas tenia muchas garantías y me gustaba trabajar para ellas
bad,"Not a nice place to work."
bad,conducted a series of checks on vehicles upon them entering the maintenance bay. a majority of the time i was on the lub team where i would conduct oil changes on customers POVs. after getting accustomed to the job i then swapped over to the tire machine where i would conduct the basics. mount balance and rotations
bad,"I learned to change oil, tired, fuel injections. Anything to do with basic maintenance on a vehicle. The hardest part of my job is management. They not willing to work with you on anything but expect you to come in to fill in for people who have called out."
bad,"The management at Walmart was horrible, any position which opened up that would be an advancement was given to underqualified people. Hours constantly changing from 20 hours one week to 32 the next."
bad,Good management 
bad,"Working at Walmart as a cashier, I hardly had the opportunity to interact personally with my coworkers, and if I was caught chatting with the cashier next to my register, I would be scolded by a CSM. Everybody seemed pretty miserable. Chatting with customers was my only reprieve, and I had a can of Pringles thrown at me once for not accepting an SNAP (food assistance program) card that was broken in half and taped back together."
bad,"It was summer and the air conditioner was out for the entire month that I worked there. The only positive to working there was the limited interactions you had with anyone besides yourself. The pay was standard, according to my google search."
bad,"This place is crappie to work at! They are rude and dont listen if u have a problem with someone , they ignore it and dont do anything about it, and they pay isnt enough"
bad,"I got in trouble for logging off my register and finding a manager due to my sugar being low and almost passing out after requesting a manager to my register multiple times, while pregnant i was asked to lift very heavy items and when asking for help from a CSM it was refused causing me to go into labor a month early"
bad,"The company itself is okay but the people you work for are nuts. The CSRs normally are never around when you need them, and before I was one they got attitudes when you needed them even if it was for a customer."
bad,It just really sucks that they would not work with me on my hours after I had just come back from maternity leave they would not help me with my hours even with a little baby just home.
bad,walmart.  underpaid overworker and cameras monitoring the size of your potential bowel movements. prepare to have plenty of anti union threats and intimidation.
bad,"All about who you know in that company. Poison."
bad,There is to much required from one person without help. Managers often rude and workers are not treated well. The three top managers are demanding and expect one person do to the work of 10.
bad,There were a million things they dropped the ball on. The reason I quit is because I was stuck on the register and they refused to let me move to a department. I was there 5 years so I left to try getting better opportunities in another job.
bad,I had to go on a leave of absence after 25 years because my husband become very sick and when I wrote the letter for a leave of absence they told me that because I didn't know how long I would be gone for that I couldn't be granted the leave of absence and I didn't want to continue to work for a company that treated their senior employees like that. I spent many years with them and in my time of need they turned me away. My husband ended up passing away.
bad,An absolutely horrible place to work for. The management is cutthroat and against the employees unless it furthers them somehow. Back breaking labor and not enough pay.
bad,Working in the photo lab was the most painful experience ever. The customers were absolutely delightful to help/serve. but unfortunately the staff was what forced me to leave.
bad,"Worst Job i ever had. They treat their employees, like garbage. Don't matter how hard you worked, you was getting fired unless you told on someone else to get them fired."
bad,"Management was very disorganized, never got me change for the employees when I needed it . "
bad,the way the shifts were set up was crazy may work 4 hours one day then 9 the next money wasn't great didn't mesh well with managers due to the fact they would disappear and never give direction
bad,"walmart is a good place to work i would reccomend it to ne 1"
bad,Horrible management that treats you like actual garbage. The hours were good but they were at random times of the day so you never had a consistent schedule.
bad,"Walmart has dug me into a hole, i have watched it fall apart since I got there. I’ve never been so disappointed in my like the managers don’t even work with you or even care about you"
bad,"Would not recommend. They will write you up for stupid THINGS. Took too much time training me, didn't learn everything i was supposed to learn. Although did like some of the management"
bad,I had some good days I had some bad days all in all I liked working for Walmart. Their are a few good people who I enjoyed working with and their where people I had to get along with due to the fact of us working together.
bad,A typical day at work is fast paced and stressful. You learn about customer courtesy and problem resolution. Management is available for difficult situations. The hardest part of the job is completing tasks effective with minimum staffing.
bad,I didnt really like working here it was just a starting out job. I didnt get enough hours and wasnt paid enough to live. It is a good a job to start out with if in high school.
bad,Muito anos  nessa empresa e muito anos de trabalho que valeu  a perna trabalha na empresa que dar valor às funcionárias
bad,"Good teamwork, descent management, got 2 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. Sometimes you would work in your normal department other times you would be asked to help other departments if they were short handed."
bad,"They say that Walmart is family oriented and fair to its employees. Don't you bekieve it! if ou have to take your child to the hospital they will count it against you . Id you end up leaving work in an ambukance they count it against you. Favoritism is widespread, if you aren't a favorite you are out of look. people whio have minimum abscences get fired and those that have many get a free pass."
bad,"Poor wages and expected to do more than what is required. Management is terrible, which makes for a poor work environment. Not a fun place to work, would not recommend."
bad,Didn't not like working there they want you to kill ur self for little money in then they talk about they a team but the people don't have no team work skills
bad,"I am not sure if it was just the location i worked at or the whole Company. I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone to work for Walmart. I had so many problems as a department manager trying to get the overnight team to cooperate with me. The Pharmacists had to call meetings with the store managers to try and get them to get everyone on the same page but there would never be any follow up. I got fed up and requested to work behind the counter as a Pharmacy Tech, but that turned out to be an even worse situation. I was never allowed time to train so i was clueless everyday trying to help patients get their prescriptions which can be very frustrating for patients that are in pain or just don't have time."
bad,"to be honest, I was 19 years old and in college during my stint at walmart. I never really liked it and was more than happy to move on when I did. I would never go back."
bad,"walmart will hire you as a part time employee, and never put yu on as full time even though you work 33-40 hours every single week specifically so that they dont have to give you benefits."
bad,I like to help customers. Making sure there was always enough coverage. Adjusting hours to have cashiers at peak times. Some of  the people I worked made my job a lot easier.
bad,"I started out with high hopes working at Walmart. I came back as an overnight stocker. I was quickly promoted as an overnight Customer Service manager. During this time they used me as an acting overnight Support Manager due to store hours changing from 24 hours to closing at midnight.  Once the store started closing at midnight i was told that because I was not in my position as long as the other over night Customer Service manager that I would either have to take a severance package, go back to stocking which would cause me to lose $2.00 in hourly pay or I could pick a different position in the store.  I chose to work over night due to family obligations so that was not an option. I was then offered officially the Overnight Support Manager position and gracefully accepted.  I was in the role for over a year when I found out again i would be losing that position because we had too many Supports overnight. I was told I could accept the overnight maintenance supervisor position so I could keep the same pay.  I was then informed that I would not be keeping my pay and lost $2.75 in pay. The company has no communication and they like to make up rules and not pay you what you deserve."
bad,"worst managemnt i have ever seen. work division is all unfair, some employees are not doing anything at all. good for a quick summer job but dont make a carrer here"
bad,Really pushed the walmart mastercards. lots of yelling at cashiers if they did not get enough people applying for mastercards. cashiers yelled at by managers and management did nothing.
bad,I will not miss this job. None of the managers I worked with did their job correctly. I feel like the shop I worked with did not run properly or legally.
bad,Too many upper managers don't know what the others are doing.They expect you to do 20 hours of work in 8 too much favoritism. Everyone is not treated fairly
bad,There was no support at this company. Management was highly incompetent as well as employees. Customers were mean spirited and unclued in to the various peripherals of the portions.
bad,"The typical day was always different, many different scenarios, and customer service issues. They managers were all over the place or not to be found, made starting work hard and not on time when searching for such manager."
bad,"Always worried every day if "
bad,I loved working here in the beginning but then management changed and benefits changed and they wanted a lot from you if it was 15 hours of work they expected you to finish I would not recommend this job to noone
bad,A typical day at work would be arriving on time for myself doing my chores as needed taking care of the customers as ordered and clocking out on time taking the appropriate brakes
bad,It was a Great experience you learn how to deal with ups and Downs with customer. Cleaning Place very organized. Fair with break and lunches i would Work th ere again.
bad,I would not recommend working here if you are in school. They do not really work with your schedule. You also get blamed for everything even if you are not on the clock.
bad,"Do not apply for a job here. Poor Management, disrespectful, and they do not acknowledge anything you do. You cannot live on the salary they give for a Sales Associate or Assistant Manager."
bad,"No matter what the management would chastise us if the truck is not unloaded on time, EVEN if some unforeseeable incident happened that was beyond our control.  Definitly not on my first choice list to work for."
bad,"I was forgotten about & picked on."
bad,"Awful management they Do not care about their employees at all And half are racist! If you can deal with racism , a lot of criticism, and a bunch of bs go ahead and work there."
bad,Would not recommend working for Walmart.  Bentonville is not a city for worldly traveled individuals.  Walmart is not an open culture and does not accept people with differing backgrounds.
bad,I've been here for 4 years and because of the minimum wage if you started at Walmart today I would be making $0.20 more than you you no longer and have a manager give you a raise everyone gets the same raise on the same day at the same time it does not matter even if you show up for work All We Are are ants and Walmart has a magnifying glass and a sunny day
bad,"Do not work for Walmart, they do not care about their employees any way, shape or form. They do not pay very well and will not let you get any overtime, even if the job needs you to."
bad,"Loved working here, great place to work. Staff is amazing as well! The schedule is made to your special needs as a person with a busy life outside of work."
bad,"this job was a long time ago but I was yelled at for not taking breaks  but never had anyone to cover me for a break. covered three or more departments at a time, and was snapped on infant of customers by management for asking for help for them. mind you things may have changed since than."
bad,"I hated everything about this place. the mangers and company. Well i like my co workers but just about everything else sucked.underpaid, most mangers were rude and mean"
bad,Realmente fue una perdida de tiempo el haber trabajado 7 años en esta empresa.
bad,The people that work there are very very nice very respectful and that's the most you miss. They expect you to work 12 to 14 hours come in on your days off and really no family time or personal time.
bad,"Walmart was absolutely trash to work in. Atleast at the time I was working there, I heard it’s gotten a lot better since they increased the pay. But I wouldn’t recommend it"
bad,implemented new policies that made it almost impossible to perform my job adequately and not enough employees to complete all duties.  Upper management not available to address concerns  personal time off was denied most of the time and got points for call outs even with a doctors note
bad,I was scheduled to work the shift of 10pm till 7am. I was often alone on the front end to cover self check out and run down 10 register to sale tobacco products. I stopped two different shop lifters and never heard anything about it in the future good or bad. I learned Management is to walk around checking on all the employees.
bad,"Enjoyed my time at Walmart. It was a friendly environment, with a great atmosphere. It was a steady paced job, with flexible hours. Would recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,No structure from manager of the store  he never there but always complaining about things going wrong really needs to work with his people in steed of knocking us down
bad,I loved working in the department that I was at. The managers make it very hard to work at Walmart. I loved the interaction with the customers and loved giving them the customer service that they desired.
bad,Wal mart considère ses employés comme des numéros et ses gérants nous le font bien sentir
bad,"Unfair workplace and not very good to work with. I had learned about a retail workplace but they weren't very set up. They were understaffed, Expecting  workers to complete outlandish tasks in a time frame that we weren't able to fulfill."
bad,"The management to work for were horrendous. No communication , bad attitudes, no manners with guest or employees. i would never work here again even if i needed a job."
bad,"From the store manager to the assistant managers, the store was run by a ""clique"" and if they didn't like you (for whatever reason) they'd find a way to make you miserable and fire you."
bad,"This place is no longer open, it closed down due to lack of business maybe, probably because of location."
bad,"Working overnight, you will be left alone on a register and the whole line of customers will be staring at you and cursing. The managers do not care and that is obvious."
bad,"they worked with my schedule, it was a god place to work, pay wasn't great but it worked for me until I found a fulltime job.  The Algood store was poorly managed."
bad,Worked at for Walmart for more than 10 years. Learned everything that the company could offer other than salaried management. Never given an opportunity to do more. Always seemed to be taken for granted.
bad,"Not sure about the rest of the locations but on one I worked for, my manager never acknowledged the employees.  would never work there again unless I can't find anything else."
bad,my experience at walmart was horrible. I worked there for two years worked all my time worked overtime when asked and helped out when needed. try to advance several times. made a complaint aganst a manger nothing was done. it was awful work experience and would not recommend them.
bad,"For someone with a disability, I was not respected although they made it sound like I was. I went through a lot for the almost 3 years I worked there. Never again."
bad,"This company sucks, never work for them, they don't care about thier employees, the pay sucks, the environment sucks, they believe the customer is always right."
bad,"Walmart says its a family based company but in reality at least at the store i worked it was all about who can i run over to get myself better, as a parent with small children if emergencies came up with them or a death in the family management treated it as if you were stealing from their pocket if you had to take the day off. My son had to have emergency surgery and i was out for several days i get demoted from my position even knowing the situation."
bad,"This was a cool job but the pay isn't great I would only recommend this job to people that are really in need ,but it is a place you can grow and advance ."
bad,"easy enough to make money at if you don't mind living at work. management works under constant threat of termination or demotion, and everyone is made aware they are replacable"
bad,"Very Stressful and unorganized place of work this is a place for someone who has no busy life, children husband or wife etc. Pay is awsome, no vacation but pto hours can be used for it. Only thing im in love with here is the money and the benefits."
bad,They refuse to hire anymore people to make the job much easier on people. They hire as little as possible to do a job that may take 5 people they will hire 3 maybe.
bad,It was a great place to work learned several different jobs but if not willing to relocate there is no room for advancement. The people I worked with were great I even made long time friends while there
bad,"• Exceptional understanding of counting, inspecting, and checking in merchandise"
bad,"Spent most days having to work as two to three people and then do the work four more throughout shift. Always short-staffed on a good night and expected to achieve more with little incentive other than it being one's job."
bad,"The work place was very stressful. Management had targeted specific employees for no apparent reason, as well as not treating anyone there fairly. The employees weren't the best there either."
bad,"I would stock shelf's help customers "
bad,"Planned commercial displays. Built commercial displays. Changed displays according to changes in inventory. "
bad,"It was a good place to work, but couldn't grow or step further up, but learning different departments were good and interesting & satisfying the customers"
bad,"Management is hard to work with, they won't listen to what the employee has to say, they reprimand on what they think and do not let you tell your side of the story.  They do not treat their employees fairly.  They discriminate against health issues with their employees."
bad,The Walmart I worked for was poorly managed and treatment of employees was poor at best. I would not recommend this particular Walmart to anyone. The company itself is really starting to treat employees poorly and take away all perks and benefits.
bad,They dont pay anything that you can live on and its stressful. You're asked to do everything with little to no help. I wouldn't recommend working here unless its a starting point to get a job working someehere else
bad,Management is not on task the store is very unorganized the scheduling is all over the place they dont allow overtime or give holiday pay there is no leadership
bad,"Very stressful and so structured, it's hard for teams to work together.  Pay was fairly good, as well as benefits.  I liked having the ability to use the Walmart fitness center."
bad,"good money, hard work, freezer at minus 20 degrees would make icicles hang from beard, other areas too hot being in the south makes air conditioning non existant"
bad,Have no idea what it's like to work at Wal Mart now. I don't even want to shop there so I can imagine how bad it is to work there. Aim higher-like Arby's.
bad,Doesn’t treat you well not understanding and just everyone thinks they are better it’s like high school.  The managers are too hard on people.  They give leeway for emergencies m.
bad,I would never go back to walmart if it was the last place on this earth offering me a job. This company is a cut throat company and will do anything and find anything to fire you if you are not liked or do what they want you to do. My experience there was very short lived as I was accused of something I didn't do because management seen me making progress but other employees who were there before have been trying for years to advance. Other employees did what they do to get rid of myself and they managed to do so.
bad,"During my time working for Walmart (and my husband's), I was treated as number and that was it. If I needed time off, as rare as it was, they often denied it or told me I had to call out and holidays, forget it. Thanksgiving, employees are often given shifts that tear them away from their families, such as 3pm-12am and are often threatened with losing their jobs if they don't. While the pay is nice, I would definitely not recommend this job to anyone who is largely family oriented."
bad,"•	Managed a team of six employees daily to execute on project deliverables "
bad,good place to work if you don't have to deal with customers. worked in the receiving dept so it was ok. great people working with me so overall good. not great pay though.
bad,I would still be at Walmart if they would of gave me any kind of a certain schedule. I have a family and with that schedule we couldn't hardly plan anything.
bad,Garbage place to work. Under paid and constantly under staffed. Expected to do the job of 3 people and in different places of the department store. Horrible work environment  and experience.
bad,i learned that customer is always right even when we know they are wrong and managers too they  are always  right and they never let you talk or defend yourself i am only working at Walmart because i need to provide food to my family but i know for sure that i would not recommend this for anybody because Walmart doesn't respect their employees they make you watch all this training videos trying to lie at you always saying that they care about you but they don't
bad,"Mauvaise experience de travail, trés grande pression."
bad,"This Walmart on New Salem Highway, Murfreesboro, TN was the worst place that I have ever worked.  The Walmart store manager and Fuel Station manger both drank alcohol on a daily basis while at work.  They worked me hours that I stated I could not work."
bad,"buen ambiente de trabajo y comodas intalaciones se debe trabajar  con actitud responsabilidad y llegar a cumplir metas solicitadas por la empresa."
bad,"A typical day at work was busy and stressful. We were always understaffed at the worst time. Management would want 2 people to stock the entire meat department, fresh fish and frozen seafood during the first day of the month."
bad,"Walmart has great benefits they also pay great with as many hrs as you want and depending on if they need workers for certain days they are willing to pay overtime, but the employees and other associates there are RUDE not all but enough i have a speech problem (studder) that was judged on a regular and this is an every day struggle for me and it just turned off my want to work with the others there i did not appreciate the judgment so i decided to leave like i said store great but the people who work within not so great."
bad,"I enjoyed working there, a typical day was dealing  with people some positive, moody, negative and unapproachable. The management could improve. The enjoyable part of the job is you can get cover for a coworkers shift if they need you."
bad,"Walmart is a terrible place to work. Management doesn't care about you and will work you like a dog with a skeleton crew. I would not recommend working there unless you have to choose between fast food and walmart. Id choose walmart, but it would be a close decision."
bad,wouldn't want to work there again you just have to be very humble and have a lot of patience from dealing with rude customers to rude employees and managers
bad,Walmart is a terrible place to work.  The company as a whole is very dishonest.  Too many people in unqualified people in management.  Poor customer service.
bad,walmart is not at all a fun place to work the department I worked was hard and stressful. I unloaded trucks in the back room and it was always hot back there.
bad,Was in training but was made to run the register alone with money drawer full to the point you couldnt get any other bills in the slots. never knew who to call for help. was told so many different things to do but nothing ever the same.
bad,All in all not that bad if place to work . Opportunity for advancement is for sure . If they put the right people in place this would be a good place to work .
bad,"A company made in United States, with store items made from China. It is cheap and the quality of the items is bad. I mean really, really bad. From clothing to kitchen utensils."
bad,"Everything was a struggle with management. They didn't work well with the employees. From asking for a day off to trying to advance. It took me 9 months of asking before they made me a technician. I enjoyed it and was good at it, but other opportunities arose."
bad,horrible place to work. they treat the employees as expendables. the supervisors do not listen to your concerns and they cut hours significantly even if you are full time
bad,"the entire time I was working the the only thing the manager cared about was numbers. he even tried to say I had to use vacation days when called up for military service, until the lawyers stepped in"
bad,Working for Walmart is not something I would recommend to anyone that has other options.  The pay was just not enough in my opinion. I just felt like management could have been a lot better.
bad,Poor management communication lead to us being yelled at by being told to do something completely different many time throughout our scheduled work days.
bad,"This company craps on employees, managers treat you like dirt. They don't care about employees. They won't back employees, but will throw them under the bus every chance they get."
bad,"The managers will work you until you bleed but won't appreciate a thing that you do. It's the most draining job not only physically but mentally. The people who shop at Walmart are the worst, I quit in 2016 and I've never looked back."
bad,wal mart was a  stepping stone for me in life It was a good place for me to work  a lot of the staff   that I was hired  with is  still employed with the companny
bad,I think everyone can make an assumption about what it might be like to work here and you assumptions are correct.  Not fun.  The only interaction you have with your boss is if you get into some kind of trouble.
bad,"It was the worst experience, managers and supervisors were not giving the appropriate training and was put to work in the flood the very first day i started working."
bad,"It's cool for a first job, especially if you're trying to get experience. Just don't be that person trying to make a career at Walmart. Not only is that lame, but you're hindering yourself of other opportunities."
bad,Pay was good. Management sucks. The job was fast paced. You get a set schedule for the most part. Lack of communication between management. Other workers are lazy and get away with it.
bad,É uma escola que nós ensina a lutar para encarar o dia dia
bad,Management is not great they need to work together more. They also need to treat their employees with more respect and treat them equally. They need to replace some of their supervisors.
bad,I didn't like the job because the manager was rude and talk to people like they were trash. But for the people in other departments they have a chance in moving up in the company it's not a bad job I just had a bad experience.
bad,I wouldn't advise anyone to work here. They hire everyone part time and promise full time within a year. You never get a full time position unless you move into management which is impossible because all management positions are filled. The hours are inconsistent and it is impossible to live and pay bills as well as take care of a family with the pay.
bad,I nor really happy with this job because there is not friendly to me so I decide quit this job. I know there is good program to me. I feel not comfortable.
bad,"Only hire part time at ten bucks an hour, they don't care about you or your family they need coverage management seems nice and try to make work life better but everyone is just a number."
bad,"The turn over rate is very high. It is easy to get fired."
bad,"Job was ok nothing to do,really boring stood in front all day just waiting for things to happen good pay though i guess because we were in danger we had gotten attacked a few times"
bad,It's pretty nice there besides just need to give people more money and over time. Everyone works together as a team. The managers are fantastic. You will have a good vibe coming in to work being around different types of people.
bad,"Walmart is not a good place to work. My position was lost because I had to have 2 major surgeries and I was told not to worry about my job but when released from doctor, I no longer had a job."
bad,Do not work for Wal-Mart it is a bad company to work for the management is so disrespectful to all the employees. Don't even get me started on trying to move up in that store
bad,"The Office Manager was an embezzler. Management was a disaster.  Employees would leave and come back whenever they felt like it.  Certain people would get ""special"" treatment."
bad,The management was horrible the hours were horrible the days you could work sometimes they wouldn't work you very horrible management in my eyes could have done a lot better
bad,"You are only a cog in the machine, with jobs being asked of you that werent in your description. they do not pay well and the environment is both depressing and catty."
bad,lots of work little pay. work place culture seems to be depressed everyone is always complaining about something or someone. management could careless.
bad,Walmart does not care about its employees. They randomly cut me down form almost 40 hours a week to working ten hours a week just  so they did not have to provide full time benefits.
bad,I have no comments about this corporation. I apologize but I refuse to give my opinion. Ive been taught that if you have nothing nice to say you're better off not saying anything
bad,look you guys can get rid of this right away. I think this is the stupidest waste of time I have ever seen and you make it mandatory idiots............................
bad,Walmart has taken away all holiday pay days so there is longer no need to even come to work to get holiday pay. Even if u have that holiday off they will still schedule you to come in and work it anyways. Their pay rate is also a joke u can work their for 6 months and start making the same amount of money and i have been their for 4 years.
bad,When i worked there i developed high blood pressure no that i donot work there anymore it went away! Treated poorly even if your area was perfect they would still complain nothing was ever good enough for them! Other coworkers would slack off and they expected other to pick up their slack!
bad,Wal-Mart is not for those seeking full time employment and/or a flexible schedule.  It's a good part-time job for college freshmen.  Work environment can be very stressful.
bad,"Other than the same basic bare minimum CBL training everyone gets, I was left to fend for myself. My supervisor was always never available to train me or answer questions, and my manager thought I was lying when I told her what was happening."
bad,"Not fun,hated it,it was stupid,very stupid,wouldn't take my hospital excuse,was bad,very bad,awful,dumb,I hated it so much and the bosses there wasn't fair."
bad,"working in walmart was nothing but stress and anxiety. management sucks. they treat you like garbage, they give you a brake when they feel like it. they are a horrible company to work for  even shopping there is horrible. lines are always long and take forever. they never have anyone working because its a horrible work environment."
bad,Walmart is not a good company to work for.  They don't care about their employees.  All they are for is the money.  They treat you poorly and don't care.
bad,"If you enjoy watching people who are lazy get the pat on the back then Walmart is for you.This company is a stool pond for pathetic ""leaders"".You work your rump off will people sit and joke with the so-called leaders."
bad,Worse place to work due to management. A typical day at work is like walking into a prison. You are treated like a child and yelled at for anything. The hardest part of the job is not being appreciated for the good that you do. They only see the bad I someone.
bad,"not a good job, high turnover rate, no good management, no room for growth, strict attendance policy. terrible pay. no raises. no help. no proper training"
bad,Managers and customers are rude and inconsiderate. managers instead of working with you demanded you work purely for them instead of trying to better yourself and do what you love.
bad,There is a lot of drama and management treats you very poorly. I do not recommend working at this store. My experience was very poor and many others agree with me.
bad,physically draining environment. all the bosses treated the employees like prisoners. definitely not a place I would recommend  any one to work at......
bad,"Horrible place to work for especially with a controlling manager, she made it where i could not move from the first position I was in it was totally lame wasted a year of my life."
bad,its a good place for someone who is not going to be working there for a long time. It will teach you new abilities that you can take to your next job.
bad,En breve contare como es trabajar en Walmart....!!!
bad,"Just no. No to the rude customers, no to the way you get treated as an employee, no to the pay, no to barely getting breaks. All of it was just one big no."
bad,Bosses are rude and the customers look at you like you have failed your life even if you are 18 and work there just to be able to have gas and make your bills
bad,The management Team does not care about your needs and wants they expect you to get tons of work done in less than a couple of hours which was impossible. Not the best company to work for.
bad,"Great job security and benefits"
bad,The place was a mess. No communication happened. They had no idea what they were doing. The stress of never being prepared and long nights mad it hard on me.
bad,"Typical day, getting there to see what on sale. I learn that I really like working there. The management need much work when working with their employees.  You really have to know someone to keep working with them. No having enough hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is shopping there."
bad,"I had two deaths in the family one after the other and was told they wouldn't count as excused absences. You handle food in most of the departments you work but if you're contagious with an illness, they want you there breathing all over the food. This is especially bad when you work in bakery or produce and creates an unsanitary environment."
bad,Walmart is not an environment that is productive for personal growth or development. Management does not care for their employees in anyway that I could determine.
bad,"Improvement throughout entire store. "
bad,"It was essentially a revolving door company, with a terrible retention rate, so the employees, especially those at the bottom were looked at as replaceable."
bad,I would not recommend working for walmart if at all possible. great people can work there but the corporate culture is toxic. only take a job if no other options are there.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for over a year. I had many problems with a certain support manager, I talked to more then one manager and nothing ever happened. I will openly say I quit because of this certain manger. The pay was good but you never got enough hours to make the pay worth it. Very little hours."
bad,"Lined up merchandise to be stocked, stocked shelves, straightened merchandise, cleaned up boxes and work areas.  Helped teammates when you were done with your tasks."
bad,Nothing to say. I dont have anything to say about this company. It provides alot of jobs for the community. It is under a orice though alot of ours worked sometimes being overlooked.
bad,I enjoyed working for wall Mart. All together I've worked for the company almost three years. I just didn't like it towards the end because they made us work the trustees even though we were on the sales floor.
bad,"Pretty  good job to work at but the managment isnt really great."
bad,worst company to work for. management was completely unprofessional. i will never work for the company ever again. Corporate need to clean house and hire better mangers
bad,"Walmart is one of the worst places in North America to work or shop at too. Sam Walton passed away and the place has never been the same. If you want to see the under belly of a society that has gone completely wrong, you can find it at Walmart."
bad,had this job so long ago that any review that I leave for it will be vary bias and probably not accurate. was very young and hated the management and most of my coworkers.
bad,Amazing and love everything about it. Will definitely suggest to any one who ask. Thumbs up all the way. Enjoyed everything about it honestly will recommended.
bad,Fatal el trato hacia los empleados por parte de la gerencia mucho trabajo muy matado y mucha presión. Con poca paga sin horas extra ni agua para los asociados en el nocturno ni pan. Horrible ambiente laboral
bad,The job is ok but the management is horrible to work for and the wait period is to long for a fulltime position. The pay is terrible and no over time is allowed.
bad,Very unorganized very rude didnt know how to talk to the employees was doing alot of standing instead or working didnt have enough work for the workers
bad,"I learned how to use hand held devices to do inventory.  I was trained on how to prevent shrink, as well as assisting customers with purchases.  I loaded between 200-400 bags of mulch, sand, and stone per shift all weighing 50lbs or more."
bad,Used to be a good place to work but definitely changed over the years. Do not agree with how my career there ended. Company did not treat me right in my opinion.
bad,Very disorganized.  punishes everyone for the mistakes of the the few.  bad work-life balance as the schedules kill whatever day you work.  Work is enjoyable management is lacking.
bad,"It's been a long time since I've worked there, I dont remeber much of it, I enjoyed being a cashier.  Wish that management was a little better.Wish the pay was better"
bad,just don't it is not worth your time and sanity. I have talked to so many people about how they did not have stress issues before working at Walmart but acquired them afterwords
bad,Not a pleasant experience. Supervisors were unhelpful and unapproachable. The was no proper training in place. There was no teamwork. Coworkers were unpleasant to each other.
bad,continue to push people out the door because they change policies and treat employees terribly. attenance policy changes raise production when most people are struggling to make production as is. it is extemely hot in the summer
bad,"On m'a refusé un poste pour un dossier judiciaire AUCUNEMENT en relation avec les tâches à accomplir, on me l'a dit clairement. Politique de pourris"
bad,The Walmart located on cascade road has a very small frieght room that has to much cramped in one room. Your manager will give you a task to complete and minutes later another manager will come and give u an entire different task. If you dont finish both you get in trouble.
bad,"Want to feel like you're trying to work a dead-end job while jerks make your life miserable, and not get the pay or appreciation you are worth EVER? Then Walmart is the place to be."
bad,"A typical day at work is busy and fast paced but very fun as well. "
bad,"management is poorly trained, they don't care about their employees and the only thing good about working there is the discount and the breaks.they do not give you 40 hours a week and the pay is low"
bad,"Between the awful co-workers, the horrid management system, and the frustrating work system, I despised working at Walmart and will never work there again. They laid me off because I was too efficient at my work, but kept my co-worker who was caught on cameras messing around in the parking lot with shopping carts while he was on the clock!"
bad,"My experience at Walmart has taught me never to give up. It has also taught me to stand up for what I believe in. I stocked the eggs, butter, juices, milk, basically all things dairy. I also stocked the frozen food aisles and assisted customers who needed help finding their food products. I helped unload and move pallets. I searched for products to be put out from the freezer. I also cleaned the cooler by myself and cleaned milk trays that resided under the milk areas. I cleaned all of the doors in the frozen food aisles and the ones in dairy as well. I did training for my job as well."
bad,No job security threatend to be terminated for mentioning union sad place nothing was hard about the job its just the attitudfes were bad and so was feeling like youd be fired for the stupidest things
bad,Working at walmart was fun. I learned the store really fast and was able to help customers find what they needed. My co-workers and mangers where mean and rude. They allowed bullying and was not organized
bad,"I worked hard, it was straining and stressful. I learned that I love people, not the people I worked with, just the general public. Management didn't give me any opportunities to advance and move forward in the work place. It was horrendous they never helped me grow and succeed even though I kept asking for support. They treated me like I was slow (mentally) and every time I tried to advance my position they bashed me. The hardest part of my job was the physical labor, they held me in one place knowing that I could not do the work I was given, do to my age, yet every time I tried to change my job they refused knowing that I could not simply quit because I needed the money. Even though I could not do the job I did it, I worked hard and kept going even though it was straining me. I was told by management that they were surprised that I was doing my job and doing it well, they believed that I would not be able to succeed in that position. I proved them wrong."
bad,Empresa boa de trabalhar nao tenho o que reclamar.
bad,"It is stressful, but it is fun. Sometimes when you do not have all the tools to do your work many times it is a challenge, otherwise, everything is good."
bad,"I would highly not offer any one to work here. Bad company. Managment was ok, not very friendly. I did not enjoy this job at all. Pay was not very good either."
bad,This company has to be one of the worst jobs in history. This company is a very stressful environment to work in and unless you are 16 in High School living with your parents with no responsibly this is not the job for you.
bad,you sell things talk to people stock things and talk to more people. its a stand all the time moving all the time type of job. as along as you like these things Walmart is for you just don't buy things when you work there cause youll spend too much money and not know
bad,"No work/life balance. Varying hours are all over the place. Management are not trained to be managers."
bad,I didn't really like cleaning i thought it woulbe be easy be but it wasn't people can be really nasty i just counld do it i hate it also some of the coworkers were kinda mean too.
bad,Walmart on new hope church road is the worst Walmart in time. That Walmart has the most drama. Everybody sleeping with everybody. They lie about your pay nothing ever adds up. Messy messy messy
bad,Pessima experiencia na rede walmart por esse motivo me desliguei da empreza
bad,"Rude,  unprofessional and racist. Would never recommend any one to work there. The managers are rude and unprofessional"
bad,Its a hardworking company that has a productive idea to keep things up and also they are fast pace workers you are temporary until 3 mo is up then you become a fulltime associate.
bad,Being a cart pusher is a hard job. Especially during the wrong weather conditions. Wal Mart worked you back into modern day slavery.
bad,You can learn so much at Walmart they stay business at all time u have to give good  customer service  when needed it I never had a  position at Walmart that I could  finish
bad,My experience working for wal-mart was a horrible one. I suffered 2nd and 3rd degree burns to my face after being sprayed in the face by a propane tank that malfunctioned while I was operating a company forklift that required maintenance.
bad,"This was a great company when I started in 1999, but slowly declined over the 14 years that I was employed there. Benefits are good, but not worth it."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is doing not only your job that you are assigned to do,but also doing everybody else's that is Favorited by management."
bad,"Process money, debit, credit transactions. Provide excellent customer service. follow company policies. I learned to be a part of the front end team. Was hard to please the management."
bad,i personally did not like working there. they have ridiculous standards of how fast things should be done when they forget that one person in a section can only do so much.
bad,the managers care nothing about their employees.it should be a team but its not .they have favorites they treat people different which in my opinion is not the way accompany should be ran
bad,"Walmart is an fun place to work, it's a safe environment, the associates are always smiling and nice at times whether they had a good day or bad day. But I will say this that Walmart can do better on good conduct, and for some of these managers need to learn just because your badge manager you don't have any right to be disrespectful to an associate and a customer. Managers and associates must remember this key that respect is a two way street or aa four way street depends on how many people are involved."
bad,"Walmart is the most stressful and depressing company I have ever worked for. The management was awful and ended up getting a mass-firing shortly after I quit working there. The other employees were always sad and never cared about their work leading to poor quality and more useless stress. Their training system is incredibly weak for such a giant company."
bad,working in the deli is alot of fun get to serve customers and make sure the food is fresh and the floor is stocked. and make sure the deli is cleaned every night before you leave
bad,The way that they handle employees terminations is below standard!Working for the company was great until I got in trouble away from the job.I never missed a day of work.
bad,The communication here was very poor. Some associates did not show up regularly. the training process could have been better and while the lunch hour was nice I felt like it was unproductive for me.
bad,"Working with lazy people, if you are a good worker it only means you get to do more work for equal pay, very frustrating after a while. Job advancement is useless here."
bad,This place is more for someone who is looking for a job while in college or at retirement age. I really wouldn't make a lifetime job out of it. It is a competitive place to work.
bad,I was employed at Walmart for two-half years. Those had to be the worst years of my life. Managers would belittle employees and would never help them achieve goals.
bad,I enjoyed working with the associates but the management could learn some tlc they are very unappreciated of there associates and don't know how to treat them
bad,I liked working here but the staff and employees were the problem they did not make EVERYONE follow certain rules and they USED ppl just to stock the store and for.the holiday season. Also they are very unprofessional they only want to look like they care if people are watching. This is not a place I would work again.
bad,"It would be a good place to work at, if management knew how to actually manage, choosing people for management just because they have a 2 year degree and expecting them to succeed is ridiculous."
bad,"This was my first job, and I gain a lot of important skills I would take to an a better job. This job could have been job, but my co-workers and managers make the job harder than it has to be."
bad,"If you scream 'Merica and think if its not white then its not right then this is a great place for you. Typical Walmart standards . There are plenty of other warehouses to choose from, don't let this be your option."
bad,"Very busy, only one lane open when we could have easily opened many more. I  loved stocking shelves, rotating items i.e.. placing the old products to front and new items to back."
bad,Not a good company to work for a lot of favoritism. On top of that pay is terrible for a multi billion dollar company I've been there 5 years I only make 10.50 an hour
bad,"Great place, great people not the place for me to work. I don't have much to say to mske an review, my day at work would be clocking in meeting everyone in an aisle, sticking an organizing that one aisle, cleaning waiting til 3 an go to the back unload the truck an then stick everything , til 11 pm"
bad,The management at walmart are not trained right and allow the power they are given go straight to their heads. It isn't a place I would ever recommend working or even applying to.
bad,"every time I wanted to move up in management, Wal-Mart always looked over me and I worked hard. my manger wanted to keep me in his area but I need more money"
bad,Walmart sucks the life out of just about everyone. People were fun to work with but the management is probably the worst I've ever seen. Other than that very good place to work if your 16
bad,Never a chance to become full time. At the time of employment was only being payed 8.40 for inconsistent hours bad work environment all the team members were considered slime
bad,I love the customer and employee interaction. That is the best thing about this company. The morals of the company are lacking and the corporation does not stand up for their employees.
bad,A typical day at work was busy for night shift. I learned how to take and make deli orders. Hardest part of the job was cleaning so much I never got a break
bad,Walmart is a good place to work at BUT the people there is very very messy they don't know how to clean off nothing or take there trash out of the garbage cans the short time I have seen garbage under the registers pooring out of the cans I cleaned my area and I did it right every time and the Walmart in Bessemer pays 10$ an hour and the one I worked for its only 9$ an hour
bad,I am a friendly person and enjoy helping customers find items they are shopping for. It is nice to talk to all the different types of people who came into Wal-mart.
bad,"Walmart Is good for a temp job, not more then a year. A lot of the managers Choose to not work and push work onto employees that are in another department with out the consent of the department manager"
bad,"it was awful, management was terrible, no consideration, hated it to sell credit cards to people who did not even had enough money for living, working atmosphere was not the best"
bad,"Dealing with unpredictable circumstances and learning how to relate to them.Retail, you have to have people skills to work in retail. Management has to be open to all situations. Co-workers are the back bone of the company. The hardest part of the job is, being able to express yourself in a way that matters to the company. The most enjoyable part of the job: being recognized for a job well done.."
bad,At first everyone would pretend they were kind people. I would describe the supervisor as being white teeth and back heart because they were mean people.
bad,The Management at Walmart was horrible. They were rude and did not care about there employees.  The coworkers were really nice to get along with.
bad,"Walmart treats their employees very badly. They have no compassion or empathy at all."
bad,Have reach the point of having no future to advance within the company. Can be very stressful at times especially when someone calls out or quits with no help provided to handle the same work load. Management usually MIA or in their office talking and laughing. The overall rating is 0 I wish I never applied but in the town I live there is really no other work available.
bad,"lot of red tapes, deal will managment and get what you need . Else stay frustrated. "
bad,They do not care about no one but walmart. The managers are rude and talk to you any kind of way. They do not try to work with you at all its their way or your fired.
bad,Did returns and put up stock. The management was ok to work with. Some co-workers were great.  Did not like it when they would change your times not you not know that they were changed. Would not treat everyone the same.
bad,"Walmart, I have no problems shopping there. But the managers I worked for need to go back to management training. That is all."
bad,"Maybe it was just my store but my experience with Walmart was terrible. I was a frozen and dairy associate but they had me working almost all of the food side of the store, tasks that were not my responsibility were dumped on me all the time. The management was a joke and couldn't run a lemonade stand much less a super center."
bad,"The night manager was rude and did not care about her employees, and she picked favorites. When the general store manager was told about her that she wasn't doing her job the store manager did nothing about it."
bad,I worked hard but the management was so terrible at their jobs. I didn't like working under the same register even though we had our own numbers. The zone manager was fired for stealing. I was always drama at work.
bad,The typical work day was fair for the most part. I learned that your day thrives off the energy you put out. The management is not up to par. Actually management is far from the mark. My co workers were great.The hardest part of the job was interacting with management. The most enjoyable part was the chance to meet nice people.
bad,What I enjoyed most was the customer interaction. Also was that I was able to help customer out with finding items in the store.
bad,"I've learned alot working for WalMart. Very high demanding company. Really enjoyed my time there. No down time, but the staff is awesome."
bad,It was a bad experience as a cashier a lot of the CSM were rude had their favorites and weren't easy to get along with at all horrible work place for me!
bad,"This job is not for everyone!"
bad,I quit this job because of racial slurs that were never handled. They want me to come back but I will not work for any company that has racist people working for them..
bad,"it was good for a little while then it got bad "
bad,"awful job to have. i hated how i was treated while i was there, it was ridiculous. And no one trained me, they threw me out there and basically i taught myself everything on the register."
bad,this place sucks they talk a good game but once u r hirded on they don't care about u I was in a car wreak and the fired me coz the DR kept me out of work
bad,"Brutal job. Learned I am not suited for retail. Co-workers nice, management terrible.  Hardest part of job is handling abuse from customers.  At times they could be lovely.  No respect for employees from most.  It's impossible to please all the people all the time, hard as I tried.  If I'm to be honest, the best part of the job was going home."
bad,Favoritism is huge. Will expect you to do too much and you'll get yelled at if you don't finish it all. The new people will get paid more because they're liked more by management even though you have more experience. Wouldn't suggest anyone work there.
bad,this was my very first job when i was in highschool. the pay sucked for the work required and i was forced to do duties outside of my job description without pay compensation. i will never work here again
bad,Horrible former employees to work with. Loved working as a customer service rep and able to assist customers to the best of my ability.
bad,Good company to work for.  I only left due to conflicts with my full-time job.  Very customer focus but shows care and compassion for employees.
bad,"Started off at 8 per hour. Was told daily how much store made, which was over 1million a week. We were worked like slaves, and paid peanuts. There was no order, and lots of arguments and chaos constantly."
bad,A typical day at work would have been come in get on a register and count my money into my register then make sure i have plenty of bags and cleaner and paper towels.
bad,"I didn't not like Walmart it bad manager, bad customers. You will have to do everything with no help and if you didn't get the work done, u will be going home."
bad,"Managers do not know how to treat their employees."
bad,Very disrespectful managers and inappropriate behavior towards me on the job. Learned not to trust everyone you work with even though you work as a team because its still competitive. Hardest part was working in the frozen department because it was really cold and didn't have the correct equipment to work but was still forced.
bad,Overall Walmart itself was a decent place to work. Working in the Pharmacy became so stressful that I ended up with Anxiety attacks. I would've stayed with Walmart if the opportunity would of come up
bad,"cashier, check out customers, count and handle money and have a conversation with coworkers. loved my job but i had to move on to something better"
bad,unprofessional supervisors. required to work extra hours with out notice. the hardest part of the job was everybody want to be the boss.
bad,"Working at walmart was stressful starting with the management team they was very rude, unprofessional but besides that its a great company to work for"
bad,"this is making me do it so i am writing a review. pay was low, management was ungrateful. discount was nice. had to do a lot of work you were not hired to do"
bad,Plain work at Walmart does't give learning possibility. This is common job and no advisement to gain nothing special one would use as an experience for future references .
bad,Managers are very uptight and very closed minded would't recommend anyone getting this job at the 529 location. Managers are rude and if you don't agree with the managers then you are an enemy to them. Just a bad environment.
bad,Objectives are set and different for each days. Teamwork is encouraged. The open door policy was encouraged and helped alot with feedback
bad,"low pay, no hours, rude co workers, management played favorites. stressfull. Customers were old cranky bitties,security always watched you every move"
bad,"An eight hour shift."
bad,this was a poorly ran building. management was poor and had a lot of wasted man hours. would not recommend it to anyone that I know.
bad,It was okay place to work at and they don't offered full-time position. I wouldn't recommended people to apply at wal-mart.
bad,I personally did not like working at Walmart. I thought the management was not good for management and I never want to work there ever again
bad,It's Wal-Mart is simply all I can say. It was a job for a 16 year old kid while I was in High School. It put gas in the tank and had a little money left behind to spend on myself
bad,Everything about this job was bad. The pay as bad. Employees weren't treated right. Co-workers were ok. I learned how to unload semis.
bad,"Working at Walmart is very interesting, fast pace, and you need to have great customer service manners.  I have learned that my customer service have improve. Talking to the customer with just ""hello"" can make a differences. Honestly, management sucks! Walmart is very diversity. There are so many people that come in. Listening to different culture is every entertaining. The worst part sometime is when they don't want to work around your scheduled. Any who I love working with other, the customers make my day with their funny story."
bad,I liked the job itself. Just not the people I worked for. Everyday there was something new that was wrong. I would be the only cashier scanning and my line was always backed up and then I had to calm the customers down from having to wait so long.
bad,"customer service, freight, ordering, scanning, modular"
bad,"unloaded trailers, enjoyed co-workers, however turn around was very high - very few remained after 6 months of employment, because rate was too hard to maintain"
bad,"If i could vote 0 stars i would.  Crazy long hours . Management doesn't care about you they only see you as a number. Overworked, hard labor. Expect body aches and pains constantly. You can't sit down unless you are on break. They talk down to you . Straight up bullies and harassment . one female manager flirts with the men but gets the women fired. Worse place I ever worked!! After you've been there for a while they will do anything to fire you    don't apply here!! Only thing I liked were my co workers. Great people who get treated badly. Sad but I hope this helps someone"
bad,very fast hard work i was over nights stocking replenishing shelf and making sure all merchandise got out to floor for customers to buy.
bad,"Hated working with this company. The managers never were on the same page, half of your fellow associates wouldn't help you and stuck their noses up at you. Management needs to be wiped clean and add people who know how to manage a large company."
bad,Management are all terrible. They dont treat you friendly and they dont give you the time off you ask for. Even if you have been there for a year that act like its a hassle to give you time off.
bad,bad work environment no body that i worked with in receiving came to work they came to play and management wasn't doing anything about it so I decided to resign from my position
bad,It was a fast pace job but the way people are treated there makes me never want to work there for the low low pay they offer to their employees
bad,poor upper management. don't work together. everyone is jumping ship. need to go back to the old days. to many chiefs not enough indians
bad,So much fun. It was very exciting and fun-filled. I got a chance to be work on great customer service. If you want a chance to be a part of something great and have a good time this is the perfect job for you.
bad,"The job was very bad.  They continued to hire lazy people who did not want to do anything.  Walmart is a good place to shop, but not a good place to work."
bad,The managers at Wal-Mart are horrible. Play favoritism to only certain people and harass you if your not one of them people
bad,one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
bad,"It was a part time job for money. I worked as a cashier and quit due to scheduling conflicts with my classes. It was easy and fair work, but not anything of interest to me."
bad,"great company to shop at love walmart, didnt enjoy the job as much. although i worked the customer service desk i loved it, i loved helping customers processing orders, returns, and refunds."
bad,the only good  thing about this is the customers most are very happy and nice and treat you more like a person than management and fellow employee smh
bad,They use workers and do not pay them enough for what they require in work.  They do not offer good career advancement at all.
bad,"I have learned the skills in relationship building, persuasion, and active learning to make it easy to adapt to new situations and markets."
bad,Walmart was a learning experience. The managers there have favoritism and help who they want. There was plenty of times I wanted to learn new things and the blow me off.
bad,i ended up getting sick during my 1st 90 days and lost my job because of it you dont get many hours or any benefits. plus it is hard to get ahold of management when you really need them
bad,"A typical work day at walmart consists of stocking shelves, helping customers, and answering phones. But the walmart i worked at didn't work out to well i was 16 years old when i started and i ended up in a car accident. Called and told them that i may not be in because of what happened and They told me that i was fired. right on the spot. Didn't make much sense to me since i never missed a day of work till that day. I always went to work everyday on time did what my job required. but yet they fire me because i got into a car accident."
bad,Treat their people poorly.  The employees are treated like they are beneath them and do not rate for nothing. Do not miss working there at all.
bad,The most part of the job consist of customer assistance in finalizing returns. The responsibility of training and monitoring cashiers was fulling in seeing co-worker accomplish learning skills and friendly interaction with customers.
bad,"It was a seasonal job, but when i started there i was a little lost b/c you really don't know who is supervisor, or where you really suppose to be. I mean it was something to do during the holiday to make more money."
bad,Horrible place to work very bad management team no communication between management and crew coworkers typical day at work consist of being yelled at no matter how good you do.
bad,"Stressful work place, management doesn't communicate they just blame each other or you. Co workers have attitudes all the time and are lazy."
bad,Bad schedules. Never cared about people. They did not want to give insurance and other benefits so they continuously hired part time.
bad,Don't work here looking to move up. If you work hard you will become a mule for the hundreds of other employees who slack. Not a place to make a career.
bad,"not a good company to work for, they overwork you and have to much unnecessary drama and a lot of managers that act beyond their pay grade"
bad,"Their ""automated"" scheduling made life outside of work impossible. Their management was unwilling to make any changes to the schedule and were easy to blame people who were not friends of theirs for anything that went wrong."
bad,I worked here seasonal 2 years ago I did not like that i was hired in apparel department but was sent to grocery and garden sometimes it was hard answering customers questions.I was so barely put on schedule.
bad,I did not like the physical nature of my job of night stocking.  I also felt like management on the floor talked to the employees in a disrespectful manner.
bad,"I come in base and decorate birthday cakes in plain white buttercream frosting as well as occasionally frost cup cakes. My main job was to base, airbrush, and decorate cakes according to pictures on cards. I learned a little about the equipment used in a bakery. M coworkers were kind but didn't seem to take the job seriously. This particular Walmart was understaffed and rather mismanaged. I got to the point where I was constantly working the whole bakery department by myself."
bad,For the work you do the pay is way too low. not only do you have to complete work in a time limit that can not be meet because lack of worker. the adduted there sucks
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to work at Walmart. By far the worst job, I have had. Overall just a bad work environment, and never enough people at a time, so always doing more work than should."
bad,"imcopetent staff, no assistance, employees don't want to work here. employees are always complaining schedules and hours, pays minimum wage, I will never work here again"
bad,"If you are a highschool student  Walmart is a great first job, but very poorly managed, and chaotic.  The walmart master card makes EVERYONE angry. staff and customers, everyone gets mad when you ask them about it but management shoves it down everyones throats."
bad,very busy environment. it was nice opportunities if employed long enough. the downside is that it is walmart. can't expect too much from a big chain retail store
bad,"Walmart is, hands down, the WORST place I have ever worked for. They scheduled me to work on the day of my high school graduation after I had requested it off 2-3 months in advance, and THEN they counted it against me when i told them that I wouldn't be able to come in."
bad,I hated working at walmart and never will again. workers who were cart pushers like I woud stand around outside talking with managers as I would bust my butt to keep up with demand.
bad,Wal-marts organization skills could truly use more work our bakery  was completely under staffed but yet expected to produce the amount of service a fully staffed bakery would provide
bad,"It's not a good place to work if you want to get anywhere in life. They say they have advancement positions, but not really. They also treat  their employees badly. You work, never getting full time unless you're one of the lucky ones that buddy up to a manager. They don't give raises. Management is never there when you need them, and they never want to open more check lanes, so when the customer gets to you, they are in a REALLY bad mood for having to wait so long. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to tell them, I QUIT!"
bad,no much of a great work environment.  I wish I could express good feed back bout it . but unfortunate there is no good review working here .
bad,employees had to pay for items out of their own pocket and could not get reimbursed until the minimum had been met was glad to get out of the company
bad,"	Assist Cashiers for computer errors."
bad,one of my first jobs it was a good learning experience. other then that it was a small town with not much opportunity. you either worked here or at a little mom and pop shop.
bad,"Management has not a clue as to what they are doing. The rules are very strict in the shop, and safety glasses are required to check air in tires"
bad,"just another fortune 500 company trying to bleed the energy out of anyone who works there. Then there's the favoritism. If you're in good buddy buddy with management, you may be able to hope for advancement someday in the distant future."
bad,sometimes management is not very nice in Walmart team.  they get harsh with employees for no reason.  if there are 5 mangers working one day they give 5 different work instructions to associates
bad,Walmart was not flexiable to my request on not working on sunday . I was very disapionted that I had only made it threw orientation . I  was given no opption but to finish my day out after discusing the problem about my schudle for the week coming. By then I had upset them so they request i finish out my day! Wow that had never in my work history happen to me.
bad,"Distribution center shipped and received freight; in addition order selector packing and maintain merchants for commercial companies.Strong analytical skills with a commitment  to excellence and Able to work under   pressure in a fast-paced, time-sensitive environment."
bad,"Great people to work with. made some nice friends, management was great, had a flexible schedule. I had time talking to my co-workers and offering insights into bereavements, and comfort to those who lost their loved ones."
bad,"Horrible hours, management was rude and unhelpful. The store manager was very disrespectful. I would be scheduled for about 4 hours a day and that was a waste of time because I lived 30 minutes away, for low pay."
bad,I hated this job. There in little trust between the employees and the managers. You are constantly being watched and your breaks are timed by little paper print-outs. This is a huge turnoff for me because I am a loyal employee that would return from breaks on time whether I was being timed or not. The people I worked alongside were very distant and standoffish towards me. I never felt welcomed and was greatly relieved when I was able to leave this job.
bad,"Very busy and short handed. Breaks were hard to come by. Management was ok most of the time, co-workers were like family. Company has awful insurance and hours. Raises and bonuses are almost non-existent. It has definitely changed since I first starting working in 2002."
bad,they don't give specific directions to employees and would treat them so bad. not give credit when deserved for good comments from customers
bad,"Good hours, but bad management, and low pay. Not a place someone would want to make a career  out of. No one takes you seriously."
bad,I can't speak for all walmarts stores but the one I worked at I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there in so many words your workers are as good as your managers
bad,"Excellent Pay, and Benefits. Horrible management structure and while managers are well trained for the jobs they ""do"", most are less qualified for the position they hold, educationally. There is no ""culture"" making for a very lack luster working experience. Very little potential to progress and promote. Overall it is a great company to work for. The salary is very fair, and correlates well to work load. In my personal opinion this is not a place to work for those that thrive off of person to person interaction, or motivation."
bad,i liked walmart when i first started everyone was nice they showed me around helped me when i needed help i would love to work at wal-mart again
bad,"Helping customer's and providing them wit great customer service. My coworkers was really nice and helpful, we all got along and was able to work together.  A typical ay was assisting customers, making sure the store was in order on the front end.  Their was not a hard part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and making the happy"
bad,"A typical day at work would be, coming to work with the mind set of getting a goal done. Doing your job no matter what. Masking sure all your duties are done with no slacking. On time,and to make sure the company is getting your 100 percent. What I've learned from working at different places is that, you can't let your outside life get into your work life. Each day at work I do what needs to be done and leave it at that. But, while I allow myself to work and give it my all regardless of any situation I might encounter. Management should be respected always. They have a job to do just like the employees. Just a higher position. There their, to help. To make it better for the customers,store,employees, and thereslves. Co-workers to me are like a reflection of myself. We should be one in everything. Co-workers are to help each other in times when I or each other don't know the answer.The hardest part of a job would be,not fully helping someone. Or giving that person half work. But, the most enjoyable part of a job is to be apart of something great. Knowing that Someday might become Excellent."
bad,I was hired as a maintenance associate but they felt I would do better as a stocking associate. I was also used as an inventory associate which helped expand my job skills
bad,you are over work and under paid. if the assistant or co mangers love you then move up in the company is easy if not then they would treat you horrible and you may be promoted in like five years.
bad,This job was located at a walmart and i enjoyed it but this will probaby not come up as walmart so have fun with this.i have to type more words so i need to keep going
bad,Laying down pallets to get ready to unload all trucks that came in for the day and to pull product out to its specific areas. the hardest part is when more then one truck come in at the same time while work area is cluttered with other product.
bad,"Walmart is fine for a temporary position to apply old skills and learn new ones to transfer to another retail or customer service-oriented company or position.  However, diversity and discrimination/harassment are KEY PROBLEMS there."
bad,"This was my worse job. They hired me for one job but had me doing something that wasnt in my job description. This was the most unprofessional environment. The superviors talked to you like you were stupid, they didnt folllow their own company policy."
bad,Night shift included lining shift out for night's shipments. Meeting with associates to outline nights schedule. Follow up with associates to make sure they are on target for time lines. The hardest part of the job was not having the people to match up with the labor hours and being able to accomplish all that needed to be done. The best part of the job was working with the associates and helping them to succeed.
bad,A store where the managers are kind and will work around a schedule if needed. Also they will help with things at the store to reach the goal set
bad,"I log in, input prescriptions, go through the troubleshooting window, apply medication order, fill medications, work drive-thru window, sell prescription to customers."
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can sometimes be very busy but fun all at the same time, the place would be filled with laughter and smiles on some days and on others it would be a few frowns and upset customers. Some things I learned at Wal-Mart are that all actions don't deserve an reaction; sometimes it's best to keep some things to yourself. Wal-Mart's management is not perfect but it's not the worst either; there are some managers that think they're better then others then other managers that are absolutely fanatic. The same goes for some of the co-workers some think they're above everybody else then other co-workers are the absolutely best, some of us still communicate and socialize with each other. The hardest part of the job was trying to talk to an upset customer that was already upset before entering the store, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people. Sometimes we would meet people from New York, Connecticut and many more places."
bad,"Working on a machine that produces vary products and parts. checking to make sure there are no defective part and fixing them accordingly,."
bad,"No training, just get thrown into a department with out having anyone to even shadow, your left on your own to figure everything out."
bad,"no support, no help given when asked but expected to do pallets (3 or more) daily along with other job duties. I don't think they would ever put help into that area for the department manager."
bad,the management do not respect the cashiers we do the most work and we do not get appreciate on anything we do cashiers deserve respect and to be backed up on customers they try to get over and we look into and get downgraded on everything we do
bad,Walmart supervisors were very rude to the workers and were often very unorganized and rude to the customers as well. I was only 17 at the time I worked there in 2011 but I guess that line of work just wasn't for me.
bad,they work you to death. long hours with no remorse or care from your direct supervisors and coworkers are for the most part not enjoyable.
bad,I was over stocking and checking the baking aisle. I really did not like it there because when I completed my task I was made to complete othe people task that did not care about doing their job.
bad,Your work is basic. Its not hard at all it just sometime customers can get on your nerves and make you want to quit. but its an ok job to have
bad,"Work with good people but as with all corporate run retail pharmacies all they really care about is the bottom line and improving their stock prices so patient, employees come last"
bad,"WM has become a money hungry corporation, but then name one that isn't.  They always try to do more with less people.  That is not always a good thing.  As many people know, you can't get proper assistance when in the stores.  As soon as Sam Walton died, they took the Made In America off of the walls in their stores.  They lost track of Sam's dream and how he cared for his employees.  When they ask for your input then totally ignore it.  I believe they have gotten too big for their britches!  There is too much favoritism in both their stores and DC's.  They say that they will ""Set you up for success"", when really they ""set you up for failure""!  I am sure not everyone feels this way, you will have those ""Brainwashed"" employees out there... Give me a W."
bad,"Its walmart you deal with rude people, nice people, all types of people, the hours are ok, you only make money once you become an assistant manager"
bad,associates that were friends with the managers were allowed to do sub par work but other associates are worked to death with no compinsation. workers are not being punished for doing sub par work. there is no personal responsibility in most managers.
bad,"busy with shoppers "
bad,If you do not bleed blue then don't work here.  They tell you that you are married to the store now and not your spouse.  Terrible place to work.
bad,"Learned about the education and preparation needed to become a cake decorator."
bad,"Company cares about company and money. I mean,  it's Walmart, okay? Ask anyone that works there, or has worked there. It's just a job."
bad,"Horrible pay never knew my schedule till the day before , managers never helped nor was i trained in every aspect of the job. Plus pay was horrible co workers were a disgrace to the company."
bad,"I learned a lot about handling meat, cheese, making sandwiches, salads and subs.  I also baked  bread, and rotisserie chickens.  The pay was grossly insufficient compared to the amount of work required.  The supervision and management showed disrespect to the employees."
bad,Customer Service based in a fast paced environment. Poor when it come to the customers however still manage to function.
bad,Working at a company like Wal-Mart is a once in a life time experience that has thought me how to run the operational side of a multi  million dollar business.
bad,"Walmart was a simple job but the CSM's where uncaring, rude and discriminatory. When you tried to take a complaint up the chain of command they did not take your complaint seriously. CSM's would mute thier palm pilots and ignore your calls for help, and shop while they were supposed to be working."
bad,My job duties were great. I loved it. However childish management and the uncaringness of managers was too much to deal with it became stressful and not worth the trouble.
bad,"Policy Procedures and making a profit was the only thing that rules this company at the end of each day."
bad,While I learned a lot working at walmart it is seriously one of the worst places to work.  The people you work with and the friendships made are the only rediming quality
bad,Not enough hours. I learned customer service and the deli. The people were nice to work with. Some of the managers were helpfull. I did not like when you came in and the management said we transfered you to a different department and you onever work in that field before!
bad,Walmart need to pay their employees more per hour for the work that you are asked to do.  They need to show more compassion for their employees and actually act on our requests.
bad,This is a tough job to work. During the summer it is more than 100 degrees and it gets cold during the winter. The shift is very long and is can be very stressful on your body. You are paid well.
bad,This position has too many expectations and job tasks for the pay. The overnight shift was extremely hard to get used to.
bad,"Worst company to work for, underpaid and over worked. Expected to do the work of 10 people always, I will never work for them again and would never refer someone to work for them"
bad,"over worked and under paid, no benefits, no accurate breaks, management is horrible, worst company to work for in my opinion, open every day of the year except christmas"
bad,The hardest part of my job was having a crew of 100+ women.  The most enjoyable part of my job was I knew my job well and had the confidence to do my job.  I also enjoyed working with the public.  I am a big people person.
bad,"i did not enjoy my time at walmart. was not getting enough hours, management was horrible, the distrct manager never responded to complaints from customers or employees"
bad,You will always be just a number to this company and once you go salary you will get worked like you are a robot. do not recommend working here ever
bad,A typical day at Wal-Mart is like any other job. You come to work give it your all to complete your task in a effective and efficient manner. I learned to think outside the box during my time at Wal-Mart and the management team was great.
bad,"I worked as a seasonal cashier in electronics for the Christmas Season and was great working with co-workers and customers, the most enjoyable part of job was meeting and talking to customers."
bad,"bust tires down, fix flats, and doing oil changes, test and change batteries,perform fuel injection service and headlight restoration and had great co-workers"
bad,"Walmart is a challenging , fun , fast paced, non-typical work environment that cover many operational task. I learned how to multi task, lead, engage, coach, plan, transitioning and execute through tenacious follow up and action planning. Executive management tend to over strategize rather than focus on the basics of merchandising, processes, in stock and operations, sometimes infringes  on the integrity of the mission statement. Co-workers were engaged with completing basic processes, but frustrated with last minute go do's, phantom surveys and canceled visits. The hardest part of my job, ""work life balance' trust that staff could consistently meet or exceed my expectations. Team building, transitioning, developing prodigies, red stores into "" Benchmark , Must See stores"",  changing the culture, perception and creating ownership with the associates."
bad,"I hated working here. They do not treat their employees fairly, nor do they pay them enough. I was a cashier at first and then I worked on the floor, trained in every department."
bad,Too much favoritism on the overnight shift. Lack of control by overnight management.
bad,I did not enjoy working at walmart because the managers didn't treat you as an employee they treated you as a slave and weren't very nice. They did not understand when I had to take my son to the doctor and did not cut me any slack for having a sick child.
bad,long time working there so not to much to say about it. the people where good to work for
bad,"Horrible place, nothing but a gossip salon.  You have to pray with the manager to move up"
bad,The most enjoyable part about this job is the people you deal with on a day to day and the relationships that are built. The hardest part about this job is not being appreciated for going over and beyond to make sure you meet each customers satification. I learned that retail can be a very stressful  environment and to work as a team with your co workers and management to make sure that the store's productivity is balanced to ensure a safe and satisfying shopping experience for all the customers. That is a typical day at work
bad,The management was rude and did not help employees fix what they wanted fixed.
bad,"Given the reputation of the company, one would think that Walmart would interact positively with their employees, but this would be an incorrect assumption. Quite possibly the worst work environment I have ever worked in."
bad,"At the store I worked at it was very out of control, the work itself wasn't all that bad it was easy for me to get done. But the management system and the employees of both day and night shift were lacking, and that made it much harder to do my job because they were not doing theirs. "
bad,I liked meeting new people. I liked the co-workers they were fun and helpful. I enjoyed learning new things. I always enjoy learning.
bad,"Terrible company, greedy owners who could care less about the people who put their blood, sweat, and tears into it every day. I was turn away from the company after I was placed in their fast track program by a wonder store director. His time was up, and he moved to another wal-mart. Then came the reckoning, I was driven away and decided to complete a bachelor degree."
bad,"Although Walmart is a good workplace, it just wasn't the job for me. To be getting paid the same amount as a cashier when I'm working 10 times as hard as them was absurd. I worked this job the summer of 2014 while on break for school for money to pay on the upcoming semester."
bad,"Couldn't recommend working for. No training to speak of and no resources to complete work tasks, either human or mechanical."
bad,worst job ever. never work for Walmart as a cart pusher. the most underpaid job there is.
bad,"Busy retail pharmacy with  technician turnover which lead to often untrained technicians. Pharmacy management issues."
bad,nice job fun place to work nice hours great staff best job ever
bad,"Exhausting place to work, difficult and unattainable tasks that must be completed each day."
bad,This was a part time job for me i work at Wal-Mart seasonal. Its to much work for such little pay.
bad,i did not enjoy working for this company. they are unorganized and i did not stay here to long it was not for me.
bad,a typical day at work would be long and hard cause you have to try and get he orders out in a timely fashion
bad,A typical day at Walmart wasn't actually a day at all. I worked overnight with a crew of hard workers and the management was terrible to their employees.
bad,"Again. Everyone has their own opinion. It was retail. Some people loved it, some hated it, and some were indifferent. Depends on what you are looking for in a job. Keep in mind it is Wal-Mart."
bad,It was a great place to work easy going as long as you did your job
bad,"Unless retail is your thing, considering this as a career choice should be thought through, long and hard."
bad,"Cashiering, stocking, and providing the customers with great customer service."
bad,"You would think Wal-Mart is paying their employees greatly, knowing that they are a multi-billion dollar company right? Wrong why are the paying minimal wages still? the work is a handful but they give you nothing to show for it."
bad,"Do not treat employees well at all."
bad,Doing the work of 6 people.Learned the type of company not to work for. Two good mangaers the rest woukdnt even know how to manage even if they had a manual. Co workers where ghetto and disrespectful.Associates would get beaten up by other family members of associates and the store manager would allow the associate to still work their. The lack of communication among management. The most enjoyable the lunch hour. The store manager were more focused on look than sales.
bad,"difficult place to work, people aren't treated fairly and the pay is awful"
bad,A typical day consists of Handling any customers with respect and trying to help get the customers through the front end in a timely manner
bad,how be on your feet good to work around others. I learned how to lessen to my customer and coworkers. the hardest part of customer service is knowing how to lessen and understanding.
bad,We all know that Walmart is a company that will limit your hours to prevent you from receiving any benefits. I was in that situation and that is why I quit
bad,I had some very nice experiences at Wal-Mart for the short duration of me working there. I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking growth.
bad,Everyday was the same schedule and routine. I learned how to deal and help customers better. The management was good and helpful. The co-workers were good people too. The hardest part I would say was being in the freezer a lot...hahaha. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
bad,"Would not work there again.  I checked out customers, was a door greeter which I strongly disliked. I would not want the experience again."
bad,One of the worst jobs I ever held in my life. I was very glad to get out of there.
bad,"good job. good training system."
bad,Their manager did not know how to talk to their employees. But I did love working there.
bad,Too much work expected with not much time to get it done reasonably
bad,Poor management. Filthy environment and high school drama.
bad,I have nothing to say about this company. I have decided to leave Walmart. I will miss working with some of the good people there but it is time for me to move on.
bad,its a company that doesn't really care so much. it one of those jobs that u have to just do you job put in your time then go home. just keep ur mind set on its a pay check.
bad,A typical day at work was good because I love helping customer and the management team treated all employees with respect
bad,Unfair treatment of employees. They like who they like and if they dont like you then your time there will be terrible. Lots of work for very little pay
bad,"Clean and wax floors, take out trash, gather carts, stock shelves, load and unload trucks. I learned how to clean and wax store floors. I loved the coworkers I worked with. Hardest part of the job was not getting paid enough. Most enjoyed working with the coworkers I worked with."
bad,treated like slaves and payed minimum wage by a multibillion dollar company
bad,I was over worked under paid and my bosses expected too much of me to do alone. After my promotion to cashier It was a little better but overall I did not enjoy working here
bad,The direct management treated the employees horribly and were unwilling to become flexible.  The workers were constantly overworked and each department was intentionally understaffed.
bad,"cash out customers, also worked in apparel stock all cloths, keep my work area clean"
bad,Absolutely hated working here. They run you to death and have no idea how to manage a company.
bad,"everything was good , customers were great, management was not that great , hours were good, holiday pay was good,"
bad,Stay away from this place. This is not a fulfilling and meaningful place to work. Management and co-workers will keep you down.
bad,"all around bad. bad management, bad work environment, difficult customers"
bad,"The hours and flexibility is very very minimal. The hours for part time could be on the cusp of a full time position. The flexibility for the shifts is non existent, and for a student having the responsibility of having to close is expected on week nights"
bad,I would not recommend this place for a place of employment due to mistreatment and favoritism
bad,enjoyed coworkers. however management was not to nice and doesnt work well with those who have school schedules
bad,"meeting different customers with different characters that a big challenge as a first job here in Canada"
bad,Not the greatest place to work. Low pay and not much in the way of training other than online.
bad,"Im hard worker reliable person willing to show up on time"
bad,"In this position you were independently working at your own pace. making sure the department was in great shape. The hardest part was keeping it together, and the good thing about doing this job. You were able to help others and you had a lot of time to get the job done."
bad,"having fun with customer"
bad,"A typical day at work will be clocking in, working and going home. I have learned that you should work effectively and to always put your customers first. The most enjoyable part about the job is you get a 401K plan and they have insurance premiums"
bad,"face paced, long lines. I learned how to multi task at a quick pace. management was always very helpful. co-workers were always nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job was when the store was packed and customers were rude and irritated when you are moving as quick as you can. the most enjoyable part of the day is the conversation with the customers."
bad,"If you just want a job that pays you some money, this is easy enough. "
bad,The most I will say is that the management is horrible and they do not care about employees.
bad,not a good place to work was like being in high school very clickish
bad,I didn't enjoy working at Walmart. Prior to working the floor by myself I had little hands on training and was basically thrown to the wolves around Christmas! We all know how Walmart gets around the holidays. It was very stressful dealing with the attitudes of the customers coming through my line.
bad,"Atribuições: Atendimento ao público, controle e fechamento de caixa e empacotamento de produtos."
bad,I enjoyed working here for the most part. I learned how to work a cash register and was able to experience customer service face to face. I did not have the best work experience with some of the managers. They didn't seem to respect those they were managing. I really enjoyed helping the customers it was most defiantly the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Walmart is a great job if you like communicating with customers face to face
bad,". Worked grocery all day"
bad,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
bad,Some of the manager's are there to help but others are there just to get paid. I was never trained for the postion they hired me for.
bad,"cashier, asssist cust on checking out, loading prepaid cards etc."
bad,"I managed the studio for 10 months which included filing paperwork, bank deposits, maintained the studios cleanliness, made sure the customers were always kept happy, I worked with family's/individuals to make sure their portraits were exactly what they wanted the most enjoyable part of the job was when they walked out with a smile on their face . I also did passport photo's and have a lot of knowledge on passports."
bad,walmart is not an ideal place to work.mangment is terrible and most start of at minimum wage.
bad,I am disapointed in the way Walmart handles the conduct.   They like to let someone go when they have been there a long time when a person who works under them has been told to do something and they don't feel they don't have to do what they were told.  I was there 26 yrs  I feel between my title/seniority  and the time I have been there this was used against me for my termination.
bad,a empresa era muito boa mais não dava oportunidades aos seus funcionários.
bad,This was like my first real job. I loved he fact i got paid every week. But the place was very hot during the summer and cold during the winter.
bad,"They employees were horrible, and I would never work for Wal-mart if I absolutely had too."
bad,Llego al trabajo un dia tipico en el trabajo hago arqueos retiro papeleria recolecto valores hago cierre de dia trabajo con mis colegas aprendo cada dia cosas nuevas lo mas dificil cuando se acaba el tiempo me gusto es aver terminado bien el dia y en tiempo
bad,"The hardest part of the job was putting work above family.  "
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public.
bad,"I left this job due to a miscarriage, they actually made me step down due to having to take more than a week off due to the circumstances. I gave proper documentation from the hospital and my dr but still was not happy with the time I had to take off"
bad,I learnt and improved on my skills. Very supportive management.
bad,"I wood get to work, start the paper work, putting all throws, pulling alerts, as what product was recalled, check price changes, do the price changes, start stocking the floor, cleaning as I would go,rotateing and putting new product out.cleaning the cooler and rotateing.assisting in Inventory,directing other associates on tasks."
bad,I do not recommend this company. Management is very unfair (or at least the ones i had) and I highly recommend to search elsewhere than Walmart.
bad,A typical day at work would be very boring and stressful and not worth it at all.
bad,Employer doesn't care about employees and worked really long hours and didn't get breaks when scheduled.
bad,"1515 Skibo rd., Fayetteville, NC is ran like a dictatorship allowing the store manager to get away with many things and do as she pleases hasn't passed inventory in 8 yrs and plays favorites while she treats the more deserving associates like slaves...smh currently working around the clock to get out of there"
bad,we fast moving learning environment.  I was able to learn and progress to be a team leader.  with hard work you are able to move up in the company.
bad,the management team is not very talk able to associates to let them know what they are doing wrong.
bad,"I made some good friends at all the locations at which I worked. However, it was not a good working experience. I apologize for the bluntness, but it's the truth."
bad,it sucked each day management could of had more respect for their associates
bad,everything sucks I quite ther long time ago it sucks hours pay staff the work to much work for only 7:65 and hour you get in there a they tell you do this a that and you didn't eve apply for that but they make you do the job so if you are looking for a job don't go to Wal-Mart
bad,"rude and disrespectful management, co-workers were nice."
bad,"I met some great people in my department, the hardest part was doing two departments by yourself."
bad,"If you want to keep your dignity and respect you will never ever apply to work there."
bad,"I was A customer service manager for 2 years here, gained useful working skills but hated the structure and inconsistency in which it is run. Every move, designed for 1 thing only..... make Walmart every penny it can at all costs!!"
bad,Wall-Mart is not a great place to work. Unless you can get into a management position the turnover rate is very high. Even the managers rotate stores a lot... As a work environment I found it unstable and chaotic
bad,Was cursed at on a daily basis by management and told what a horrible job my team did.
bad,I have never truly been so disappointed in working for one company in my entire life. The management and the team was not efficient and they never followed store guidlines.
bad,The managers and employment plan were very unorganized for the pay given.
bad,Management in this place is terrible. Everyone acts like it's their store and the manager has no regard for his employees. Nobody that works there gets paid enough to deal with doing it every day.
bad,I worked at a distribution center and it was like slave labor.  I was good at my job and love going as hard as I could but it was never enough.  People would get fired for shady reasons and then they could get their job back after applying 6 months later (with less pay nonetheless).
bad,"Terrible management, minimal pay, not enough staff. No one in the store knows what they're doing."
bad,The job was enjoyable because everyone was friendly and helpful at Walmart.
bad,I encounter many people on a daily basis and I learn how to handle many situations.
bad,management there is not all that understanding and dont always listen to what you have to say .
bad,"To customers, a waiter or waitress is the public face of a restaurant. He or she greets them, tells them what the daily specials are, answers questions and may even recommend particular dishes. Of course the waiter and waitress also serves them their food. While customers see the wait staff each time they visit the establishment, they may never lay eyes on the chef."
bad,"For a Temporary job it is a good experience, I was able to performance my skills in cake decorator because I take a course on night class to learn about sweets and I really enjoyed to do so."
bad,other employees made it ok. It was back breaking appreciative work.
bad,"A typical day at work depends on your job within WalMart. As a cashier, you will stand in the same place all day, handling tender, and merchandise."
bad,"working here was okay for my first job. i was hired as a full time employee, but they changed me to part time"
bad,To many chiefs not enough Indians. To many managers telling you to do different things at the same time.
bad,"There is not much to say about this. Its walmart, I was a cashier."
bad,"I was a General Customer Service Associate (Cart Pusher, Stockman, etc.) for 3 years before I accepted another job offer. Wal-Mart may look great outside, but looks can be deceiving, they're horrible inside. The crime rate is tremendously high at that store and the store and company management are doing nothing about it to make it a safer store to shop, there are not enough registers open during the busy hours, they don't schedule enough staff to operate them either, they're always out of items that are hot sellers, the management don't care about the employees, and especially to me either. In the summer they made me sweat in scorching 90+ degree weather without allowing me to cool down and have anything cool to drink, and in the winter they made me shiver in frigid -20 degree weather without allowing me to warm up and have anything warm to drink. My dignity and health was at stake, so I left."
bad,The pay isn't great.  There is little to no chance of actually 'climbing the ladder.'  No benefits.  Sloppy management.  Poor hours.
bad,Always on your feet for little pay! Better off working as a telemarketer...
bad,since I have been with Walmart I have obtained a number of new skills such as check cashing processing money gram and pill payment transactions
bad,I started as cashier and quickly moved into customer Service. I have gained a lot of knowledge on how to handle and calm down disgruntled customers. I learned how to print money orders return unwanted items and keep calm and efficient In high stress situations
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was a regular day "
bad,Trabalho em equipe sempre funciona !O aprendizado fica melhor o trabalho agradável
bad,"O dia de trabalho era puxado,mesmo eu sendo menor aprendiz eles exploram bastante todos nós,a gerência era boa mais também sempre obrigando a fazer serviços que não eram para ser feitos por aprendizes,meus colegas de trabalho sempre bem dedicados.A parte mais agradável  e a mais difícil não tinha pois eu entrei para trabalhar em uma área que era o RH e acabei trabalhando na loja do mercado,trabelhei separando perecíveis válidos,bebidas estragadas e válidas,me sujava inteira,sem luva sem nada.Trabalhei nos freezers sem equipamentos e fiquei doente,e tudo isso era reclamado mais nunca chegou em lugar nenhum.Particularmente não aconselho a nenhum de menor a trabalhar em mercado.Uma empresa com nome tão grande e horrível."
bad,"self motivated managers, poorly paid, hard work. nice people to work with."
bad,Management don't value the workers or provide the proper tools to do the job.
bad,I was a department manager they pay slightly over min wage to take on a lot of responsibility.
bad,"Very interesting because of the variety of departments I was sent to  help out in peak times.  Was a ""floater"" and yet cashiering was something I did in each area.  Able to learn the merchandise, grasp the various marketing methods of each department, help customers all over the store."
bad,supervise the unloading of freight from trucks daily. Supervise employees stocking merchandise on sales floor. Clean store and stockroom daily to prepare for next shift. Management is very supportive with providing the necessary tools to complete set goals for day. The hardest part of the job is maintaining turnover rate. The most enjoyable part of my job is completing the tasks that where assgined for the day.
bad,"everyone know how bad walmart is, but it just provide a chance for me to learn the real world"
bad,"Wal-mart is a very unorganized company at times, and needs improvements, and a lot more communication towards associates and managers"
bad,"Typical day at walmart pharmacy was like hopping into a frying pan every morning- Getting allt the drugs checked in and faxes sent out and input scripts and work insurance trouble at the same time as answering nonstop telephones and lines of people at input window and drive thru-  very very busy pharmacy."
bad,Walmart was a very different place to work for. I believe this may have been one of the hardest jobs I have ever worked. Not only did you not get any help from coworkers and the management was even worse but they stayed understaffed and employees stayed over worked which caused a lot of problems among employees. I have noticed in the beginning when you first started out everybody was very willing to work with each other but as time passed I notice that it was just a show for the new people. The management at Walmart has no respect for their staff and with the understanding that certain things need to be done and certain budgets have to be Not showing the employees a little care will always cause them to have a high employee turnover rate.
bad,"Not employee friendly, too demanding and does not care about staff.  All staff is easily replaceable, and leadership does not value employees."
bad,"I start my day with review my tasks all the day  and try to finish all the tasks in the right time, I am really enjoyed this job because I learned who to manage my time, my relation ship with all the crow .I can deal with any management because I know what is my duty , I love my co-workers (my team work ) they very co-operations , we understand each other, we respect each other. the hardest part is in the end of the year (year clothing) , it is not hardest but we have a million tasks to do , and the most enjoyable part when I complete my tasks I feel that I did something important for the company and my self too ."
bad,Walmart is my first experience with retail sales.  It has been a true learning experience for me.  The other cashiers have been great in assisting me to learn the job.
bad,I learned a lot of management work was very easy working at this company was a great experienced for me never a dull moment
bad,"dont like walmart , very mess.... No one should ever work there they treat their employees like garbage."
bad,the people that manage there at the one I work at are awful except for one lady that works to hard to pick up the slack for the others there
bad,other co. workers act like they are higher in rank then they are. Managment has very little knowledge on how to solve problems
bad,"Terrible co-workers and employees are treated very poorly"
bad,There is nothing fancy about working for walmart. They are ok to work for if you don't have other choices.
bad,Enjoyed helping out customer and providing them with good customer service
bad,I loved working at walmart. Great experience they give alot of hours and pay theyre employees quite well.
bad,"This was after surgery, they moved me to cashier. My duties included helping the customer pay for items they wanted"
bad,"A typical day at work was doing paperwork and overseeing the safety of the entire store. I was always always being taught something new to help move up the ladder of success. As for management, most but not all, they were not very fair to their associates. I enjoyed all my co-workers, we all got along. The hardest part of my job would have to be going to management about a co-worker who was doing unethical things which were not permitted in the work place. The best part of my day was just being able to communicate with everyone and help whomever needed help."
bad,"work with a lot of people"
bad,busy place just stand on your feet all day and low pay at the time plus i was still in high school
bad,"The compensation is horrible for what you have to do.  I felt like a peon, resulting in me just not wanting to be there any longer."
bad,I worked there as a teenager and it was one of my first jobs. I would not recommend anyone working there that is looking to move forward with the company.
bad,"Arrive at work, supervisor held scheduled meeting to assigned each person their task for the night and the goals set for store that night to be complished.  Went to assigned area and began task (stacking, stocking, and zoning.products on shelves and cleaning area before regural opening of the store."
bad,It was so boring and mundane. Coworkers have no enthusiasm or pride for their job and the customers are usually a pain in the neck as well. The best part was working at my own pace.
bad,The hours weren't enough to support a family and the pay wasn't great either.
bad,Don't work here. No one cares about you as an employee and they only care about the bottom dollar.
bad,I had a good time for a minute but the manager is not nice.  They don't work with you on stuff.  They never have stuff stocked right.  The store is usually a mess!!!
bad,It's a world wide company. you have good and the bad. It's what you make it at wal-mart.
bad,Assisting customers in checking out. I learned how to operate Walmart's POS system.
bad,"Busy Day At Work Allday, Everyday."
bad,"Responsible for managing schedule and procedure of over 150 personnel.  Controlling expenses, sales numbers, are pushing performance goals, ordering products, monitoring inventory and standardizing. Responsible worked closely with invoices, backroom and cash office. Planning Monthly sales strategies, delegating and supervising multiple tasks. Working on training and development of employees to make excellent team players."
bad,"I like working at walmart because walmart allow you to move around in the company and to grow as a person. I learned a lot at walmart ."
bad,"A typical day at work was fun, we were a family. Working at Wal Mart I felt a lot of love not only from my peers but from the customers as well. I went into work happy and I left work happy. The most enjoyable part of my day was speaking to the customers seeing the same customers a few times a week, the customers start to become my friends. The hardest part of my job would have to be cleaning up every night after the day was over, I didn't like that but it had to be done. Wal-Mart was a good experience."
bad,"The Start Of My Day Was The Team Meeting,Folowing Checking Into Our Designated Work Areas.Next Was Unloading Our Trucks To Move The Merchandise To It's Deignated Areas.Finally Stocking The Shelves With The Merchandise."
bad,i wold never work at another walmart it sucked. the customer service wasbad. co workers was hard to work with. way to much drama
bad,they will work you to death and you will never get anything for it. if you are lucky you will get a 40 cent raise every year. even if you are the best worker there and put all other workers to shame you still will not get anything for it except more work.
bad,"I was in soft lines and spent most of my time straightening, folding, and facing clothing.  The fitting room lady decided to leave WalMart so I asked if I could take her place.  At that time the fitting room clerk answered all incoming calls, so I was pretty busy.  We were to watch for shop lifting, but could do nothing about it, even if we saw it.  Some of the customers at this store were very crude.  The fitting rooms were used as bathrooms on two occassions.  My set schedule was changed, but when I asked my supervisor why the schedule was changed, I was told 'because I can'."
bad,"I hated that job, the management always question you if you request a day off, I keep a cold cause I worked in the meat dept., I request 2 be transferred 2 another dept., but was rejected."
bad,"Receive and disburse money within the business establishment."
bad,Too focused on pleasing customers that the company lacks taking care of associates.
bad,Walmart is good to their employees as they have good benefits and perks.
bad,Great place to work. I enjoyed processing the inventory and my co workers
bad,Terrible experience. Disliked the culture and lack of management skills. Any effort to suggest alterenative methods of motivating employees was met with resistance
bad,Great experience but not a job you can do forever unless you like retail.
bad,i frist work in the snack bar and then i was transfer to the jewerly department when the sanck bar closes and i was  not train right by the manager of the department and i was trained by other employee that help me the manager wouldn't help me  and i ask for help
bad,I enjoyed the first few years at Walmart but then I realized that there was NO advancement opportunities at all. After they fired all the good managers they hired a bunch of people fresh out of school to be the managers and the place went down hill.
bad,"Big business at it's worst. The walmart I worked at was horribly managed, cashiers were always stealing and nothing was ever done, and nobody was ever made to be responsible for their mess ups."
bad,Really was not a fan of working here.  It was just a job to complete my senior project
bad,there were customers who were nice and others who were rude. The management team were never on the same page with each other so you did things 3 times
bad,"Management treats the associates badly, they are rude and uncaring.  If you don't mind being disrespected and can tough it out, then this is an okay job.  I learned that big companies managed by a financial specialist are all about money.  It's an easy job because it doesn't require any skill, but you will have to work hard for little pay. Nothing is really enjoyable except serving customers, if you like that."
bad,The most enjoyable part about being a cashier was the people that would come through my line. I did not like the people I worked with nor really liked being a cashier. I would have preferred being in a department. 
bad,"Come in at 11pm, clock out at 7am. Job responsibilities consisted of cleaning and maintaining entry way and watching for any suspicious activity, as well as checking customer receipts and ensuring everything is in order. I learned how to operated and industrial baler. Management was very straight forward. Co-Workers were respectful. The hardest part about the job, for me, was the shift and scheduling conflicts. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the pay."
bad,The management was horrible the shifts sucked they were very unorganized and they made me sick no sense of pride working there
bad,I loved working at walmart fun place employess and management were great people to work with  
bad,My workmates were all fun to worked with but management didn't treated me good.
bad,Over Night Crew would leave 6 gallons of milk out in front of the dairy cooler for me to clean up every day. The messes would be left for me after I would come back from days off and no other employee would take care of it. 
bad,This company is a terrible company to work for. They never have enough associates in the store and they don't pay you enough in my opinion for as much work as you do. 
bad,"You must be on your toes at all times,be willing for changes in the way you work,the management team keeps changing the rules,working conditions,never consistent with thier rules,never satisfied with your work,never appreciate your hard work efforts,thier goals cannot be fullfilled by anyone,we all do our best in what we do it just seems it is not enough.    "
bad,productive and fun environment. lots of opportunity to grow
bad,Did not get treated well and illegal things were happening.
bad,I worked at a Walmart for a total of three months. After working my hiney off for $7.45 a hour 35 hours a week and at the end of the pay period only made $399.00 NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!!!!!!!!!! The managers sit around twiddling their thumbs while they bark orders to their associates and expect them to have their new products on the floor and a safety sweep in their departments along with all the zoning and customer service you have to do. DO NOT WORK THERE! McDonalds is better i'm sure!
bad,"There's a reason this place has so many negative reviews. The management doesn't communicate, there's a constant stress of conflicting delegation, and they treat you like little more than a number."
bad,Walmart will not value you as an employee. They know you are replaceable and will treat you as such.
bad,Walmart wasn't a great job to me. I worked in the back with the freight team. We unloaded trucks and stocked freight. The managers were very tough on us and always pushed us to do more work than we could handle due to the fact we were under staffed. The co-workers were great. This job would have been better if we had more staff workers on our team. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks which were packed to the ceiling with freight and having to sweat the whole shift for the little pay we got.
bad,"Extreme lack of morals"
bad,"management was horrible, co workers were horrible there wasn't anything good about that job at all."
bad,I liked my job but the managers made it very hard to be comfortable. 
bad,"Management definitely not great, knew very few co-workers way to many gossipers, this basically was a job to pay the bills while in school."
bad,"Assistant Manager responsible for daily store operations. Resolved advanced customer service issues. Managed seven different departments within the store. Included cashiers, service workers and hourly management. Provided effective leadership and met daily challenges in order to be successful in all endeavors within the company."
bad,its fun management work with you co workers are really nice i dont have and hard part about the job but the best thing about work is helping the customers.
bad,"I will never work here again nor do I recommend it to anyone, long hours and sometimes they forget your much needed breaks. All in all a bad experience"
bad,"Assist in the unloading of freight. Replenish products on shelves, inventory control, Assist in the training of new employees, Pick and Bin overstock product, Customer assistance in routine store activities. Order processing and maintenance for the Pet department, Maintain receiving hand count for the entire store. Use forklift to load pallets for weekly pallet pickup. Customer returns completion, new freight and old freight completion, Help maintain overall store appearance, Front the products on the shelves."
bad,"Poor treatment by management. You were not treated as a human being. Employees are constantly worried about saying or doing the wrong thing and possibly being firfed. The attitude towards employees is, we can always find someone to replace you."
bad,"Working for Walmart is a job but to be honest they could care less about their employees. When i worked there, I was the Dept. manager for Electronics. People were stealing dvd's, cd's and high dollar tv's on overnight shifts. I ask for a few changes to stop this from happening and was told NO. So in the end I guess I rocked the boat a little to much. But loved all my customers and co-workers they were great."
bad,"a typical work day at wal mart check cashing, cash handling, money transfer, accepting bill payment from customers, money orders money transfers, customer service returns/exchanges, keep area clean and organize I learned that the pen like red and blue marks are marks to show money authenticity, the management team is a"
bad,Managers were well informed and very demanding of their employees
bad,stocked merchandise
bad,"At first, I thought this was going to be a really down-to-earth job because it appeared that way at first. Once you start working there longer, the company reveals it's true side. The Wasilla, AK location is such a horrible place to work. I worked from 10pm to 7am night shift.The workers, specifically the women, were very flirtatious with the associates and the managers. I think they were like that because in all honesty, the accepted it instead of maintaining professionalism. Another thing I realized is they would rather have 5 people work the whole store, clean the whole store, take both our 15 minute breaks, take our 1 hour lunch, door greet, and assist customers (because it is a 24/7 store) yet want us to take less than 2 hours to complete our work. They were basically slave drivers."
bad,"Management was very rude to their associates, not following break or leave of absence policies."
bad,"There are some hard working employees working here, other than that I have nothing positive to say about my time at this company. There are two documentaries about the company and they tell it best."
bad,I didnt like it there because of some of the coworkers would boss me around and make fun of me.
bad,What do you expect? They don't care about you and it makes it hard to care about them.
bad,"I have been at Wal Mart for a total of 15 years. I have seen many changes, most for the worst. I am ready for a new career change, not in retail if possible."
bad,Most days are pretty routine. The system assigns the associates a specific register to maintain and operate. Lunches and breaks are distributed via computerized systems.
bad,The management could never figure out what was going on for any particular day. They were so poorly organized.
bad,really enjoyed fast pase at autoliv got along with everyone it was agreat place to work
bad,The Management at wal-mart is awful to say the least. They treat the employees as if they're irrelevant. Unfair scheduling.
bad,"I was treated poorly by most of the managers, they all had there favorites."
bad,"I liked my job but wasnt thrilled at some of the tough procedures and nit picky details that went along with working for a corporate optical. Many managers came and went knew nothing about optical and helping people seee only about numbers and paperwork, def not my favorite, the hardest part was never ending printing reports and doing other things there besides optical work, coworkers werent very interested in learning the craft, best part was the optician teaching me more and more."
bad,Great coworkers. Management is terrible. Things are always changing. The hardest part of the job was it seemed like there were too many chiefs and not enough indians. The company is always trying to cut back hours.
bad,"Management doesn't care about their employees at all!!! Probably the WORST place to work!!! They fired me for being in the hospital for a week, because they refused to give me medical leave so they fired me for absences."
bad,You work for low pay but decent coworkers attendence policy sucks no chance to succede with it and your set up to fail.
bad,1 i was working full time there
bad,"They treat their employees terribly, in one experience i had at walmart they told an employee who was having an athsma attack that very mment that if she went home shed be fired. The employee left to deal with her athsma and as promised walmart fired her."
bad,"I was hired on as a Door greeter at the age of 23 and took the challenge and mastered it very quickly. Upon my 4th month I thought it was time to upgrade to a better position that I knew my capability was up to standards to handle. But they always turned me down and put me back to the door. And after a while I begin to feel like it was, thats all my managers thought I was good for. However with a considerate mind I knew they loved how great I was at what I did as far as customer service and knew I was the strongest amungst the rest of the elderly door greeters so I knew thats why they wanted me to stay. I accepted that. But I didnt accept that if they knew I was great why wouldnt they move me to another position with better pay. ahhhh haa then I get it. It was all about money not the value of who I was as a person and what my capabilitys were. I would never wanna work for walmart a day again in my life."
bad,It was an interesting job. Work schedule changed all the time though.
bad,There was never enough staff. I learned how to run the department alone. I also learned how to work in more than one department. The management didn't care what employees did nor if work got done.
bad,"I through i would b at walmart until I retired but when my mom got sick my new store manager would not let me transfer but let another assistant go to sams right down the road . I had to be near my mom I was a hour away from home working.I was told I needed to either be a assistant manager or go take care of my mom, so I left."
bad,"(Wal-Mart) started off great!! But over the years things have gotten worst. A lot of managers left ,we have less help and a lot more stress. This Journey has made me cherish the smallest things and motivates me to do better. I love each and everyone of my co-workers. The hardest park of my job is dealing with unprofessional managers. The most enjoyable part is helping customers and my co-workers and knowing everything will workout in our favor."
bad,The management was more concerned about their personal lives outside of work rather than what needed to be done at the store.
bad,Management was more concerned about what was going on in their personal lives versus what was needed to be done at the store.
bad,"Never liked working in retail. This was my first job, this is where I started to learn my customer service skills"
bad,"The things they tell you in orientation all lies. Almost got killed here several times, their profits all Wal-Mart's cares for, no open door policy either......go somewhere else, save the heart ache. A new hire lost her hand on first day."
bad,I liked cashiering until they wanted to change everything and make it harder then it had to be
bad,Cashier
bad,"Though retail is an high stress this particular location is very unorganized. The managment is not on the same page, the work you do is that of what two or more should be doing , and they do not staff the people according to the peaks in the frieght or customers."
bad,You stand on your feet anywhere from 4 hours to 8 hours.
bad,"I worked with Walmart for 3 years, in that time I have seen alot of unfair and unjust things occur."
bad,Wal-mart is the worse company to work for they are very slow at helping the customers and they do not care about their workers. they only good part about working there was the people i got to work with.
bad,with the revenue wal mart brings in they should really consider paying employees a little bit more money
bad,"The supervisors switch around (front end to grocery, grocery to 3rd shift, etc) so much that I never knew who to go to if/when I had a problem."
bad,boring just very boring and management sucks did i mention its also boring
bad,Low pay and low benefitis for extensive work. No opportunities to progress or learn your skill.
bad,"Would never recommend working here. No regard for home life, no room for advancement. Long hours, and low pay make this the worst job I've ever worked."
bad,the mangement didnt care if u didnt feel good. and coprate was not handling my problem right.
bad,"Wal-Mart workers are incredily lazy, and the manangers are just as bad. Things never get done, and people constantly complain to them about it."
bad,A typical day at work would be finding stuff where it should not be all around the store.
bad,"it was an okay job very productive place.it was a good expierence, alot of job oppurtunties."
bad,"It's ok. Overall it's an okay company. I believe that the workers should get paid more, because you find yourself doing everything in the store. I think the mission of walmart is great; however, it needs to be followed through."
bad,management was very inorganized and made it harder for employees.was hard to promote
bad,"Although I was thankful to have had a job when hired by Wal-Mart, it is a very unprofessional environment to work in; theres is no training. You are sat in front of a computer towatch module, once finished I received no shadowing of anyone experienced to get hands on training. Hours are cut without notice. No customer service training is given to associates. Associate interact with customer with no regard to how service is being practiced. The management are very unprofessional, they only show work ethics when corporate come to visit and even some of the corporate individual are rude. Wal-Mart do not value there associates. I would recommend no one the fustration of working at wal-mart."
bad,We always had issues with shoplifters. We had to stock shoes. changing price of shoes daily was hard to keep up.
bad,Management doesn't know how to talk to their employees. I enjoyed helping the customers.
bad,I go in and start to put pallets out on the floor to get ready to stock shelfs.I learnd alot of customer service to help the customers.My coworkers were very helpful too.The hardest part of the job was to unload the trucks. The best part to help people.
bad,Walmart work people too hard and pay less money. I was making 7.30 As a department manager. I had to constantly request to step down from a manager.
bad,"the managers treat you bad, its really hard work for not enough money, and they never give you enough hours"
bad,not much pay but some stores will work with you so can go to school just maters on which boss you get
bad,The Day Could Be Fine Busy as Normal. Everyone Could Be Constructive And Then Comes Along The managers Cause They are Having a Terrible Day They Want To take It Out On all associates. The Job Is easy And Fun The Hardest thing Is dealing with The Managers.
bad,I was holiday help so i wasnt there long. I was real busy and i worked late hours.
bad,"I do not enjoy my job at Walmart, hence why I am seeking better employment."
bad,awful worst job imaginable learned nothing highly unorganized management was a waste of space co workers were nice hardest part was going to work best part was leaving and breaks
bad,the csms had to be registered trained. a cashier shouldnt have to train their supervisors
bad,"My type of work day would include working as a team member to finish a project or setup a display. I like to keep busy and when the job is done, I find something else to do."
bad,worst job ever! the management kept getting me mixed up with another employee even though i had been there for over a year!
bad,"I have nothing good to say about Wal*Mart. The managers can't make decisions, the associates are lazy, the customer's are nasty, the benefits are horrible, the ""my share"" bonus is a joke and the schedule is terrible. The only good thing I can say is....""Thank god I'm no longer there !!"""
bad,people didnt work as a team
bad,55+ HOURS PER WEEK. The people were fun to work with though!
bad,Wal-Mart will destroy you.
bad,I have heard management tell associates to put pallets of perishables/consumables outside on the patio. I have seen birds walk on the boxes of pasta & crackers...etc. I've seen management wipe bird droppings off a can on tuna. I've seen mice and rats come out of bags of dog food. Putting these items outside in the elements is a HUGE no-no !! Yet continues to be done.
bad,"I applied for a position, that was a promotion. About 2 months after I was offered & accepted this position, they changed it & added more areas for me to oversee. I NOW have 4 times the amount of work then the original position required. I tried to do this extra work, but shortly realized it was too much for me. I went to the store manager & asked if I could step down, explaining this position was more then I could handle. She said ok. Of course as I should of expected....they dragged me along...""We'll get back to you"" ""I'm working on it"". Excuse after excuse as to why they weren't moving me as quickly as I hoped. Three months later, they fire me for not doing my job, after I asked them if I could step down. I explained to her I made her aware that this job was too much for me & she said I could step down..now they're firing me !!?? She said she will not change her decision. It took many, many phone calls to the market manager, who by the way...said the same thing ""I'll get back to you"" over & over. After many calls & letters, they took me back at a position I can handle. So to sum this up....management lies. Its easier for them to ignore you & your concerns then deal with it. I was fired because management didn't want to deal with my request !!"
bad,"They say misery loves company. After reading some other reviews, it seems MY Wal Mart isn't the only one with poor management & low moral. The associates are VERY stressed, management pushes & pushes them until they can't take it anymore and end up crying. Hours are cut with the exspectations of getting all the work done. Full timers are getting 30 hours one week, 40 the next. It makes it very difficult to budget. Sometimes the part timers don't get any hours at all & when they go to management they're told ""oh well, I can't give you hours"". Its a sad sad company."
bad,My job was ringing up customers. Hours were great at first but after first of year I was spending more in gas than hours I was working a week. Got along with co-workers and enjoyed meeting new people.. Was unemployed before I got this job so it was better than nothing at all until the drive got to be too much and the hours were cut.
bad,"I have been working as a cashier since 2003. I have seen CSM's come and go. When I started, they were hard workers, made sure we got our breaks and meals. Came to our register to solve any & all problems. Now, not so much. They stand at the podium ALL day and talk. They are so concerned about who likes them & who doesn't they fail to take care of us. They gossip, tell cashiers who was short, who got written up & worse yet.....who was coached !!!"
bad,I assisted customers with any of their needs or questions. I also ran the cash register. Management at this job was terrible. This is why I only gave it one star.
bad,Fast and fun.
bad,Only working part-time hours with full-time pay for only working 3 days a week
bad,"In my store it seems the associates including management are more concered about gossiping and spreading rumors then performing their actual job. If you got to the personell manager about something private...she tells the people in her ""click"", who in-turn tell someone else & so on & so on. Within days everyone knows your business. Same goes for management.....go to them with a problem or concern & as soon as you turn your back, they're trashing you and telling what you had just confided in them with. So, in a nut shell...if you do decide to work at Wal Mart....keep to yourself, don't trust anyone, don't tell anyone anything and keep quiet !!"
bad,I have been assistant manager for Wal Mart for 8 years. We are supposed to have a rotating schedule...what a joke !!
bad,"Unfortunately I have not one good thing to say about Wal-Mart. Poor management, sad and depressing place to work."
bad,NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK EVER. low pay and unappreciated. There is nothing good to say about working for this company.
bad,"Try to avoid it, the managers liked to play favorites and treat the employees badly and unfair"
bad,"If you are a brown noser....you'll go far. If you suck up...not only will you get promotions, but you won't get coached. While other associates that work harder and don't suck up or brown nose will go no-where, get coached and given more assignments. Management contributes to the gossip and rumors throughout the store. The personnell manager will discuss your pay or personal information with other associates. Store manager was more interested in who will go on a cigarette break with her then how her store is running. More assistant managers have quit in this store in the past year then any other store. And if you don't text the store manager with daily gossip or tattleing....she gets p.o.'d at you. I NEVER worked in a store where the store manager wanted everyone to rat everone else out. And if you didn't run to her with gossip, you were not liked & she would make your day miserable. Not a friendly work environment."
bad,Not a good place to work in any way. Every store understaffed with low wages and poor service.
bad,"It was ok, I meet some pretty nice people. Had to deal with angry customers sometimes. I had to ask questions if I didn't understand something and sometimes it would take at least 15-20min for them to get to me..."
bad,Walmart downtown long beach was not the best company to work for and I wouldn't advise people to work there.
bad,"I'm embaressed to say I work there. There are so many bad things I put up with because I need a job. They abuse their associates. They certainely are not as customer friendly as they want you to believe. I have been coached for something I wasn't aware of. Management has their favorites & if you are NOT a favorite, they make sure you know it !! Poor benefits, low pay, not enough hours. Not enough help. They will push & push you until you can't take it anymore. The Walton family should be ashamed."
bad,Not enough money...high benefits..no advancement...waste of time
bad,"None of the managers know what they're doing. They give you directions then 1/2 way through they change their minds and you have to start over. Market manager is included. They are heartless. Will not approve days off if they don't like you. Over-ride your availability, then coach you if you can't work your scheduled hours !!! Loss Prevention associate's lie."
bad,This is not a place I would recommend anyone to work. It is poorly managed. There was never enough cashiers or floor help. The shelfs were barely stocked. Management has no respect for their employees.
bad,"The management and associates are rude. And don’t care about anyone or anything. No room to Advance. Associates lie and get you fired, just because they don’t like you. And managers let them."
bad,"At my store, is a slave factory, understaffed, holiday pay is only only black friday and form of 15% off card."
bad,Management lack sooo much they never respect your hours you also gotta stay quiet don't even bother talking with people they are sensitive and with that you could get in trouble i had discrimination co worker of mine managers didn't do anything they lack too much sitting down talking or just on the phones Biggest tip i can give you its that on the application schedule put your real hour's because manager are lazy to take care your new schedule one of my biggest thing was that i am disabled guy on my back can't stand up too much and manager They didn't care at all i had to constantly bother them because to lower my hours but they never did Also if you plan to work at Walmart please don't speak to anyone about you they can be sensitive people because they gossip too much please be careful just do your work
bad,"I loved everything about this job, but the company doesn’t show enough appreciation towards its employees. Walmart is one of those, quit today have a replacement tomorrow kind of employers and I hated that part. And it is by far the hardest physical job I have ever done."
bad,Horrible management experience. Only cared for themselves and complained ALL the time. Did not care for the Online Grocery Pickup area and put everything and anything in our area. Very annoying.
bad,"This is a horrible place to work, I would never recommend this job to anyone. The benefits are great and the pay is wonderful but they use this as an excuse to treat you like dirt. They yell at you for minor accidents and wrote you up if you get injured on the job."
bad,"They harrassed me for 4 months on nothing that had to do with my job! I liked Walmart tho! I was a great worker 😔💯.. Managment had me doing everything from stocking to door watching. But harrassed me about personal issues,my whole time there!😔"
bad,"I worked for Walmart for years. If you just need a part time job or are going to school it's a good start. It's hard to make a career of Walmart because everyone (including management) are worried about their own jobs. We never have enough help and the customers and managers take it out on us, who have no control over the schedules or hiring."
bad,"Buena empresa para desarrollarte por primera vez en el ambito laboral, y con estudios basicos como secundaria o preparatoria. Son salarios muy bajos y horario de tiempo completo 9 horas ya q incluye tu hora de comida. Es trabajo estable. Yo trabaje 3-años el ultimo ya fue un desastre porque estudiaba tambien, me terminaron corriendo porque llegaba tarde."
bad,"Meet new people everyday, making friends, and responsible for front-end cashier and all returns.Managers are friendly, if your a fast learner you get promoted."
bad,"Mngmnt in OGP had ppl do their jobs for them. Refused to do it one day, was told I could either do it or leave. "
bad,"I was able to work in multiple departments to include: infants, girls, boys, men’s, and lady’s. Infants had some stocking of shelving items, along with car seats and other baby related things for sleep and play. Areas often flooded and needed clean up."
bad,"I loved working for Walmart. I had many friends that were great co-workers while I worked there. I also had great bosses, very attentive. I realize that it was a great temporary job and learned a lot while I was there about retail and how important our community could be. I realize it was a great job overall."
bad,I loved working at Walmart I kept my area clean and greet customers with a smile I had fun working and conversating with customers . Had to also ask customers would they like to apply for a Walmart credit card certain questions we had to ask sometimes .
bad,"In my opinion A Job Is A Job."
bad,Was a good place at first been there for awhile now and have seen alot.2nd shift has had 3 different managers. The mangers dont care about you at all they just care about the number of trailers they can get unloaded. There is a  10 person crew they expect them to do the work of the other 2 shifts with around 20 to 30 people on the shift. One manager is gone all the time and leaves when ever he wants and comes back when ever he wants. It can be 30min before end of shift and they will open a floor load that takes forever to do. Most people dont leave on time are at work till 3 or 4 am. The pay and benefits are great but upper management is clueless to what is going on you can tell them but nothing happens. Alot of people quit just after a few weeks because of the stress. After talking to a few yard drivers the equipment is junk and falling appart. Thet will not fix the major problems with them.  They just let them go and get worse. The people that work hard get flack all the time the ones that dont just get away with it. One yard driver backs in the trailers so hard he brakes stuff all the time and gets away with it. If you dont make nice with people in a certain group then you are shunned and no one in that group will talk to you or help you. If management wasnt so concerned with hitting numbers and actually helping us succeed it would be better place to work. I did love this job but now have been thinking about leaving
bad,"As with most chain retail jobs, it isnt the best.  My store, if it was an isolated case, wasn't the best.  We had issues, inconsistently, with keeping managers on duty.  They are willing to work with you if there are issues, but you have to have PTO.  In the hospital? Doesn't matter.  Injured from an accident yesterday, doesn't matter. Management was about as useful as a potato when we need help on the floor.  Something about policy forbidding them from helping on the floor.  Everyone got along and did what needed to be done.  That is all that was positive about work their"
bad,I went from working 30 hours or more a week to working just the weekends it is a good company until they start cutting your house without telling you .
bad,I enjoyed working. I got to interact with the customers and make their day. I've always wanted to go to a position that let me work with customers. I got good saying about me almost everyday. I always worked hard to move up but management would work with me. I've had to argue with them for three months about the position they kept having me go of because of my allergies.
bad,"A typical day is always getting myself ready for the tasks, working fast so as to complete my job before the end of the day. The management is very poor. The hardest part of this job is when there are not enough associates to help with the job and you're left alone to do the tasks. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I'm the department manager, and i take the responsiblity for whatever happens so I make sure my job is well done before leaving for the day."
bad,Walmart use to be a place that workers loved to come to and work as hard as they could to make the company look good. Walmart use to be for the associates and the customers that provided a hards day work for the company. Things have changed.
bad,you have to do so much for decent pay and they do not respect your feelings if you get hurt they will fire you they do not care if you die at work they will not care they can replace you
bad,All depends on management team of the store the way the store is run and how associates are treated they have there good and bads like any other company they need more hours to work with so customers can be taken care of
bad,I didn't feel like I was listened too a lot of the time. I felt like management didn't want to work with. I felt that my voice wasn't important to upper management.
bad,"Walmart does batteries, light bulbs, tires, oil changes and chassis lubrication. The Walmart automotive care center manager and supervisors are great."
bad,I enjoyed working with my friends but the management was unbearable just about. We had a few great managers who came through our doors that we enjoyed one of whom unfortunatly passed away. I did have a flexible schedule and enjoyed any hours that I worked but I did feel like management was trying to make me quit my job. I had them yelling at me for little things like when I was a cart pusher I had them get onto me for one cart in the lot that was just put there.
bad,You couldn't say or do anything without management getting on your case about it getting you called to the office or pulled to the side. You couldn't laugh or have any type of fun at your job without getting accused of not doing your job.
bad,"When I first started, it was a great company to work for. They treated you fair, took care of you, and left you happy. But as the years progressed, it all went down hill. They started cutting benefits, pushing you for more and more work. They have started firing people for foolish reasons. Treat you like garbage. Honestly its gotten to point where you fear if this is going to be the last week there. The only thing left is the pay, and even that is getting harder and harder to justify."
bad,Bad customer service... unsafe work environment( one of the custodians using ammonia with bleach )  Stores are built too fast multiple holes in roof. smoke room in break room
bad,I think that it was just the store that I was at because they did not hire people for the right reason I  saw them promote a guy who did not have any experiacne at all
bad,"i loved walmart, great place to start off, good pay, give you enough hours always busy makes time go by fast. everyone is friendly, great management. good thing we get discounts"
bad,It ok for rite now your work load is very heavy one person do a job that three people is needed for you work long hours not a good place to work if u have little kids
bad,The management is horrible you ask something they say they will take care of it for you and the never do and when you are in your department have freight or something your manager told you to do it most likely won't get done sometimes bevause they pull people from their department to go on register to help with the lines and when they do pull you it's either few minutes or the rest of your shift and then the associates get in trouble for their work not being complete and have time limits for department managers to get things done
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart was ok. Upper Management was horrible they would talk down to you, yell at you on the floor. They would want you to do a job that would take 10 hours or more of work in 8 hours. You would get in trouble for working overtime even when asked. There was favoritism to where certain employees would be able to do what they wanted miss as much work as they wanted."
bad,"Ring up merchandise for customers and take payment"
bad,"I personally didn't enjoy working here. Cashiering is mostly just standing there and I'm not a fan. My hours kept getting cut, and my first paycheck got lost."
bad,"Typical work day consist of cash handling , sales, giving great customer service to the customers. great managers helpful co-workers , great benefits and stock."
bad,its a good company to grow as management someone who likes working in retail stores and merchandising. Using your mind creating end caps in merchandising but as well showing great customer service with the company! Never forget Save money and live better Walmart :)
bad,The management is not up to key! They don't see eye to eye and are NEVER on the same page. It's a great work experience and good people just needs some fixings
bad,It is not family oranted like it used to be so many things have changed the other co-workers were nice and good to work with but it was not easy and it was very fast speed and you couldn't do anything but work
bad,"short breaks and scheduled for overtime quite frequently even when you are under 18 and only allowed to work 20 hours they keep you till 10 or later sometimes on a school night otherwise if you are looking for a steady job around 8 or 9$ an hour and are okay with sitting for the first week doing computer ""tests"" than its an okay job"
bad,Typical day at work was a productive day. Learned many new things about shoplifters. Management was great. Hardest of the job was not being able to handcuff suspects. Most enjoyable part of the job was having a productive day.
bad,"Okay place, management sucks. Rude and the have there favorites. overall wouldn't work there again, Place is okay despite the managnent"
bad,"Great pay, mostly great people to work with. As long as your not applying for 1st weekends shipping then it's a great place to work.  Their managers are to conflicting and each one will tell you something different. Then will try and write you up if you dont do what one says but does what the other says."
bad,"A typical day consisted of me clocking in and being assigned to a register. I then rang countless customers most days. My co-workers and managers were really friendly there and they made work enjoyable most days. The hardest part about this job was dealing with the customers. it was way more customer interaction than I was used to and a lot of those customers were very rude and impatient. The most enjoyable part was just getting to meet new people and learning the work environments that I do and don't like. Overall, I learned that I don't like that much interaction with that many people."
bad,"I loved working with the co-workers. I loved the fast-paced environment. "
bad,"A typical day at the job was tough. Although, I could handle it, I wanted to further my education, and it wasn't allowed at this particular Wal-Mart at least not in the setting."
bad,"I enjoyed working  for Walmart  being  a  cashier in   working in the meat  department , in  expanding  my  brain  all  over  the  store nice co  workers,  and  good  management were  I was working"
bad,This was my first job ever. I loved it because I didn't know any better. They gave me the experience to better my self by finding better jobs. I thank you Wal-mart.
bad,working at Walmart at times could become very stressful . I did not like working there by the end. never got the help I needed. The management team there had lots of favoritism for a few selected people. would bend the rules for them always but  would wright people up in a heart beat for the same thing. aloud thing to happen that never should. but the people were ok a few of them were. that's what made it fun. good benefits just bad politics. well at least at the store I worked at number 1034 in north Carolina. If you want a job you will love Walmart is not it. well at least not for me it was not. Management would go to parties with coworkers like sexy ones. bring in sexy cakes and all kinds of crazy things like that. scream at people on the sale floor and in front of customers. it was crazy. did not care for it at all. that's why I left. Walmart talks a big game but when it comes down to it they suck big time. if you don't get in the right store with the people that do like they should don't bother. because you are going to hate it. but if you do get in one with the right people you just might like it but for me and were I work I hated being there. and to this day I hate walmart with a burning passion.
bad,"I have learned a lot at my jobs, and they've giving me a lot. A typical day work is coming in getting the task for day and getting it done as soon as possible. I enjoy my jobs just need a better why to make in come."
bad,I did like working for them at first but after a while things get worse. They cut hours and have some crazy demands. Management doesn't seem to care on most occasions.
bad,"I was responsible for finishing my go backs,my claims, and hazmats during my shift everyday. I learned how to communicate better with people/customers. Management was organized and helpful. My co-workers were very helpful with my tasks and made my job very enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was the hazmat ,because it was a messy process and sometimes difficult. What I enjoyed most was accomplishing my tasks at hand and learning new things."
bad,Co-workers make the task of dealing with Wal-mart's terrible ways bearable. Jobs are not hard but are made so due to overbearing and counterproductive measures taken by Upper management.
bad,"Typical day for me is printing reports, managing over 50 associates with a task for remainder of shift.I learned great customer service and team work from walmart.Management at walmart has communication problems. I love most of my co-workers because we know how to work as ateam and share materials when needed. The hardest part of my job is not geeting my orders approved by managment on time and having to write up my associates for poor work behavior.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to smile and assist customers with the help they need."
bad,"I started as a cashier. My training was not normal: I was being trained by at least six different people when it was supposed to be one person training me. Because of that, I wasn't doing as well as I could have been. "
bad,"This is about the mp orderfiller position specifically.  I hve several issues here: first, I was told I might have ""some"" overtime on ""occasion"". Reality, 10 hr days ranged from 12-15 frequently. So our 3 day weekend became 2 as 8hrs of sleep would take you to 2-3pm on sat. So I also didnt get the time off with my family that I was told I would. Second, each order is timed, another thing I wasnt told at my interview. I can do the work but because of a.s. I cannot do it at a breakneck pace. Third, training was a joke and outdated for forklifts. I would see forklift drivers driving with forks 18-24 inches off the ground at times. Lastly, safe practices were nearly non-existing.  A fruit dropped on a guys head from top racking (about 20+ feet) no big deal, a container of ice cream fell and knocked a girl out, hospitalized,  and they still have an ""accident free"" workplace? I would never recommend this job for anyone. Stay away from distribution centers. The stores on the other hand....that's just retail."
bad,"a typical day at work was always fast past "
bad,"Era uma empresa boa de se trabalhar porem as pessoas que trabalhavam la , fazia com que o clima de trabalho se tornasse ruim e o salario não era muito bom nem mesmo com hora extra."
bad,Typical day at work would be to make sure frozen and dairy was stocked. I was frozen and dairy manager.  Learned how to order make tags and be in charge of people.  Management was not the best they did not do anything.  Co workers were ok. Hardest part of the job was having people tell you to do something that I knew wasn't the best way.  I enjoyed helping the customers.
bad,a typical day at work is always a learning experience with employees as well as customers. the most enjoyable part of the day is walking away knowing I created a satisfied customer. my co workers are enjoyable people to be around.
bad,"•	Issued receipts, refunds, credits, and change due to customers."
bad,I worked a fast steady pace. I learned how to better my customer service and how to deal wit different types of people 
bad,"great job, good people, flexible schedule and comfortable environment I learned how to do almost every job from customer service to shipping and receiving stockingand monitor others in training to oversee them in the position they were hired for within the store"
bad,"walmart was a good place to work for, but i feel my concerns and complaints were not taken serious"
bad,"The best things about this job are the fast paced environment, my customers who know me by name, and my coworkers. Management however was awful. They were not helpful or in anyway a positive influence on the employees. I really loved getting to know the customers on a personal level and have made lifelong friends among mycoworkers."
bad,"If you've ever worked at Walmart you know they put all their attention on the customers and 0% on the employees. Theres hardly any room for advancement if you can bear to work there long enough the benefits are awesome. Awesome job security they have enough money to keep you working there, but like I said.. they don't have too many values with employees"
bad,"A typical day at work in the Domestics Department involved straightening the department, folding towels and shower curtains, rugs, finding things that didn't belong in the department and taking them to the Customer Service desk. I enjoyed having the whole department to myself and working at my own pace."
bad,Empresa com grande possibilidade de crescimento .E bem competitiva.
bad,Managers has picks. You better be ready to work. Its really underpay. I HATE IT. Soon as i find something else im gone. The hours are long. Ive had 2 palkets to fall on me now i have bruises.
bad,"Management frequently caused numerous day to day problems like constant scheduling errors, lack of communication, and terrible treatment of employees."
bad,I loved it starting out like so much but then they started changing up on how they won’t work with me with my daughter they cut my hours management is hard to get ahold of like they just need to fix some thing
bad,"Took many hours and never gave me the shifts I needed and was able to work , took money from my checks and wouldn’t let me stay on 3rd but let others stay that didn’t STOCK"
bad,Maybe other walmarts are better but the management at sachse walmart is horrible. They expect so much from their associates but they never help with the on going issues. It is ridiculous. Most teams aren't staffed enough to get the work done. I wouldn't want to work here again or atleast at this location.
bad,"I Love it,The best place to work if you like being in the middle of drama ,today’s fast-paced atmosphere ,Management is fair with scheduling and training also listening if you have any complaints"
bad,Management & environment and the way the company handles and treat their employees could be better in order to want the employees excited about coming to work. Always understaffed and wanted you to do more work then you could handle in an 8hr period so unfair to an individual. They don’t value their employees they treat them like salves
bad,"The job is great but management is horrible! They play favorites really bad. It doesnt matter if you work hard, as long as you kiss up they let you do whatever you want. Some of the worst employees have all the benefits and literally get to stand around half the night doing absolutely nothing or just standing at the desks talking to manegement half the night while still making production??? Management also pads assignments for these employees to make production despite no work put in! They also get the easy work and assignments. They need a mass makeover of management employee relations."
bad,"Good place to work but managment is terrible, especially on CAP 2 team where if you try to take paid vacation time off you ain't getting it, it'll get automatically rejected. Management will pretty much write you up if the truck isn't unloaded within 2 hours, overall I don't recommend anyone work for them."
bad,Managers need leadership training and to be held accountable for daily failures and the accountability for equipment is HORRIBLE Walmart loses more money on lost and stolen equipment from management alone
bad,"I learn alot from walmart. It thought me how to speak to people, cook better. I learn something new everyday. I know about hardware. Sports and even cars"
bad,"They don't have good management, break, and attendance policies."
bad,"The most enjoyable time was working with the customers and for the customers. I loved going anoube and beyond for the customers. If I couldn’t help my customer I would call other Walmart’s even Walmart.com to figure out what I could do"
bad,"Employee morale was always low, but job advancement is practically guaranteed after a year there. Pay isn’t great, even for managers. They gave fulltime hours for stockers, but hire a million cashiers, so they don’t get fulltime benefits. Discipline is laughable and almost nonexistent. 2/10 - good enough for a paycheck, but not much else."
bad,"Wal-Mart has very poor management, but are very fun to work for. I would not like to move up within the company because of how you are treated here. I enjoy talking with customers and always fulfilling their needs. I also love to be a great leader to my associates and hope one day to be working and moving up in a company I love."
bad,"They need to hire more people. Always understaffed."
bad,"I just had to hit the minimum amount of characters to move on from this step. I hope everyone’s day is going perfectly! Always remember it could be worse, maybe not, I don’t really know what you’re going through."
bad,"When I had the interview at WalMart I was told by the hiring manager that I would be hired full-time and I would be given an endless amount of hours and that is why I accepted the job. I had like a week of full-time hours and after that I got cut down to working three days a week for like 4-5 hours. Not to mention the staff was horrible. As far as the CSM's they were lazy and they made us cashiers scared to ask for their help when there was a problem. Most of the time when a problem occurred, they were no where to be found which slowed us down tremendously. I would not recommend this job to anybody. They are so unprofessional and they do not work as a team at all."
bad,It was a great place to work with at the beginning. Lately it has gotten out of control. I used to be working over 30 hours a week. Now I am only getting 19 or 20 hours and I am now considered a full-time associate.
bad,I lovely working for Walmart because they pay good and I like there job and I hope I stare work for them soon and I pray they call me I need a job plz call me soon
bad,"Maintenance is a not a great job to especially during the weekends, and holidays. It does teach a lot about safety, how to maintain a clean work environment, and how to follow OSHA's standards. However, depending on where and what location though the job can be more of title than a position."
bad,Gostaria muito de uma oportunidade de emprego pois estou precisando muito .para tbem mostrar meu esforço e desempenho
bad,i was able to learn quickly multitask complete a project do my very best at what i have to do speak to everyone keep a smile on my face through the day
bad,Very diverse environment.  Many cultures for all over . Family oriented atmosphere among employees. Great job opportunities for advancement.  Best training ever. Good pay and compensation.
bad,people were not so nice you had to be in click and they would talk too you if you were not in the click they didn't talk to you very fast pase work wasn't to hard
bad,"Management only cares about themselves and dont care about their employees. Took away the raise increaes. "
bad,he prics have gotten way to high. I can buy cheaper clothing in the mall then I can in Wal-mart. They need more security in the stores. Need more sales associates. Better incentives for managment team.
bad,"Decent pay, bad benefits, little to no job security. Schedules are always at random, you work almost every holiday for little pay and no over time. If your not a full time employee, after Christmas is when things get hard. The company cuts hours down to around 15 hours per week for part timers. It's very hard to pay your bills with that, even at the pay rate most of us are at."
bad,You never get breaks and they are always asking to work over and cut the time later. Management never has your back they are always bending over backwards to make the customer happy ever if it makes you look stupid.
bad,"Walm art c'est un bon  store que g,ai aimer beaucoup travaille' surtout pour le changement de schedule ils sont plus flexible mais just le problem des heures"
bad,i enjoyed working there till they decided to become an academy. the academy doesnt do anything for us associates but make us more stressed it only does stuff for the managers. they punish you for attendance. i was in the hospital and they still put occurences on me. you would think they would let it go. i had to leave the job on good terms and they will not take me back due to my attendance when things COME UP
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart Neighborhood Market Division, but after awhile with taunts from new management night shift felt our jobs weren't secure. I was a hard worker and to feel that at any moment because of bad and petty management techniques that we would be possibly let go wasn't conducive to a positive work environment. I got out of there. I was looking for a job that i could grow with for years to come and this company was not it."
bad,"Terrible place to work, i worked at three locations.... just, no. Save yourself some frustration and keep it moving, don't bother with this sh***y company."
bad,"Very nice, easy to employer to work with, nice  and enjoyed my job.  Learned to work the register and deal with a lot of different people as far as co workers and customers."
bad,"Excelente empresa para aprender"
bad,The deli manager has no idea what he is doing and has no experience doing a scheduale which is the reason I utimitally quit. I was hired as a part time employee and was force to work 40 hour a week and for 10-12 days in a row. When I asked for the schedualing problems to be fixed I was told I would have to just deal with it. I am a mother of 6 children and can not work these kinds of hours and for so many days at a time.
bad,"Just Busy place. something management would pushed out other times its like they not there, But working was a good experince and give you a chance to grow"
bad,"Busy, consistent,  always alot of customers,  job security ans great bosses to work for. Slightly separate from the other employees the pharmacy is a different schedule"
bad,I can say only thing I can honestly say was good about this job is if needed the time off with a doctors note that they will hold your position. other then that I can say the management was bad they don't support their employees and its not the best place nothing is how its suppose to be. the hardest part aboutnthe job was getting someone to listen to you. The most enjoyable apart was going on leave and coming back to a job andit had good hours.
bad,"It was really cool to work there , sometimes there was favoritism but overall there was good times. Not much on arguing between coworkers everyone was understandable"
bad,Thank you it was a very great company to work for. Very long hours and the pay was decent. Please continue to help keep loyal customers and always stay open
bad,"I only worked at Walmart for a short time. They said I'd be working a certain shift, but three days in I found out there was mandatory weekend overtime on a different shift. They basically lied to me to get me in the door. Everyone I spoke to hated it! My trainer said they work them to death. They increase pay quickly so you feel stuck. Work is hard but not ubearable. Beware!!!!"
bad,This company has and follows very strict procedures to ensure consistent service. The management was very profession but lacked a human element when regarding employees.
bad,Walmart is one of the best company ever to achieve more experience and also make their workers more valuable. while working at Walmart I learned many things like how to deal with your respective customers and how to serve them.
bad,No a good job. It's was fun fast paste. That's all it has. It seems like no one cares about the employees. It also seems like no one cares about their job. This is a while ago. I'm sure things are different now.
bad,it was easy cash for me because I had just finished high school my first real job nothing much else to say about it don't expect to much
bad,"i liked working at walmart everyday that i do come in to work. The only thing i dont like about walmart is that they tend to over work their employees. The management team is so unprofessional. They lack good communcation with their employees. They write you up for no reason even though they put you in that predicament. If everyone would have great communcation with the employees not just the management team . if they communicated with the employees everthing would make the store a better place. Like at the walmart where i work at there is a certain manager that always get his way never is accounted for his action. he does what he wants and the store manager does nothing about it to solve the problem. This manager was put as manager not ever having experience as management. Not knowing how to talk to customers, im always hearing  complaints about this manager from the customers. Theyve reported it to home office but it never fixes the problem with this situation. But over all working for walmart is good as long as manager  has good communication skills and provide respect with all employees not just management team. Everyone should be paid the same amount of respect."
bad,I am a hard worker will stay late if need will give you 100 percent and more. always help others whenneeded I have 3 years of warehouse experience. in both shippingand receiving
bad,"Typical days were long, being in management we worked 12 hour days, three days on three days off. I learned first time management position, Wal-Mart is not the place to start. The rest of management were for themselves except for two. The hardest part of the job was keeping up all of my employees, making sure they were getting their task done. The only enjoyable part of the job was the pay and benefits."
bad,On a Monday morning  i came in turn on the light on  count my drawer make sure the correct amount is inside the register .After that turn over all return bends over.Then get ready for my first customer greet and smile.After a couple of hours wait for the next co-worker to relief me for a 15 minute break.Return from break help co-worker get the customer service line down and the hard part of the job is gathering all the claims together to return them to the back of the store to the claims department after that return back to service desk continue to work until my lunch break that's the best part enjoying lunch with other co-work at a nice restaurant then return back after an hour has passed.Clock back in continue to work were needed  after a couple hours clock out and my day is over at Wal-Mart.
bad,not the best pay but can be decent place to work. Worked here in ohio and transfered to oklahoma its nice to beable to do so not all companies have that option. however with walmart I'd say your job expierence solely depends on your manager.
bad,"Overnight stock wasn't difficult at all. Come in for work get pallets using pallet jacks, re-stock shelves, and make bales for empty boxes, and clean up aisles before 6am crew come in. Produce Associate keep fresh fruit on shelves, organized cooler, inventory cooler, make orders for fruit that's not in stock, keep work area clean. The most enjoyable part of my job was setting up displays for upcoming holidays, got along with customers and co-workers excellent."
bad,"I would clock in and get straight to work. My co-workers were very nice, we got along all the time. I learned how to transfer calls and have patience with people. There was nothing hard about my job. I enjoyed all of it."
bad,"I loved working for them, but their were no benefits working for them for a year or more. I could be wrong. I don't remember. I went into the hospital and I was fired for a no call no show when I called the manager and explained the situation. I didn't have issues at work with being late or anything. In fact, I was always an hour early. I am displeased with the way that they handled this. I would still be there had I not been fired for this small incident. I loved this job"
bad,Performed customer service all the time. Associate that worked under me always needed my help even after being told and shown how to do things many times. I had a couple associates under me though who were the only ones I could ever count on and knew a job would get done.
bad,stocking was a typical day at work. I learned to respect the people I work with. management sucks. Co-workers was the coolest people you would ever meet. The hardest part of the job was the 1 of the month. the most enjoyable part was lunch.
bad,Coworkers are easy to get along with... stores differ from each other when it comes to management. In some cases managers are non existent if you’re looking for help most of the time they’ll tell you to figure it out your self.
bad,The company started off good. I was so will to learn.But after 4yrs i just don't kown. The pay is good and benefits.They don't help you move up. You have to do yourself.
bad,I would not really much recommend anyone to work at Walmart they are very rude and don’t really appreciate the things you do and they give you hours and next minute the hours go down
bad,"I worked at the Walmart distribution Center in Pageland SC. They will gladly start you off with 17 to 18 dollars per hour. but what they want tell you is that the hours you work is up to them. I have worked a 24 hour work week, and a 50 hour work week. it varies, depending on how much volume you have that week. I have me mad 48,000 one year. and then again made 28,000"
bad,"I loved working with people at Walmart and they were nice, but I was not happy with my hours being cut. My schedule constantly changed hours every week and it was very frustrating."
bad,Well its retail sone days are easier than others but I dont agree with a manager approving me for something then firing me for it and breaching ethics
bad,"Not all the management team was bad when I left only a certain couple of them.  I used to love working there.  I learned a lot trying to get promoted even switching departments.  I was trained on all the PLE which was very beneficial for getting pallets down from the steel for myself or others, even unloading certain trucks.  When there was a big visit the stress in the managers showed because the store was not up to par and certain managers would wear the stress on their sleeve and the associates would try to avoid them.  They push you and don't pay the department mangers enough for all the work they have to do including the stocking team that is pushed to get the freight out to the floor and not bring any back.  The department managers always had to go back and fix everything the day after a truck because the associates working the freight were told to get it out however they could.  I worked in all aspects and saw all angles of it and said something multiple times and nothing was ever done."
bad,it was to far for tm and I cant make it from school to work they wanted me there to early they all was wanted me there before my time I was getting out of school at 3pm and the wanted me there at 2pm it was to early for me to get out of school.
bad,Walmart is a place i enjoy working with but the Asst. Managers are more the problem than the associate. By me working at Walmart you have to keep a clear head.
bad,"They treated me unfairly,I was a great employee & deserved better than I received.. Walmart really needs to monitor their management team & how they operate."
bad,"Enjoyed helping customer,  giving  great just customer  service,  stocking the floor, moving pallets,  Building  stock  bases, making labels,  scanning  in new products"
bad,I never want to experience working with management like I did with walmart lack of communication with management & us as Customer Service Managers over the front end
bad,Walmart was a well paying job with great benefits as a cashier for months  I learned to deal with many different types of people and personalities. It taught me how to keep my composer in tense moments .. in have patience with each individual .
bad,great company but if you dont intend on staying a while you probably will not be promoted.the workplace culture is great and fun but it really depends on the store.
bad,Was a great place to work years ago.  So many changes in management that the respect is not there for employees.  They depend so much from us with little time and the ladies the worker get a treated better than those of us that work hard
bad,Empresa busca sempre atender seus colaborados da melhor forma possível.
bad,"You must work fast to please Wal-Mart . "
bad,"Greet the customers as I came into the shop, asked what needed to be done, took customers information for work orders, started to zone the departments, most enjoyable part of this job would be working with cars."
bad,Very hard work physically. Lots of available options for advancement. Great benefits. First aid training and power equipment training available for those willing.
bad,My work is busy and full of work. I love talking to customers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with dangerous customers.My co-workers are nice to me sometimes. I leaned to stay sweet in bad situations. The most enjoyable part is making customers happy. The management is good.
bad,I am an applicant that have been applying for employment with WAL MART. I have been choice for the position as of today. Do you still have my application.
bad,"Working for Walmart was not bad. It can have it ups and down, some management are nice and will help me with freight and running my department."
bad,"sometimes it would get busy, the lines would get long. I just tried to do my best to get the lines downand tried to make the customer happy."
bad,"I LOVE working at WalMart, but I had no idea that I was terminated. I had to keep calling, and a week later discovered that i was terminated because i was no longer needed since it was a temporary position. The management and scheduling is so unorganized.You can never get in touch with anybody, and I shouldnt have had to find out that I was terminated through me constantly calling and coming up there. Someone should have sat me down and told me. Who ever the new management for the WalMart on Marine Blvd really does suck! The old management was WAAAYYY better!"
bad,I was able to learn new processes and I became familiar with several different departments. I would welcome an opportunity to return if needed.
bad,Good company to work for great benefits pleasant people to work with. mid-day rush usually Monday Thursday and Fridays fast paced always something to do or someone to help the hardest part of the job I would say is making the customer happy because each one has a different need
bad,"llegar al departamento a realizar el cierre del dia por medio de programas determinados para esta accion, hacer retiros de efectivo cada cierto tiempo para que no se acumule en el exterior de la tienda, archivar los reportes diarios para la firma de los mismos, conteo y empaquetado de los valores para la entrega ya que lo solicite la empresa contratada para esa actividad, cortes de caja cada que un asociado acabe su turno asi como la recoleccion de papeleria(boucher, cheques y vales de despensa), capturar lo retirado y cuadrarlo con lo fisico."
bad,"I was in charge of the inventory, scheduling, customer support, I used to work from 7 PM to 7 AM"
bad,"They didn't really care about there employees, I have a messed up back from a roll over that happened and I need something else to do but they didn't want to work with me so i ended up hurting my back even more. I have a hard time standing up straight or even sitting down, laying down and standing."
bad,I would not recommend this company they do not stand behind the associates and they expect you to have open availability no matter what or they can not use you.
bad,I miss working there wish I can do it again I loved working CV there I wish I never got discriminuate because I really liked it the job was great I stared as a cashier and worked my way up to a customer service manager
bad,I loved working there and then mangers had there favorites and they can do whatever. Then am Asst. Manger put employees and customers in danager. I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply to walmart
bad,A stressful job at times. Supervisors harrassing me all the time to work faster. Job Harrassment. Store very dirty and unorganized. Customers messing everything up
bad,"I worked at walmart for 2 years or better giving my all and i got fired cause i was in the process of transfering (please note until transfer attepts i was never late,never called out,never took vacation,and worked multiple possitions and never got in trouble till transfer attept)coinsidence?"
bad,"Walmart is a great place to work and the pay is great too. Friendly co-workers, and customers. I went in at 4 a.m. and worked til 1 p.m..those were my favorite hours."
bad,"Work in walmart is fine, but as a store standard? You might always get burnt by the sunshine. Too many carts you need to handle but few of your peers are willing to help you. Some of my peers always run out of work at work time, it is useless to tell the manager, trust me. When I first get this job, I was happy, cause I thought walmart will treat their workers equally. But cashier always get extra money, but as a store standard, never think about that. The manager was mumbling and try not to tell you what this work is about when you are having your interview."
bad,It was okay for it to be my first job but it felt like everything I did was a problem. They approved of my vacation but they fired me while I was on vacation.
bad,I love to work at Walmart it's a good environment and I love the people that work with them and and I love you all of the bosses and I love working around people special to customers when you said they know how to make you be happy when they come in how about
bad,The over-working requirements were under-payed with little sympathy. The building was too small for the stock and at times tricky to walk through to unload trucks and get pallets out to the floor
bad,recomendo para amigos boa empresa para se trabalhar
bad,"i use to work there and i loved my job then they fired me because they were irresponsible and couldnt keep up with schedules , but besides that its a great place to work and its always busy especially holidays mmmmmm those were the best"
bad,"i worked the night shift. i was responsible for stocking the frozen goods. i learned to use pallet jacks and also balers for cardboard compression. It was a great place to work, i just wanted something closer to home."
bad,"A typical day at work for me starts with me clocking in, and finding a register. After I find my register I always check my receipt paper, and after that I always make sure I have plenty of bags on my bag carousel. My co-workers are really helpful. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing what they have to say. The hardest part is when a customer gets frustrated, because we ask for an ID. However, I never let that get in the way of my work. I try to explain the situation as best as I can, and majority of the time I have to page a manager (CSM). The management at Walmart is very unorganized. Sometimes we have to leave our registers to go find them. Sometimes we have to page them several times, because we can't find them. I have learned to not trust anyone, because that could cause trouble. If something doesn't look right always page a manager."
bad,Co workers and management staff are all friendly. Work up loads to your desk each morning and your given a certain amount of invoices a day. Learned how to speak different languages working with different stores throughout the US.
bad,When I get to work I get my Gemini and printer. Then we start doing audits on the bins. After that we start on the picks in the system. When that's all done we go to the salesfloor and count all the merchandise on the shelves.
bad,"Good Company to work for"
bad,"coworkers friendly ,fun job to do ,and will love to work at another walmart store in my area"
bad,"Na epoca que eu trabalhei nao me ensinaram nada tive que aprender sozinha nunca me apresentaram o gerente da loja me dava bem com colegas,mas nao e uma empresa que eu queira trabalhar de novo."
bad,This job was a nice job while i was in high school. Flexible schedules and great job advancement opportunities.
bad,I enjoyed ringing up customers during the time they would come threw the line I could tell something about talking to me made them smile and seem to have a better day in general.
bad,Its an great work environment you just have to be with the company for 6 months to get pto time. Which sucks when your child gets hospitalize and you want to be there for them.
bad,It was fun when I was meeting new people at Walmart when I was there I expected way more structure but it didn't go as planned but we got over what we had to accomplish we all work together
bad,I have worked for walmart for 12 years. I made one mistake and they fired me. Not only did they fire me but the other associate that did the same thing I did never lost his job or didn't even get a write up. I was doing what my manger told me to do and she didn't even tried to save me or save my job.
bad,This job was a good job but the way they run their whole Walmart system is very poor and very horrible they need new rules for the store itself all together.
bad,"A typical night at Walmart was sometimes stressful, and sometimes the mangers treated the employees like they were less of what they are because of job titles."
bad,I worked here right out of highschool. I liked the people and they undersood family. they treat you like family. wonderful place to work. if you want to get into cars start here.
bad,"Busy Stocking and managing departments"
bad,It was a pleasure working for Walmart and with the customers. Some were like family because they were daily familiar faces. I learned team work and ownership. Management was really helpful and easy going.
bad,"They are willing to work with you at times, depending on management. Hours and pay were okay before they gave employees a mandatory raise. Depending on location good place to work."
bad,Wal-Mart was a great job too work at. Amazing associates and managers. Had great hours and amazing manager. Worked there for 3 years meet new people that came in regularly and got too know them.
bad,"I enjoyed walmart because of the friendly, professional, neat, honest, much respect, and hardworking environment. I enjoyed making the customer's happy as well as making them comfortable with talking to me."
bad,I have more experience with cash handling and working with other people. I was insecure with myself when I first started the job but have grown more confident over time.
bad,There are friendly associates at Wal-Mart. We work together and get our job done for that day. Everyone is treated fairly in all situations. Overall good place to work.
bad,I learned a lot from this company. My day started with getting merchandise off the floor. Scanning merchandise into the bins. Clearning the screen out.I learned how to solve problems. How important working as a team is for getting the job done.The hardest part of the job was planning a game plan to get all work completed when there wasn't enough people to help. The most enjoyable part of my job was completing what needed to be done and making sure customers enjoyed their shopping experience
bad,good place to work. good people and customers. was fun to wait on different types of people. management was nice and good to work for.
bad,"You get there , clock in, get on the floor . scann your badge and hop on the assigned register. you get two 15min breaks and one our lunch. management will help you with break timings and questions , co-workers also if avalible. the hardest part would be waiting for assistance or not knowing how to price match certian items. the most enoyable part would be . the co-workers and breaks & customers. ."
bad,"bom trabalho na empresa,aprendi como ser uma vendedora,e ter um bom atendimento ao publico,a direção trabalha junto com o funcionario,o ambiente de trabalho e colegas era bom ,melhor parte do trabalho era o atendimento com as pessoas."
bad,"las actividades son buenas y se van rolando en los mienbros de las plantillas de cada equipo de trabajo, he aprendido a tratar a proveedores y a empleados a dar un buen servicio y resolver situaciones urgentes tener toma de desicion"
bad,This is probably one of the worst jobs that i ever had in my whole entire life. Everybody was paired and off and had great relationships with each other but i constantly felt like an outsider
bad,"Very fun employees and productive job, management has a few problems and a great lack of leadership, but over all it is a very good paying job and gives me the hours I need."
bad,"very stressful no matter what you would do the manager would find something wrong and tell you how you dont deserve to be manager, love the employees and customers"
bad,you never know what is going to walk into the front door so just keep an open mine. The will try to help every one all at once so just wait your turn.
bad,"management try to make the area run smoothly , the hardest part of the day is to make the people happy that shop there also the managers . people enjoy when other people have a smile on there face that tells other they done a good job. To make sure everyone is satisfied with everything  and have no troubles ."
bad,It was fun I enjoy talking to people and helping them. The work was enjoyable and the workers were vary nice to me.they became like my Walmart family and I felt safe around them.
bad,"One day it was very busy and I was by myself in the pharmacy and customers came at same time @ drop-off, pickup, counselling and OTC recommendations. I gave preference to the work accordingly and handled the typical situation by myself only and provided the effective patient care & excellent customer service."
bad,working there was ok but they wouldn't change your hours. the managers were ok and the people work there were nice. that is all.
bad,As everyone knows Walmart can be a pretty busy and hectic work place. I learned a lot about electronics and how to work the processors with the photos. I learned how to deal with not so pleasant customers as well as how to make up sales to products.
bad,"busy work, management is underpaid, benefits at store level have gone way down, understaffed most the time. lots of areas to gain experience."
bad,"Its always a good day at work. Great customers I've been knowing since I've been working there for five years. Great pay now since I've gotten great raises every year. Management very nice, work with my school schedule, and also treat me like I'm welcome."
bad,"The people I worked with were great people, we worked together and finished unloading the trucks on time."
bad,"Lugar que te da otimas oportunidades de crescimento."
bad,"If you are a motivated sales person and can grow a book of business with a great company culture - this is the place to do it. Yes many prospects are taken but if you are creative and willing to put in some additional effort, you can make six-figure earnings within the first 3 years."
bad,os dias de trabalhos começavam bem agradaveis com o canto do ino do walmarte.eu aprendi que tudo tinha um motivo la dentro em lidar com a sociedade ouvir os clientes e nao falar e nem questionar.a direçao e agerencia sempre buscando novas formas em melhorar o ambiente de trabalho.boa convivencia com os colegas de trabalho.a parte mais dificil era fazer que com os clientes se sentisse bem por mais que eu tentava nao conseguia.e aparte melhor do anbiente de trabalhho era nas confratenizaçao dos setores.
bad,Walmart is very productive in getting things that the customer needs at a reasonable price
bad,Working at Wal-Mart was a enjoyable because I worked with a lot of different people young and older than me.
bad,"Provide customers with assistance.And to make sure all customers leave Walmart Supercenter with a smile on their face. While maintaining a high level of professionalism,and efficiency,to maximize customer satisfaction,snf increase customer loyalty."
bad,I was there 10 yrs loved most of my years there until last year when i was trying out for LP everything from there . Well not explain in this memo but if ask well expain .Other then that i loved my Job so much has changed at that store.I really thought i would retire there.
bad,was great working there but there was a lot of manager favoritism also schedules and they don't help with family emergency if u have to leave they just laid u off also they don't pay overtime they make u go home early
bad,"My review on Walmart is that I enjoy my co-workers and nice customers. I have learned better customer service skills, also I have learned how to deal with money and problem solving."
bad,i loved my work at walmart the coworkers were awesome the managers were understanding an compastionate   the work was fast paced with deadlines but there never gave you more then you could handle
bad,GOOD place nice people great work benefits hard work and good people and a start up company and its walmart not sure why we are doing this but I never worked for them
bad,"Walmart is still part of the good oll  boy system. it is a cut throat , back stabbing place to work. The do not give there workers credit for any thing and if they do, they will tear you down in the next breath.And they do not premote fom with in the store ."
bad,"Wrongfully firing loyal employees        "
bad,I really enjoyed working there. You see and meet many varieties of people. I'm a people's person so I enjoyed ringing up item's making sure they found everything ok during their visit.
bad,"Worked off production for four years."
bad,I enjoyed working for walmart store in country club hills il
bad,Very calm busy at times. I learned customer service. They where very good and hard working lunch hour all the friendly faces i see i think my job was very good with customers and people feelings
bad,Being a department manager was stressful . Having to deal with a million different attitudes everyday make sure that you reach the sales goal and etc but it’s a great job
bad,"I am a great pn time highly motivated worker, i like to assist people and help them with what ever i can help them with. I like my coworkers they were very helpful with that ever i needed to be assisted with"
bad,"Fast pace picking and pulling order to be shipped out, there is honestly nothing like the Walmart environment. and I can honestly I learned a lot working for the company."
bad,it was a good time while i worked there i had no complaints my time workin for walmart the overnight shift was cool too i guess i learned alot while oi was there
bad,Work at Walmart was not a easy job but I did it with no problems unloading GM truck was not easy at all but I work and work to get the job done every night
bad,"My typical work day is helping the customer get what they need and ring up there tv""s or other things they have.I just want a chance to work for your company"
bad,great company! taught me a lot. you get a lot of hands on experience. money management and customer services skills go to another level. a lot of multi tasking
bad,Loved every minute of working in the deli. The customers were very sweet and patient.
bad,making sure he orders sre right and takeing merdice to the sale floor checking the food tempertature
bad,Need better pay and benefits. Very short staffed sometimes and don't consider what we do for them .
bad,"help customer,  I made all sort of bread I help to design cakes as well"
bad,great company .. helping associates with every little thing
bad,It was fun and a good place to be for any hard worker or good person.
bad,"Short of staff every time and you ended up doing extra work that needs to be done in a night in fast paced, always go home tired and exhausted. Pay wise is not really good, different people has different hourle rates, but you do the same job. When they decrease your hours of work they don’t inform you they just do it for their"
bad,"worst place to work , management needs to treat the employees better than do especially the ones who have health issues .  I could not work in cold places like freezer and cooler with out getting super sick ."
bad,"The bad mostly because , you always wind up doing more than what you are paid to do and never a thank you it's like if you want to work here then you do what I tell you to do"
bad,"Trabajar para esta empresa es trabajo al final "
bad,"It drains you, they work you to death, never staffed many times I worked and closed by myself. Management never to be found or never responded to help being needed. Always made you feel like an inconvenience to them."
bad,I will never applied to walmart again. Management  doesn’t claimed to work with people who has Disability. They don’t inform the new employees in the orientation that they have to wait for least 6 months after you started working to work in a different department.
bad,my experience with Wal-Mart was not good mangers picked favorites with the associates. if you were not one they would not help you often enough. I did not get enough hours. and they would mess up my schedule a lot.
bad,Someone with out attendance issue can get fired in a couple of days. They don't care how long you been there. It isn't uncommon to go 6 hours with out a break. Getting a bathroom break is almost impossible. it is sad because it use not be like that. Full time benefits were taken away when they change over to PTO. They don't get holiday pay or extra pay for working on Sundays. They are hiring almost every week and firing every week. Standing prolong hours is very hard there.
bad,Does not care about associates or there families.  No work/home life balance.  No possitive coaching.  Only negative harsh put you down comments from leaders.
bad,"Its not a caring place when it comes to your family and health. We don't have paid sick days or holidays anymore. We use PTO for everything,  that's not fair. It's too much favoritism, and too much like school, some managers are very immature and childish."
bad,I worked for Walmart for 3 years and i can say i wont go back. Managers throw you under the bus for their own mistakes other departments do the same. I personally worked in lawn and garden and i was required to not only do my duties but help any other department that needed help and when one thing was wrong we were always blamed even if we weren't involved. We were called the trouble makers when we were the hardest working ones there and the company doesn't treat its employees fairly
bad,The job was rather stressful with unforgiving management staff. the associates were the best part of the job. the hardest part of the job was having to deal with the management staff.
bad,"The management team is terrible. They don’t care about associates. When I started working here about 3.5 years ago they were different. We had associates in every department, every day. Now we’re lucky if we have 5 associates for the entire store. All they are worried about is their bonus. It is a terrible company to work for."
bad,"Just do your job, their way, don’t sit or talk and follow all the rules. They keep files on everyone, usually from photos provided by the many cameras. You earn demerits for various infractions, being late, or early, or trying to rest your aching feet. After 4.5 “dings”, they can fire you."
bad,I’ve learned nothing at this job! I can read and count. This job doesn’t care who they hire and the pay is horrible for the work that’s asked of. They definitely needs to work on management also.
bad,Walmart use to believe in family and now they believe in money. Older associates used to be valued because of their knowledge and now they are pushed to the side for younger less experienced people.  They want you to perform two or three jobs for the same pay.
bad,I’m surprised I gave them 2 stars because Walmart sucks. The management is the biggest downfall and the employees are snakes. The managers think they are so much better than the rest just because they get paid more.DO NOT recommend you work here.
bad,they really took advantage of me when i was in high school and that it was my first job they would punish cashiers if they didn't ask to go to the bathroom and wouldn't give any of our breaks on time and they wouldn't even let me take off work for a funeral
bad,If you don’t value yourself and only work to almost but not quite pay your bills then this place is for you. Get used to skipping meals or being late on paying bills oh and overtime doesn’t exist unless there’s and audit or holiday coming up. At least they do schedules two weeks out so maybe you have an idea what you’ll be doing. 🤷🏼‍♀️
bad,They expect too much from their employees with not enough pay. They do not appreciate their employees or their customers. It is all about how much money can go back to the shareholders and CEO
bad,I liked working with some of my co-workers but that was about it. There was too much expected of myself and others and very little support to get things done. The company itself seems to be changing a lot of policies and ways things are done without any feedback if it is successful.
bad,Walmart does not value you. They only care about profits. Honestly find a job that cares for you. Not someone who pays the best. Money isnt everything
bad,Working for Walmart is not ideal. I encountered many corrupt managers who ignored policies and played favorites. They cut your hours for no reason which is not ideal for anyone trying to make a living.
bad,Walmart isn’t good at all. The supervisors think they are better then you and currently they are having a racist PROBLEM at the store it is terrible honestly.
bad,"This is the worst job you can get I work at the Chesapeake Walmart on battlefield and they the worst management and I feel they underpay you for all the work you do. I have been here for a year and yet have gotten a raise, but yet the can put me anywhere I am a cashier and I do self check and layaway and I lift things by myself with no help, but when other people need help they can get it. Management is wishy washy and  has a lot of favoritism"
bad,"Would not recommend anyone working there.  If you don't have a choice don't stay to long.  Find something better elsewhere.  The work is hard on your body, back and feet.  Management doesn't care."
bad,Working at Walmart you don't have a life. The company expects you to work at their whim. All holidays are worked at Walmart. Very hard to get anything accomplished through management.
bad,Very stressful environment. Managers lack respect and empathy. Expectations are not the same or fair for all associates. Working overnights expected to do everyone’s job. Your the clean up of everyone else
bad,"At hire I was told I was full time and would be eligible for benefits after 6 months.  Six months has come and gone and I’m only eligible for the 401k.  Upon investigation it looks like with their benefits you’d have to meet a deductible of 2,600 before you’re actually covered so it’s not worth it. Day, mid, and night management doesn’t communicate with each other.  Panic sets in at 4am to clean up everyone else’s mess before the big boss comes in.  My coworkers are great but there’s a huge need for improvement."
bad,"Was great at first, went down after 8 months, was full time after holidays was lucky to get 20hrs. If you cannot work what management says, your not going to work at all!! Not family friendly,  doesnt care if your sick, will not accept doctors excuse or hospital"
bad,"Was a great job at first, with a promise of advancement and career potional but soon after working there you start to understand your just a number easly replaced when you no longer bend over backwards or open your schedule to be avalible at all times..overall I wouldnt recommend walmart as anything more a stop gap to another job or a part time job at best."
bad,"In the short amount of time I worked at Walmart, it was a horrible experience. The management did not work with you on your hours, I was poorly paid. On top of all that the consumer service was poor."
bad,Working here it wasn’t very fun. To me everything was always so unorganized and the managers did for who they wanted to do things for and I didn’t agree with a lot of things they did
bad,"The moment you sign on, you are no longer a person. You are a very, very small piece of a machine that doesn't even need you. Because it doesn't need you, you're expected to be meek and grateful that the machine would even pay you at all. If you have no individual spirit and can easily force a smile to fit your face, then Walmart is right for you. Alternatively, if you're an automation repairman then Walmart is going to be your best friend sometime in the next decade. Walmart is primed and ready for the robotic takeover."
bad,working at walmart is stressful you never know how many hours you will get from week to week.Managers have a do what you can attitude. staffinbg is horrible especially if you work closing shift as some depatrments have 2peole to cover the whole store
bad,Walmart’s management and corporate team don't care about their associates there is a lot of favoritism and lack of empathy and understanding about what there associates go through
bad,"you get there and clock in and then immediately get to work. at some point, you will get at least a 15 min break. inconsistently. bad management. coworker drama. wrong people in charge. how to deal with people. I only enjoyed the pay."
bad,"managers are not constant. Nothing is stable about working for this company. Not the hours, members of management, managers availability towards the employees. Zero consistency. Management will allow you to choose your availability but only after you have been hired. Employees aren’t often informed of all their rights within the company."
bad,i liked working there until i was forced to take a position i could not take. so now i do not work there and really dont recommend any one with kids to work there
bad,My experience at Walmart was fair but not the best job I have had. I enjoyed my short work experience there but moved on to better opportunities. Interview and hiring process was simple.
bad,Way too much expected for what they pay. Will work you to the bone and lecture you on not doing enough. You have to beg for time off and are almost always denied.
bad,"they brag that they offer unlimited advancement opportunities to their associates.  they only do that until they find a place that for you that fits their needs.  they promote new hires that perform at lower standards than you.  then they introduce a new hire pay scale at $9 an hour starting without adjusting pay for the long term employees. then they do it again to $10 an hour then once again to $11 an hour.  It was like the long term employees took three involuntary pay cuts so the company can get some good publicity.  Since I quit, if I go back, in three years I will be making the same pay that took me 12 years to get to the first time."
bad,"It sucked from day 1 I was misled and it sucked I had requested cross training never received it. I never even knew who my manager was, half the time had no clue what I was supposed to be doing I was bored out of my mind but that was just me"
bad,"Been working for 3 years at the location. It went downhill really fast. Management are everywhere else but in my work area. Some even avoid it. They push and push and with minimal pay. Wouldn't be as bad if they hired 2-3 more people, but they'll hire for everywhere else but the deli. Just wished they cared a little more"
bad,"New hire driver will slip seat for a minimum of 4 years. Forced dispatch. You’ll only have a holiday off it falls on your normal day off. If you’re in a major metro area and dealing with traffic then your pay by mile is a joke. Cut backs on the most basic things in office, shop, etc. 30% of new hire drivers leave within 1 year. Micro managed by people in Bentonville that have never been in a truck."
bad,"Advancement is nearly impossible because there is no training or follow up to career interests.  Also, they make sure to point out the negatives and never the positives....you might get a thumbs up once in a while."
bad,Company changed constantly.  Work more than you could take PTO. All management team  wants the work fulfilled by end of shift. Customers feel like you supposed to shop for them.
bad,I worked at this company for 7 years. Worked like a slave very poor management. Low pay at the time. Now they have increased pay but it is not worth the headache for what you deal with.
bad,"Management played favorites, Employees were disrespectful towards others. Very stressful there, management played favorites and harassed the non favorites of not getting everything done"
bad,"Grossly understaffed! Expect one associate to run several dept's. Lot's of favoritism, Poor scheduling, which puts stress on best workers. Very frustrating for employees & customers. Management doesn't respond, their main focus is freight, & overstocked shelves that are danger to all."
bad,"you are overworked, underpaid, and unappreciated. they feel you are replaceable and don't care at all about their employees. they also will cut your hours and never give 40 hrs a week so they don't have to give you benefits. don't work for them and don't buy from them!"
bad,"not family friendly,  not single parent friendly,  you get in trouble for having to call out or leave early if you or your child is sick,  they do not accept doctors notes,  the only plus was the pay. management will cut your hours if they don't like you."
bad,Walmart was a stressful job the managers was not as appropriate in the workplace I made pretty ok money but the workload was over whelming because of the weather situation .
bad,"Some managers are extremely easy going and actually treat you well while others don’t care and are always miserable who usually are the ones that play  “favorites”. Work and life balance is not that great, schedules come out 3 weeks in advance and the managers will change it and not tell you"
bad,I worked there as a temp to remodel was there for the hold job we redid the inside of the store as well as the parking lot.did restocking also.removed and replaced shelves
bad,"Working conditions are horrible. The air conditioning is kept off or very low In the departments. You cannot make a living with part time hours and they don’t give you any. Only Department Managers work 40 hours and they will always remain in their position. There is never enough help and when you call a member of management, no one shows up, EVER!!"
bad,"I worked for in Walmart IT division for 20 years after spending 3.5 years in the store, working with others was the best part of the job and the most rewarding for promoting a team work environment, the last couple of years, management didn't promote a positive teamwork environment, which made day to day activities the hardest part of the job, when it should be the easiest."
bad,The manager didn't do her job or help others accomplished theirs. Poor team work. Wasn't willing to show me the things or steps I needed to take to move up in the company..
bad,It use to be fun but then you get Management who has favoritism against employees no advancement  Everytime  they raise the minimum wage at the store they don't pay the workers a differential they pay them the same been therealong time i make 12.90 the minimum in my position is 12.90 they also will get you to take over as temporary dept manager for your manager while on leave  tell you it's for 8 weeks. And the manager takes longer takes longer to come back hr was no help they owe me dept manager pay for 15 weeks  and her job was also only protected for 12 it wasn't offered up and it did t go on a job board  when I went out for my tonsils I was told if I wasn't back by 12 weeks my job would go up for  bid  and I would have to find another position in the store just goes to show management only cares about them selves and their prized employees they go to lunch with
bad,"Lots of stress and hard work, with little to no recognition for your work performed, it was just always what they need you to do next. They don't repair cases that you have to access continually to provide service for the customers but they are very difficult to get in and out of."
bad,Its a place to just have a job. Wouldn't recommend to everyone. You have to make it your life goal to get ahead in this company. You have to be available everyday 24/7.
bad,It’s all about who you know and if they want to know the latest gossip. The human resource recruiter is over company not management. Recruiter chooses what it wants to hire and who stays regardless of how you work hard & well with others. Karma is coming. WalmArt Florence hough road. Management has been fired because human resource recruiter summer 2019
bad,Walmart Neighborhood Market has bad management. They dont treat there associates that come to work hard. They don't give you no chance at any other positions. They will hire out of the store instead of in house.
bad,"I was never promoted to the position I was promised, so I changed jobs within the company. Then when I switched, my old assistant manager said they were about to give me said position. Once I became pregnant, I moved back to my old job because it was safer for me and my baby, as I had a high risk pregnancy. They denied my requests off so I could go to my doctors appointments. I had lost the raise that I had worked for and was pushed to do more than my body would let me. I was then put on strict bed rest for the remainder of my pregnancy. I had all of my paper work in order and then was denied maternity leave even though I had my baby six weeks prior to my due date. I feel as Walmart and its management team do not care about their employees, just about their sales. It was a great job before I had gotten pregnant since I was about 19 when I started, but after wanting to start a family, it went down hill."
bad,"Never had a study shift. Never knew what time or what days you are working. Could not have a family life or personal life because the schedule constantly changed. Under staffed, management constantly change and store manager could care less about you. After 5 years I felt drained. Moved on and happy."
bad,I once heard management tell a college student that he could not work in the mornings and if he changes his availablity he will be getting 4 hours a week. He had told them that he needed mornings cause he had schooling at night and he still needed to pay rent on his apartment and pay bills.
bad,"I was enticed by the visible tattoo policy, however this was the only perk. I was told a wage I would be receiving, however I was not told that wage would not be given until after I finished training on a computer. And there was no scheduled time to do this training, so it was up to the individual to find time to do training. The scheduling manager did not work with my college schedule as was promised, and as such I had to call in for shifts to attend my classes. I was not hired on as a cashier, however I was given cashier responsibilities, and in return got in trouble for being a cashier. I was fired for too many occurrences (missing shifts due to my college classes)."
bad,I would not work there again. Did not appreciate being disrespected and co-workers and managers were rude due to my disabilities. I was let go for this.
bad,"The Wal-Mart I work for doesn’t want to make anyone full time for the benefits especially if you have children nor do they want to pay decently. They degrade their employees, and refuse to recognize hard work over laziness."
bad,I got burnt out working at Walmart. The manager was a bully. Everything had to be done his way. He was stressing everyone out who was on the overnight shift.
bad,Wal-Mart could care less about the employees. They allow customers to abuse employees. And write them up when they try to defend themselves. Total sell outs.
bad,"A tipical day working at Walmart was constant stress as well as interactive with merchandise and customers at all times."
bad,"The neighborhood  market that I'm at has high turnover and minimal  training for bakery and deli associates.  It is a sink or swim culture, where most opens jobs are filled before anyone knows that they are available."
bad,Our crew left some water bottles out after a two truck day and our manager is threatening to take our water away. 110 degrees on truck no water. Shes taken away our music no gatorade no body armor management wont let us have anything that replenishes our electrolytes salt or sweat loss have to work in silence with extreme heat. Overall horrible moral horriblstressstressdisgusting manag
bad,Walmart is not a good company to work for they don't care about their employees pay is not fair for amount of work and stress involved employees are over worked and under paid dept managers and store managers treat employees like badly the point system for walmart is not fair especially if an emergency comes up right its a lie
bad,"I did not like the company, management was horrible.  They did not care about you as a person and management was very critical and. It in a good way. I didn’t like it"
bad,They pick and choose who they want to work and they have Favoritism and there rules is out of control and I don’t like the way they treat people but all you do is try your best and be  patient  With them.
bad,"Unlike what theyd like you to believe walmart and their company, depending on location, are filled with money hungry individuals who dont care for anything but themselves."
bad,Terrible place to work managers go on vacation 1 a month for a week like they’re not as understaffed as they are. The CSM’s get no respect as it is from higher ups
bad,"Walmart is a work place for those just coming into the work industry I wouldn’t recommend to try for a long term career at Walmart "
bad,"They didn't care what the employees had to say when it came to doing things a certain way. It was their way no exceptions. The academy at the store was always interfering and changing things everyday making things harder. Some management took advantage of the employee's who were not in their area then later scolded them for not finishing their tasks, when they took them from it in the first place. Got into trouble for the tiniest  mistake because to them everything had to be perfect."
bad,"HIGH TURNOVER RATE, cause they don't really pay attention to the welfare of their employees. Management is unwilling to accommodate you since they see you as a cog in the machine."
bad,It's a job. The worst thing was being unable to sit down at any time during my shift. It's fairly easy to master basic job duties pretty quickly. Working at Walmart is fairly simple if you are good at following rules/policies/procedures.
bad,Don't get much say as far as what you can work. They change your work schedule without notifying you. Everyone likes to micromanage and give you task that mangers were given to do.
bad,"Walmart is more focused on its store image than the happiness of their employees. Hours have been cut so much, that we are working with a skeleton crew."
bad,you were forced work in places where you were not trained and with no one to help you which made it extremely frustrating. As well most people not making a living wage
bad,No staff full expectations as if you had . Full work load and no staff to cover everyday requirements and had to work other departments that weren’t staffed
bad,"Walmart does not reward hard work or dedicated employees. The job security, advancement, management structure, compensation, and the way they treat  their employees is terrible and inhuman."
bad,It’s stressful and they don’t have enough people to work over night  you have to work four times harder for what you are getting paid the manager alway coming to ask you are you done before you even get started
bad,"They never had one person for management over the Front End. I never really knew who to turn to when I needed to request time off or other important matters. It would be one person in charge one day and another person the next day. It would be a headache. Finally, when they tried to get a permanent person, that person went on a firing spree for all of the things prior people in management of the Front End left unsolved or messed up. I got lucky for the time being for managements mistakes but it is a stressful, dysfunctional environment and job. I would not recommend it. I learned that you should just go to target or shop at target."
bad,The management would be extremely rude if you had any questions regarding a product or money order. The main manager would call you out in front of customers when you failed to meet their credit card requirements. Would not work with you on schooling or house hold problems. When you switched registers after the end of your break and the person who ran the register before hand messed up with any of the money you were blamed for their mistake at the end of you shift.
bad,"Was a good learning experience, but management wasnt understanding and only knew how to micromanage. All they do is bark orders around and expect you to get it dont but wont help you out unless your a favorite."
bad,"Despite being able to turn in an availability repost, or becoming a part time employee, they will try to work you to death. Had to work 9+ days in a row multiple times, and when I asked for a set schedule(I didn’t even want weekend off, just Tuesday's and Wednesday’s) I was told that if I changed my availability I would likely only been given a few hours. I started off as a part time employee, but would constantly be scheduled 38-40 hours a week. Would be asked to stay late, and then they would send me home early the next day to avoid having to pay overtime."
bad,"I am responsible for answering questions ask by customers and managers alike. At times regional will walk the stores and ask about sales, overall running of each deptmart"
bad,À celui de Pointe aux Trembles il y a aucun respect pour les employés. Les employeurs lèvent le nez sur les petits associées. Beaucoup d employés sont partis et plusieurs font encore partir à cause de la grande boss et de certains gérants qui prennent les employés pour des moins que rien.
bad,It might be a better Store if they had some competition as it stands they don't and services all the towns surrounding it. They also know they are the only ones in town and treat the customers as such.
bad,They smile in your face then treat you horrible  when you get tired from working on a hot truck and a hot line in a cramped area and only get to eat lunch after you finish two huge trucks and they get mad when you have to go on break then complain when anyone talk or joke about anything that deals with outside life they pick favorites they harass you in front of customers treat you like bad
bad,"No flexible scheduling, no benefits unless you paid a ridiculous monthly premium, no appreciation, and too many expectations that could not be met on a daily basis."
bad,"its okay at first until later in the months when the manager starts mistreating you, always getting in trouble for no reason, no hours. Night shift crew was great but day shift crew is terrible."
bad,I worked for the company for 2 years and it really took a tole on my mental health. While trying to do my normal delegated jobs I was also thrown others jobs as well and yelled at if I did not get them done. I worked as a cashier and a customer service associate so trying to do a million things at once left me so drained at the end of the day that I withdrew from normal social interactions with friends and my significant other. Management was not eager to help with difficult situations at the customer service desk which made customers even more angry. CSM's however are more than happy to help with situations but are so overworked that they're running all over to different departments.
bad,"Don’t work there, it’s horrible, the pay rate is too low, not that much hours, just apply to another job, try Target or something but don’t work at Walmart"
bad,It’s not a place I’d work quite honestly the way it’s changing is for the worst it’s not a place you can get ahead in life . No OT 3week wait for off days smh ... it’s terrible and it’s not a secure job .
bad,The management is geared to younger slave like standards everything seems to be sugar coated though you may not part take in the sugar it just for show but you have to keep it clean for new comers.
bad,"Walmart treats their employees like trash. The security watches the employees more than the customers. Do get me wrong they hire anything so they have to watch them. But if they paid more than starting you off at $9.00. Than they wouldn't have to watch their employees. Then, the upper management is very rude and hard to deal with. One assistant store manager asked me to hurry up and create a display because her bosses boss was coming in to walk the store. I did as I was asked. The man came and seen the display and did not like it at at. I did everything she asked me to do. But when he said something to her. She told him she had nothing to do with it and it was all me. I explained to him the situation and she ended up getting coached. But the moral. She thru me under the bus like. I had did it. But if she had did the schedule correctly and had the department manager of that department wprking like she normally did. Everything would have been done and she wouldn't have had to ask me to do it in 30 minutes."
bad,they only care if you show up and then you are only a body.  Everyone is expendable.  There are many more to take any ones place.  they only do enough to keep out the union.
bad,Horrible company to work for. Constantly on you about little things you already know and constant harassment to associates. Management is poor!!!!!!!!
bad,Always expected more than what was capable of being done. Management couldn’t help even if they were your only hope. Wouldn’t recommend cap 2 to anyone.
bad,Just seems when they’re interviewing you they just want to get you in cattle and they really don’t care about what you can and can’t do unless if you’re willing to crawl up somewhere
bad,They were terrible employers and I wont go back there. they are not family orientated and they don't pay enough. I would not refer anyone to work there.
bad,I only lasted a year at walmart because I worked the overnight shift while it was still the overnight shift and the management team left us alone to do our jobs.
bad,"Terrible. Management is terrible. They're unorganized, rude, and don't cared for you. The customers there are unreasonable and rude. Overall a horrible experience that make you feel depressed and degrading"
bad,I had just graduated from High School about to get into college and they did not work with me on my school schedule. Management me told me in order to work there I need to have open availability and I could at the time.
bad,They don't respect you and don't have family values I. Wouldn't recommend Working here they promte from who they Kno not what you know very unfair company if you ask me
bad,"If you apply at Walmart please do not put in for overnight stocking. It’s extremely stressful, always short staffed so they expect you to do the work of two to three people on your own. You’re also timed for each task you do which makes it even more stressful and nearly impossible to complete. For the amount of stress I was put under every night by management and threatened of write ups it’s definitely not worth the little money they pay."
bad,I hated working here. It was too demanding of some employees. There is no incentive to be a hard worker because they just expect even more next time. They tended to overlook week employees but expected much more if you showed initiative. Management turnover was terrible. Each manger seemed to do thins differently than another one. No uniform systems in place.
bad,"This is the place to work if you want minimal hours, no benefits and have zero financial responsibilities. This is a decent place for a first job, while you’re in school. Not a good place to work for the long run."
bad,"I did enjoy working for Walmart almost 4 years, but hate the new attendance policy. Had a death in the family, but was terminated due to the fact that they weren’t “immediate family” which is stupid..honestly it’s not too bad because of the benefits, but be warned you can only get them after being there 2 years. Enjoyed who I worked with some of the time. All around Walmart is okay, but not the best place to work."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here unless u have no life and never get sick because If it doesn't benefit the company it doesn't work, they cut hours for people who have been there for years and put up now hiring signs at the same time they do not take doctors notes and they will not work with or around fertility appointments so if u are trying to have a child and need help do not get a job here.  In my 14 years here I have seen this place go down hill what once was a nice place to work is no longer something to be proud of."
bad,Some not all of the people isn't unfair its just not giving a full 40hrs and taking the bonus money and doing other jobs I didn't sign up for a lot of stealing and disrespect to the employees
bad,Walmart need better chech and balance on the store manager. Walmart is not treating their employee with respect these people give there all . upper management don't care as long as they are getting there high salery
bad,Management is very picky and have favorites. Some of them hardly work and or take advantage of associates with good intentions. The Shifts are always random and unfair .
bad,"I liked my co-workers but management was very wishy-washy.  No communication between asst. managers, dept. managers and actual associates.  Everyone got different information depending on what shift you came in on."
bad,Overall worse place that I have ever been employed. They don’t care about their employees well being not are they passionate when you have an emergency.
bad,I worked in the backroom unloading trucks and stocking the shelves while helping customers. I would not recommend working here. I am paid minimum wage and overworked. Management is a joke. There is no recognition for hard work. You will be held accountable for absence regardless of reason.
bad,"Very long busy days. You can learn a few different things depending on your position but rarely have the chance to move up in the store. workplace culture is suppose to feel like a family ""walmart/sam's quote/logo"" but they want you to work yourself to death and it's an every man for themselves kind of job. They don't try to work with flexible schedules, if you ask for one the you will most likely be a cashier. Bonuses are rare and they tie it to your attendance now. Double/triple points if you call out on weekends. No overtime, you can work over your schedule but they make you take lunches to cut it out."
bad,They preach team work but put it all one one person. Management doesn't communicate at all. Does not allow over time it's actually frowned upon. Work pace is terrible because the managers are always takeing people from one task to another without talking to the manager the told them what to do causing the stocker to get confronted for not finishing taskes they appointed to them .
bad,"I was told by a manager that they couldn’t accommodate my school schedule, forced me to take a pay loss, and took me completely off schedule. The store is completely unorganized"
bad,I stayed with the company as long as I did simply because of my fellow associates networking with them and knowing that it wasnt just me going through the things we went threw
bad,se aprendió suficiente sobre el manejo de efectivo
bad,"the managers at this job play favorites and expect lower employees to pick up their slack as they take a break longer than permitted. one manager decided to belittle me and use vulgar language in front of a customer while I was performing my duties. She had failed to fix the pricing on items in her section, she told me it was my fault. I was supposed to do the re-pricing, when I never had even been assigned the tool used to re-price items yet, nor was I trained to use one of those tools yet."
bad,"If it is your last resort, work for Walmart.  If you have a brain you will loose your mind there.  If you can be a brain dead robot you will get promoted."
bad,This environment is extremely bad very unorganized.  Never allowed to finish projects then blamed and penalized for it.  Trained for department management positions then upon doing the work was not given the raise that was promised.
bad,La capacitacion es muy pobre a comparacion con las actividades que se realizan.
bad,Es un dia en el que llego y muchas veces no tengo mucho tiempo de conocer a mis companeros ya que me espera mucho trabajo y por lo tanto no puedo tener mas relaciones con ellos
bad,"When I worked there I was passed over for Customer service manager several times even though I could do the job.the raises sucked, the cashiers were unreliable, the turn over rate was high, some management was unprofessional, safe wasn’t treated very good."
bad,"They allow lazy employees to be lazy, and rely to much on hard workers. Refused to give me bereavement pay when my grandpa passed and almost made me miss his funeral which was in another state."
bad,Don’t go there they treat you bad and don’t care about the people they have the manager of the store doesn’t care the other managers don’t care you come in when they want you Work 4 hours go home then come back work some more no one staying long everyone quits or let go this is not a  Company that cares about you they only want money
bad,"This job was detrimental to my mental stability. Management was not supportive, the location was constantly understaffed and overworked, and we were threatened with write-ups any time we couldn't keep up."
bad,They don't care for their employees well being. The management is awful and they show favoritism to certain people who don't even do their job.they need improvement
bad,Stressful place to work. Management needs more training to teach new employees the job. Management needs to learn how to manage employees a lot better.
bad,"Wal-Mart as an overall company expects a lot from their associates and does not pay enough for what is expected.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing most of the time.  Their are great protocols that, if followed, make things better but no one is on board with everything like they should be and then there is no incentive to do better.  And they do not care if you quit or are unhappy for the most part.  I had good experiences but most of the people I worked with were not super happy there."
bad,i worked there for a few months and it was just full of drama and uncomfortable rules and unsanitary. the pay was horrible they took away 50 cents because they removed overnight
bad,Walmart is a place I wouldn’t advise an adult to work for as a career. The management is horrible they’re base off favoritisms and themselves. They don’t care what you’re going through in life or your outside life. They pretend the associates are a walmart family but they treat you as if you’re not human. You’ll mostly be at work then at home and they have a point system where you can get fired for calling out for a real emergency. Doctors note are not accepted they don’t care if it’s something serious there’s no acceptions. I wouldn’t recommend working for this company if you’re trying to achieve in your career.
bad,They keep cutting things out of your pay so you can not get ahead or make ends meet. Cutting full time associates who have been with the company over 20 years down to 12 hours per week when they think it is a slow month. Why?????
bad,This company work well when we have company from higher but on the everyday work need improvement. Meeting we have daily give out little to no information about the day.
bad,"Poor management, little understanding and flexibility with anyone having a family. Management usually steps on you or walks on you when you are trying to uphold company policies. Very poor establishment to work for."
bad,"Very difficult company to work for.  Management is for the most part rude and insensitive toward associates.  Very demanding culture, where three or four people will tell you to do something different, so nothing is completed or done well.  Expectations are unrealistic and impossible to meet.  Even though everyone is disposable when working for any company, one shouldn't be treated that way."
bad,the employees fight with the customers. Upper management like to bark orders to the assistant managers. Mostly upper management in the stores are men when I see women who know what they are doing more. The culture is poor. The hardest part of the job is taking orders from upper management with not enough time and then they embarrasses you. No enjoyable part of he job
bad,I was homeless while I was working here and not much was done to help. Which I understood and respected but when they COULD help me they didn’t try to. As in releasing my work information to the apartment complex that I was trying to move into and Keeping me homeless for an extra month longer then I had to be because of this.
bad,"I truly love the people  I work  with, that is one of the only reasons  I get up in the morning, other than having bills to pay, management is lacking at this company, they don't  have a clue of what they are doing, they are not trained properly, they do not communicate  with their employees very well, they do not respect or appreciate  what we do for that company. The worst part about the job is rude customers I cannot stand dealing with rude people, but the nice ones make up for it."
bad,managers would berate employees in front over costumers. single out people for personal reasons. would not adhere to home office policies. overall it was one of the worst places I have ever worked.
bad,You're worked and treated like a slave. As a cashier I often had to do work way above my pay grade just because I was good at it. This company's ridiculously cheap pricing is the main reason they are world-wide.
bad,I like working at Walmart first few months but after that it was horrible and management was slow and some were never there and some were nice and some were mean and rude and disrespectful to the people that actually work they.
bad,Started out as a tech 8 years ago and worked my way up to Service Mgr. Upper management has given me no training at all in the 2 years that I have been mgr. In my title as Service Mgr. You are given a title and that is all. Upper mgt. Always has my garage under staffed also we are made to work over at night shift to satisfy customers only to have to take 2 and 3 hour lunches to take the time back off. Not at all happy with my job and am currently seeking employment elsewhere.
bad,They really need to overhaul management of this store. They make promises they can't fulfil and take advantage of employees that actually work to take the slack for lazy people who don't want to do their job.
bad,The job was boring. No one was there to help and I was always there by myself. The place was an unsafe environment. Police was there because kids was hanging out looking for trouble.
bad,Unless you're a teenager or in college it's not worth it at all. Horrible pay and no benefits bc they don't make you full time employees and leave you at 36 hours.
bad,As much as walmart was a big part of my work ethic. It unfortunatly lacks in the care for its employees and if they have emergencies. It is unstructured and has an issue with talking to employees. However I did grow and start to love the company despite its downfalls due to the coworkers that I worked with.
bad,I enjoy wal mart for positions to grow but was not given opportunity to run my own department how i wanted. I really cared for my areas. Id wish they had more tools to do job and better training. Need better scheduling and better pay plus benefits.
bad,I worked hard to prove myself and they didn't appreciate that of me.. working hard at Walmart doesn't pay they didn't even notice me..workers are lazy and unpleasant
bad,"A job at Walmart should not become a career but for some people it works out that way so, the people that never have the capabilities to get out of Walmart end up getting moved up while never really learning or understanding what to do causing a lack of management skills that trickle down to the associates causing a stressful work environment. Also the company itself ends up shooting itself in the foot when it comes to managing the company as a whole."
bad,"Was great to learn layaway, fitting room (Switch board) and customer service techniques so long ago.  They were skills to build upon in the early 2000s."
bad,I tell desperate people to get a job at Walmart because it's better than nothing but it is a terrible place to work. They break your body and mind. They promise you incentives but never fulfill them. They will lie to your face. Corporate does nothing but make your life harder.
bad,My experience there was terrible to say the least. A typical day consisted of apprehending shoplifters. We had managers there that wasn't willing to help us succeed and we basically had to learn on our own. The workplace culture was very hostile and the employees didn't care to even be there. There were no enjoyable moments at that location.
bad,Planning tools would state that we could only do this much and they would request we do triple the work. When we had to stay over to finish the extra work we would be punished for it
bad,Walmart has stollen overtime hours from me right before I am suppose to get paid. They know when people come in for overtime and don’t say anything until the very last minute before you’re suppose to get paid and management is poor and never really listens to employees concerns and ideas. Management also doesn’t schedule enough employees for specific shifts and expects one employee to do the work of many.
bad,"The managers didn't care about what happens in your life outside of work. As long as you show up to work, that's all they care about. I had a stalker. So i told my manager about it. They assigned someone to walk me out at night. They told me because my stalker was not talking to me or toughing me; they could not and would not ban him from the store. Then the man that was suppose to protect me and walk me out every night started texting me inappropriate messages and saying inappropriate things. I told management about it and they did nothing."
bad,"The other coworkers are ok, I didn't like how they did the hours you work. the management is very bad, the department I was in I didn't even know who the manager was, manager never came by to say hi or welcome to walmart thanks for being apart of walmart.. What I really liked about walmart was helping the customers out. Management very very bad."
bad,"Working in a Walmart is a soul sucking experience, management treats hourly workers like trash, hours and scheduling are inconsistent and do not always conform to availability.No over time, no chances for raise or advancement, long hours, and nit picking, yelling managers who don't care."
bad,You would work six days a week but only get less than 30 hours. So therefore you were never eligible for benefits. The scheduling was a mess because they only employees that got the hours were friends of management.
bad,The hardest part of this job is dealing with the people that come through walmart. The rest is fairly easy and you get two 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch
bad,"Managers dont have time for their associates, lack of job recognition. no Job growth. Low  pay and compensation. I would not advice anyone to work for this company"
bad,"work overnight shift, way too much work for the amount of staff we had. complaints were never dealt with. can reall yonly say bad things about working there."
bad,"Walmart does not really care about their employees, they don't allow their employees to get a fair bonus even when accident free, They have two registers open for customers even though the store if fully staffed with associates to fill every register to assist customers for quicker service they ignore the need of the customers and mistreat the cashiers/ employees needs as well. Someone should change this because the customers don't like to wait in long lines."
bad,Don't work for Walmart unless you're a high school student needing something to start at short term with plans to have a better second job or to use as a stepping stone to a better job
bad,They suck as a company. The management team doesn't know how to lead people. They work you to death and have too high daily expectations. Not an ok job.
bad,"I think with big corporations like this one the experience can very from location to location depending on the management. My experience has not been the greatest but Walmart's business model is great in regards to its employees, the management I have does not follow those standards. I know other people that work at other locations and they enjoy their jobs greatly."
bad,"My job experience at Walmart was not a pleasant one. I worked long hours and was always tiered with almost no time for myself It was stressful, fast paced, and almost non-stop for me as a cashier and what's worse is I was fired and I didn't even know it. No calls are anything. I had the flu and had to be out sick for a whole week and came out of my sickness early, asking when I was coming back in again, presenting a doctors note. I was told then that I had been let go."
bad,No good work ethic there.. Very poorly run by the manager in the deli.. Swing shifts working till 11 pm at night then having to be back in a at 5 am.Would never work there again. Didn't even have a trainee  there to help you.. Just like they threw you in the mix of things
bad,I actually liked my job at Walmart it's just the pay was horrible. I started out making six dollars and sixty cents an hour then got a raise making seven dollars sixty cents. The Walmart in my state sucks.
bad,"I am always overworked, no one gets in trouble for not doing their work so they just made me do all theirs and mine as well. Paid time off is accrued way too slowly to cover any kind of emergency"
bad,"As a cashier, managers will take advantage of you every chance they get. When I worked there (2010)  scheduling was inconsistent, it was nearly impossible to request a day off. Breaks were never given on time, sometimes they would completely “forget” to give me a break, but if you sign off of your register at break time without manager approval they would write you up."
bad,I loved working for this Wal-Mart store.i meet some awesome people there.management at this store was top notch.they cared about their employees at this store.excellent hours given to work at this store.the store manager was awesome.i have never met a manager quite like him.(Mr.kelvin sales)
bad,"I was fired from here because I was admitted to the hospital. While hooked up to IV's and being scheduled for surgery, the only question I was asked was, ""why aren't you at work?"" I did everything I was supposed to in order to make sure I wouldn't get fired or build up too many points. However, in this store if you weren't a favorite then you didn't matter."
bad,Worked in health and beauty section and was pulled to cashier each of my shifts for a week then got yelled st because my area wasn’t stocked..... ....
bad,"-Each shift began with a brief meeting and employees were encouraged to stretch before shifts"
bad,company that take advantage of their employees low self esteem and make them feel afraid that they are going to lose their jobs if they do not do what they are told.
bad,Walmart is a fast paced hard job. Work is based upon man power and your worked over that causing you to do two peoples worth of hard physical labor...
bad,Thought I loved my job at first until they started making me work until 2 in the morning and won’t allow me to change my availability. I hate my job at Walmart now
bad,"Terrible Place to work, couldn't advance in any way shape or form, very picky on who they promote selective you could say, terrible experience, Wouldn't Recommend."
bad,"Yes they pay more hourly<but there not very nice<never know if you get hrs that week<have to ask can you fixed my schedule<sometimes they do>if theres a problem and you go to a manger they say will fix<they never do,the worst is they changed their policy about bad weather,if you can""t get there they don""t care and its goes against you..."
bad,"The environment  awful. They expect too much with almost zero traininh. The company is terrible if you're between 20 and 35 and have no schooling or kids at home as they don't have good schedualing deparment. If you're in high school or newly retired it's the place for you. "
bad,"The pay was not sufficient, so I needed a 2nd job. They would not allow 5 minutes to make up for commute time. Therefore, their points system caused me to be let go."
bad,"Walmart Canada does not reward or acknowledge their hard working employees. If anything, the harder you work and do your job above and beyond what is expected, the more they start to treat you horribly and take advantage of your kindness. Workplace was very labour intensive and unsafe at times."
bad,a typical day at Walmart as a stocker we come do our picks and stock the floors all day sometimes we would have to help with ither parts of the or clean
bad,"This particular Walmart is poorly run (at least a year ago it was). There are favorite employees that manage to get all the opportunities to move up. They tend to be a little bit harsh on when you have to come in and if there is a call out you are expected to drop whatever you are doing to go into work, and if not you will be reprimanded. This job is NOT for someone that has a schedule and responsibilities of their own, scheduling changes week to week even when asked to give a structured schedule."
bad,Working at Walmart was very stressful for me. They said they are all for school and getting a higher education but it was a lie. They would schedule me on my schools days and they try to write me up when they were given a copy of my schedule. The management was horrible and they play favorites. One of the worst companies ive ever worked for.
bad,They are a very poor company to work for. They care nothing about there employees and treat them like garbage. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody
bad,This was my first full time job after high school. At the time I was hired I was the only one over 18 so I was required to work on the alcohol/cigarette lane every day and even when my shift ended I had to wait until the next shift came in before I could get off that lane. This was usually at least a hour of overtime every day. After 3 months I was moved to the electronics department for my morning shifts and unfortunately a small item was stolen. Walmart management told me the funds for that item would come out of my check because I wasn't able to stop the thief. After that I refused to work in the electronics section because I felt stopping thieves is the loss & prevention team's job not mine. I was demoted and moved to clothing and after that they cut my hours to almost half and I knew I could not stay much longer.
bad,"ambiente sem dinamica geral e pessoal, cargos muito elevados para pouco retorno,"
bad,"They don't like to work with you on hours, and your punished if you hurt yourself on the job. And if you get I'll or need surgery don't expect to be able to get days off they don't take Drs notes and they just don't care. They expect less employees do more work cuz they don't want to hire more employees if they do t have to. And be expected to move out of your department, you will be called to cashier, stock food and work in other departments if they need help."
bad,wasent worth the gas no benefits the managment was terrible no communication between upper and lower people. was constantly bashed by customers and upper did nothing about it
bad,Foi uma experiência boa e ruim ao mesmo tempo.aprendi a lidar com o público.
bad,"Customer service, register, cash handling, section work, stocking shelves, team work, fast paced, work hard, set goals to get thing accomplished, not enough time in the day to get everything done"
bad,"the managers make you feel less than, you have to beg them for a break, if you mess up and needed the CSM to help they would become frustrated. i wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy"
bad,"I would not ever want to work for this company ever again to be completely honest. It was my first job and i didnt get paid enough for the people i had to deal with, employees and customers"
bad,"hired a drug addict, didn't listen to harassment reports and took too long to take care of the issue after i and several coworkers were sexually harassed"
bad,bag stock slice bread unload pallets from freezer bring out to sales floor restock place raw dough for bread on carts into cooler for later then brought out placed in oven to bake  take counts do mark downs pull some stock for food pantry help customers answer questions take cake orders very fast pace they expect the impossible if not meant you are repremanded /written up coached and belittled did enjoy slicing and stocking and helping customers just do not speak to customers when management is around or you will get yelled at and belittled even in front of the customer poor management un caring too demanding.
bad,"Most customers I experienced were mean talking, disrespectful, and treated you like you were of no value, they were only there because of lower prices"
bad,"In my experience, Walmart was not a very good place to work for. For example, the reason why I was fired was because of points. You can have up to 4 points for the first six months and they come off exactly 6 months after you get them. They give points for if you're late, and if you don't come at all. You get 1 point if you're more than 2 hours late and you get a half a point if you're less than 2 hours late. Well, I came to work one morning and I started my day as usual. I was the opening so I had to get my till. And then it dawned on me that I forgot to clock in. It was 7:11am. They give you the first 9 minutes for free...just to give a little leeway. Anyway, I clocked in and when I went to clock out, I checked on the computer if I had gotten an extra half point for that morning which would have put me at 4.0 points. I didn't have one. So, I thought to myself, okay, they didn't put it in because they saw me there at work. Well, a couple weeks later, I checked on the computer again and it was on there that i had 4.0 points!!!! Every time I would try to go to the people that were supposed to fix it, they either weren't there or they were at lunch. And they almost never answer the phone; I called 3 times. The managers eventually caught on to it and they fired me, despite my story that I explained to them. I went to the manager about a week after I was fired and explained to him my situation and he said ""okay, I'll take a look at it."" but that never happened. So that's why I wouldn't recommend this company to ANYONE."
bad,"The job and every person in management there sucks bit time. The associates that you work with on the floor are about 75% awesome and the other 25% you want to stay away from.  scheduling is horrible there and to book a day off is like pulling teeth, they don't care about their employees at all."
bad,el clima con los compañeros de trabajo es lo único que valoro de la empresa pero sus administradores y gerentes son los peores jefes con los que he trabajado
bad,"Well u always see all the good things published on the tv and in the paper and on the news of all the good things they do to help people allover the world. But i bet u didn't know there employees get a yearly raise and the max for a 15 year employee is like 28cents so imagine the rest of us its like 20 cents it will take five years to get a whole 1$ also employees don't get  paid holiday time you get pto but not everybody has pto available.and it's mandatory u work on holidays,I bet  no one knows that they do all this good but there's no loyalty to their employees and that their employees can barley feed their families .to top it off especially at rimrock walmart just as im sure all walmart?there is so much favoritism ,it's really not a great company to work for most employees all feel the same way but there too afraid to say or do anything bout it"
bad,not exactly the most exciting minimum wage job.    you could find something that paid more no problem that would be much more exciting than walmart...........
bad,"Still can't believe the behavior. Multiple Imaged laptops in various states of repair were replaced only to have them restored and replaced the same night."
bad,While working for Walmart I met some amazing people. Walmart employment requires commitment and extreme sacrifices for advancement.  The company is a great stepping stone for management training. Walmart employment provides a diverse environment and practices an open door policies.
bad,Walamart was just not the right job for me! The other employees were sweet. But management didn't care about anyone!! And management showed favoritism!
bad,"Stressful place to work, don't get paid enough, and want you to do the job of five people. If you are lucky enough to have good coworkers, they can make it better though."
bad,Customers are often rude for no reason because of the reputation of Wal-Mart. Management expects too much of their employees. You are expected to make up any work of people who called off on top of getting done everything you have to do. Some customers and coworkers however made up for most of it.
bad,"Poor use of labor, most of the hard work was placed upon the logistical staff, even for other departments. I was poorly paid and treated as expendable."
bad,"At first the work was good and the hours alright but ad time went by and I learned more and more about not only my work but also every neighboring department I begun to realize that I was being made into a nameless drone, the hours began to out weigh the compensation"
bad,"never thing that you are going to be able to do you specific job title. they are always in high demand for cashiers so you would always be pulled from your job to assist. Expect to be reprimanded for not completing your task when this happens and dont, what ever you clock out after you shift is over. this is a big corporate NO!NO!"
bad,"It was my first job. I thought it would be easy and fun, kind of chill, but no, I barley had anything to do when I came in. Management was so unprofessional."
bad,The job was really hard. There was no direct order of work or where to start. It was definitely hard to get in balance with the work ethic there. I did meet great people at the job.
bad,"they suck as employers, I don't recommend working here for a long period of time. It's good if you're just doing for a little extra cash, but not for a career."
bad,"Empresa responsable y reconocida"
bad,A typical night includes stocking shelves away from anyone and everyone. No social interaction save for on breaks. Management expects too much out of you for little pay
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is just seeing the customer's smile after helping to find the items that they are looking for or to just talk about things.
bad,This is a man all man challenge  it is hard work  lifting heavy boxes   Wal Mart always brag about The pay  when everyone else is paying almost the same thing all Walmart want  is production  and that is fine
bad,This is an interesting starter job. It is not something I would recommend for long term and if you need health benefits I would suggest applying else where. Over the years the environment has become very unpleasant.
bad,"Its fast paced inviornment. They want everything to be right the first time , but they dont want to support you. My advice would be to just shop there and not work there."
bad,Its not that great. management sucks. its goin down hill the shoppers hate it . its really smelly. the customers are rude and racist. they take the customer is always right to a whole next level
bad,"you stand at a register all day long, have to wait for a manager to send someone over to cover your break or tell you to go, never know when that will be. They will schedule to work till closing one day and have you there to open the next"
bad,"fast paced store in a large town, stayed busy for all the hours I worked, I enjoyed those I worked with and would have like to have been able to have worked a days hours full-time."
bad,WORST PLACE TO WORK. would never apply here again. worst supervisors they would never have a schedule ready and also always had me to do other stuff as they would never have anything prepare for me to complete my original job
bad,The pay is horrible. The management treats you worse than you can imagine. It is very stressful and you feel underpaid and under appreciated. I cannot even explain everything you would have to put up with working here.
bad,"My time working at Walmart was at first manageable to a point. There were many expectations put on the average employee there, actually on every employee there, so much of the time everyone from the cashiers to the managers were high-stressed with little time to coach those who struggled with the workload. Like someone once told me, ""it takes a rare person to work there and stay there,"" and I have to say with pleasure that I am no such person."
bad,terrible place to work. They do not care about weather conditions if your are working outside whether it is raining or shining. Little to no breaks at all.
bad,"I would never work here again.  It sucks out your soul and will to live.  Always open, and forget about spending time with family during the holidays.  Management is always changing, and they don't take you seriously, ever.  Hardest part of the job is being treated like doo doo by customers who could care less."
bad,Too many chiefs not enough indians. Support managers try to hard pushing you to do things they couldn't complete themselves. Ive yet to see a support manage complete the task that they want you to do and on time. Never happened.
bad,"Walmart is a great company, but in the Walmart that I worked at, it was a little tedious and the management are very unorganized and not cooperative. The place is very bright which can kind of damage some customers' vision."
bad,I was a photo technician at Walmart I found the job really boring to the point were I looked forward to my shift ending so that I could leave an go home . The thing that stressed me out was working with cash machines that didn't work right when customers went to purchase something in the camera department you would ring up a customers stuff than the cash register would go down this happened everyday working their Also the manager of the department was bi polar one day he would be helpful an encouraging An the next he would be trying to fire you !
bad,Walmart is a job with ok benefits and gives you a chance to move up and make more money if it’s a fair company. It has a assisted to help with financial assistance for the associated
bad,Walmart is a good company but they treat their employees like they have to be in 10 places at once. the more you know is not always the best at Walmart.
bad,"When you go to work for Walmart you are told one thing, then it changes, then it changes again.  They will do anything NOT to pay ANY benefits, NOT to move you forward in the company, NOT to offer job security.  This is not a company that will go to bat for you.  They WILL leave you on the side of the road."
bad,Starting as a cashier to Asst. Manager step down from my kids. To Dept manager had to run many Dept. And not getting the time to run them the right way due short handed.
bad,It was my second job. For a teenager I think working at Walmart would be fine. But the Walmart where I worked at was unfair. Management was biased towards guys.
bad,Just to stressful not even help and they will get mad at you when everything could not get done and does a stress a lot of stress and always honest every time we turn around
bad,They started me at $6.30 per hour  and I was not given any credit for education or experience. Male counterparts were hired at a higher wage. Hourly employees aren't paid very well while management makes a lot more money and gets much larger bonuses. Usually MORE than what a full-time employee makes in a year plus their wages. Very top heavy company. Too many managers for the number of employees.
bad,A den of frivolity and inappropriate intimate behavior between management and employees. No support from management. The workplace culture was too gossipy and obscene
bad,I love working with my coworkers. They are very friendly. I love my customers. But management is not great. I never get enough hours in a week lately.
bad,"I was working part time, still attending school. Was told to provide full time school schedule and was still scheduled over my schedule for school. Hard to work with."
bad,"At the location I worked at, they picked favorites, and if you weren't on that list, you were treated horribly. Period. Don't work there. It's just not worth all the stress you put yourself under for people that don't care."
bad,Good for a while. Then they changed management. With that they started to changed my scheduled all the time and without warning. Very few positives about working there.
bad,"Not a good company to work for. Can't have a life with crazy hours and no set schedules. No job security, dont know how many hours you will have from week to week."
bad,"When I first started I wanted to learn the routine and they told me ""There is no routine just go fast in fact you are wasting time by asking questions"". I was not impressed. If you did not get 10,000 picks done by 12 am we got disciplinary action. That and if we were getting too close to overtime they would make us shave down the time by taking longer breaks and threatened to fire people. I was disgusted by Walmart."
bad,Productive and fun place to work because you get to meet new people everyday. And you also get to learn so many different aspects of customer service.
bad,My work schedule was very inconsistent. I do things that wasn't part of my original job description and they are not reliable with anything. I do not recommend this place to anyone who is starting work as their first job.
bad,"It was the worst job I have ever had.  Management was horrible and petty. Management did not respect the employees at all.  Over work you for the pay. They played games with you if you did not kiss up to them, showed favoritism.  Most managers did not have a clue of what their job was they could not teach you what they did not know themselves they put people in positions because of their relationship with them."
bad,Overall the work place was horrible. Lack of management skills and poor communication skills. also they over work you and expect you to stay overtime without overtime  pay.
bad,I loved the fast-paced work environment but there was no room for advancement nor raises. Then came time for them to lay off people and cut everyone that had only been there for under a year.
bad,"I love working with the public and the first few years at wal-mart were great! Then slowly the culture changed. Don't work for wal-mart, they understaff their stores and expect more and more of their employees with very little incentive to do so."
bad,"I worked at Wal-Mart for about a year, but in that year I was fired because of a medical condition called Ulcerative Colitis. They didn't do very much to protect my job when I was hired back in. They should really fix their 4 point rule for those who can't help it."
bad,Walmart was fun to work at for awhile but it has all gone down hill. They will not let me move around in the facility I’m stuck being a cashier. They give another new cashier another job right out from under me when I was next to have that job. I dislike almost everything there.
bad,"Walmart is a retail establishment that I would not recommend working at.  "
bad,Management is made up of people that have no idea of what they are doing as a manager. The upper management hires people they like for a manager position not who has the abilitiy/history of management.
bad,"Managers were horrible. At least my immediate manager was. Constantly changing the methods or procedures, but no proper training of employees. Day to day bullying or harassment."
bad,its stinks..... the managers and all that treat employess not good.... They are not very family friendly at all... They don't work with peoples family activites
bad,Work long hours with no pay and disrespect from managers. had to fight to get breaks and just overall treated like a slave. would not recommend working here
bad,I liked working with my co-workers. They were what made working at Walmart fun. The managers were a whole other story. Most of the ones I worked with were arrogant and uncaring.
bad,It's Wal-Mart. Cut throat atmosphere. There are extreme expectations. The wages are low. Not many hours. There are no benefits. Management is unprofessional.
bad,"If repeatedly being talked down to, yelled at, degraded and treated like nothing more than a number then this is a perfect job for you.  Management does not help morale at all."
bad,Mangament at walmart was lacking at best. The CSM's were not interested in actually managing other then socializing or talking to their friends and the management lacked the desire to hold CSM's or other employees accountable for policy violations or other violations. The pay is lacking as well someone with experience that should be making at least 10 to 11 an hour is started automatically at 9 and you have complete cbls to get to 10.
bad,"I have worked at walmart twice, both times were not to my liking. first time was as cashier and secnd time was for over night stocker. Cashiers do not receive any respect from the managers and are looked upon poorly. Overnight stocking was horrible because it was always under staffed. In my section of the store was suppose to always be two people stocking and they would only have one doing 12 hours worth of work in 8 hours."
bad,no advancement dont care about education no benefits and employees are not heard bad pay for amount of work required its good for a decent paycheck but not worth it
bad,I learned a lot working there but its a poor place to work fast paced poor management take you out of your comfort zone don't pay enough nor work enough hours its just not fair
bad,"Mangers in higher positions play favoritism, very  inconsistent with follow up, treat associates unfairly. I could go on with some of these stores. There has to be better places to work."
bad,"stocking supplies in every department everyday and using a pallet jack to move things as well... I learned how to first drive a forklift, and stock items in a warehouse and the department store. Management was poor. The hardest part of my job was stocking and the easiest was ringing up customers."
bad,"Short of devoting every ounce of yourself to Walmart, you will not be appreciated or capable of upward movement or utility. Unless you really need the job, you can do better."
bad,"Tienes buenas enseñanzas en cuento a ventas y como manejar reportes y auditorias ,sin embargo sus jefes y salarios son muy malos asi como sus culturas ."
bad,"They were inflexible about hours. You had to work wherever they wanted even if you were not hired for said position. If you were deathly sick, and even if you had a doctors note you would still get in trouble."
bad,"It's a place for young adults, good for people looking for part-time work, quick to fire people and high turnover, the environment is like being in high school"
bad,"You'll get paid nothing (but that makes economic sense) Don't take this job if you have a family, this is meant for college students and kids in or about to leave high school. The thing that really got to me was them changing the schedule while I was off work and then accidentally clocking in on my days off because I had no idea. This messed up a lot of important events in my life because of an unstable schedule constantly changing without any notification whatsoever."
bad,this was not a good job. i enjoyed meeting new people but they dont care about you or what you have to say. they are strict to those that actually do their job but not those that slack off.
bad,Company want you to work everyday of five days a week with little to no help frown on you when request a day off no concern when you have personal life issues such as dealth in your family offer no support at the job just criticism of job performance if you do something great. You won't here about it but if you don't do something to standard management is extra quick to point that out.
bad,"very stressful work enviroment, upper management had no idea how to do the job but expected lower levels to. every day consisted of nothing but being told you weren't good enough and the threat of lossing your job."
bad,Decent job if you want to gain some customer service experiene but you will have to work every holiday and weekend. The pay is ok with someone with a college degree but shouldn't be that much for someone with only a high school diploma.
bad,Wouldn't recommend to work here. Management is really disrespectful and unprofessional. Makes you work like a slave and pay so little. Unappreciative of your work. Can careless about your schedule or health. Just sucks.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was closing at night, had to move prescription bags from days 1-9 every night, prescriptions are held for up to 10 days.  Closed 4 registers nightly.  Sometimes had to help customers for 2-3 hours before a timed break.  Workplace was not very happy, someone was always mad at or disliked coworkers.  Too much talking on personal issues, making customers wait longer than expected.  Scheduling was not managed well.  Everyday 2-3 people called off making it difficult for others to work their regular shift or having to work extra hours unplanned for.  I also helped with the drive thru line, customers picking up prescriptions. Most enjoyable part was the friendly, courteous customers who knew me by name, and talked very graciously and were always appreciative for helping them."
bad,Be prepared to work a lot but just get a little bit of hours with no benefits and you have to get another job to make enough to eat. Management is all over the place. You have a lot of good with more bad. People play games here. Good as a Part-Time job and nothing else.
bad,"If you have medical issues, not the place for you. Made supervisor aware during interview and still got terminated 2 months in because of medical problems, WITH Dr. paperwork."
bad,Overall I would not recommend this job to anyone. They do not take things as professional as they could and do not let you change your availability hours or let you get time off unless put a couple months in advance
bad,"My days at Walmart were very tiring. I learned that great customer skills & how to keep customers happy. I also learned a lot about leadership. It was a couple of managers that I liked bc they treated me like a human being but mostly managers there break the policies more than the regular associates. The environment was very difficult to breathe in. I hated coming to work. Loved my job but I hated the environment & as far as being promoted, it was all about favoritism. The hardest part of my job was coming to work knowing I wouldn't be recognized for my work or not getting promoted. I loved the customers, they always made my day & I always made theirs."
bad,"If you can't find anything at all, work there. The only employed people at Walmart that are valued are the salaried staffers. The hourly employees are treated like useless dogs."
bad,"its just not my type of work environment, would love to find a better place to work. it was far from my expectations but someone has to do it i suppose"
bad,Walmart lacks motivation and energy. The morale among employees and csms is very negative and depressing. Everyone hates working there but lacks the skills to do anything different. Employees are not appreciated and are told on a regular basis that any monkey can do this job. It's sad how lazy and unmotivated the employees are...
bad,Everyday was something different you never did what you were paid to do. Learned to be patient with customers.Management was horrible Dont work there!
bad,The management was horrible not to much to say they just treated employees like garbage  and that's not how u run a business for it to be a multi billion dollar company the pay sucks
bad,Maestro de bizcocho durante 1 año  depende mucho de la gerencia de cada tienda no todos walmart son iguales
bad,"No room to succeed. This company does not appreciate their associates. Managment expects the impossible, setting you up for failure, not allowing you to succeed."
bad,"I have only been working here for a few months and I hate it so much. I try to stay positive but the management sucks, They work you more than you should be, the associates are rude (only some of them). I dislike it so much that I have called in sick like 20 times just because I hate it. The training/ trainers don't really help you. I got yelled at because I did not know about the communications book."
bad,"As far as my walmart in garden grove. Everything was absolutely Terrible from schedule to management. (Mostly Management)  Management was a joke didnt know how to run shop in the back room did absolutely nothing but yell and complain to our Cap 2 associates. As well with our supervisors. They all love to play favorites and will stab you in the back if it will give them a better chance at doing something with there life in walmart. The only decent part of walmart, were my co workers besides that stay away from Cap 2 garden grove."
bad,The job titles are very misleading. I applied as a sticker thinking I'd be stocking shelves and what not. Found out after I did all my online training that the job was actually pushing carts. The only stocking you did was water and fruit.
bad,"Management was horrible, scheduling was impossible and they over-work their employees. Pay was not good, either. Probably the worst job I've ever had.."
bad,"Having a disability, and working for a corporate entity is a joke. When you try to utilize the protections of intermittent leave, you can only see this safety net after having been with the company for a year. There is NO WAY to do this."
bad,"Definitely  would work there again, employees are super friendly and fun to work with. Wal-Mart has such a happy environment and it really is a nice and healthy workplace overall!"
bad,"I found this job through a temp agency so it was just a temporary position, also it was a new atmosphere because i had never worked as a sales associate but i enjoyed working there, and it was convenient being as tho is wasn't far for me to commute back and fourth to work."
bad,"Was  like working at a high school with all the drama and gossip ,you never knew what job you were going to be doing. You get hired on as a cashier then when you come in you do 20different jobs . understaffed but won't hire more people"
bad,Makes sure you're on time. There costumers can be a pain but that's all apart of retail right? The customers treat you any kind of way. Sunday's are the worst.
bad,The pay was horrible. The managers were uninformed and not very personable some were actually really awesome. the benefits were the worst I ever had the pay was way  below what it should be for the work you have to do.
bad,a typical day at walmart consist of manager yelling at workers like were slaves the hardest part about my job was trying to get the manager to understand where i was coming from far as when i was working on a project and trying to get it done.  the best part about working at walmart was the workers everyone was always smiling and getting alone with each other
bad,"A typical day at work started with getting the list of jobs needing to be done in that shift.  Then as i would do them i would get called to other parts of the store to do other peoples work.  I learned that i need to be stronger and more forward rather than just taking harassment from coworkers.  Management walked all over me and i felt like a little ant being crushed because those in management felt it was okay to harass those who were new.  The workplace culture was very crass, rude and inappropriate.  The hardest part about my job was not taking the harassment or judgement to heart.  The best part about working there was coming home.  I apologize but it was a very hard place to work."
bad,I have a lot of years experience to where I can be a supervisor ...if you are not multi culture and go through temp agency where they pay you nothing you can't get in I did apply outside of the agency and was working there for only minium wage
bad,"The managers were slave drivers that never had enough help to get all the stock done, plus the other shifts passed their work onto the late night shift.  All we had time to do was stock over eight full hours, and if you were even one second over your scheduled work hours they'd put you in a meeting with a manager for being overtime.  Not to mention the company cuts your hours to keep you under a certain income level so that they don't have to give you benefits for working."
bad,I did appreciate the customer service experience that I got during my employment. Leaning about retail and how it all works. The knowledge you gain can help you in so many ways
bad,I truly wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who is head of your household I've been stuck being Part time with this company for 3.5 years and can not take care of my children like this I only i truly think the company can do better
bad,"As a cashier, I was expected to gather cash from the designated office and assure the money stayed organized throughout my shift."
bad,"Great company to move up in. benefits are okay, very long hours, management is terrible and does not care about employees, its everyone for them self!"
bad,They let me work as many hours I wanted as long as it didn't make it over the part-time requirements. The work day usually went fast because the store is usually busy. I liked the relationship I had with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place all day long.
bad,"I liked applying to walmart. Orientation and all that was cool, they made the job sound like it was the best and then you start. They throw you under the bus in a difficult situation for an experienced worker and leave you high and dry with no help. Duncan OK Walmart. Not to mention they never rotate stock"
bad,"empresa con sueldos muy por debajo del esperado, los compañeros del área de trabajo son muy buenos teniendo en cuenta que sean de la misma jerarquía, la parte difícil de este trabajo era que no tenias tanto apoyo por parte de tu jefe inmediato mas que de tus lideres de equipo, lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente de trabajo a nivel tienda"
bad,Its a job for sure. I cant really say anything bad about them. There was a lot of hours and you got to meet a lot of people. There was a lot of work to do and its a job that will keep you busy
bad,You will get annoyed easily working for this company.They have no sympathy for time needed off or sick days. Takes a while to build benefits. Your days are consumed by walmart with pay that is not worth it.
bad,"This job is not professional, the morale is poor and cant pay bills and no upside to working here. There is no advancement and no positive side of growing with company."
bad,Bad place to work. High turn over rate. Claims to be family atmosphere to work in. Not at all! Department managers work together in stealing and coning money.
bad,Don't waste your time. All the managers care about is production. The employees have no say so in the job they are doing they do not care about you all they care about is production they will not hesitate to fire you for any little thing.
bad,The best thing would be the hours but that is if you are full time. But the pay could be way better for the work that they want you to do and the task they ask you to perform. Some management were very helpful but most only cared about themselves. The attendance policy is horrible for people who have families and young children. Walmart needs to seriously re look their ideas because they have strayed long from their core values.
bad,El salario es muy bajo lo que se percibe. Ante mano si se menciona cuanto es pero el tiempo elaborado contra el tiempo pagado no coinciden.
bad,This is the worst place to work at. The employees there don't really care much about it and you shouldn't as well. This is like the last option available. Anyone can get hired and fired within a second.
bad,"On a typical work day you will work about eight hours. The managers won't greet you and treat you and customers poorly. You'll be an hour to two hours late for a break or lunch, or even maybe until the system locks you out. On an average you will get paid $400-500 if you have 40 hours every took weeks. The good part is you meet awesome customers who are very sweet no all however. For cashiers the pay in NJ is $9.40 an hour."
bad,Worked as a cashier but often be placed in different positions due to lack of personal. You did not advanced based of performance but by how long you were in that position.
bad,most employees are nice and caring so the problem isn't the coworkers. Management is cruel and unbearable. I worked at Walmart for 2 years I worked full time hours but they refused to actually make me full time. so basically they scheduled the hours I wanted but refused to give me the benefits. I fought hard for full time and worked hard to get it. I was promised full time for 2 years by 4 different managers and yet I never got. Some of the managers would stuck me and everything that wasn't done they blamed on me even though I had coworkers that could have done what they wanted. they even yelled at me for things going bad in my department while I was on lunch. It got to a point I didn't even get breaks because they thought I needed to do everything yet I still wasn't even full time. they took away my right to have Sunday off for church and so many other rights as well.
bad,"This job is good for a get to where you want to go job."
bad,there will be days where you would have to work alone doing not only your job but the job of three other people.  Management did really help much when you needed help they were no where to be found
bad,"Loved the customers, and my CSM's, but the upper mng was not around and their thoughts on WALMART first doesn't work for me. I work because I have a family."
bad,"It is not a bad job. The management team could be better. The pay could be better, and the associates that are hired need to be older then high school age."
bad,Terrible place for employees. This place isnt for the workers at all. It is not a good place. It does not help progression nor does it help personal gain
bad,"I enjoy the people I work with but the atmosphere of the store brings you down. I am part-time and don't have a set schedule so I can never plan family events without having to take time off. "
bad,i work there for 1 year and got laid off because of another person the management is not the best if you plan on working here don't go to target you will be treated better
bad,This job was exhausting and caused me severe anxiety. I would frequently get distressed and dizzy at work and need to sit down and nobody would come help me. They would leave me up front with up to 15 customers in one line. I'm older now so I could probably handle the job better now. Their pay at the time was awful.
bad,Working at Walmart was a temporary position for a summer to work in a place of management where I was able to oversee departments and work directly with a manager
bad,restock shelves help customers break down boxes take out the trash help out other department with inventory and take an annual inventory of the whole.
bad,My opinion is they do not give you enough hours to make it worth your while. You have to work full time to get insurance. They were constantly calling me in on y days off. I was down to 12 hours when I left to work for Cintas
bad,"I started working here shortly after my husband was discharged from the military to help fund our family. On a daily basis, I felt like I was constantly butting head with management if not the customers. Some employees will tell you that its best place they've ever found a home in. I unfortunately have to disagree. I never felt valued, I felt expendable. Which on frequent basis, a manager will tell you that you are. The pay isn't enough to sustain a family . I had to come to work 2 days after having a baby because my FMLA wasn't approved, which I was told that if I didn't they would terminate me. During those 6 weeks, it was all unpaid leave."
bad,"Horrible work experience managment needs to be upgraded, and peiple nee to follow rules ans stop lacking. Just not enogh pay to put up with people bull!!"
bad,"Walmart has No Vacation pay,No absence time off,No late's,No compensations..PTO and No Vacation pay I did not get a penny for my 1 year vacation....Walmart will terminate you if you get 4 lates in 6months.Walmart has good insurance .."
bad,"everything about this job is wrong, they pick favorites. they really don't care they put you where they need you and the pay is not good for anyone who wants to have there own place"
bad,"not many work hours available. "
bad,I liked working for Walmart learned a lot of different thing's and met a lot of great people.The customers was so open to me and when they told me they feel like the could tell me anything then  knew right from that moment what my calling purpose was and it was to follow my dream and help people that's in need or just need help or someone to talk to about there day's.
bad,The manger was grumpy and when given a direction it wasn't always clear. Managers were always stressed out with work load. Their wasn't a team feeling. It was a click of Associates.
bad,"Temporary job from the start and did not treat people equally. Lack of communications between the manager's,supervisors, and the worker's."
bad,"Revenue based company with minimal concern for their staff.  Too much favortism within the organization.  They push their cashiers to sell Mastercards to customers that are not interested.  If no attempt made, you get written up by management."
bad,The pay is good that is something I did like. They ask for your availability but I would always end up scheduled during class time no matter how many times I corrected them. They said they would give me 25 hours when I had heavy load courses but still gave me close to 35 hours or 36 hours. There were people that needed more hours so I do not understand why they didn't give more hours to those who needed them.I was very happy and cheerful at first but management can be very rude and my cheerfulness didn't last. Management doesn't communicate and it causes a lot of problems. Some of the managers are not very well trained and do not know how to handle certain situations in a professional manner. Some members of management are really good but the majority doesn't seem to care or know what they are doing. When I finally confronted them about my scheduled hours there was retaliation from my supervisor. I asked around and other associates (not just students) that work there have gone through the same situation. They do not follow the policy the way they should which often causes a lot problems with customers.
bad,"My experience at Walmart Super center in Utica, NY was terrible. It was ok the first few months. Management was OK, i made a lot of friends working there and i loved my assistant manager and department manager. We had a very good relationship. Over time things had changed, management had changed a lot, some people left and went to different stores, the store manager got fired for the way he ran the store. It was a lot of favoritism going on within the company. Other than that it was ok. A typical work day involved clocking in, going to my department and getting started on freight. Putting product on shelves and making the aisle look nice, after i was done with that i would go outside and help with loading customers vehicles and mop and sweep. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the different personality's of different customers. the most enjoyable part was payday, lol. just kidding. i enjoyed what i did very much and i was very upset when i had to part ways, but everything happens for a reason.."
bad,The company seems to overlook the hard work of the stock clerks. The managers on third shift do not show concern for the physical needs of their employees. They just want the workers to get the job done regardless of their physical well being.
bad,Walmart is not like the commercials on television. The pay at the time was terrible and there was not much room for advancement. Some managers were better than others.
bad,was mistreated very professional and underpaid by the management hardest part of the job was pleasing supervisors who didnt want me there the best part was making others happy
bad,"Horrible management, associates and customers. Everyday was loke going to a place where people either looked down on you or customers talked down to you. The store was not the cleanest place and the atmosphere was always turbulent."
bad,Worked for Wal-Mart in high school and again 2015 until the close of the end of the year and love working at Wal-Mart but sadly like most job every is friendly  until faced with a situation where if able to toss under the bus Wal-Mart will and my store seems to only hire and advance their friends or family members so not to award the hard working and devoted employees my suggestion is if getting a job their do it as a stepping stone to finding a better career or some to help with money while perusing college.
bad,"Walmart only cares about Walmart and not it's employees. Management is terrible. They do not handle personal issues well, such as illness or any sort of harassment at the workplace."
bad,the job was very easy but management was very poor and unorganized. they did everything last minute and was all over the place with instructions.  they even had to fire 3 managers including the store manager
bad,"Your Supposed to recieve a raise for 6 months every three months. When it came time, i was told i had to be completely done with training, and they put a 33 day hold on my training and I only had 2 sections left before graduation. So that isnt true. "
bad,Great place to work but they are very strict on scheduling and attendance. You don't have a set schedule and they don't really work with you on your needs.
bad,Very unprofessional and not very safe when you're the only person in the store working but also have to stock the cooler . Not very trustworthy
bad,Management does not treat you well at Walmart. The training is also minimal for cashiers. Dealing with the poor management and customers day to day was horrendous.
bad,"Sucked. It really really sucked. I didn't enjoy anything about it, got yelled at for stupid bull and never moved up the corporate ladder. So it sucked."
bad,"Walmart is the evil empire of corporate America. The only good part is the people on the ground-level, the ones that keep Walmart running, there is where you can find true, caring friends. "
bad,"Walmart I have to say was one of the worst places I have ever worked at. They expect you to work miracles.  They don't care about your family because they make you work ever holiday. If you call out once it is the end of the world. I would never recommend anyone working at this place they just don't care about anything, except money."
bad,Work all day and will cut your overtime any way they can either sending you home early or making you take a longer lunch. no room for progress in this area
bad,"The management is not friendly, or helpful. You get fired very easily. You cannot make a single mistake. I did not enjoy my time here."
bad,"they are rude and not helpful at all, The managers make you feel like you are the lowest of the low just for working there. They give you a write up if you don't take you lunch on time, but they wont come to help if you are with a customer and you have to go to lunch!"
bad,"This was my worst job ever.  I still got my work done, but they treat people very7 poorly here.  There is really something wrong with the people who work here.  They might be on drugs."
bad,"I worked for Prime Time Nutrition for almost a year. When I was on break from school the work hours were suitable however, when school started back for me those work hours conflicted."
bad,too many management telling one person what to do. company isn't family oriented. Awesome co workers. Pay isn't enough for all the responsibilities they want you to do
bad,I started as a cashier and ended up leaving after being moved to unloading trucks due to health reasons. I learned the limits of my body
bad,I just felt like the management could use a little more professionalism. it was a lot of things that I would improve on if I had the opportunity to do so but it just wasn't a workplace for me.
bad,"I recommend this as a stepping-stone job only. As a low-level employee, you are hardly respected or treated as a real person. Often times ridiculous hours are still considered part-time positions."
bad,"I had a manager who referred to the employees as money."
bad,Not an understanding company at all. Horrible managers and lazy staff. Will never work for this company again. Barely like to shop here!
bad,"job is held over your head like a figurative carrot, management does not view you as human and you will be terminated for anything not in your control"
bad,"An  improvement can be done in communication between manager and supervisor better, especially when it comes to giving shifts to employees working day shifts and evening shifts. Display's set up for holidays should be done at an APPROPRIATE time, basically stop putting them out early, customers have complained about this."
bad,Management was not helpful in resolving scheduling issues. Breaks were unpredictable in times they were given. The rules spelled out in the training manual and on computer based training sessions were routinely disregarded at the discretion of the CSM on duty.
bad,"horrible management and they don't care about promotions. they only care about the higher bosses even though there already billionaires."
bad,The workers are great at walmart. The managers  are the people that would make you frown upon that particular  Walmart The entire time I worked there it was hard to deal with management.
bad,I left Walmart because I became part time as well as so many other full time employee and lost my benefits. Walmart as a company doesn't treat the employ fairly. They try to get as much work out of the least amount of employees. No one really liked their job because of this. Managers at Walmart didn't even seem to like their job. Everyone was just going through the motions for a paycheck.
bad,The management is more concerned with their bonuses than taking care of the customers or employees. They get bonuses for cutting salary so they have one associate cover five departments.
bad,"it was nice working there."
bad,"They are horrible to their employees. Was suppose to be on mod duties and they neglected what wsib had told them...i 100% hated working there. Some of the empolyees weren't bad though, some never showed up for work and got promoted to manager because they were attractive."
bad,"Overnight crew is expected to do all the stocking, merchandising, and cleaning, without recognition or compensative pay.  Hardest part of this job is not having enough crew to work with and no safety adherence."
bad,The managers were rude and they discriminated against me. They also weren't very organized. I have no intentions on working for walmart again. They told me they had a policy against discrimination and didn't follow that policy.
bad,"Worked at Walmart for about 12 months and was not impressed by management team, issues unresolved, hours cut and stripped of all benefits. I would not recommend this job to someone without management and customer experience"
bad,"The job itself was easy but some of my co-workers would bully me which is why I quit. The management was ok after my supervisor moved stores, she made fun of me for something I don't have any control over. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish the isle assigned to you in the time given for you to do so as well as helping customers and staying out of their way while shopping. the most enjoyable part of the job was making sure everything looked perfect at the end of each shift as others are finishing up their duties they help eachother."
bad,The management for Walmart was not only unsuccessful but poor. My day consisted of poor managers being completely rude and disrespectful to not only the customers but the employees themselves. There were good days and there were bad days. It kind of just happened to be very toxic.
bad,A very very strict working environment not allowed to much flexibility with schedule as well as with the way u have to work it's like a dictatorship very miserable place
bad,Over worked for low pay. Once they make you full time they cut your hours and after paying or all benefits for a year you can finally use them. not worth the wait. rude and difficult to work with management.
bad,They cut your hours randomly and they are not a professional company management is terrible. They have favoritism.
bad,It's not a place to work if you are looking for a career that you will appreciate and enjoy. Almost like modern day Egypt with the Israelite slaves.
bad,co-workers were great the locaion no so much would see alot of wierd things and people glad i was right next to the police officer the whole time
bad,Company was great! The people i worked with were team oriented and everyday was a challenge. Advancement opportunities were available if you worked hard and and showed great customer service
bad,I could not stand working here. The management constantly made the employees look as if they did not know what they were doing just to cover up the mistakes they did which in turn caused extra work for the employees.
bad,"No one really knew what was going on the entire time I was working there. The associates were not treated well, and before I resigned, they were firing people left and right who had been there for 20+ years for the smallest reasons just to save a buck since each employee gets a small raise each year they work there."
bad,"Management is very poor."
bad,They were very bad at scheduling they would change your schedule without any notice they were very slack on breaks they would take forever to get to your line to help and you can see them standing there laughing and talking and the attitudes were out of this world
bad,the management staff at wlmart think they are are very high and mighty.... there are a few good ones but not most walmart is a huge company and you are just a number
bad,"I learned a few new skills, and met a lot of life long friends but , the management really sucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
bad,"most unprofessional place I have ever worked. do not apply they will treat you bad and unprofessional, they have attitudes with you and do not care about if your nice to customers or if your rude to them"
bad,"Job was part time, placed in areas needed work. Worked less than 18 hours per week. Primary job was to work in the bakery making cakes and cookies. Gathering store carts when needed. Receiving and storing incoming supplies in warehouse."
bad,"constantly being accused of cellular use even though I always left it in my vehicle, I even proved it, yet the said I was on it while I was unloading a truck and they still said ""your temporary assignment has ended with us"" poor pay, I was one of the hardest and motivated workers there, unloading a truck packed with boxes normally 2100-2400 pieces by hand, and for 7.75 an hr and only got paid every 2 weeks,"
bad,"A typical day at work is stocking the floor with freight. Have a clean an presentable zone for the next morning before customers walk into the store. I have learned how to do picks for the back room, i have learned how to check for stock that needs to be on the shelf. Management can do better with communication with each other and sales associates. My job is not hard. I enjoy doing everything and learning new things, and meeting interesting customers everyday."
bad,Walmart is entirely too large to be so cheap when it comes to their employees and benefits. The attendance policies are absolutely unreal and the management is HORRIBLE!
bad,The people I worked with where good but the management didn't care and never bothered to take anyone's opinion into consideration and were extremely aggressive
bad,It started as a good pace to work. I had started as a cashier and worked my way up to pharmacy tech. I enjoyed my job helping customers with RX's and finding things out on the floor. I learned so much about the different medications. Management however was not good. They would change your schedules with out notice and when I became pregnant they started trying to push me out. I loved most of the people I worked with.
bad,"walmart, is such a busy place to work at and customers are always on you about something and it never ends, but for the time i was there it was alright and an learning experience."
bad,A job is a job but over half the management is terrible. The bad workers can do whatever they want and they get on the good ones backs.
bad,"I learned a lot as far as customer service. "
bad,"When I first came to Walmart it was a great work environment, as I progressed through my tenure there, management began to change, employees turned on one another and other co-workers were rude. I do not recommend working there if you cannot stand people being biased, and quick to turn their back on each other. They were awful with working with me on my school schedule, one manager told me I had to work on a day I had final exams, I failed my finals and he asked me was the time off needed after my finals were done and graded. I have seizures and they tried everything possible to have me come into work one day shortly after being hospitalized for a seizure, I will never work there or any Walmart ever again."
bad,"with the hours they was giving me, i was barely able to make rent, i worked so hard to get a raise or even a promotion, it never came"
bad,i hated this place from day one but they paid my cell phone bill at the time. i wouldn't reccommend those jobs to very many people
bad,Typically I would work 12 hours a day plus. My direct line manager is abusive. The company feels it can do what ever it wants to its salaried managers.
bad,I worked at walmart for another 6 months as a cake decorator . It was alot of work and some times stressful because more to do and not enough time to get it all done waiting on customers and stocking it was hard to get it all done to leave on time.
bad,"I enjoyed my time there. The customers make it fun, I really enjoyed my customers they make it worth wild. The work was easy for me because I like people."
bad,the management at wal-mart is not that good they don't treat the workers fairly and are very rude. i learned that the customers come first and customer service is a great deal. my coworkers talk about each other behind their backs and start drama. the enjoyable day is when i'm in electroincs working
bad,Its always busy I learned a lot out of this company the management are ok to work with the co workers it all depends on who you assoicalize with the hardest part of the job is having to bite your tongue when customers get very rude and snotty for no reason but i do a good job not being rude back
bad,"They do not follow the practices that they preach.  Each store manager makes his/her own rules. and corporate offices allow this to continuously go on.  False advertising of real employment technities.  They say you start at $9/Hr. and will go to $10/Hr. in Feb., 2016.  What they do not say is that they have cut hours of current employees and their pay raises in order to offer people off the street this good OPPORTUNITY to become a Walmart employee!  Most people who work for them are under-educated and can not get another job somewhere else.  Hardest part of the job is to just say ""yes, how high do you want me to jump"", and the best part are most of the customers that they serve."
bad,While being to work at Walmart I loved working there. But as time has gone on they do not accept doctors note for when you are absent so you end up getting written up after so many absences even if you have doctor notes. I love the coworkers that I have they are all so sweet and we are like family except the managers because it feels like they are more concerned about money and their title then taking care of customers and their employees
bad,crazy work schedule and long hours no benefits. Rude customers low pay just horrible !!!!!! no vacation or sick time to use after 1 year! smh
bad,dissapointing work place not supportive management team not courteous to employees unless your a type of management they treat you like your a no body
bad,"working here was a bit challenging at times. the people, including co-workers were sometimes rude. the scheduling was horrible, I didn't really have a life working there"
bad,"By far the worst company I have ever worked for. Not only do the customers treat you like you're on a lower level than them JUST because you work at Wal-Mart, the employees are the most rude. You might get just enough hours in 1 day to work but you will end up feeling like a slave! Management and customers do not care about you. Worst place to shop AND work."
bad,"I worked hard as a temp to hire but then when the time came was let go. Wasn't too happy about that. Also, during work shifts, I had like 5 managers to report to which made the day long, confusing, and tiring. Had to juggle all five managers' requests and explain what I was doing several times to each one."
bad,"Mean people. No structure to the job requirements. Poor management. Disrespectful. Did not acknowledge the fact that when I was working there I was in my senior year of high school so scheduling had to be around my schooling, they would give me late nights, and times to work when I was supposed to be in school."
bad,"Management is absolutely ridiculous, associates are pretty great. Customers are customers as with anywhere you work. I typically worked evenings and the store manager is some kind of psycho."
bad,Management did not listen to other employees. They make you do things without giving you the permissions to do them. The company cuts corners and violates numerous state work laws. You can do you very best and every time they will tell you it was not good enough. I am truely sorry for anyone who works at this place. I would shovel manure for 12 hours a day before I worked here again.
bad,"if you like working as a cashier then its ok, not my best experience long lines and long periods of standing and having to remind them its your break time because they dont remember. at that time i was 18 and id get angry costumers cause i couldnt ring up beer for them. so not pleasant job if your just getting out of high school"
bad,Walmart was a great experience for me. I learn how to run the frontend. customer service. People just work there to work.
bad,I enjoy meeting new faces and even seeing common faces. No set schedule so I'm usually working all over the place. My availability is open but still I get minimum hours.
bad,"Wal Mart - what you see is what you get. There are too many negatives to even remember the positives - or maybe there were no positives. It was along time back and very grateful I do not work there anymore and hopefully I will never have to work there again to pay bills.  Stingy owners who do not pay workers what they are worth - they would rather see amounts in their bank accounts increase above all else. Again would only work there again if I had to pay my bills, but would move on as quickly could. It was the most aggravating place I have ever worked."
bad,Walmart is such a big corporation that it fails to see their employees' accomplishments and or abilities to move up within the company. I could honestly say I'll never work retail like walmart again.
bad,"Very stressful job, never enough associates to handle workload and if we did have enough management would move associates to different areas or send someone home. Managers would cut schedule to keep associates from getting full 40 hours so they didn't have to offer insurance and benefits."
bad,not a good place to work. the only enjoyable part of my day was lunch and talking with some co workers. only worked there because a needed a job at the time.
bad,did not enjoy my 14 moths that i was here. I do not recommend a job at Walmart at all i do not know what else to sayb fgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgfdgf
bad,"Work you like a dog. Does not care about work/life balance. Very rude and power tripping management. HR shuts door, does not respond to any calls. If advanced your then mocked and knocked down. When questions are asked to management, they ignore and laugh."
bad,"I always wanted to work for Walmart. I have tried to get a job there for years. And when I finial got the job with them I wish that I didn't. Management was poor, and need a lot of work. Now they have new management and it is better."
bad,If I would have known that my boss' family had a disagreement with my in-laws I would have never been happy about this job.  I never got time to request time off.  Management often talked down to me.  When I needed to switch schedule for school they gave me a lecture on policy and procedure.  Now all the cute young boys got to do whatever they wanted.
bad,"Typical day at work, with too much criticism of employees.  Some perks include decent lunch hours and some breaks. The hardest part of the job is, not being able to respond to every phone call."
bad,"Excellent corporation, product selection and business model.  Depending on store, can be an excellent learning tool for operations.  Success of operation depends on staffing and dedication to customer service.  If those commitments are met, the store will succeed."
bad,"It was okay to start a job placement, but not for a long term career or to pursuit an area of interest in at least not in the optical department."
bad,"Walmart is the worst company to work for, they are not fair, they work you hard and do not pay well and they receive bad ratings daily. I like a company that treats everyone equal."
bad,They don't have enough resources to teach you well and they don't really care about your life outside of work. I tired getting help to accommodate to my kids life and needs but they refused to help any further more. Personnel is knowledgeable but any other is not.
bad,"i didnt like the hours nor the days and never really had a weekend off"
bad,"It's Walmart. And being a cashier, you can't expect much. It got crazy during weekends and lunch hours, as well as the first Friday of the month. However, the management was flakey and people were being fired left and right. Mostly for really dumb things. People who have been there forever were being fired for being a few minutes late.  This made me very upset because I knew they were doing this to hire younger people they could start out with less pay. Also, I would have been left out in Lawn in Garden by myself for hours with no back up at the cash registers when I needed it most. Associates were walking on eggshells and most loathed coming into work."
bad,My job at Walmart was the least enjoyable job. I couldn't enjoy working there due to all of the corruption on the job. Nobody could really get along and it is never fun working with people who cant stand each other. At the same time management does nothing to change these problems.
bad,"National vision inside of Wal-Mart was great when I was doing my extern ship after completing my American career college optician program was great, but after being hired at another location same company I have come to the conclusion I would prefer working at a privet practice. Most of the national vision employees are good people."
bad,"I assisted customers with their photography orders; organized the orders that had been sent out and returned for the customers; rang up the sales and cleaned up the area."
bad,Wal-Mart isn't a place for advancement. They treat the female employees not good. I was not happy working there. There wasn't a brake down of chain of command.
bad,Just had to put clothes back from the fitting room.  It paid the bills at the time while I went to school. Not a great company to work for for long term.
bad,"I would rather not say anything about this job. It looks easy; but was not.  As an Event Specialist I was known as a Demonstration/ Sampler type job where I had a cart with a product and sometimes information available concerning the product, and the public would usually take a sample of the product."
bad,"It is a big company that likes to hire within, it allows associates to move up in the company. There's always something to do so it's a high demanding company to keep customers satisfied."
bad,notienen respeto por sus políticas de  respeto por el individuo ni calidad de vida
bad,"A typical day at work is providing customer service and making sure people find what there looking for. Also making sure shelfs are stocked and freight is handled. I haven't really learned anything, but with management they don't really care. I witnessed a medical emergency in the parking lot, and I told management and they didn't do anything they just said oh well. Someone else had to call the cops. Its like a middle school in the work place, everyone gossips and talk behind everyones back. Its not a very fun place to work."
bad,the management was not good. It was hard to go to school and work because they never worked with my school schedule. The hardest part is working with the customers and trying to handle different situations
bad,All Wal-Marts are the same. My safety was in danger and management did nothing. They push their best workers out the door by the way they treat them and they always wonder why their best end up quitting.
bad,My job at Walmart consisted of unpacking boxes and restocking the shelves which taught me organization and how to complete multiple task in a certain amount of time.
bad,"I personally didn't enjoy working here. It was less personal than other jobs, I was never called by the same name more than once with some of the higher ups. I was let go for having a nose ring, even though there were several other people that had a facial piercing... I didn't feel appreciated or respected.."
bad,"Your work is unappreciated and half the crew will set there and let you do all the work, and by the end of your shift when all the things that are supposed to finished arn't then they will all blame you."
bad,"I felt that the managers were not fair. They had certain picks that they would show favortism to. Pay was good. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. If you put in for time off in advance, sometimes they wouldnt let you, but would let others off at no advance time."
bad,"Walmart doesn't pay well. They have long lines and wont help the employees provide the customer service skills needed to provide excellence to the customers,"
bad,"No one actually showed me how to perform my job. The supervisor made me ""tail"" him as if I were his personal pet, performing tasks that he was too lazy to do himself. The environment was completely unprofessional. Other employees stayed on their cellphones and there was no type of discipline. Walmart sucks. You would have to be there for at least 30 years of your life to actually achieve some sort of promotion or recognition. The store manager had no college education but bragged about his position of power."
bad,"Not a good company as it pertains to the work-life balance. Management team members are expected to work 60-80 hrs a week on a 40 hr. salary. Change must happen immediately, not healthy."
bad,I enjoyed the customers. Coming into work everyday and being able to interact with the customer was the highlight of my job
bad,"Management showed favoritism  toward certain associates,was very rude and was always saying negative things about everything. The job itself was easy and I loved it."
bad,"I would go to work as a cashier, but end up doing every department in the store, because the managers failed to either schedule some one or hire someone for a particular department. Our management at the Wal-mart I worked at were the poorest excuse of managers being that they never were there for the workers when needed and they just took advantage of the employees at there leisure. The co- workers was okay we all had to endure the struggle of the management giving us a hard time and not try to work or put forth effort to make us a successful store. The most enjoyable part of the job was making my customers happy."
bad,It was not well set up. The management is rude and there is no room for a female to move up. The pay was unfair and the store in general was just not enjoyable
bad,The Vernon store can not be rated with other Walmarts. This store tends to treat its employees like children. I have learned a great deal working for Walmart they do have some good programs company wide. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart is the associates I work with. The  hardest part of this job is the way you are treated management is a joke at this store.
bad,"Very productive and efficient, fun place to work. Fast pace and great people to teach you and to learn from. Hardest part is getting know each and everyone that makes the company a great place to work"
bad,"I think it was alright starting at first and then the managers stopped caring about you, I was working for 2:00pm -6.30pm without a break."
bad,"First down stack frozen, dairy, packaged meats and bakery; deliver merchandise to appropriate departments. Secondly, stock frozen dairy packaged meats. Scan overstock into system for those departments then help in dry goods inventory. Helps you learn do's and don't's of inventory; receiving merchandise; good house keeping; and working as fast as you can. Management was lacking. Next to them telling you to hurry up, there wasn't much there. this is because higher level management would force them into positions that required them to respond this way. Co-workers were okay. Not a restricting environment as to the break room and areas, and if you can work and talk you had no problem with a little socializing."
bad,relaxed enviroment. could tsske your time noone huvers over you. the people were nice
bad,Walmart does not help new employees do their jobs they throw you in the deep end without any instruction
bad,"Wal-Mart as a company is very unfair to the employees a lot especially during the night shift we get most of the blame for anything that happens in the store we barely get good reports, the managers aren't really good at there job they don't know how to operate half the equipment but they are shift leaders. ive learned nothing since ive been here the hardest part of the job is night shift and not earning enough pay I don't enjoy the job at all"
bad,I started when the store was new and wen u need the management the most the was to lazy to do anything except one.
bad,customer service forklift scissorlift checking in invoices and po# merchandising price changes loading and unloading of merchandise
bad,"Use to be where a person could take pride in thier work at Wal-mart, but now it is micro-maneged. No more thinking on your own and feeling satisfied and proud. Even the customers suffer. It is not a good career move anymore to be working for Wal-mart. I hope to find a place where customer service matters, foremost, and as a number one priority.."
bad,Management are tyrants. The employees look like zombies and all you get is 1 measly dollar for working the graveyard shift. I was glad when they let me go because if I worked there any longer I would have been in the graveyard.
bad,you start your day by clocking in and finding your place. checking your area and fixing your bags.
bad,"I started out being an over night stalker with small raises quarterly if your performance was above par, which i started out in the low 7's and ended up with 11 dollars an hour. Gradually, things changed Wal-Mart started treating the employees like their product (More for Less). Employees are over worked and i can't speak for all locations but the one i worked for in gainesville florida. Their for 5 years and i would never work their or recommend them to anyone."
bad,never feeling good enough no matter how hard you work. always being threatened by the managment team ..
bad,not I place I would consider working at again. Not enough ethic in the job place
bad,A typical day at Walmart would be to work your job and help customers. The Co-workers at Walmart are very nice people to work with.  The hardest part of the job is lifting more than 20  heavy garbage bags and putting them in the compactor.  The walking around the store from bathroom to bathroom cleaning them and restocking them.  I enjoy talking with the customers and giving them my advice if need be.
bad,If you want flexible and benefits this is not he place for you to work. Just read the media
bad,"Cashiered, Bagged, Waited on Customers, put bags on mine and other coworkers when not busy. Zoned products"
bad,"Most of there normal freight is a 1700 piece truck. And even with that they still don't have enough employee's to get it put away. With the holidays coming up there trucks are doubled but yet expect the same amount of employee's to get things done."
bad,"From the outside looking in the job seemed to be a great new start for me. However, the management is not on the same page (one manager will tell you one thing and another will tell you the complete opposite)."
bad,for someone trying to get on their feet this is a place to start and branch out to other places.
bad,"Employees let their personal feelings interfere with their work relationships."
bad,their are no words to describe this job..... over worked with little pay and no benefits....
bad,"Managers blow you off"
bad,our managers would never have our materials in our station to do our job our managers never helped us when help was needed. manager would never  be involved with the department unless her managers where in the store
bad,its walmart job sucks what can you ask for no one wants to work at walmart
bad,Loved all of the people that I worked with. Management was not always so easy to work with
bad,"a typical day at work here is drama filled and childish , one thing I had to learn was time management. Walmart managers are the most unqualified people on the face of the earth. Rudeness was daily, micromanaging and constant dictatorship. My coworkers were all pretty nice people im still friends with them to this day. the hardest part of the job for me was the constant nagging by my managers over the smallest of things, another thing was the pay rate.There wasn't any joy at walmart"
bad,Get to work clock in and do my job help customersout with any questions they might have or check them out
bad,"The unloading crew currently has the most problems. There's no one to supervise them and everything is always in a chaotic mess. Only a handful of managers actually know what they are doing and it seems like no one gets trained on how to do stuff properly. The store itself is a mess, prices are missing, etc. The store manager is indecisive and can't take action on anything. He is oblivious to the store's overall problems and doesn't fix things glaring him right in the face. The store needs way more leadership and direction from everyone higher up, as the people in charge now take advantage of their break times and like to pretend they don't have many responsibilities or people under them that they should be trying manage and make better workers."
bad,Work Here Was Very Easy But The Staff Made It Hard By Not Doing There Job
bad,I dident like this job at all the management was childish and the coworkers were as well
bad,"waited on customers that are wanting deli meat, and cheese. I also made sure that all the customers where happy and pleased with  their food that they have gotten."
bad,I think the best part of working at walmart are the customers. Ive learned to be patient while helping the customer pick out their choices.
bad,"providing service"
bad,Managers are rude and treat employees as if they are lower than them. Hours are always being cut. Employees are forced to preform job duties that aren't in their job descriptions. I would not recommend anyone to work at this Wal-Mart.
bad,Walmart doesn't listen. Breaks happen some time if not at all. The registers don't work. If you talk to the manager and let them know there is a problem nothing is done about it. Customers are the number one concern and Walmart doesn't care about customer service.
bad,"They find any reason to fire their employees to cut down labor. It doesn't matter if they have been there 4 years or 40 years, they will find a way."
bad,Typical day was helping customers with what they were looking for or needed. My first time learning about the role of a management position. management wasn't as good as it should have been. co-workers and i got along and worked very well together. The hardest part of the day is when registers went down or when co-workers couldn't come in i would help out and take the spot. Most enjoyable part of the day is at the end of the day.
bad,Unloader is the hardest job physically. Your only in warehouse non stop on feet entire time unloading trucks while being timed. The most memorable part of job is coworkers teaming up to help each other. Maintain friendships to date.
bad,You get what you see whenever you go into a Walmart. Its not the worst place but it shouldn't be a long term career choice.
bad,"Midnight is a very hard shift to do, Many different personalities within management makes it very difficult for fair environment."
bad,it was hardwork and i did move up but mainly wasent benifical to have a managment job.
bad,"I enjoy working their."
bad,Working at Walmart was stressful and management was very unorganized.
bad,"Exigencia al maximo todos los dias, no tienes vida publica y se denigra al trabajador como en ninguna otra parte, no tienes derechos y el maltrato laboral es el pan de todos los dias"
bad,When I first started this job I honestly didn't mind it. Management seemed nice and so did other employees. But after about 3 months they started to show their true colors. Management would tell you one thing and then yell at you for it not even an hour later. For example I was told we could clock in 5 minutes early as long as we either clocked out 5 minutes early or took 5 extra minutes on our lunch. Well I did this for almost 6 months and once the 6 months was over they gave me a paper saying they marked me as absent from work for 2 days because of all the early clock-outs and clock-ins I had. Who does that?? I was also told when hired in that I would get 32 hours a week guaranteed and that I'd be working on the sales floor. Well 4 months into the job I got cut down to 20 hours and they wanted me to do registers when I had never been trained on them! They lie and try to get you to quit. My friend who worked with me was employee of the month twice and they told him he didn't qualify for a raise on his anniversary as well. Nothing they do makes sense and all they do is lie and cheat their employees out of the money they earn.
bad,Customers for the most part is what made my day most enjoyable. I Loved my regular ones and always enjoyed seeing new faces as well. I also liked that my managers felt as i done a good job and found me capable of doing many different jobs. But i did not like having an hour lunch most days.
bad,When I started to work for Wal-Mart it was great. After a couple of years I started to why people refuse to shop ans support Wal-Mart because how they treated employess
bad,"Not the best company to work for. the worst work experience ever,"
bad,its a job to get a check but other then that if you want friends don't look there
bad,I hated working for walmart. They treat their employees like unfair!
bad,Definitely a position which developed my personal  attributes to which I would become better suited to daily dealings with customers.
bad,not the best work environment. managers pick on associates and create a negative work environment. ive seen them harass associates until they cry. and make them feel bad about themselves.
bad,"Overall good experience, some days could challenging. Every days is different, with different obstacles."
bad,"There wasn't much about the position at Walmart that I liked, except I met a fistfull of nice customers, & that was about it. There were a couple of customer service managers that were nice to me & understood me, but the rest were just plain horrific people."
bad,I dislike the company because managment does not recieve enough training.
bad,IF you can find any other job dont pick this one. You are over worked and under paided
bad,I loved working overnights.  I got to enjoy the day.  But some employees were not friendly.
bad,"The management was poor that I could not grow with the company."
bad,My experience with Walmart was an interesting job. My coworkers were fun to be around but could  cause a lot of drama. The hardest part of being a cashier at Walmart wasn't the customers but the customer service managers that didn't care about us having a break or what time our shift ended. I would always have to complain to my general manager about the ignorance of the customer service managers. But I really enjoyed having my lunch breaks and 15 minute breaks. But I did learn that Walmart is cheap and they don't care about their employees.
bad,I mean walmart is all about what you make it. Whether you befriend or just work.
bad,It's a good company when you first start out in any newly open store..but they have to many turn over in management..fighting for power..then you  see many turn overs non management...plus they need to pay more
bad,This wal mart did not help with scheduling. They made you work later hours with no notice
bad,Is hard to enjoy work when most people you are on shift with are in a bad mood or standoffish in attitude. Management was lacking.
bad,"This seems like an easy job going in, but it isn't. The entire time I was there, I would be doing everything and running around constantly doing things that weren't what I was hired for, and getting yelled at by people who weren't my manager. I was always tired and stressed out, I couldn't eat and couldn't sleep because work was stressing me out so badly."
bad,Mangement has changed not sure how is to work there now. Load and unload trucks.
bad,es un ambiente laboral demasiado exigente y no esta bien remunerado
bad,A typical work day was very stressful. I learned how to interact with a wide range of people. My co-workers were ok but management were not very open to the needs of the employees.
bad,"Had a set schedule when working in receiving"
bad,Just punch in do your job and go home that is pretty much it. I learned a lot about Walmart.  Some of my coworkers were very helpful and enjoyable to work with. Standing on a concert floor for hours is hard there. I don't know why it just is. The most enjoyable things were the company discounts on things from food to merchandise.
bad,"The managers are always yelling at you to get things done, they expect way more than what is required from employees. some co-workers are willing to give you help or advise, but most just care about getting do what needs to be done."
bad,"Walmart is a tragic work experience.  What I learned is that Walmart exploits labor and keeps intellectual people down, while managers use the underlings knowledge to make a better life for themselves.  I worked there 2 years and had a chance of reaching management positions when morons were chosen over me for better opportunities."
bad,not a friendly atmosphere to work in.  Only concerned with what can be done in 8 hours get more done with less help
bad,poor treatment of associates and poor management decisions
bad,"was a job, it was local,management was ok,i stayed to myself,expected to get more then ur share done ,was a place to work"
bad,"I'm glad my head supervisor terminated, because I don't like the way I was treated while working. Don't have any respect on co-workers and employees."
bad,I hated the store I worked for the managment had their favorites and was treated really unfair. I normally worked 7-9 days straight and they got away with it. I was mistreated an awful lot while working their by co-workers and customers.
bad,"The management generally with few exceptions had the ""bully on the block"" mentality. They would talk down to and degrade those working beneath them just up to the point to where it could not be considered harassment. This is not I place I would recommend for anyone to work unless there were no other options available."
bad,made no money and you had to work everyday of the week and you had to be there every weekend.
bad,This company reminds me of high school the in crowd does what they want to and the hard workers are used until they are brunt out
bad,"Not a very fun job.  There is no appreciation for employees,the benefits are sub par and and very poor management."
bad,The worst job I have ever had in my life the worst run company I have ever worked for
bad,"meeting and helping many people from all walks of life was an enjoyable learning experience for me ,"
bad,"No cumplen con lo prometido, los panes de trabajo no son objetivos y escasean de una dirrecion"
bad,"The job in most locations is terrible. Not enough associates in the store to maintain a functional work environment. Which usually ends up you doing more work for less money. To move up in the company you have to be a real brown noser, and instead looking into your hard work ethic, generally it is assessed by who you know."
bad,"I made some really great friends while working at walmart, but that is about all the positive things I can say.  I worked awful hours at a very low pay. The management did not back up its employees and did not like to help out when their associates need it."
bad,"There isn't a typical day because we never get the same amount for freight each day."
bad,wal-mart was horrible. The management there were very unrealiable.
bad,not enough money to support my family horrible benefits package and micromanaging management who wont listen or resolve problems
bad,"Unorganized, does not treat employees with kindness nor fairness."
bad,Thumbs down! I love the people that I work with just not the company.
bad,Horrible Company to work for. They have very little room for advancement
bad,I would only recommend this company if you need something temporary.
bad,Overall a very hectic and fun place to work. The management team that I worked with were very down to earth. They never made anyone feel beneath them. Work was always a new experience on a daily basis. My co-workers became family over time.
bad,"management was a very ""i have my favorites"" store. your good work ethics didnt mean anything here. and pay was horrible, not even liveable."
bad,"To start, Walmart is a fantastic company for everyone in the world who doesn't work there.  If you ask any employee - they will tell you that they hate their job and they wish that they could find a different one.  If they tell you any different, it's because their review is coming up and they need to fool management so they don't get fired.  My time at Walmart was far from the best."
bad,"Clock in at 3a.m. pull all out of dates off floor. Unload skid(s) into freezer by myself. Pull donuts out and rack them so I can get them done by 6 a.m. Go over and help in Deli cause they are short handed as are we. Pull bread wall. Get donuts in oven, get glazer ready and start donuts. Do about 3 racks and time for lunch. Go to lunch for an hour. Now that's if I don't have any orders. If I was to have donut orders I would do them depending on the time they are due. Come back from lunch and finish donuts. Make sure to box up enough for second shift to put out at 4p.m. Then start clean up. within that time take break. Then do my pull for the next day. help with cake orders through out my shift."
bad,This has been the worst job I've ever had. Managment does not appreciate their employees hard work and does not value their needs.
bad,"there is no loyalty in this work environment, there is no security, management is terribly poor and has high double-standards"
bad,You are now property of Wal-mart. You will work when they say for however long they say and overtime or one minute over and your fired!!!
bad,"It was like working under a dictator, employees really had no say in ideas to make work more efficient and management didnt really care too much about employees as far as raises and advancement opportunities."
bad,not good they use the workers and pay them as little as possible. if you ever try to get a job and are trying to make something of yourself don't go there.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. It is a job. I worked overnight and I couldn't hack it. I could sleep during the day and it took several months after I quit to get my sleeping schedule back to normal. Management was terrible. Most of the people I was hired with quit before I did. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home. 
bad,The pay sucked!!! Management did not care if you got a break or not. Customers were always upset about anything and everything. 
bad,"1) Não havia um dia típico, pois éramos remanejados constantemente para outros setores da empresa que não eram pertinentes ao setor de vendas."
bad,"I know so many people there who got fired for dumb reason. They dont treat there employees well, and its so hard to advance in the work place. They work there employees so hard and never tell them anything in praise for there hard work."
bad,"You work ridiculous hours before you get a break, management expects supervisors to take care of their problems. Customers are mindless simpletons, and there is only a 10% discount on certain items. If you become a CSM, you basically become a department manager, cashier, service desk associate, cart pusher, sales associate, zone supervisor, unloader, and so on for 9.00 an hour. Management has no idea how to speak to employees, and for the ones who do, they are preyed upon."
bad,"I was a cashier, a inventory prep specialist, stocker, and sales associate.  I was full time, but now Wal-Mart only hires part time.  I knew how to order, price items, stock, how to read managerial reports, assist customers with items at other stores.  I injured myself on the job and was dismissed because of it.  I was called to assist unloading a truck, which I had experience with.  I was injured that night.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to complete assignments when working in every department of the store all at once.  It was a very stressful environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers from all over the state.  I sold race horse feed to a customer from the Paradise Raceway. "
bad,I  was not very happy with Walmart. They told me they could work with my availability but in all reality they didnt so I did 3 months of training and then didnt even get to keep my job there!
bad,"a typical day at walmart would be to swipe in, walk to my cash, sign in to my cash and process customers orders, bag their merchandise, handle money, and continue on to the next transaction. I learned how to process returns and exchanges aswell as a variety of transactions. Management is unfair, shows preferential treatment to full-time employees and disrespected me throughout most of my employment there. examples such as : calling me fat, telling me to shut up, not accepting my doctors notes, disciplining me when i had nothing to do with the situation. The co-workers were for the most part quite enjoyable, fun loving people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant criticism from management. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of my co-workers who made the shifts go by fast and kept the conversation interesting."
bad,"slave labor for little pay. its a family store until you work for them, then they dont care about your family. management is worthless, rude and dumb as a box of rocks. the only thing that was nice was the other people you work with"
bad,"There were a few employees that had very serious hardships, & when we went to management to see if they could be helped out, it fell on deaf ears - in other words, nothing was done.  But they were big on giving back to the community.  Lots of miserable co-workers.  Don't miss quite a few of them.  They talk about you behind your back.  There was a female Assistant Manager there that everyone was scared to death of, but thankfully, she's at another location now.  There was a lot of heavy lifting involved, which I don't miss.  Not enough hours, & paid minimum wage so as to keep prices low.  However, enjoyed for the most part working there, & was lucky to have a local job in a seasonal area. "
bad,"trocam de funcionarias a cada vencimento de contrato, não valorisam seus funcionarios, não deram chance de aprimoramento do trabalho"
bad,"This is my second time in employed at Walmart. The 1st time Sam Walton was alive and so were his ideals. . . everyday people given the opportunity to advance regardless of educational background. A family oriented community fully supportive of each other. Now however, I equate Walmart to ""Modern Day Slavery."" The amount they pay and the expectations of the job are horribly unmatched. Years ago my starting pay was $10 an hour in 5/12 they started us at $8.40 and now they start overnight associates at$8.20."
bad,a typical day at work would consist of gossip. I learned a how to do cakes and party platters. Management did not want to be bothered with customer complaints rather have associates deal with it. Co workers were ok but most of them only gossiped about anything and everything. Hardest part of job  was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was nice customers
bad,Not a great place to work managers do not care much about employes. Not much room to move to different areas. Limited hours scheduled.
bad,a very good place to work but for me my and experience not a very good place to work with people who don't care about the store and never give any good customer service
bad,"They will guarantee you a certain amount of hours, you start out getting those hours, then from there, the longer you work there, the more they cut your hours back. You have to wait a full year to get medical coverage, and even then you have to maintain a certain number of hours, so typically they cut your hours until you fall just below the mark for getting benefits. You never have a set department, the managers expect you to complete 3-4 tasks at ONCE. If you don't have those tasks done in an hour, you're getting verbal and written punishments. They will pull you from your department to cover someone else's, but when your department starts to fall behind, they rip your tail over it. The managers will pick on the people they don't like until that employee quits or ends up getting fired. If you get hurt on the job and have to seek medical attention, expect either A. Your hours to get cut, or B. You get fired within the next month."
bad,"Satisfied with my specific job in loss prevention, but not with management and pay scale due to amount of risk (physical harm)and savings to company vs. pay/benefits. Co-workers were great though, I met alot of great people."
bad,"The assistant managers and those above them have a hard time communicating with each other, and they treat employees like they are not as good as them."
bad,walmart is not a good place to work. THE managers do not assist with any work and many show favor to certain workers. i was fired from walmart due to my color.
bad,"Great learning setting for future milestones in life , understanding the environment and expectation of job description verses what is required on site ."
bad,"a typical day at work for me is basically running around the pharmacy to keep up with customer service. I learn new things everyday, mostly things to do with insurance. Management at Wal-Mart isn't as good as it should be when it comes to them tending to employee request. My co-workers are great to work with and are caring people. The hardest part of the job is being short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around caring co-workers, and making a customer's day."
bad,"The job is vey demanding for low compensation. Forced to stay past 9 hour shifts, Was not compensated for working after midnight, other employees were paid bonuses for after midnight, When management was asked, they were rude and never addressed it. Co-workers had the same complaints. Very rude and distant management."
bad,"My time at Walmart has made me question the ethical values that members of the Board place on the employees that run the store. Very low pay, very low hours and very low benefits."
bad,When you give customers usefull information about a product or anything I felt rewarded because I done my job.
bad,"A typical day is in non-stop scanning, bagging and payments of customer's purchases. I learned how to zone items to make them look presentable. Management was scarce to be found and the CSMs were always busy. Co-workers either were too gossipy or kept to themselves. The hardest part was having to work long hours up to full time but little pay and no benefits were the only reward. The most fun part was talking to the customers and cheering them up."
bad,"I like the people I work with for the most part, some are there to stab you in the back. I have been there all together 13 years and I feel that my time with the company has come to an end. I want to find a company that is for there associates and not about only helping certain ones get ahead."
bad,es muy mala por que no respetan los horarios con los que te contratan y menos te pagan las horas extras
bad,"I wanted to do something better and valuable. After so many years at Wal-Mart, I felt stuck and could not move any higher"
bad,"The pay sucked, The benefits sucked, the worked you hard long hours but would tell you there is no full time positions so they wouldn""t have to for benefits."
bad,"By walmart being my first job i learned alot about cashing and zoning departments, it was my foot in the door."
bad,"Jornadas de trabalho horriveis, com salários baixíssinos. Sem perspectiva e transparencia para evolução de cargos dos funcionários."
bad,"Oh my! What can I say. I didn't enjoy this job. I took it because my previous job was temporary and I was no longer needed. It really wasn't the work that I didn't like, however the work was hard and tediuos, but the management was not good. I had a major injury, outside of work, and was on strict bed rest for a long period of time but after a week of being gone they would call me two to three times everyday to see if I was feeling better and when I would be back. They threatened my job and I was felt I had no choice but to leave."
bad,"The scheduling was horrible, almost as if it were randomly generated, sometimes scheduling you to work 11+ hours with minimal breaks, and sometimes scheduling 2 working days within 4 hours of each other."
bad,Nothing i did not expect from working at a Walmart. however i would not recommend working at one unless you have no other option. they are very rude to employees and nothing is organized.
bad,"Management at the Walmart I worked at was the worst. CSMs ignored the cashier's needs whether it be a price check, change for the till or any other need. Our breaks and lunch breaks were always late. Breaks were to be after two hours of work. There were times some of the cashiers didn't get a break from 30 minutes to nearly two hours. There was much favoritism shown. I enjoyed being a cashier but dealing with co-workers and management was unbearable."
bad,"a typical day at walmart they had department managers that can barely speak english and didnt even know how to do their own jobs, the delegated to much. didnt learn everything already knew what to do from my past job. only like 2 or 3 good managers, some co-workers were alright, hardest part of the job was when they expected for you to know what to do on your own, enjoyable part was working with customer"
bad,"In this company I've learned to Managed other employees, train, utilized several tools and enjoyed working with everyone. Pleasant place to work."
bad,it ok if you wanna work at walmart im not going to bash nobody but I have my reason for wanna leave I been here 2/12 years and I just wanna find somthing better
bad,"Wal-mart was not the best place to work for, because it's very hard to get full-time. Right when you are on the verge of becoming full-time, a manager comes up with an excuse to stop you. You may start out getting almost 40 hours a week and then all at once your down to 4 hours a week. It's very hard to make a living at wal-mart, that is why so many people will search for another job. I learned that not every employer is going to keep their employees happy, especially if their moto is the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of working at wal-mart, was all the co-workers I had worked with."
bad,hard and stressful how to survive in an dog eat dog environment. Ran like a plantation. Boss makes 6 figures associates make squat.
bad,There was No communication between staff and management.
bad,The job was not what I thought it would be. Co workers were mean and they don't pay enough
bad,it was very hard physical work. management is so bad. in general it was a very hard work
bad,Very hard
bad,cool laid back never frustrating or overwhelming frindly smiley faces always all day
bad,I liked working with customers.Learned that I enjoying working with people.
bad,"In my 3 years at Walmart i saw people that were hard working and dependable have so many problems there. While the workers that would be ""friends"" with managers would get the promotions. The pay is low and the insurance was rediculous. They also say they have flex scheduling but if you try to get it they will just give you little to no hours."
bad,i stocked shelves and not just in one department but different areas. i had to deal with customer some were friendly and some werent but all in all i enjoyed working there. the most part of my job i liked was that i got to meet new people every night
bad,"This company has lost complete focus of what Sam and his wife set out to do. Provide a great company, with great products and take care of their people. Sam once said ""The only ones that know what is going on out there, the ones that really know, are the ones on the front line"" Today, this has changed. The company is completely run from Bentonville. All decisions, all controls come from there. The store manager has little if any autonomy to do what you would expect him to do; rather he/she is a puppet to the control of the company."
bad,It was a good job at first. Then people changed and management changed. Had people who had the same job title I had running around think they are a boss when they aren't.
bad,"Waiting on customers, handling different monetary transactions, helping customers find items, keeping my lane clean and free of debris."
bad,I start my day off stocking the floor while assisting customer with great customer service When the Fozen- Dairy truck arrive unload and put the merchandise either in the cooler or freezer. and also unload the Walmart groccery truck later that evening; when time to go home clean up your work area for the on coming shift.
bad,"I would not recommend Walmart to anyone looking for steady, full time employment."
bad,I would never recommend working at Walmart to anyone I know.
bad,Assisting customers with store merchandise and attending to cash register.
bad,"provide excellent, fast and friendly service to all customer that come thru my line"
bad,"This Walmart has alot of management issues and it falls onto the employees. There is a ""Click"" at this Walmart and I don't work well in conditions like that. They schedule you with weird shifts to make sure you can't work a second job if you need to. With the economy the way it is, if you can find a second job to make ends meet you should be able to do so. Walmart will not let you work more than 32 or so hours but not 40 and the pay is below standards for that type of work. Walmart needs alot of improvements done with management."
bad,"Es una empresa multinacional con sus propias normas, las cuales según la situación poco se adaptan a las normas regionales y/o de cada localidad."
bad,I would recommend working for there distribution center but not for a store.
bad,"Meeting, with management, customer service, stock, customer service, price, customer service, inventory, customer service."
bad,"A typical day at work is serving customers in buying jewellery, watches, battery changes and band changes on watches, cashing customers out when its busy, I have learned a lot in this dept. would love to learn more but its to hard with not getting enough hours and no way to learn more. Management has there favorites and I guess that is everywhere. They say they understand but they don't. My co-workers are great we all get a long very well. The hardest part of the job is when there is nothing to do. The most enjoyable part is serving the customers with any of their needs if that is possible. I do like my job but I feel it will not go any farther and I want to go farther."
bad,not a good place to work treats employee's like garbage. not a good environment for people.
bad,management didnt know what they were doing and most employees walked around putting off their work on others.
bad,The company states they're family oriented but are not so caring when you've fallen ill and management is very rude
bad,"I use to think that Wal-mart was an amazing place, where workers were treated with respect. Unfortunately, i was deceived at how they do not work with their workers. For example, management do not help their workers make sure that all the tasks are done. By that I mean during Christmas rush, management (except for a certain few managers) will not get out on the floor and make sure everything is done on time and as required. There is also an extreme lack of communication between management and their workers, and even among management. In my honest opinion the only thing I find they are good at is when an employee request a day off or such, they don't give you hassle about it."
bad,You were just a number to them. They did not care about you as a person. I worked in a store. They just continued to cut hours and expect more out of the employees that were left. The upper management showed little respect toward the employees. All the cared about was whether or not they had that body there to fill the slot.
bad,"A basic day at Walmart was to assist all customer inquiries and to stock shelves.Basically everyday was the same and no room for advancement, as well as no recognition of a good job, and as far as management is concerned they could barley remember my name since there were so many store managers more than 3 per department. The most enjoyable part of my job was updating for promotions."
bad,Busy settling but benefits were minor. Company is a big chain store company
bad,I rate this company not good to work for once you go into to management they treat the management team bad the asst. are not trained they learn as you go and they fire you first change they get.
bad,Management was aweful day to day task were demanding coworker were great customers were good
bad,"Beginning from damaged merchandise from main warehouse destroyed during shipping, to employees that simply work for a paycheck to managers that have better things to do than to minimize waste from theft and poor fifo rotation on the grocery side, A day at this company simply gives me heartache, Wamart could be so much better ! A strong company, it will be hard to bankrupt, but their in place systems need help. The store is dirty and in need of maintenance most employees have criminal backgrounds and show no interest, but at minimum wage is hard to hire an elite workforce. I have learned that when a company meets their financial goals some of the cost control and customer service falls apart. My location is one of the top sales locations in the US. The sales are from $300K to $1.5 million ( Daily Sales )"
bad,"The atmosphere was pleasant, working o/n was a nice schedule. The schedule would change but overall was consistent. Most of the managers were friendly and helpful."
bad,I enjoyed my co-workers. They made time soar past. Also the customers were appreciated. The diverse attitudes good/bad provided me with life lessons on how to deal with each attitude appropriately as a customer service associate.
bad,was fired by not shceduling to work pay is bad dont know how to scedule dont work here
bad,It takes a long time to go Full time. If you work hard and never miss u should be rewarded a full time position And some employees just walk around and complain about simple things....But it’s a job and I’ve learned to just make the best out of the situation I’m in!!!
bad,"The job description during the interview process did not match what I actually did at work. The management team has a lack of care for new employees. The entire section called off while I was still training and I had to figure things out on my own. I am constantly left alone to run the bakery and deli section alone. Employees are not held accountable to keep the work area, equipment, and supplies clean in the food department until they have a visit. They tend to work me full time hours with part time benefits. When they have been short staffed I do not receive a thank you or any type of compensation for overworking. I was forced to drop out of school and pay back thousands of dollars because Walmart HR Manager did not submit my correct availability."
bad,It was a job that was okay. I mean you go to work and you are enjoying it until rude customers come in and yell at you for the dumbest things possible. The work environment itself was alright and sometimes enjoyable with the right coworkers.
bad,"Walmart management has little regard for its workers. Poor pay, poor working conditions. Would not recommend the company to anyone. Promotion is made from who likes you, rather that on one's merit."
bad,Working with customers was a highlight of the day. I enjoyed helping the customer with any questions or concerns. Management was not the best. I would like to see better management interaction with other employees.
bad,"Would not recommend there is a lot of flaws in the way they manage. They start off at $11, you get a bonus every quarter however the amount is based off of how much money your store has left over after its expenses. For example, the store may decide its time for new shopping carts (about $400 each). They recently changed their policy to where your bonus is determined by your attendance however, employees with no occurrences only got around SEVEN dollars bonus. Its really all dependent on how well your store manager manages the stores money. Bonus with our previous one used to be around $500 per quarter. Raises are done once a year after your evaluation which takes place around February they raise about 20 cents."
bad,"The Wal-Mart experience is not nearly as good as that of some retail chains I have worked for.  The pay is less, the workplace is not neat.  The job duties were, however, quite neat."
bad,Treated me unfairly to people who got hired the same time as me. A guy who was hired the same time as me was already working full time (40 hours). They were only having me work 28-30 hours a week
bad,The higher ups and shareholders are vampires that suck the life out of you. All this company cares about is money to that end they will nickel and dime you into poverty.
bad,"ther eonly work with people they like, they are not equal with anybody, they just treta you like you were nothinh, making people do more than they should even with some medical restriction, they don't care about any body just for theme self or there small group of bad management."
bad,The pay does not meet anyone’s needs! There is no room for overtime and totally move towards an unbalanced work and life. Customers are allowed to treat employees whatever way they want which is pretty much a daily occurrence (cuss at employees treated less than) the pay needs to increase in order to compensate people for what employees must endure!
bad,desde gerencia le hace falta humildad humana para el personal como los jefes
bad,"Stressful work low pay. Management doesn't listen and not enough people working ever. Find a better place to work, no sick days need to find someone to take your shift if your sick."
bad,"Employees were depressed, always talking about how there was no future for them there. Management's responsibility towards other employees was very poor. The happiness that the employees express is all fake, just an advertising gimmick to make money and to make people feel comfortable."
bad,"I woke as a forklift driver here for 2 years, all the employees are just a number all the care is about the numbers and production, mangers have no knowledge of what the doing just pushing the employees to do their job, the worst job environment to work for"
bad,I’ve been with this company over 12 years and feel like I have no opportunities for advancement or security in a future. I enjoy customer and associate relations but feel discouraged with all the concerning changes
bad,"Walmart had started off very fair and I was happy to have been employed there, but the wages were less than what was deserved, as I had to complete three different peoples jobs including my own every day. Management is more concerned about customer satisfaction than their own employees, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but they never considered their employees when it came to trying to satisfy both the customer and employee."
bad,They say they are all about family and a family oriented company. So far from the truth. I worked on a team called CAP I. We typically stay in grocery.
bad,"Very poor management, don't show appreciation to employees, overworked, underpaid, stressful, don't stand on Wal-Mart standards... Corporate need to come in and straighten things up in there.. Needs improvement, needs improvement, needs improvement, needs improvement"
bad,I never received enough hours.  A second job was required.  Management only wanted to find something you were doing wrong and accuse you of most anything.
bad,"No one cares, and half the time your coworkers don't even bother to show up. Customers are rude and demanding, and you have no authority to assist with their problems."
bad,"You began to feel as if your job is on the line ever single day because you are constantly being told there's a ton of people who could replace you if          ""they feel"" you are not productive enough.  Management lack people skills which results in poor treatment of employees.  The environment is often an uneasy feeling that generates low moral from employees. It's always about numbers."
bad,They are inconsiderate and always want to fire people. I was great employee but because I took two days off due to medical reasons (I could not walk or get out my bed) they didn't excuse it . They don't care how you feeling or if you can't work all they c
bad,It is what you make of it. Stay to yourself. Clean up. Do not come in door trying to make friends be on your ps and qs. Watch your surroundings at all times
bad,My stay at Walmart was not the best. The managers were rude and didn’t care about their employees. They are not flexible with your schedule and get mad when an emergency comes up.
bad,Everyday is stressful and frustrating. Work load given to associates is overwhelming. And management does not appreciate hard work. Walmart as a company is excellent but management is more concern in making money than taking care of their employees.
bad,The job is not fulfilling. The management team is not great no communication with each other. Benefits are not to good. The pay is alright but could improve. They are all about the numbers could care less about the employees moral.
bad,It is a ok job for college students. The pay should be more because all the task they ask you to perform. The customers are rude and feel like they’re entitled.
bad,Walmart is an overall bad place to work. The only good thing was hour flexibility. They don't care about their employees and don't teach you properly for the department you work in.
bad,The culture and ideas that are behind Walmart and its distribution center are phenomenal the sad reality is very rarely are these ideas and cultures followed. You will always be told how you are breaking or not following cultures and ideas but the moment it becomes a rush or an emergency which is led by case per man hours you will be told to get it done no matter what but if caught you will be fired. They will tell you safety is number one until case per man ours is in Jeopardy. If you get hurt and you don’t tell anybody chances are you will be able to keep your job. The sad fact is if you are hurt and you tell them it will be your fault they will point out how you failed to perform your job properly. Mind your words for if you are perceived as saying or doing anything that someone else could miss construed your actions or words you will be fired. Most common phrase is “at this DC it is ok!” But it will contrary there very own safety and culture ideas. You know something is off at this distribution center due to the fact that most of its upper management with 10+ years has either left to other DC’s or quit. Sad fact is some good ones got fired long before they could change or quit.
bad,Managers were only concerned about themselves and how much work they did NOT have to do.  Associates were only trained by computer and expected to learn without much supervision.
bad,Title pretty much says it all. 1 of the worst places I have ever worked. They randomly cut hours so you can never be full time and to avoid giving benefits. Was threatened what they call a coaching for working to get to the end of my shift
bad,Walmart needed to support they staff and raise pay and only upper staff get all they money and benefits and staff is so tired by over working not able to take a day off sick or tired and they needed holiday pay more vacation and sick day off
bad,Money is more important than employee wellbeing. Was sent to hospital twice and was supposed to have a medical leave that got denied. If I hadn't resigned I would've been fired for too many days missed due to being unable to work.
bad,"It is very hard to change old mindsets. I had the displeasure of working at Walmart store in Plano. I experienced so much indifference towards Black employees that it was hard for them to work without being micromanaged. The work culture was clannish and closed towards Black employees in most departments."
bad,"Managers did not pass grade school, very combative, no communication, managers tie your hand so that you can not be as effective, schedule sucks, work life balance sucks.  If you enjoy working with rude, uneducated, uncivilized, bullying, managers who will retaliate against you, lie to you, use illegal tactics, then please apply to Walmart."
bad,Working there the employees are nice but management was not understanding I did alot of work for little pay and they never hired full time and there were hardly any hours for work
bad,Walmart sucks as a company. They are horrible to the employees. They dont give them the benefits they deserve. Their pay sucks compared to other places.
bad,the work is pretty easy for me. a usual day consists of pushing around a thousand carts a day with a sometimes slow day or a busy day but no matter how busy we may be we always work as hard as we can to make the customers happy
bad,The job is very taxing. It starts out fine but soon starts to wear on you. The management there has its days and sometimes they treat their workers badly. They love to change their workers' schedules without telling their workers about it and demands that the workers just change their plans to suit their needs. They overwork their workers and there isn't much chance for advancement.
bad,I worked at Walmart for 14 years!! I have seen the good the bad and the ugly! Every company will have something employees don’t like. Walmart has a major turn over rate
bad,By far one of the most unprofessional places to work always understaffed and high turnover rates. Overworked and under paid is Walmart’s motto so if you don’t mind go for it.
bad,the managers don't want to do their jobs at all you can work all day and get belittled for doing said job and you are scheduled by the computer and most of the time you are working by yourself
bad,Working at Walmart gave me a sour attitude. The customers are rude and managers don’t really back you up or make sure your ok. It’s like high school all over again working there
bad,Difícil a empresa não presa pelos seus funcionário
bad,"The individual store management does as well as they can within the strictures outlined by the Home Office. Naturally some stores will handle the continuous rapid fire changes better than others. But as a company self described as customer oriented, they are doing an increasingly poor job of listening to what the average customer actually wants and how they define ""clean, fast and friendly"".The wal-mart family was really like my family while i was a part of it, but the poor treatment of it's customers and their customer's needs make me dubious about the company's overall future. They have the ability to be so much more. It's a shame."
bad,Yes treated like a machine. managment scheduling not caring if you have families Or not.  And to top it off the store manager is gone more than he is there..
bad,Company doesn't care about employees . They're all about money . No  Family leave with doctor order. New hire start pay higher than some of employee .
bad,Walmart don't care if you have family emergency so when you need to be there for your kids they don't care if you don't have a ride they don't care about any thing all the care about is if you get the work done. It other than that they will fire you in a heart beat that's all I have to say!
bad,"Todas las tiendas Walmart (soriana, mega, Aurera) deberían ser reguladas y supervisar las condiciones de trabajo por el gobierno."
bad,"Poor management. Called an told them my bro passed Had to plan a funeral an when I got back they were going to fi re es me bc the manager I tee talked to didn't let anybody know what was going on after all tree that they would only approve 3 days bereavement I ended up taking 6 days an now I cant miss or be late or miss work for 6 months or I'm gonna get fired.  "
bad,I would have enjoyed more responsibility . I would have like to increase my knowledge of the department & other departments. I always asked for more responsibility
bad,"I worked with quite a few good people but management was hard to handle. I enjoyed it when I worked with certain people but others made my time there unbearable, I would report issues and they wouldnt get dealt with in a timely manner."
bad,Not enough hours. Never full time for long. Your hours will be cut without notice. Can’t live off Walmart job. It’s fun if you have people to talk to. It helps you keep your mind off the work load.
bad,"Cut hours with added work load, expected to help at other departments where no one is scheduled but still required to get your department work done plus help customers...No hands on training..... you just learn and take test on computer......Lucky when anyone in Managemeant knows a answer for any of your questions..... 1/2  the customers  and 3/4 of the co-workers are slobs and have no manners to pick up after theirselves."
bad,"Not the best company but its a job with decent benefits, management is ok but some of them can be very lazy, it's alot of work and very fast pace so be prepared to give it your all"
bad,If you are fresh out of high school in you are in need of a job i would say go for it it’s not the best but it’s something but prepare for long days in restless nights
bad,"Walmart was a very stern lesson in why people dislike working in retail, your management works against you, and will have an inherent dislike of you based solely upon their unreasonably high expectations. Managers constantly abuse their positions, and will take adverse disciplinary action against you if you do something that they disapprove of, regardless of whether or not it is accepted by company policy. "
bad,Unloading trucks and sorting items . But the weight of break pack boxes for me was terrible . The bottom would fall out and the supervisor and others would laugh . Not 1 person would help pick up items . This job overall was stressful . Some of management wouldn't help either. Or even think of trying to make it safer on the employee .
bad,Not a horrible place but they didn’t pay well at all. They give you 1.50 extra for a few months in the summer then take it away in the fall. Managers were ok but when you tried to get transferred they always rejected it
bad,"Constant customer interaction, constantly moving departments to help others. The associates have a bad attitude about their job because of management."
bad,"My time at Walmart was not great, they had me working in nearly every department, but wouldn't give a raise, or promote. Everyone i met that wasnt management hated it because of the assistant managers"
bad,"Unfortunetely, low morale among my co-workers and high turnover is present at the store I work at. Management tends to focus on high productivity with the hourly employees; employees are surveiled by cameras thoughout the store....and they track your movement throughout the store. Hourly wages are generally lower than most big box retailers."
bad,"1. Favoritism is abundant"
bad,"The Management there is horrible. They make you go everywhere in the store to work, and even put you in areas that you have no knowledge. If you're having a bad day, they don't care. They will screw you over, I was working in toys with an toy associate, we had everything picked up, shelves neat and organized, all the return carts were gone, but my manager, out of nowhere had a return cart. Management is horrible there."
bad,They don’t care about their employees. I had a dispute with a cart pusher because they were short on cart employees and they guy tried pushing me so I went to management and talked to them and I even gave it a week and they still didn’t do anything . Didn’t feel safe!
bad,"Have had many years of experience in the retail, grocery experience in my life and I love working with people, work was challenging and in my department never a dull moment"
bad,"Bad hours, no help, live and die by the clock. No intensive for improvement, poor training."
bad,Las personas que trabajan ahí son personas muy hipocritas y aunque uno hable con gerencia o con recursos humanos no hacen nada al contrario los defienden
bad,"They get you in trouble for thing you never do, and unless you are a brown noser you will not advance or get hours. The management chooses favorites and treat everyone else like garbage."
bad,Unorganized and rules are not fair across the board.  It seems that there is a lack of accountability and genuine concern for the employees.  Several seasoned employees work super hard and care and the company  shows no thanks for the hard work.
bad,Proper training was never given. Management very childish and talks about fellow employees. You will have to deal with nasty attitudes and poor customer care.
bad,"su cultura es un poco desfavorable ya que es algo sumamente repetitivo y estresante, no brindan motivación a sus empleados."
bad,there are plenty of nice coworkers and customers but the managers just show a lot of favoritism and that really can discourage a hardworking person that is eager to excel
bad,"Recruited and hired new associates "
bad,"Worst almost 2 years I've had. If you want to be back in a place where everyone acts like they are back in highscool, this is your place. "
bad,Terrible work environment with very negative management and associates. Customer attitudes makes for a very difficult time at work and also at home. It's not a regular schedule and the pay is pretty low. You want benefits? Forget it. McDonald's can probably do better by you.
bad,You hear stories about how bad the stores managment are and other things and you then think well corporate couldn't be that way... right??? WRONG!!! The same model applies. Poor management and leadership. If you need the experience to better set yourself up somewhere else then by all means take a here.
bad,"I felt that they preached customer service, but actually never really followed the protocol for customer service.  Management was not attentive to the needs of employees, and rarely felt like I was actually worked for a company that cared about their employees"
bad,Way to micromanaged. A lot of empty promises of advancement. They have this thing they do at walmart that if your good at your job you get to do everyone else's and not get recognized for it.
bad,"It’s an okay place to work depending on your management team. At my store, they nitpick at everything and don’t give the hours they said you’d get when you’re hired. The store manager doesn’t care to get to know employees, honestly I don’t think I EVER had a conversation with him other than his passing nod. They say it’s a family but they only care about themselves and their favorites."
bad,Was a decent job at first untill we lost our overnight stockers due to corporates decision to turn us into a day stocking store. Expected the same amount of work with half the staff.
bad,"They blackball you, promise you promotions never give them, management is so messy and one sided.  I got into at least 8 arguments with managers for being unprofessional and talking down to me.  Overall biloxi walmart sucks and has the worst management of any job I’ve ever worked at! Leaving that Walmart was the best decision that i have ever made"
bad,"Having over 17 years w/ WM this time I can see the changed in Mgmt and the change in the culture.  People don't like all the politics that are involved in doing your job these days.  You dedicate yourself, your life to a job and they can cut it from you in an instand."
bad,"A typical day included stocking, cash handling, and dealing with customers. The customers are always rude and the management doesn't care about the employees at all. They are there for a check, and so are you. The culture is do your job at any expense."
bad,"The supervisors are not very supportive. It is a mellow work environment. "
bad,I help make sure customers needs are met if asked for help. I have learned patience in dealing with the public and with management. the hardest part of this job is never having a set schedule.. Not being able to have a home life. Most enjoyable was some of the people I worked directly with became friends..
bad,"I didn't find out until almost my fifth year at my store that I was not getting the fulfillment of title, benefits, and advancement opportunities. Some of the management are not very caring and understanding; all they care about are physical bodies in position rather than the workloads the bodies bring to the table. Their scheduling can have you work for ten days straight but not qualify for overtime."
bad,"You don't get any benefits/compensation as a part time associate first off. I never had a rude customer or coworker. I'd go into work all smiles & with a positive attitude. I was a greatly appreciated associate but I wanted to move up or possibly transfer & the higher up managers take forever to do so. They wanted to keep me up front because I ""was such a great front end associate & so many people call in regards to courtesy calls"". I was hired on as a cashier & was later coded for money services but for some reason I was always asked to push carts or go run the customer service desk (which was not in my job description). I also had lower back spasms from pushing carts & my managers knew that & I was still asked to push carts & was penalized when I wasn't able to work & the same thing with the flu. All I can really say about walmart is that they love a yes man/gopher but they won't do any favors for you in return. Expect plenty of shadiness & drama between coworkers/managers but do your best not to get involved."
bad,The company itself is not bad to work for. Each store is different. I would never recommend the store I worked at purely based off of the customers that come through. It’s right off the interstate so people all over the country come in. I had many issues with my previous manager and was forced to quit because of their lack of will to transfer me to another store. It’s a decent part time job if you need it but I’d recommend trying every other retail store first.
bad,"Walmart cuts your hours. You have to beg for them to put you on the schedule.  Our BONUSES went from 350 to 100 every quarter. That's a huge drop. Didn't we"
bad,"Management is not very friendly, the scheduling of shifts is very hard to work, even when expressed to management was told they didnt have time to double check the schedule.   Out of all the management only 5 are approachable and actually smile, most are very rude and grumpy to employees and customers."
bad,Any job in Walmart is going to be stressful. The employees are good people that deal with alot! But between management and  rude customers this job will become your nightmare.
bad,Although the employees are family friendly the upper management are not. For this company it is all about profit not realizing without good employee the profit shrinks. They disregard the value of their employees as far as being family friendly. They over work and under appreciate their employees.  The employees come last in every way. to get the experience working in retail and with the public a good start but as for long term career not.
bad,"Working at Walmart is tolerable, giving the department that you work in. I worked as a cashier and I also worked in the hardware department as well. In the hardware department, I mixed paint, assisted customers, and was left alone a majority of the day. I also liked being a cashier as well...I liked meeting new people, and talking about different products."
bad,"I am under paid for all the work and other people's jobs I end up having to do. Management is holding job integrity against me so I have to do others jobs. It's a ""team effort "" when others walk around talking when I doing their work for them"
bad,"I applied to the West Broadway Walmart thinking I would really enjoy myself, figured I would learn new things everyday. I go into work and dread it. They are always really unorganized and I feel like I go in there and I am not respected. The workplace is high paced and noisy, always someone crying. Zoning really isn't zoning when someone comes to screw it up after you've fixed it. You feel as if your effort is not appreciated by anyone."
bad,Walmart is only loyal to money. The managers have favorites & chose who has to follow dress code & etc. Pharmacy is always forgot about & the last to learn about changes.
bad,"I only worked there for three months but those three months were pretty poor. I worked as a cashier, and the customers were trying, you couldn't stand still for even a minute. It was always on the move, clean your station, keep working, don't stop."
bad,"Management does not know how to talk to, or appreciate it's employees. They overwork their employees, and never congratulates them on a job well done."
bad,I worked there about a year.  Management doesn’t care about employees and will talk to you any kind of way.  They don’t care if your 19 or 70. They expect too much
bad,Never wanted to work with schedules time off didn't care about any outside serious family problems if you have kids forget even trying to work here. They point you for anything they messed up my schedule came in late and gave me points anyways.
bad,Does not follow hazmat guidelines. Threatens you if you say you want to make an incident report about said hazmat guidelines. They wouldn't let me take Christmas eve off then they let me go three days later.
bad,"They don't train you with hands on experience, it's fend for yourself. They did not fully explain the scope of the job. Their training is sitting in front of a computer that shows you how the store/job works, not your job. You are watching the show with no supervision or help."
bad,"Everything besides my ex-coworkers and hours were awful. Management only sees you as a number, EXTREMELY rude and difficult costumers every other transaction, outdated technology, getting time off was a hassle (even for my senior prom!), point-system is really unrealistic (5 points when most people either have families to take care of, health issues you can't even use a doctor's note for, other obligations,etc),  typically expected to do jobs I wasn't trained for, Management takes advantage of us, etc etc.... but this is what really pushed it for me. I had a really good attendance record, but i recently had troubles with my heart. Mind you, I'm 19 and this doesn't typically happen to people my age. I was blacking out and vomiting at work if I was standing up for more than 5 minutes (even in front of a Customer Service Manager who witnessed one of these episodes!) and eventually had a seizure, but all points were counted against me. Department manager cleared my points after i tearfully explained everything that's been happening to me. Asked her about filing for FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act)  and she said she'd take care of it and let me know when we can talk about it, and she never did. Asked her about it AGAIN and she acted like she forgot everything that had happened, and told me I'd need to file for LOA (Leave Of Absence) due to medical, and told me I would need to get with personnel about it (that information was never mentioned in the beginning, but okay.) , So, for 3 days straight, I called multiple times, each with no answer or call backs. I would leave a voicemail"
bad,Petty employees and disrespectful managers. No benefits unless you are full time and they refuse to make many people full time. Did not get paid enough for everything I had to do.
bad,No communication between management. Favoritism is very apparent. Expected the same amount of work done with 10 people or 2. They do not stick to the schedule they assigned to you.
bad,I had pneumonia twice and I was expected to still work. I would call in plenty of time for them to call someone to take my place. They didn’t and I was fired
bad,It’s just a bad life style. The managers don’t teach. The workers don’t work and everybody is miserable everyday they come to work there. It’s a terrible place to be
bad,As I stated above I really have nothing to say one way or another! The culture there is exactly what you expect. The pay and benefits are what you would expect from a company their caliber.
bad,You could always tell that certain were favorites for certain jobs.  Everyone was always stressed. I learned basic money handling and did meet some pretty cool people.
bad,I did 5 different jobs every day and i was just told we were understaffed no one else to help out or we have to do what we can to help out because we're all a Walmart family. But never got helped when it was a personal matter.
bad,They don't care about your life outside of work. Will have you working all the time. Spend majority of your time in there and will barely have enough time to spend with your family
bad,As my first job working night shift wore on me very quick. Only worked there for 6 months couldn't take it anymore felt older than I was and never had set days to work and set days to have off made you work more days than have off.
bad,The store manager was never there and the assistant managers ran everything. The store was very one sided on everything and none of the rules were enforced
bad,Walmart was a ok place. It had its days sometimes they were good and sometimes they weren’t. The manager you had based the day off the mood. Sometime there is a lot of work to be done during the holidays.
bad,Management will write you up for tasks they were responsible for. Work policies aren't clearly disclosed. After your year probation you have to wait  a few months to receive your first raise. No holiday pay and no overtime. Quarterly raises were scarce and only worth $5 when given. During your first year you do not qualify for benefits or any of the company raises.
bad,Will not hire a full time employee and only pays minimum wage. Extremely hard to get any hours in a work week. Very discriminative as a company. Would never recommend Walmart to anyone.
bad,"Manage zones with very few people people,expected to put returns up till 10:00 pm. I love leading my team and working with them. Customers are my main concern to make them happy."
bad,"They were completely inconsistent, almost every day I would have to work for a extra 5 hours bc no one was scheduled to work/they only originally scheduled me for 4 hours. It was stupid managers picked favorites and would yell at everyone else. Managers also refused to do work so they would make us order? Like wth? Oh and when you were allowed overtime it was great but if the store manager didn’t approve it, and you had overtime you literally got written up."
bad,There are so many change which are unfair it's no more holiday pay instead we get a coupon they're forcing customers to scan and go they're cutting hours with this new core scheduling. This was an excellent  company to work for but to many changes which are unfair to the associates.
bad,"I believe working at Walmart is a decent part time job or good for teenagers as a first time job. Not much room for advancement, starting pay isn’t great for an adult with a lot of bills or kids. They should consider leaving their self check out lanes open longer considering they never have more than 5 out of 14 lanes open."
bad,"If you want to advance in a year or two with your honed skills and attributes, go somewhere else. Here, they want to keep you as a part-time employee, working 40 hours per week, without benefits, as long as possible.  Not all Walmarts have a unprofessional management team that gossips about employees they hate behind their backs to others, but some do."
bad,"I worked my tail off for 3 long years here at a Super Walmart. I demoted myself from Dept Mgr as it only paid $1.10 more per hr."
bad,"Unfortunately the location that i worked at the managing team did a lot of micromanaging in my department and ended up causing multiple on the spot terminations by the employees themselves. Clear lack of care when it comes to individual employees. Not enough incentive for those lower on the food chain. (Personal incident) when having an exit interview with store manager due to my two weeks having been put in due to relocation, manager proceeded to call me stupid for not transferring to a walmart at the location i was headed to. This was the very first and last time we ever spoke."
bad,Walmart had great employees but the management team was a disappointment. They treated their employees bad. Not a single manager knew how to run the front end and put all the stress on the CSM's.
bad,Inaproperate talk duri g work talk that will upset others tell me to pic up speed and not that great to work at walmart need more work on there jobs there are not appropriate people there
bad,"They do not care about their employees. They make immature teens and young adults front end managers, there was so much drama and rumors going around. I even had a manager try to flirt with me and take me out. I got points for going to a funeral and ending up in the hospital, I had a note for the hospital stay and I brought in the funeral program. I was told they don’t accept either. I decided it was best for me to leave."
bad,Hard to get the tools you need to be successful. One week training is provided when you get a promotion. They give you a three week schedule but it is not guaranteed to stay that way. No holiday pay and when you request them off the are not approved.
bad,Terrible hours got point for not calling in(which I did) because of me being in hospital no way to make full-time as any time u get close to where they have to make you full time your hours get cut
bad,"Morale is at an all-time low, job security is close to zero, positions and departments are being eliminated, but the work still has to get completed. Too many company processes that distract the associates from doing their jobs. Was a wonderful place to work at one time, but no one at the home office wants to hear from the field associates."
bad,"If you just need a job to put food on your table, this is it. But I hope your ready for real slave labor. Lower level workers do all the work while managers do nothing."
bad,It was a terrible but tolerable work place. Although there was constant tensions between the employees and managers. Employees who smoke are allowed to have longer breaks than those who don’t smoke.
bad,Horrible management and place to work for. They are very inconsiderate about your life and as a employee. The scheduling is horrible and not enough hours are given.
bad,"It used to be a fun place to work,. But now its push push push with little to no help. And no one seems to want to stick around. You are treated unfairly and at times feels like a slave. You work your tail off while some people that do the same job you are expected to do don't. And everyone gets the same percentage raise. So if you work your tail off or are lazy everyone is getting the same percentage rate. Also the way they are doing PTO now is not right as well. You have protected PTO and regular vacation. If don't use Protected you loss it."
bad,"I worked at store 168 for over a year, poor management and communication. Hours are limited as well as overtime prohibited. Management will coach you if they get in trouble, because nothing is ever their fault."
bad,Too much favoritism not true family. Business don't care about they employees or customers all about the money nothing else not trying help the people and down south are very racist and rude to they employees
bad,"This is without a doubt the most toxic work environment that I have ever experienced. While I get along quite well with the majority of coworkers at my level, the management is entirely atrocious. Nothing is ever good enough. Take the time to do an amazing job, you took too long. Go through it fast, you did horribly. If you have one single item out of place, your entire job is a failure (and I've been told this directly to my face) and have your job threatened. Meanwhile, the vast majority of other workers, though I hesitate to call them that considering they do the opposite, can get away with doing nothing day in and day out. This means that two or three people are forced into doing the work of six or more, with no additional compensation. This job feels more like paid slavery than an actual job, and managers treat you as such. The store manager refuses to even acknowledge that anyone lower than him exists. Any formal complaints brought to his attention are responded with a ""I'll look into it"" and then are immediately forgotten. Yes, this company gives vacation time. Little good it does, however, as management has summarily denied any request of time off that I, and others, have put in. Personally, I have yet to get a vacation in nearly two years. Any accumulated hours beyond your ""cap"" is truncated each year, and not paid out whatsoever. Despite how much they brag about how they ""care about family"", the reality is that they don't. At all. In fact, this new attendance policy that they have enacted is a direct counter to this statement, where any and all holidays that you would"
bad,"No full time, dinky benefits (if any), one person does job of several. Wouldn’t recommend. Low pay. Not worth the aggravation. Unprofessional. Shame on the waltons"
bad,The upper management is terrible. They show no respect for the individual. The company would much rather hire new people than keep the ones they have.
bad,"Competitive work environment. Management doesn't adhere to policy but then will discipline you for it. Great way to learn the ins and outs of retail though.  Claim advancement opportunities, but there are only there if you are willing to play politics and brown-nose. My experience was it didn't matter how good you were at your job that isn't what will get you promoted"
bad,I didn't really like any of my bosse. tjhey rude and only cared about getting the job done. and they weren't really interested in hiring people on full time.
bad,"The biggest bunch of manipulating jerks ever. They do not care! They lied about me, tried to write me up for a day that I wasn't even at work. Absolutely no management skills among the Apparel Department managers. Its like theu are stuck in the past with their polucies, and technology. They literally unload trucks by having people carry individual boxes piece by piece off the truck!!!"
bad,"Un lugar super estresante para trabajar, ya que hay mucha presión laboral, y el trabajo no solo es hay te lo llevas a casa."
bad,"Management doesn't care. You're also hired ""at will "" which means they can fire you for any reason whatsoever. Customers are usually angry because walmart doesn't take care of their lines and is often dirty"
bad,"The company has really changed. It’s HORRIBLE, now. The pay is not worth it. Walmart should strive to be a better grocery chain, instead of always competing with Amazon and other companies."
bad,"While at the job, I had to get a grill off of a high shelf. Was informed by current employee that the way we were doing it was normal. However I got hurt in the process and was fired along with several other employees."
bad,"You have to have conections with the store manager ,if not, you dont go no where ! Just like that , they dont care if you have a heart attack, they wont care just like they told me ! Assistant manager borrow $ to an associate and wanted to fire her but to avoid a report on him ,he put a transfer for her and aprrove it same day ! They scream"
bad,Overworked and Underpaid.......... Management team is trash. With the exception of a few who care about the employees. Other than that poorly ran store
bad,"Company culture of placing shareholders above all else makes employees feels like they are just a warm body instead of a team player for an organization to be proud of. Constantly understaffed and overworked with unrealistic expectations. No real communication from store management, except for constant threat of reprimands or job loss."
bad,Bad place to work all about the bottom dollar.managment doesn't work and with only being allowed to call in four times before being fired people lose jobs fast
bad,"management sucks, pay sucks, hours suck, not friendly people. to much drama and childish games. no family time when you work there. 1 hour lunch is no necessary."
bad,"Had to teach myself a lot of the aspects of my job because information was not readily available. Enjoyed many of the people I worked with, they were like a family in some ways. Expectations were not universal across the board however, and job responsibilities were not shared equally. Was never enough required equipment to do the job properly but I learned to do my best with what I had."
bad,third shift had no life you got to two days off you got lucky if they were consecutive. but very entertaining. Management was so so been decent part time job
bad,job for kids constant change of policy.  mod team is a joke no respect for employees.  managers are terrible hr is not there th help u at all for anything.
bad,"It’s a job, you have to go whether it’s fun or not. Management is honestly useless, not very help at all. It’s best to not be social because management tends to put blame and reprimand employees and segregate people."
bad,Inconsistent management made doing your job difficult.  It was often unpleasant working conditions due to the environment.  It was often very cold or very hot and uncomfortable because of the nature of the stocking job.
bad,The worst place l’ve ever worked. The boss are never there and other workers are mean. It’s all about rumors and things like that that make this environnement so bad.
bad,very fast pace and heavy lifting they do not pay more than 40hrs a week not a good job for a family man more for young high school graduates good work days and off on weekends just does not give more hours to work and does not pay overtime or holiday pay
bad,"I liked my job as a cashier but the hours made it so I never saw my family. When I asked to change hours my hours got cut, even though I was told if I needed to change my hours for any reason it wouldn't be a problem. After many issues with the front end manager & not getting any help from the Store manager I quite. The Susanville, CA store has a super high turnover rate & has issues keeping employees because of the way they treat them."
bad,Nice coworkers I worked at #2058 store. If you are let go you will have no warning. Enjoyed helping impared customers shop having conversations getting to know them had regulars! Don't let points get to 5 they show favoritism alot to certain people. Pay starts at $11 hr after awhile they will cut hours one time I had literally 8 hours for 1 week! Most I got was 30-35 hours. It's a decent place to work but if your looking for long term I don't recommend it!
bad,I worked at Walmart for 2 years and every second was miserable. The management team was inconsistent and not good when it came to giving disciplinary action to the correct employees and correcting any major or minor mishaps that came about.
bad,"I would never tell my enemy let alone a friend to work for Walmart they only care about you if your a kiss butt and you bend over for them they don't care about you showing up on time, being there everyday even when sick its all if your friends with the managers you get what you want"
bad,A typical days work at wal-mart was stressful.  As being a customer service manager the management was suppose to back you but they hardly ever did and when you ask for management for a problem they might come and they might not.  Think that they need a new management
bad,"Depending on which you work at, in my experience managers love people who kiss up to them. They play favorites and don’t care for actual good workers. In most cases management is very helpful when it comes to things going on in your personal life like being sick or other issues. But the manager I had did not care at all. Overall as a cashier they work you as much as they can and throw you in different positions all around the store even if you don’t want to do them. It’s not extremely hard work but it can get repetitive and tiring especially since there are lots of rushes and more work during seasonal times."
bad,It’s a okay job and the pay is really good but the management is poor. So hard finding a store manager when you or a customer needed them. Associates mostly stand around and talks barley works.
bad,When I was sick they would stick me to do the refrigeration jobs and dairy jobs and meat dept. Those are all cold areas to work and when your sick being in the cold constantly drags your body down. That's not healthy! Why couldn't they out me outside in fresh air so I can breath easier and get better health wise. Wal-Mart and their employees dont care about the under dog. They seem to like to beat them to the ground with hard manual labor. I stocked just about every dept there was. But did anybody come to me to say hey you'd be a great fit for this position. No! 👎 no managers like to talk with you or have conversations with you. It's a downer unless they change everything from the top corporate to the bottom making things better greater place to work and be productive!
bad,"No realizan los lineamientos que dicen tener como lo de la cultura walmart,el respeto por el individuo,te explotan amas no poder"
bad,Even after clarifying I have health issues they just gave me more and made me work harder than everyone else in my group. Soon enough my condition got so bad I was rushed to the ER for emergency surgery.
bad,management is awful. went from working 35 hrs a week to about 10-18 hours a week. Their call in system is extremely unfair. Breaks and lunches are always way to early or way to late.
bad,"I really loved my job until the management team squandered any associate that dare want the store to change for the better. Work began to feel like an afternoon special, cliques & drama. If you reported anyone to HR, the store manager would release that information to the assistant managers and you would be retaliated against. "
bad,"Walmart was what it was, although things have change a lot, I don't miss it at all, management don't care about employees because everybody can be replace, sometimes store was short staff and had to run the several department at the same time to assist costumers."
bad,"so lets get this straight you hire someone change their schedule multiple times, constantly change what a person needs to do, send a person home sick don't except the doctors note and fire them because other managers said they don't want someone puking all over the store while they work. oh lets not forget attempting to withhold final pay check, last I checked that is a crime."
bad,"You get a minimum of sick days only what the state allows for, but after all it's walmart. They want you to give them your all but will not give you any work/life balance."
bad,Unbalanced work life job!  I was am area manager and my team continually gave ne wrong information. They don't care about anything other than the daily work. Walmart does not care for their employees!
bad,Career advancement depends on who you know or who you're dating. Being belittled in front of customers and fellow employees is the norm. It is a VERY stressful environment.
bad,When i 1st started here it was great and i loved going to work but then tbey started making alot of changes on alot of things..unless your management they dont care about you at all
bad,Low wages. Never get 40 hours and the schedules are never consistent unless you brown nose a little bit. Management is horrible and never seen or available to help with problems.
bad,"The days would start off hectic, sometimes you couldn't find a manager to ask questions about your day, where you were needed they were very unorganized."
bad,I only had a bad experience because the managers didn’t want to work with new people. They made sure to accommodate for old friends of theirs but gave their butts to kiss to the new folks.....Charleston’s Walmart that’s near tanger outlet was horrible to me. Well the managers. When they were hiding or super busy then you were fine but !!!!
bad,The company okay work for just with poor management they tell you that have to go by all the policy and when you tell the customers  that then they want to talk to management they tell you to break policy my manger told one of they people  I work with that walmart does not pay us to think and we should not think
bad,Managers don’t care and don’t listen to anything you have to say. There are no paid holidays and you rarely collect vacation time. They don’t accept doctors excuses so god forbid you are ill. The point system is ridiculous and raises are not issued properly or in a timely fashion.
bad,"Wal Mart is a stressful place to work, Only certain people usually get to move up in the company. The management at Wal Mart needs to really be looked at. They just like to do what they want to do due to them being in management.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers"
bad,Working there was stressful grueling and sometimes overwhelming didn’t really give you any sense of direction. Also never have the right amount and to a certain extent amount of resources to use
bad,"Walmart was my first job, and it wasn't the best experience. Management gossiped about employees to the point that I didn't trust any of them, Let alone hope to advance my position. Not 2 weeks after being asked to go full time I was fired because I had 3 points (the point system is absolutely ridiculous) which was due to missing work after beginning to have anxiety and panic attacks. They refuse to work with you due to mental illness."
bad,"Working for this company was okay, I didn't learn that much at all, The management didn't want to listen to what you had to say and if you got hurt on the job the didn't take that into consideration they made you keep working anyway. the co-worker where very friendly wot work with."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. The management was awful, and constantly accusing and harassing their employees. Worked absurd hours (worked a 10-hour shift TWICE, and multiple 9-hour shifts). The management was lazy and did not do anything but sit in the lunch room. Wouldnt recommend to anyone."
bad,"Unload gm trucks, or downstack grocery trucks, stock an aisle, you have to be fast paced."
bad,The store manager which has since been relocated and demoted was the absolute worst type of human being that could have power..He wasn’t honest he was just a smooth talker..
bad,Not a good store to work at. Store is ran by manager that are only worried about themselves and do no care about their employees.very unfriendly staff
bad,"Inconsistent hours, cold and uncaring management, and zero regard for employee morale. Almost no opportunity for advancement or pay increase, little to no bonuses."
bad,"Walmart cares more about hiring 8 people to fill one position because 7 are usually going to quit within the first month.  During my time at walmart I encountered more thieves than I ever would've thought and most of them employed by the company.  Pay at walmart unless you're part of the store management team is extremely pathetic to say the least."
bad,"No matter how short staffed you are, management will not help you. They do not care how you do it as long as it is done. Work is work, after a while it becomes annoying"
bad,"Very stressful and unfair place. "
bad,Got yelled at almost daily for stuff that was not our jobs.The management did not care about anything. Hours were not what you wanted at all you would morning than a late night then an early morning.
bad,"Applied for Customer Service Manager but they hired my as a CAP 2 Full Time associate until a CSM position opened up. They said they would reinterview me when a spot opened, and it did within 2 months. However they did not interview me. This happened 3 times. The management is horrendus and the deadlines are ridiculous."
bad,"I actually would have loved this job just for the high energy.  However, poor management can ruin any job.  The Blanchard store has horrible management!  If you can keep your head down and have an endless amount of patience to deal with bipolar and erratic supervisors and upper mangement, you would probably be okay.  I stayed for three years before I gave a two week notice."
bad,"My job NOW is to zone, stock, etc. in apparel. This job is STRESSFUL. Walmart in general is SUPER STRESSFUL. I'm miserable 90% of the time. My health has slowly deteriorated. As has my mental stability.  The verbal abuse I've dealt with from managers and supervisors is ridiculous. Once I've found a new job, I'll be leaving. "
bad,Hot and horrible working conditions. Very few to no breaks at all depending how much you have to load. No help when falling behind when it's coming in to fast. Unsafe work environment.
bad,"Poor management, poor cooperation, poor attitudes with co-workers, unnecessary cut back on hours, associate's treated poorly by customers, associate's unable to complete given tasks."
bad,"as i said in the tittle this is nit the best place to work but it is not too bad, there is no grown in you career if you work at this place ad management is not the best they dont really listen to people but if you do your job you good"
bad,The management when I worked there was acting like they owned the whole Walmart corporation. They were not fair with scheduling and didn’t care if you have a family or life
bad,"I have worked at Walmart for 2 years now. I used to enjoy coming to work and being a part of the ""team"". Management was friendly and supportive while laying down firm instructions. It used to be about providing the best experience not just for the customers, but for the employees as well. Now, its all about making quotas and cutting costs. I love my coworkers and need the money to pay bills- pretty much the only reason I'm still working here. New management is nonexistent, either can never find or refuses to help out with the ""grunt work"". People are quitting/leaving/getting fired in droves and no one is being hired to replace them. The remaining workers are now left to pick up the work of several other people plus themselves and get everything done in their allotted shift or risk getting coached for incomplete work/overtime. The new attendance policy, supposedly brought up by employees, is awful as calling out now affects your quarterly bonus. What they don't tell you is that they brought the days off from 9 per 6 months down to 5 (5 unexcused absences and you're fired). Now, these days are unpaid unless you request it out of your PTO, which is accrued (8 hours or so every 6 weeks-this is also how you get paid vacations, etc.). The protected PTO is also accrued and you still get a ""point"" for your unexcused absence if you do not have the PTO to cover the day (8 hour shift = 8 hours of PTO). Basically, they took away our days off, our bonuses, and our morale."
bad,walmart has many good people that work there. I met so many lasting friendships from walmart. The most important thing working for walmart is the discount and the medical insurance.
bad,"Management Was A Joke At Store 383, My Fellow Associates Were Wonderful... But They Weren't The Ones In Charge. No Communication & No Respect At All For The Employees They Are Driving Absolutely Insane.."
bad,"The management just throws you into the thick of things without any explanation or description of what you're supposed to do and not do. When you mess up, they place all of the blame on you, instead of teaching how to do stuff better."
bad,I did not like working at walmart. The supervisors were nice but they weren't really flexible. Always had me working the same shift every night. Even though I let them know I needed to be off by a certain time.
bad,Walmart is just not the place to work. They work employees hard and pull employees out of their specific areas off their specific tasks to get other things done and when they don't get their work done management complains about employees. Also management will have hourly employees work 10 hours on a given day and tell them they can keep the extra hours but then end up cutting them at end of week taking away any potential overtime. Also will make employees take extra long lunch periods so that they don't go over 40 hours.
bad,Management had favoritisms and employees were dictated by 2 lady’s in personnel they also were very unfair with rules regarding certain people. The management had their favorite
bad,Management treats you terribly. They make you work when you have a 104 degree fever and vomiting. They do not care about their workers health or needs.
bad,managers play favorites if they like you whether your good or bad at your job you get more privilages than everyone else they cut hours alot more than they should can barely keep there employees and change their policies constantly
bad,"Management was organize, did not what was going on with work routine.  Management did not like to hear recommendations as how to make work more efficient."
bad,"One minute its mandatory to work, next minute hours are being cut. Promotion are not done by who is qualified for the position but more so on who they like the most. Even if you have a degree a person with a high school diploma is more than likely to be picked, especially if they kiss up to management."
bad,I didnt prefer my management they were unfair i wasntn treated fairly at my walmart. There were time in would get harrassed by my manager almost everyday.
bad,While working there they werent fair nor understanding. As a cart pushing I would be in the parking lot collecting carts while they were pageing for a carry out I would get yelled at by management because I didnt hear the announcement (no intercom system outside). I tried to request a radio to prevent the miscommunication in the future and they refused. Besides that and nearly getting hit by 30 cars in a month (averaged almost getting hit once a day at least) it just didnt work out at all.
bad,I missed days for a funeral and it was counted against me. I had 2 managers talking down on me and I took it to higher management just to find out that they was stuck in each other’s pockets so I didn’t get any help with it and ethics didn’t do much. And they told me if I missed a certain day for my knee surgery that I’d be fired.
bad,"Managers treat employees like children and will yell at employees in front of customers. During slow times employees may only work 12 hours a week, yet Walmart will not accommodate you if you take a second part-time job------Needless to say, working part-time at Walmart does not pay the bills. Customer Service Managers are also very rude to employees. Employees are threatened with being fired if they call in sick too many times. When you do call in sick, they post your name on a big board in the employee area so everyone can see it. The place is filthy dirty and we are not given time to clean our work areas. There are inches of dust on the shelves where merchandise is supposed to be. It is not uncommon to go a week (or more) without any cleaning supplies at all (not even paper towels). We are not allowed to use cleaning supplies from the store when we run out. Customers get angry when we are constantly pushing the Walmart Master card on them. If we do not sell enough Mastercards, we get pulled into the office for a ""talking to"". Employee lockers are about 12 inches wide, 10 inches tall and 16 inches deep. There are not enough of them so some people are forced to share. (I can barely fit my own purse in my locker) I think this is another way that Walmart demonstrates that they have no respect for their employees."
bad,"Good paying job but I didn't like not having a set schedule or working on all holidays & most weekends. "
bad,"Walmart is a very stressful weight to have on my shoulders due to the way the store is run, and nothing to do with the customers. Walmarts managers do not communicate with eachother verywell, if at all. Walmart has plenty of people to work for them but they do not schedule enough people to cover anypart of anygiven day, they are always pulling assocites from other departments to cover shifts and by doing so they put that department behind. Managment does not communicate with its associates verywell either, they tell their associates to do something but dont give them enough information, like where the items need to go or where to put thw items that were already there."
bad,"What I have learned about working in retail is that I really don't like it.  There is really no room for advancement. The customer does not treat you with respect because they figure if you are working at a chain big box retailer, then you must have no higher education and can't stand up for your self so what they do, knowing that you are in your place of employment, knowing there is nothing you can do, they start hard bashing you down.  Talking about your children, your lack of education, and so on.  Even when you or another employee tried to stand up for you they just tell them to mind their own business.  And they grab even more friends and neighbors, to scare the heck out of you.  This is bullying at an adult level. No one should have to deal with this. I know for any good looking males or females working at Walmart right now, are undergoing this stress of bullying and trying to get their sanity back before they have to go home to their family."
bad,"A typical night was arriving at work and making cash pick ups.  Then I would bring the money to the cash office and balance the tills. I would   then code the checks and make the deposit.  I would call on any bad checks in the file,  try and reach people who had lost and found items to be picked up.  Then I would balance out the safe for the next morning."
bad,There are not enough words to describe how bad Walmart is.Just know that they are not well run and you will not enjoy working there.Part timers do not get vacation.
bad,"my job is a simple one unload the gm truck and stock shelf."
bad,Walmart hires in off the street people making what long term employees are making. No longer gives paid holidays. Work life balance does not exist. They want you to work around Walmart schedule.
bad,No one knows what there doing. The stockers for clothing keep all the good discounted cloths for themselves and don't put them out on the floor for the coustomers.
bad,"they treat employees badly and don't care about them . they get away with doing there employees bad . most of the management sees the employees under them as being just a number ... i saw one manager say to a employee ""we don't need you , we can always hire someone else ,an then  damand they work more hrs and threaten to fire them If they say no. they also make most employees work full time hrs. but then cut there hrs down for only a week or two so they don't qualify for full time benefits"
bad,"Lacking in Walmart culture that is so profoundly spoken of. Lack of diversity and inclusion. No career advancement. Management needs classes on how to manage others. You do learn a lot of technical skills, retail skills, and how to be speak the retail language to apply it to other companies."
bad,"As a student working part time at a wal mart it wasn't hard. I didn't mind the hours that were given which were 40+ hours. But the thing was I was part time working 40+ and a full time student. Should hire as full time and give benefits to their hard workers. Not to mention at the time I was there the management was so toxic. Managers too worried about what their superiors would think of them that they mistreat their workers. Had so many people walk out from their job because of this. Another thing was that management would schedule you a random weekend off and then schedule you 10 days straight. Overall, co-workers were awesome, management needs work and Wal-Mart needs to treat their dedicated workers with respect."
bad,my son was born a preemie and i couldnt get fmla cuz i transferred from somerset to columbia and my leave didnt go with me so i had to start all over which was dumb and the time i got fired for i was in the hospital with my son from being sick he has bronchopulmonary displasia of the lungs so he gets sick often and i didnt have enough hours to get a intermentent leave or a short leave i think they need to make it a little bit better for mothers with sick children to have help or time off
bad,"I was in the bakery doing bread and I loved what I did, but they were always short on people. I was expected to do all the work of the bread when it was usually at least a 2 person job. The other long time workers got to do whatever they wanted when they wanted and was never back from break on time. When trying to discuss things with management they did NOT care at all. I never felt comfortable with management and they did not have their bakery regulations set or enforced. It was always something different everyday, very unstable. I quickly got out of that place and found a much better job with amazing management."
bad,I suggest you find better work elsewhere because this isnt a good job.the mangers lie and you get in trouble with it the magerous stalk you and are very unprofessional beware this place
bad,"other employees good to work with."
bad,"I've been working at WALMART for 2 and 1/2 years now. At first it seemed ok, as most new jobs do. The pay at first seemed reasonable and it was close to home. The hours they schedule you for are ridiculous. ""They"" being the Assistant managers over your department. As of recently the computer is doing the scheduling automatically and is to blame, is their excuse nowadays...."
bad,"I was just a janitor basically, but It was better than no job at the time when I worked there. I learned a lot from that job and it gave me the push to always find something to learn from any job"
bad,In my opinion i was treated very poorly was given very little hours and the management was terrible i wouldn't recommend working for Walmart in any sort of capacity
bad,As a cap team supervisor you are responsible for stocking freight scanning bins zoning and top stock and unloading truck when asked .I learned important skills like running equipment and managing skills.The culture is company driven and very tight deadlines that are hard to meat .The hardest part of the job is trying to keep morale up and still getting the job done.The Management team is pressed so hard they bring it down on the hourly associates whom they expect to do what they are ordering them to do.I feel like they can do better but the short staffing bad management and even worse morale I would not recommend working there.
bad,Management was awful. One of them would talk behind my back to my coworkers and they would talk to me about instead of my manager coming to me to tell me how I could improve.
bad,"management is very unprofessional. Expect employees to complete all assigned tasks even if the store is super busy. So many things to do all at once helping customers throughout the shift, and helping out in various departments. And if everything is not completed by end of shift, employees get a write up. That is unfair, sometimes it is hard to complete assignments in 20mins depending on what it is."
bad,"I worked at walmart part time while purchasing my home. I was working in a professional photo lab as a technician setting up calibrating, maintaining and operating film processing and printing equipment in a 1hr photo processing lab. I was performing custom and 1hr printing of photographs and enlargements. This started to change with new management that had become volume over quality. After time the work hours became incompatible with my primary job."
bad,"Cap 2 always had a different manager, the first month I worked there we had three different managers and then they started making associates perform management tasks without pay. The store has no direction and is a cluttered mess with employees who are immature and play games rather than work. You can ask each manager the same question and they all have a different answer, so who really knows the one best way?"
bad,Well had several run ins with a employee who was lazy and complained alot talked to a manager and she went and told the employee about it. Management always looked the other when my supervisor was doing a poor job of her managers tried to tell me what to do even though it was not there department
bad,"Not a good place to work. No advacement, the pay is far too low. terrible hours. The managers are untrained and work under extreem stressful conditions without any reconization, salery increase, or advancement. The store manager is terrible."
bad,I would only recommend a high school student to work here part time if you're trying to make a living it's going to be a task working at walmart and i'm speaking from experience
bad,"You won’t get promoted if you don’t know big people back there. "
bad,the store was there but nothing else...i didn't even know who my manager was i  had to learn my position on my own. there's no more i can say about walmart
bad,"Honestly, Walmart isn't great. The CEOs are greedy, and theyll kick you ti the curb in a second if you don't meet their ridiculously high expectations."
bad,"I like my particular job, at walmart. I was sad to give it up, but I had to, they would not allow me to do my job because I messed up my back, and they would not accommodate my disability."
bad,"My experience at Walmart was horrible . I worked as a Tire and Lube Tech for my shot time there, and all I noticed was safety rules being broken by employees and managers all the time."
bad,"Not much to be said about the place except, the savings passed to the customers are taken from the blood sweat and tears of the employees. if it wasnt for them being literally everywhere i would never shop, nonetheless work, at walmart ever again"
bad,Unfortunately almost all of the coworkers did not work as a team to help every one win. There was a lot of judging and uncooperative people and would not finish their work and would leave it for some one else.
bad,Co-workers were outstanding individuals who pulled together as a team; the work did not match the pay and lack of hours and benefits were a null for 90 percent of employees.
bad,"To much backstabbing, drama and most of all, HATE. A lot of employees with mental issues. Bottom line, its like a zoo. Customers, were such happy people, if (I) the associate was happy. IT WAS TOUGH, so much anger."
bad,"Employed as PT Maintenance.  After 3 mos, began stocking shelves.  Never had title change nor salary increase for Stocker. Wanted me to work FT, while hired for PT and no benefits.  "
bad,I don't know about all the other Wal-Mart's but the one in McMinnville Oregon is horrible. I was constantly being micromanage by the higher ups. I stayed as long as I did because I really needed the job I've got kids at home to take care of.
bad,"You wear 80 Different Hats, not just the one that you were hired for! ** As a Sales person you are not told that you are also a Stock person, a Janitor, etc.....Get that Stock out!! and attend to customers at the same time! *** Too many Unqualified so-called asst mgrs that know not their job nor don't care about proficiency only that you fill voided holes,so that they look good!... while most of them will stand around talking/Laughing and not be productive!! They will keep Rude Obnoxious Associates as long as they keep putting out stock!"
bad,"once you have learned more than one position, you get moved all over the place"
bad,Management doesn't care about anything. They will act like they do but they don't. Customers in the area think they are entitled so everything will be your fault. Under scheduled is like mandatory at the store.
bad,"Management has to change favoritism, change having to take mandatory hour lunch, constant changing work schedule. Not great place to work, little or no advancement unless a pet for management. No raises based on merit of job you preform."
bad,"I have been with the company two years, and love the people i work with,  but it is nearly impossible to be put on full time hours, and the managment team lacks communication and as a reault is very unorganized. Making the work environment needlessly hectic. Compensation is also lacking as most people cannot live on a 11.25 an hour."
bad,The Walmart I work at cater to certain social groups within the area and lack a basic understanding of basic business practices and standards. Salary manager does not discuss job contracts or associated benefits.
bad,"Unfortunately, Walmart has the tendency to hire less than qualified management, and are very dull on sympathy. The strict work environment added with the less than great management, this company has been an absolute nightmare to work for. They also do not take your work experience into consideration when calculating your pay."
bad,Not properly trained for what they expect  hours change every week. Always out of supply not enough up to date tools for job. Not enough pay for the job.
bad,"I just finished a second stint with Walmart and I believe the company has gotten worse since the first time I was hired with them. I was a former store co-manager with the company and a former store manager with a different company. None of that was taken into account when I was hired. I was given a part tome position with horrible pay. There is literally no job  advancement opportunities unless you suck up to whatever current manager is running the store. When I applied for an assistant manager opportunity, I was told by the store manager that I didn’t have enough experience leading a team. I informed him of my past positions, but he said I didn’t have current experience. All of their current assistant managers are kids with very little to no experience, the stores are completely understaffed, and they are currently trying to get full time associates to step to part time by reducing hours. I assume to cut benefits. Overall a horrible atmospherre, and a terrible working environment."
bad,Well I would say that everyday i did a duty but since it was such a inconsistent schedule that everyday I had to be very flexible to be on top of when I started to know what I had to do. While it was mess to be here I learned that being flexible can get through many situations and being able to think for moment and long term faster.
bad,"I devoted my life to Walmart in the beginning two years of employment. It cost my health and eventually my job, all of my insurance and stress caused more health problems. I was harassed by new managers that I had helped to train. Eventually I was disrespected and threatened by other managers for not being a part of the group to punish and push people that they did not like. Once you ever get a health issue and need an FMLA leave you become a target for termination. Sad but very true. Had there been a medical clause for sick associates I would still be employed and going on 7 years."
bad,the people at the WalMart I work at didn't treat the people that work there very fairly . I always stayed late when asked .I even walked 10 miles home one night at 3 am. because they ask me to stay i had no ride. when another girl got hired she keep coming to me and asking for help so I basically train her. we were both slow.  the only thing i was told was i was slow. but when fired i was told i could not do my job. the girl i help train is still there.i was about 15 days past the 90 days to be hire full time. they don't care if you are a hard work .they just wanted people that made them laugh or joke around. I'm the type the just does my work and stay to my self.   This was my dream job.
bad,"hardly worked as a team."
bad,Not people friendly the management thinks their better than people can’t voice your opinion and it’s like a high school super MESSY. Don’t do it unless you really need it. They have a very high turn over rate.
bad,"Não tem muito o que falar, porque fui desligada sem motivos , nem ao menos uma explicação."
bad,"I don't think that Walmart is a good place to work. Mostly because the different areas cannot seem to get on the same page as to who needs to be where and when. Paging people all over the store because someone is on multiple lists to be in various departments at once.  If one is unlucky enough to be on a register, they are stuck there for the entire day without getting to fulfill their other duties until the computer forcefully locks them out and even then no replacement comes to help the people who are in the line that cannot be helped by that individual any longer."
bad,Wal-Mart is not a good place to work for them management team is horrible they don’t appreciate your hard work management don’t know how to talk to you they want you to do there job while they sit and watch you I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for them
bad,"i loved some of the people i worked with. was not allowed to use sick time or vacation without your job being threatened every time also I was lucky that I had friends as managers or your life would be miserable  they schedule you outside of your availability and if you are a cashier or trained as one you will never leave work on time because you cant leave until someone covers you. when CSMs called for help with the front end all managers hid until the lines go down or a customer complains then they yell at the CSMs for not taking care of the front end they for get that the CSMs are in charge of Money center, customer service desk, pharmacy, automotive, electronics, garden center, sporting good, and all of the cashiers and if lines are long they want CSMs to jump on a register and help get lines down and keep up with all the over rides. they under schedule every department so they are always short handed and you cant work any OT because that takes money out of the stores directors check."
bad,"Worse place ever to work. Poor decision making, greed and completely lack human emotion and empathy. Bottom line is the only focus ever and at whatever cost to associates"
bad,"I was hired with Walmarts and put onto the Remodel team. First day I was handed over to the stationary manager and HR rep just walked off. I was supposed to stock, price, locate returns. I had no idea on what to do. A lot of walking till my feet and legs was going to fall off. Remodel team at that time never received the fixtures so stocking became the norm at 7am. When the remodel team started working on remodeling ,we were climbing shelves, crawling around the floors on hands and knees pushing full carts of product from 7am on. Lots of walking, carrying, lifting, climbing ladders,stocking,resets.I was not able to do this, so I went to HR to ask for another position that I could do.I got laughed at and was told to go home and wait for the remodel manager to call when she gets out of a meeting. I went home and stayed.I could not believe that HR would laugh at someone due to they were incapable due to many other factors to do this kind of work.Or why they would put someone in that position that was not physically able to do it."
bad,"I learned alot at Walmart. I learned how to work with others. I learned that customer service can actually be rewarding to myself as well as the customer. I learned how to stick a job out even though I felt like I was the one doing most the work all the time. One thing I did not like is that I noticed the harder you work, the more work they put on you. When others are barely doing just enough to get by, they do not ask as much of them, because they do not hold them at the same standard as they do the ones who work hard. The most enjoyable part of the job for me personally was my relationships I built with my customers."
bad,"When I worked at WalMart they were understaffed for the overnight positions, meaning the current employees were required to do more work than they were supposed to do. They were understaffed for the entire year I was employed there. The hardest part about this job was keeping up with the manager's demands in terms of the amount of work to be done in a shift, which varied depending on the manager, due to them being understaffed. The only good part about this job was that you were able to, for the most part, keep to yourself and get your work done."
bad,"poco compañerismo y sueldo muy por debajo de lo que desempeñas, muy mala organizacion+"
bad,"You walk in to work and you get your equipment then start you day. But you wonder if your doing things right, wrong, are going to keep your job or lose your job. It's horrible to go to work and feel that way."
bad,"Management doesn't care. Coworkers don't care. Customers treat you horribly, and management offers no assistance. There is truly nothing positive to say about this company."
bad,Not a good place to work for management treats you like dirt not willing to work with you the are none caring and you only get promoted if you know someone that is already a manager
bad,"Stressful work, Unrealistic time limits.Supervisors that complain too much. Other management being disrespectful to associates.And SOME not all customers being rude."
bad,im sure not everyone feels the same way but i had the worse 2 managers during this last shift change.the managers didnt really care about us employees.i was wrongfully terminated due to my managers being lazy and not taking care of my attendance points that were issued to me during my approved leave of absence when i had my hand surgery.i didnt really have a good experience but im sure others enjoy working there.
bad,They do not care about people.  It is all about the bottom line.  They care only about favorite employees and push away people they don't like.  They show favoritizm
bad,I worked at Wal-Mart for over a year and while it paid the bills my experience had been poor. I worked from 2 pm until 11pm but often have to stay late to compensate for the lack of my fellow employees compentency. As well I worked several aisles that had hours to be worked that exceeded the work day and if I didn't finish I was punished through being coached after three coaching you were fired which is why I am no longer with the conglomerate
bad,The culture of wal mart is very similar to that of high school.  The hardest part of navigating the job was dealing with all the levels of management that do not seem to communicate with one another.
bad,"Walmart maintains an culture that is not employee friendly. Programs for advancement are based on you to know. Advance on merit is nonexistent. Low morale and low pay, Many employees work full time and quality for state welfare benefits."
bad,"Associates aren't treated well and hours are always being taken away cause of the managements bottom line in taking money or paying less. No promoting unless you are with their group. Worst Walmart is in Buckeye, Az"
bad,not all types of people can work at a place like walmart and i wasnt one of them. nobody really knows what they are  doing or supposed to do until its time to lay blame
bad,the job at first seem really good  and i enjoyed working with a great team. as changes with the company took place it change the atmosphere and the store took a turn towards the worst and too this day the store / company never made a comeback.
bad,"I was taken out of a department that I was thriving in, and put into a department that had no place for company or personal growth. I also went a full two months without a scheduled shift."
bad,"I'm quitting because I get scheduled for 6 days and less than 40 hours.  I have to work weekends and evenings and after all these years, I'm worth more than that."
bad,"It was a alright place to work, the management was very poor and the hours didn't handle well with my Chron's. The benefits are quite nice if you work full time."
bad,"I arrive at work and begin my duties.  I like most of my co-workers, but for the most part the workplace is just work.  There is no associate motivation and morale is usually low.  The most enjoyable part of this job is clocking out and going home."
bad,Was a fun place to work at until you get into the bad sides of management. The workers are fun to be around unless you're constantly being watched like I was.
bad,"Yeah this is a good job for when you're in between jobs, but I would never recommend it as a place to stay for that long. You can't climb the ladder because they'll never let a cashier become a manager."
bad,It is Wal-mart. You get what you expect. work like a dog and be treated like a dog. Culture is a joke. They only care about the business and nothing about their workers.
bad,I started working in the deli after 4 yrs. I moved to soft line. We were not allowed overtime even when it was needed. My supervisor was breaking all the rules and finally was fired after I had left.
bad,Most places i've worked i was to count my own cash draw before starting my shift but not here. When you clock in you are to report strait to your register. if you needed to  use the restroom or talk to a manager or supervisor that was to be done on your own time. if you have a family emergency ( which i did ) i was told if i left i was fired.
bad,Management left something to be desired. Everyone is replacable. Company doesn't back employees in time of dispute no matter the situation the customer is always the ones in the right. Wouldn't recommend working here to anyone!
bad,Walmart has changed the focus from a family retail company to forgetting how they got to where they are. The Walmart employee is expendable. Unrealistic work/life balance.
bad,"This store has a lot of cruise ships that come in, so those days can be stressful. Management is always in the back and never come out to help unless they are walking the store. And then its usually to complain about something."
bad,Too much work for not enough pay the managers let certain people walk around the people they like the most the co-manager will see you and won't even speak
bad,Most of the time we are short staffed cause the few that are to be stretched so thin doing many jobs a day. New hire cake decorators with no experience start out making a whole lot more than I am making as a decorator having been with the company for 3 years now and with 20 yrs + experience. Management at my store is at an all time low. They are rude disrespectful and unreasonable and completely unaware of how to do the jobs they are telling us how to do.
bad,The management was poor and the work environment was stressful and full of drama. payment was minimal. But meeting knew people everyday was fun and interesting
bad,it was fun to work with the cap 2 team i would start off the day unloading truck sorting boxes and stacking them on pallets then after truck went to break and would go to the floor to stock
bad,Would be a great company to work for if management was taught how to speak to associates. A lot of yelling and cursing (even though it is against company policy) and if you need hours don't count on it. Lucky to get more that 20 hrs in a week.
bad,"I started as a cashier, it was supposed to be 20 to 25 hours a week. I was constantly scheduled 35 hours a week. Then they started to schedule me a shift that ends at 11 pm and back at 7 am. This was after telling them about how many hours they were giving.me."
bad,They tend to hire everyone part time so that they don't have to offer you insurance. A lot of the employees are very disrespectful and rude. Management knows it happens and does nothing.
bad,It’s a hard job. The customers are okay for the most part. Andalusia Walmart has a messy management team. They pick favorites and treat the rest like less than equal. I don’t rexorwoelonf there unless you have a very thick skin.
bad,"If you tend to work hard, management will take advantage of you in so many ways. They'll abuse that trait. From making you work harder than you already do, to making you come in on your days off while the rest of the lazy employees get to do whatever they want. There's also a buddy system and favoritism."
bad,Walmart does not care about your personal life. They do not care about how you feel about your job. Nobody will listen to your needs. Management is terrible.
bad,"Some days are fun. Most are very hectic & your ability to get your own duties done are constantly interrupted by other co-workers & management demands on your time. You get sent to other departments constantly on a daily basis to either bail them out or do someone else's work because they called off, etc or are unable to perform their own job duties,etc. You receive sporatic direction from your immediate manager most of the time because he is getting yanked to another department, etc or trying to get his own work done. Upper management operates on basis of 'it's a body' instead of this person can be trained properly to succeed. Employee turnover is extremely high. Workload distribution is poor. Many 'slackers' survive only because they are some managers 'pet'. Most management look out for themselves & their ""pets"". Instead of there being 'no 'I in team'; there 'is a 'me' in team'.There is very little, if any unity as a cohesive team working for the same goal."
bad,Its a job the new system is NOT anything close to what the people had with the new system. Management doesn't like people NOT always think their way and most of them DONT LIKE the new system and take it out on ANYONE who goes against them
bad,"For the store that I work at the management won't listen when we tell them we're short-handed we have to run around very quickly getting dehydrated getting exhausted multitasking not getting enough breaks. "
bad,"The managers dont care about the struggles of regular associates, spend their time talking or sitting in office, when helps is requested they get upset that we need it. the store is severely under staffed yet the managers get mad when things aren't being done. The management doesn't listen to the associates concerns or complaints."
bad,"The lack of leadership in the management team is unreal.no training what so ever , they make you hit the ground running.  Trust me I was there 6 years."
bad,"A typical day for me is always hectic.sometimes complete chaos. I have learned a lot about managing several employees, cash handling, quick decision making, excellence to customer service also how important it is to follow  polices and procedures for the company's success while maintaining  integrity.  It is very challenging, competitive often busy place to work. Being able to work well under pressure, have patience, and exceptional multi tasking skills would be required  in order to succeed. Hardest part of the job is managing the associates so you are keeping your stores productivity, safety, and customer satisfaction projections on target. The most enjoyable part of my job is to provide customers with best shopping experience."
bad,"I try and clean 176000 sq. feet a night."
bad,"Someone has to work a certain number of hours to get health insurance benefits. It can take 2 years or more to get benefits. Not enough people are scheduled to work, stressful environment."
bad,"Didn't like the job or the way you are treated by staff never know if they going to fire you or not."
bad,"I was released after sustaining a lower back injury.  I had called out twice after the accident there and they fired me over the days I missed.  I had came in early and worked on my days off, but they don't care about employees, just their shareholders.  They refused to give me breaks during a lot of my work shifts. Management wouldn't follow my work restrictions and make me do things I wasn't supposed to do."
bad,stressful of every detail most quit after 3 months so turn over is terrible I do not recommend that anyone work here unless you will to be degraded and not respected for the work that you do
bad,Working at Walmart was not stressful because of the customers or fast-paced environment. It was stressful because management had no idea how to do their jobs.
bad,No matter how customers treated you the company would not stand behind you.  The scheduling was bad and you could not have a life.  Working 4 and 1/2 hours to 6 hours no lunch just a 15 minute break
bad,It was very difficult for me to work in Walmart because of many different things. Not that great of training and it's kind of sink or swim they throw you into it. Very fast paced and management wasn't very helpful and making sure their employees are okay.
bad,"The lack of security when customers yelled and acted in an inappropriate manner is an issue. The lack of support from management when things got rough was unacceptable let alone when your manager tells other employees of personal matters in an unprofessional manner - management was unprofessional, would not work here again ever."
bad,To work at the big box stores your need to be self motivated and a self learner/teacher. As with all big box stores you need to put your job first. Overall not recommended.
bad,"They are no longer a family organization, they have turned into the same corporation that the rest of America is dealing with and they are  all about about profit."
bad,Es un trabajo que requiere de actitud pues el trato al cliente siempre debe ser bueno.
bad,Hire more people  of color or hire people that have friend of color so they know how to act around them. And some manage  was OK. I think could of done a better job if was trained properly and had one boss instead of every body being my boss.but I will miss what it could been.
bad,i really enjoyed working at Wal-mart but i only think i liked it because i was young. i was making a lot of money it was just something to keep m busy.
bad,"I had worked with the company for 3 years. So many times I was told how good of a worker that I was, but wasn't showed. One year they gave this great worker a 5 cent raise, and another year I didn't get any raise at all."
bad,I learned more about how to process payables and preparing the retail store for yearly inventory. The culture of Walmart is unprofessional environment which makes it hard to concentrate in the environment while working.
bad,"The hours are long and tiring, you barely get your breaks on time if you even get them at all. The management is poor and doesn't care about their employees. The environment is very fast paced. Some days were okay when you did have good managers. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place for a long period of time and not being able to sit down or lean. I learned a little more about money while working at Walmart. The most enjoyable part about Walmart was meeting some of the employees."
bad,"bad manmagement, no teamwork, too many cliques with management, people worked there iobver 1 year never did any work, "
bad,"Working here was my first job so I had no idea what to expect as far as pay, benefits, or anything else. I feel like for a first job it's a great place to start, but not necessarily good for much else if you need good pay or benefits."
bad,A typical day at work would be busy with different cultures of customers and employees. The hardest part of the job is completing tasks while assisting customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers needs and wants.
bad,I did not like working at walmart. The management did not listen to employees and would show favorites to some employees over others. They did not want to bend when you needed time off.
bad,In a normal day we would front and face certain isle. After that we go to the back to throw the truck the managers would be joking around and were rude.
bad,"Management treat associates badly. Not allowed Overtime and yet expect them to finish the job with less time. They like to fired the hard working associates and leave the ones who hardly do any work. Favoritism is all over the storr. You don’t do what you’re told to do even though its wrong, they will fired you even if you didn’t do anything wrong."
bad,"you'll work varying shifts, when I worked there they didn't have any set shifts so you were working what they wanted you to work and would rarely work with your personal schedule outside of work."
bad,"Spent almost 2 weeks on a computer to learn duties that I did not do. No actual hands on training was given to me, while being yelled at for not being fast enough during my first week actually stocking shelves."
bad,i am a high school student and its hard to know my week and its even harder to know 3 weeks to 6 months in advance. The managers expect the cashiers to know stuff and do stuff that they haven't been trained to do
bad,had to stock multiple pallets of merchandise in a short period of time if not completed management would write you up supervisors would take longer breaks
bad,Pas de possibilité d'avoir un poste temps plein...
bad,lacked support from management
bad,"The work environment at both facilities I worked at were horrible. A lot of equipment necessary to complete tasks were either broken, missing, or waiting on repair. Had very limited supplies, employees a night were extremely low and they refused to hire more help. The managers were beyond rude and quite threatening at times."
bad,Would never work for them again they have no concern for the workers or there families when they say that they are a family oriented company there quick to fire an associate
bad,everything about Walmart has sucked my soul from me. I hate it but need a job and for 11/hr its about the best I can do for the work.. The management is terrible and rude. Never enough hours even when I ask for them..
bad,They Hired anyone to Be management and instead of hiring from within they hired friends and family and the store went very bad it was no longer a wonderful place to work even after 9 years with the company (excuse my language).....
bad,Walmart super center of Oroville had and still has many problems. a lot of the managers are uninterested in anything do with leadership and fully rely on workers to do their jobs for them.
bad,"It was gross to see workers touch things they shouldn't have with their gloves on and they go right back to handling food.  Management only cares about the numbers."
bad,Some days are easy some days are hard.  Some days they would have us doing our position work then they would make us do other position work but over all it was stressful most of the time
bad,If your looking to do a basic cashier customer service job and have to work a long time to get up to full time position and have to work many hours to earn 8 hours of pto
bad,"Employees on the overnight shift were regularly required to perform ""24 hours"" of stocking work in less than 6 hours of real time. When requests were made by night management for additional staff on the overnight shift, they were ignored repeatedly."
bad,do not work here if you can help yourself. Every Walmart has pretty much the same policies. I hated my life there. I was threaten to be fired for being sick.
bad,Shift supervisors were often rude. But overall the place was bearable to work at. i did like our breaks however. We had two 10 minute paid breaks and an 1 hour lunch.
bad,"Poor management, discrimination towards employees. Unhealthy environment, management makes employees work while severely ill. Retaliation towards employees."
bad,"When walmart started it was a fairly good company to work for. Over the years benefits have been robbed, and employees have been robbed too. It says something when most of your employees do not have benefits, or are not working enough hours to get benefits."
bad,It is very stressful and always wondering if today is going to be your turn to be called in to the office because the store manager is having a bad day
bad,Not a great place to many chiefs and not enough Indians no set rules to much work and not enough people management only addresses themselves and not the common worker
bad,Very difficult place to work at. Costumers tend to be rude which makes employees and management feel the need to be the same. This place over works the employees. You get told (not asked) to go to different departments that are not according to your job code or experience which can irritate an employee that doesn’t know what to do. Management is very unkind to their employers. Not a relaxed environment what so ever!
bad,The workplace culture is very uninviting and demeaning at times. Management doesn't treat you as an individual but as if you were just a cog in a machine.
bad,"They make you take your breaks and many of the employees are not helpful.  They require you to sit behind a computer and train for 2 weeks before you are allowed to be on the ""floor"" which then they just throw you out there and expect you to deal with customers on your own. Everybody there is LAZY!!"
bad,"Walmart has done very well to provide a slow pace, relatively easy work to be done, while making it extremely convenient for associates to take two 15 min break and a 30 minute or an hour lunch which keeps associates from leaving. Walmart has a nice setup going for them which prevents alot of people from leaving the company.... but its not for me."
bad,"employee in another area doesn't show up, for an example the cart pusher doesn't show up so they make everyone go push carts in when they could have called someone in. They also time you in your area and tell you have this amount of time to get the work done and they don't take into account of helping the customer out in that time."
bad,"I worked hard, took good care of each department I was given. I became known as the candy lady. I was bulk candy and tobacco for 6 years. Then they moved me to furniture and pets. I couldn't keep up with such a big area with no help. I tried to talk to management. So I decided to be a stay at home mom for a while."
bad,"They are not a fair work place. They will take your job if you go out on a medical leave. They say they have an open door policy, but they will not listen and they refuse to back you. The management will retaliate."
bad,"A empresa é muito boa mais tem um porém"
bad,"Nos quitaron todas las prestaciones de ley, y ya ni bono nos dan, por ellos ya me quiero cambiar"
bad,"The job was good in the beginning. Towards the end they were not very compassionate. When I got hurt they wouldn't take a doctor's note. You didn't get paid holidays,vacation."
bad,Walmart used to be all about the associates not just the customers now they will get rid of you in a heartbeat no matter who you are how great of working you are. If it will benefit Walmart money wise they will get rid of you in the blink of an eye the longer at Walmart the less likely you are to have a job you can move up easily yes but only if your favorite it doesn't matter if you're the perfect person for the job they're going to pick who they want for the job no matter if they're trained for it or not it's just not a good place to work for anymore.
bad,There is very little training and direction from the supervisors you are often left not knowing what task to do next. The wages are very low and the hours are not good. There is
bad,The job was very stressful and was only a select amount of diversity. The management sucked sometimes I had to wait a whole hour for help. They would work me every hour I had.
bad,The management at the Fowlerville Walmart was horrible they had no appreciation for sales associates on the floor. You would rarely find a manager on the floor unless there was a problem
bad,"the management at walmart was very poor i worked there for two years with cap two unloading and sorting the trucks everyday, saw someone who started a year and four month after me get pushed straight to supervisor over me! without knowing how to bin or even use a mc40. the management is very quick to pick favorites and will not work wit you when it comes to certain family issues and expect you to put walmart first before your family."
bad,"management told about having a degree would put person in much better opportunity for management , but found was a waste of my time and money for the college degree. Became a time of kissing butt to get promoted."
bad,their was no good management and no one to help when it comes time for for the need. management was not good to team and to the customer when they come in to store
bad,"Very stressful, Management is never on the same page, the pay is not enough for what you have to put up with, the hours are awful,and customers tend to treat you like your stupid."
bad,The manager of the store should not be the manager. He doesn't care about the employees. He only cares about what he looks like to cooperate. He doesn't listen to what his employees have to say. He figures that everyone is to work like a dog just so he looks good.
bad,"Management did not work well staff, no opportuniteis for advancement. Poor wages, felt as if only important as an employ flaunt my military background."
bad,"I was in line to get A promotion, Got the flu, I was told not to come in while sick when handling produce, worked for A week with the Flu, Then took two days off and was threatened to be fired if I did not return. (Even with A doctors Note)"
bad,I would not recommend working at this location.  Unfairness and lots of judgemental people. I have nothing good to say about this company. No appreciation after almost 2 years of service
bad,Estuve 3 años ahi y nunca tuve un aumento real. aunque fui promovido de puesto mo recibi un aumento deacuerdo a que lo que hacia.
bad,"Walmart is not an ideal place to work.. they fire people that work hard, and keep the lazy ones. Management is a joke, there is no self proclaimed 'safe place' to discuss problems, management takes it out on you when or if you complain. Said breaks are an hour, you're hassled if you take them. I could go on and on but I'll leave it like that."
bad,"The main problem with walmart working on the overnight shift they are terribly understaffed and you are expected to work two or three different jobs because they are so understaffed. I only worked three days as part time which was only Friday, Saturday, and Sunday the only bad thing was those are the days that employees call out the most. It was not uncommon to come to work and it would only be two people in the maintenance department and you are expected to try to clean a 220 thousand square feet building with only two people. RIDICULOUS"
bad,After 4 years of working on multiple shifts they expect you to have no life outside work they want you to have open availability and to devote you whole life to them with little pay they cut hour to below full time when I have full time status
bad,Sucked it was like working in a Chinese shoe factory at night with the smell of vomit and rotten meat and vegetables all around the people were very rude and they lied about finishing there part of the work
bad,"Walmart is a good job for in-school and high school job. The management team isn't very pleasant though. Very rude and doesnt care about any of the employees and only focuses on getting master cards. If you dont get master cards you get sat down n spoken to and trained. Also, they don't give you hardly any hours due to hiring so many employees."
bad,"Usually come in around 8 am where the vision center begins to open. You may or may not be a doctors tech while doing optician duties. Typical day includes doing lots of insurance work and verification and fittings for glasses. "
bad,The company has to many stipulations and goals that are unrealistic that they want you to meet and they are not really concerned about anything else but reaching goals or numbers.
bad,Walmart was a decent place to work.  I did not enjoy the favoritism of other employees.  Managers would give me the bad job and give the others all the other jobs so that they could goof of on there phones and talk to each other.
bad,"There is no team or family environment, they dont care about you like they say they do. They want you to plan your life around their schedule. You are required to come into work even on your off day, no matter if you have a family to tend to, another job, or school if not you will be reprimanded. They dont treat you as a human being more like just an object. The only thing they care about is their numbers. Management team from upper to human resource is a joke. Then they wonder why they have one of the highest turnover rates in the region."
bad,"At Wal-Mart there is a culture of fear and distrust.  During many years at Wal-Mart I managed at five locations in two states and the culture was the same regardless of community or specific store management personnel."
bad,will ask you to work on your day off but then wont give you a day off. hours are bad. higher up management needs to understand their job better. long weeks.
bad,"No two managers will tell you the same answer to one question, there is no communication, this is a very hard place to work, there is no privacy. Not a good place to make a living."
bad,All management have nasty attitudes from the moment you meet them. Expected to do job without training. Expected to do CDL training on time and also regular work. You get in trouble for doing exactly what the the management told you do. Every manager has different style and pet peeves that tick them off. You also get in trouble for having overtime even though management or supervisor asks you to stay pass your full time hours.
bad,"Constantly got moved from this department to that department to help and then get scolded for not finishing work in my home department, so short staffed."
bad,"I have worked within two larger retail companies, and have found that both companies tend to hire managers based on personal knowledge of them, rather than skill set. I will not repeat the mistake of working for large retailers again."
bad,"Walmart cares. Its a very fast paced work place. very stressful and high pressure. if youre not equipped to handle high stress work, place grow thick skin then apply"
bad,"First off there attendance points are ridiculous, they give there employees horrible hours, they overall dont care abiut there employees very much, they dont help people advace or help them become something in the company they only care about themselves and money!"
bad,"No matter what you do there, if you aren't best friends with the supervisors and managers, you wont get ahead or treated fairly, or even get a pat on the back, a good job, they wont even remember your name and its on a name tag. extremely unfair work environment. if they like you, you are treated like you own the place. if they don't, you are overworked, underappreciated, and you get yelled at for talking to customers, or taking them to another isle when they can't find what they are looking for. extremely unprofessional work environment."
bad,helping customer out and cashing them out. I learned to be more helpful. them management was ok not the best. there was no hard part. I enjoy the customer
bad,"The company expresses that customer's satisfaction is the most important part of your job, but really the amount of work that is completed in a given time frame is what really matters. If the work is not complete, you are basically forced to stay until the work is done or face a write up that goes towards the company firing the individual. If the individual stays until the work is complete, then the time is mandatory to be cut from the clock before the end of the week."
bad,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers but the company doesn't care about their employees well being. They won't allow you to use any of your sick days, and hardly approve of pto even for Dr appointments."
bad,The job was ok for the most part but then my husband got hurt during my trial time and I had to take time off due to his injuries and I was left go but it wasn't used against me as a firing situation because of my husbands situation and me being on the trial period. They told me that I could reapply in 6 months without any problems with getting hired back.
bad,"Too much favoritism...Only certain employees could express their ideas. People were suppose to be fired but they were saved because they refuse to hire new people. A department manager put their hands in me and kept their job, no suspension, NOTHING!!!"
bad,"Walmart is not the place to work if you're looking for friendship or comrades. Sure the work is easy, but also monotonous. A typical day at work started with me clocking in, and then going to a check out lane to start working. The cashiers would constantly be pulled out to do stocking for a manager who had no jurisdiction over us. We shouldn't have to do a job we aren't being payed for. Our job is to check customers out and make sure they had a pleasant shopping experience while maintaining the front end of the store. The management team was sarcastic and rude. They weren't understanding of myself or others. If I could give a zero star rating in management I would. There is no workplace culture, it's every person for themselves. The hardest part of the job was simply standing for so long. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my only friend coworker when I was on break."
bad,"All in all, the job was not complicated. Just no communication with managers just above myself n other cashiers. nothing was verbal just signs posted and if the sign was gone than you had to get information from other co-workers"
bad,Need to rotate job duties & not constantly put the same person on non rotating jobs. Also if a employee has pneumonia don't put them in the cooler stocking all shift long.
bad,"I have worked at Walmart over 7yrs. And have watched myself get low paychecks due to insurance and penalties due to 401k withdrawals.This money is  taxed when you make it ,withdraw it as well as added back as gross income to be triple taxed so how is it matched?Walmart should not allow people who have issues to be in management positions."
bad,It was a job I took when I was young so I could have extra money.  The people I worked with was okay but the management wasn't very good.  No hours no benefits for part time
bad,"Long shifts, ujnderstaffed team, 4am to 1pm, expected more then able for position, other easier job made more money, bad management, unable to move positions or get promoted"
bad,It's alright for a retail job. They make it clear from the beginning that they do not care about the employees. The hours are unpredictable and change every week.
bad,"i was being treated unfairly after i did alot of work and helped multiple departments that werent part of my job discription. poor management, rude employees."
bad,Walmart is an ok company to work for if you want to get your foot in the door. Other than that I do not recommend working for this company. Typical day at work is being understaffed and expected to handle more then one department. the most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
bad,"clean up someone else's mess, make salads and sandwiches."
bad,"Started making 6.25 and over the 5 years worked finally made it to 10.30, no opportunity for growth or advancement, management is poor, the moral is kinda low, people work here because there's not much left there to choose from in this area. There's favoritism shown to certain employees."
bad,"I had an allergy attack to a pine-sol spill and one of the front-end people  sent me back to the same register before the spill and the aroma was gone and when i told her i couldnt go back there as i was allergic to pine-sol and she looked at me, eye - to - eye, and said she didnt care. I went back to the register as i was told to, and within 10 minutes, i lost my voice and my throat felt like it was on fire! I reported the situation the next day to a co-manager who looked at me and said ""oh well, you're okay now"" and did nothing about it!"
bad,You will run from the time you get there until you leave. One moment you are out in the lot gathering carts and the next you are at the back of the store. Then you may be cashiering and later in Customer service. It is extremely busy.
bad,Nothing is taken seriously here. The management is a joke. The corporation all together is just a unprofessional. I would never recommend to anyone older then a teen.
bad,"ran cash register/self checkout."
bad,"Fast paced,  more expected of employees than time in the shift. Having to take extra long lunches to cut overtime anything over forty hours a week is a written warning"
bad,"Hard work,low pay, and fellow associates are hard to work with. If you have problems with anxiety this is a tough job. They are not concerned about they're employees"
bad,It was once a great job to work. but after the last 3 years its taken a dive. The mangers play favorites the is no more teamwork allowed. Any time you have a question or problem management is rude to answering if the don't just walk away first.
bad,It's rough and the managers attitudes are horrible. You don't get paid enough for the things they want you to do. You pretty much are a janitor if you work at night alone.
bad,"Lack of structures and management, their is too much favoritism and nepotism,. Change of command has lack of follow thru on employee complaints. Stressful environment."
bad,"I worked for walmart for about 2 years , it was my first very job. some thing happened in my life i lost a child and walmart till pointed me for my absences even though i was on greviance"
bad,"My biggest grievance would be the multiple times that I was promised a raise in pay to my already small earnings in exchange for extra work which was later refused. My extra positions and work, however, remained."
bad,no flexibility for hours no cares given for pre-existing commitments like school very stressful and no one teaches you what u really need to no for the job like how to catch a thief of a quick change artist instead you spend hours listening to an automated voice talk about terrorist financing if you get a job here you will seriously regret it in just under a year.
bad,"B.s.s is one of facility supporting coumpany which facilitates technical support team, housr keeping teams to do work in monthly bases, b.s.s belonges from haryana."
bad,"The things you hear aren't always true.  Fast paced, cut throat, management doesn't care about you. the only care that work is done and done quickly and when they feel it should be.. they will stand and watch you do it and not care if you need help."
bad,"I was a student worker and they said that I had a job with them, so I didn't look for a job.The week before I graduated they rudely tell me that I needed to find another job because I didn't work there anymore."
bad,"I dealt with a lot of customer complaints. I often worked long shifts, which resulted in not getting a lot of my breaks on time/ at all. A lot of the csm's wouldn't respond to any of the action codes I'd use while at the register with a customer when I needed them. A lot of the other workers either slacked off, or didn't know how to properly do their job duties. A few of the managers there had picked out which of the employees were their favorites. A lot of the customers were very rude, and impatient."
bad,"No fun except for those times the employees make there own.bad management very demanding ,talk down to you always.only plus is the pay.You can get overtime."
bad,"I was 60 when I started there, and they worked you very hard, and did not give creedence to your age. This caused me to be terminated because of personel dispute with management. My experience was never given any weight, when it came to job opportunities from within."
bad,"Management was awful and never addressed issues brought up multiple times. Customers were often aggressive and when a cashier felt uncomfortable or unsafe, management did not step in to protect their employees. Managers would't approve days off requested multiple weeks in advance until the day before. Pay was low with no opportunities for growth. Frequently was worked way over the amount of hours I requested and was told I could have."
bad,It was fine until a couple months ago they split the shift and cut hours. Now you have to almost fight for hours and it seems as though nobody cares about the workers anymore
bad,"The managers and coworkers made it a stressful place to work. As much I tried to stay to myself they always brought themselves around me with their problems,but I would always walk away."
bad,I will never wanna work for Walmart ever again no training at all no help with management no guidelines treatment no place for a person to build there trust as coworkers at that place no not never will I go back I got sick an they didn't take that as a health problem as of firing me do to 4days of being sick are the other 2days of helping other ppl
bad,"I enjoyed working with the public, however the managers were very contradictory when telling you what they needed to do. One manager would say one thing and another manager would tell you something different."
bad,"Horrible place to work.  Walmart does not care for you as a person or your family obligations.  If you wish to loose your family, this is the place to work.  You will be scheduled every holiday, if you wish time off you have to request it over a month in advance with no probability that you will receive it.  Worst place to work"
bad,"For this company to be about team work, I had to struggle alone at times while the management team walked pass. The best part about working for Walmart was the customers;the cons were the selected candidates for management. Walmart has poor management. When their employees resign, they're quitting bosses; they aren't quitting the job."
bad,"This company does not give the best benefits anymore, and the managers are incompetent and should hardly be managers. You don't get paid for working holidays at all."
bad,It was a good job till new managers came in then they had to make a name for their self.They throw a fit if you have to go to the bathroom while on your shift
bad,I worked temporary remodel overnights for 13 weeks. I am 53 years old but I did not receive much respect. They keep holding the carrot over our heads saying that permanent employment was possible. When the remodel finished they then informed everyone that they are not hiring.
bad,Management was horrible. They all were very demanding while they all sat back and did nothing. Co workers were not friendly at all. The negative energy that management and co workers would put off made it hard to work and make the best of your shift.
bad,"Being a toy Department manager with no associates to help. Have to pull freight yourself. Constantly setting displays. Cross merchandising"
bad,"There are a few good managers in the store, but for the most part they don't care about anything that doesn't have to do directly with them. Management hardly responds when you page them for customer assistance. You get four points for a six month period before you are fired, which is reasonable, until you are in the hospital a day and sent home the next and still get the points even though it wasn't your choice to not go in to work."
bad,"When i stared working for Wal-Mart it was a good job at the time i just think the pay wasn't enough. they just need to work beter on management  "
bad,"It was mostly my store. It was very unorganized and very unprofessional. The management was unprofessional. The everyday work style was unprofessional The human resources were unprofessional. They do not value good workers. In fact, almost everyone that was working there when I was working there has quit. With the acceptation of 3 or 4 because they admitted to if they left that they would have to actually work at another store. I do not approve of this store. I approve of Walmart, just not this location."
bad,Working for Walmart was just another part-time experience. My hours were steady and the wage was minimum. Most of the staff were nice. management needs work.
bad,"Just to stressful people always arguing walking around just doing no work at all customers threats towards the managers , managers don't know how to actually at professional its just sad"
bad,"untrustworthy supervisor who would hide and watch you work but those that did not work like they supposed to would get special treatment and not have to perform their jobs correctly. When you would say something nothing would be done."
bad,Not flexible one bit. Managers sucked at their jobs. They run off of a point system and if you get like 3 points in your first 3 months you get fired.
bad,"When I started, the store had a great front end Manager.  He was moved to the back end and the front end had no immediate Manager or Supervisor."
bad,"It is Walmart what do you expect. The management does not care. They only want the final dollar, and do not care about the employee. I would not recommend."
bad,walmart had bad management and poor pay they let bad mangement make poor calls and dont question any of it . overall it was not a good experince for me
bad,"always stressful"
bad,"I had outside stress asked to step down was told that I could not step only be let go or quit, came back and I was let go with no one asking if I was okay or was returning to work."
bad,Very stressful if you are motivated to complete your work to the best of your ability. Management only seems to care about their bonus.Most managers do not seem to have any idea of what maintenance is responsible for.
bad,"low pay, only 15-20 hours a week, discount only on some items, no  benefits, work culture low, no advancement, no opportunity to learn was put on register instead of teaching how to handle insurance"
bad,"I have learned that working in a stressful place trains to work at faster pace and also helps keep up with your work. You also learn how to read different peoples body movements and dealing with difficult peoples issues. Also you have to learn about working with different personalities, and how to do your job professionally and but respectively. Which is something that I had work on for two years. You also learned how to deal with a situation and how to properly fix without causing the issue to escalate."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is long and sometimes with the right staff very Friendly.  I am not prejudice by any means, but, sometimes people can be very cold in the work place especially Walmart. The Manager does not smile or speak when he sees one of his employees and I spoken just to say yes every time I saw him. The Walmart at 14000 Worth Avenue needs training in being a customer service associate. The hardest part of the job is they don't want you to leave after you have worked an 8 hour shift."
bad,"This job is a last resort step to get something going, yes I have learned a lot in my years with walmart but they have some learning to do themselves about how to treat their employees learn how to handle productivity issues with their associates, definitely have issues giving promotions to associates who ""prove"" they deserve it by asking one question relating to customer service which makes no sense on how someone can be judged to be a good candidate for mangement."
bad,"this job helped me to recover from loss of previous job, and with minimum employment options in area this was sufficient of a place to work. Recommended to those that can't find a job and need a regular job that will be open year round and will always need people to work here"
bad,"Management isn`t the best, Customers can be so rude but its because they never schedule people right so we are always understaffed even though we have cashiers."
bad,"only thing I guess i can say is, dont make this job permanent. you will hate your life. and management is... no words... life at walmart is okay if you have friends but the customers are the worst part about it"
bad,Alright for a temp job. If you were just needing a side job also. But I do not recommend because the employees do not get taken care of. Its all bout what makes the company look good.
bad,"store unorganised managers not doing there jobs correctly which makes me not able to do my job"
bad,"Being degraded, and addressing the issue with no solution was my biggest issue with Wal-Mart. Otherwise, management is ran very poorly and not held accountable. In fact, the workers who work their tail off, are the ones who suffer the worst."
bad,"this job has its ups and downs, I've enjoyed working there aside from the poor management. Expect so much without showing/explaining. A lot of threats."
bad,"So demanding to their employees, even part-time associates needs to open their availability or else they'll give you 12hrs a week. and they will throw you everywhere. (all busy department)  and you have to work hard as if they were paying you that much. and btw, most of the new employees have higher rates in the salary than the old ones. The maximum increase you can get is .50cents a year. I mean if you reach your 1 year anniversary at walmart they will give you ratings on how you work. 1,2,3,4,5. but usually they'll give you 3 means .30cents. and the management is very poor. and some of the customers belittle the associates. SMH"
bad,"Management really needs to step up. The Walmart I worked at was corrupt. I think it's because it was a new store so they threw in ""managers"" that didn't have a clue what there were doing just added to have someone fill a position"
bad,"Constant work but it gives you the opportunity of learning various functions that can take you in other directions, career wise. It can be demanding but also sometimes rewarding."
bad,"The Crew is great but the mangers talk down to you and give you no respect, I enjoyed working with my coworkers and I loved my job But I don't understand how some people become mangers at Walmart"
bad,People who are lazy get promoted and treat the associates poorly! Workers should be treated better and more fairly! Management needs to follow the proper procedures and guidelines instead of finding ways to take shortcuts. Walmart as a company is going downhill slowly.
bad,"management needs some work, they are rude and so are the cashiers that work there, I've seen them on their phones at the registers, you do have a few good people that work there but not many and others are rude and disrespectful."
bad,Little to no opportunity for advancement. little to no communication skills and just an overall poor work environment due to no set schedule and attitude of other employees.
bad,"Working with Walmart really opened my mind. Co-workers always felt that the wages were too low to drive and not receive any benefits if they were PT. As an employee I had similar thoughts and feelings, but when I became pregnant they gave me Family Medical Leave Act, but in hopes of being rehired those ideas were shunned and they made me feel like I was worthless and couldn't receive any unemployment either. I had to bed rested during my pregnancy and they kept making me chase my tail."
bad,Wal-mart was a lot into favoritism and it was very hard to get promoted unless you never talked back and had no brains. I worked here for 6 years and was treated horribly. Also there were some inappropriate issues happening with the management. I would not recommend this job.
bad,There managers need to be held more accountable they expect overnight stickers to work with a time table which is calculated by a compare that has never stock one product of pallet.the hard work is not considered ever.as long as night managers have store up to store managers satisfaction. And make themselves look good regardless of their night crew.
bad,"Not allowed to select days when could not work to facilitate setting of medical appointments. Worked night shift then scheduled for next morning shift. Not allowed to give away shifts to others without getting in trouble."
bad,"No chances of moving upward in the department. Management was as awful as the pay. My weekly hours exceeded 45-50, even though I was ""part time"". They didn't want to provide any benefits or good pay"
bad,I was an employee for 2 years.  The ripley location is based on discrimination of all types going on at this location.  So I'm not probably the one you want to give opinions regarding walmart.
bad,"Over,the co.could and should do better by it associates,better benefits ,such as holiday pay, etc,better pay ,treat associates with respect  ,take away the point system"
bad,"My walmart was terrible. They hire people that don't work or show up for work and fire those that try to do their work well, but sometimes can't come."
bad,The front end management has favorites which means only certain people are able to move up.There is way to much retaliation going on.If you get on someones bad side which don't take much your hours will be cut!Customers judge us associates by the actions of our management.My advise would be to leave Walmart as a last resort to work at!Beeville 463
bad,Customers are always angry at you and when you call for help from management it takes to long according to me and the customers for them to show up if they do at all.They get paid tens of thousands more a year and you end up doing their job and you make thirteen thousand a year and they make up to seventy thousand a year more then you.
bad,I just had a bad experience with Walmart managers and hours. It was stressful and i didn't really get trained completely for my position. One of the managers didn't want me to change my hours and i had to for school. He made it like i had to work a certain time.
bad,"paid very little, expected so much and talked down to you like you were a child and stupid, treated with very little respect, did not care about the times you were scheduled if they wanted you to stay and finish something you had no choice even if u had finished your work to make up for others lack of work, managers had people they liked and they were given special treatment"
bad,The work is easy but the management is pretty bad because its always changing. You have too many managers at which they all tell you to do something different while the other is asking you to do something else.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of a Walmart Associates day is helping the customer!  It is great to help people find what they need and direct them to services they need.  The online availability to e-commerce is growing and becoming highly popular with customers.  If you enjoy a varied work schedule and a rollercoaster work ethic, you'll love Walmart."
bad,"I found working for this company was completely awful. The management was poor, they belittled their staff and spoke poorly to customers. They didn't communicate with each other, they over looked the employees that worked hard and were reliable to promote their friends."
bad,"I absolutely hated working at Walmart. They pay their employees lower than they should considering the amount of work they do. There were different styles of management, for one would tell you their way and the other would tell you theirs. It was very hard to decide who you were to follow. They would often tell their employees to hurry up with whatever they were doing to provide another task, but it was in a degrading way. I only stayed because of the quarterly bonuses and just becoming comfortable with the place."
bad,"You could be scheduled for a long shift but be told to go home early because it was slow and there was no chance of making up hours. If you would ask for more hours they would tell you that you need to ""bid"" on them"
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place. I was unhappy. I was told it was a full time position and turns out it was only part time. Just be aware of what i learned and ask questions.
bad,"I was a cashier when I started. From there, the job was decent but once I volunteered to learn Money Center and Customer Service, the managers took advantage of that and made me work all three positions nearly every day and I was not ever given the pay to go with the two other positions. They overwork you and yet they don't respect you or the fact that you have a life outside of Walmart."
bad,"While Walmart will tell you that family matters it's sply not true. Scheduled 50 hours, was not uncommon to work well over. That's fine except when family life needs tending to (appointments that are rare or a death in the family) it's very difficult to get the time needed out of vacation to get there. "
bad,"They don't have any room for advancement within the company, and don't care if you have a family or family issues going on. They always give the same associates holidays off every year."
bad,"I enjoyed working for this company but I believe it needs to be more open about positions that are available, willing to work more with their staff, and accepting limitations on those who need it not want it.  What I mean is, don't expect everything to done by one associate where there are others there to help.  I have stepped up numerous times for my coworkers and when I got sick on the job... they (my coworkers) all said, ""I am too busy to help her."""
bad,"I hated working for walmart, you're never given the time to complete your computer classes, yet can be reprimanded if they aren't being done. Cashiering isn't hard however it can be boring or insane depending on the customers. You're required to work all holidays. Management usually doesn't care."
bad,Working here you arent treated fairly. You get overworked when you are working. You have to not only do your job just the job of other people. You never get your breaks on time. Its rare that you get out when your supposed to.
bad,A typical work day is stressful due to staffing issues and co-workers who do not pull their weight. I haven't really learned anything. I had retail experience when I came. They don't pay based on experience.  Management is vey poor and seem to be more concerned with authority rather than everyone working together to achieve a common goal. They tend to focus on the least significant things while proper staffing and employee development are placed on the back burner. The culture is corrupt because they dishonor employee confidentiality and management are dishonest. Management are never held accountable for wrongdoings. Everything falls on the associate even when management is at fault. They do not support their staff when handling issues with customers. It's like they have no consideration for employee attraction and retention. Workloads are heavy often falling on few people while company favorites get away with doing less with no consequence. I could go on and on and on. The hardest part is having to make record of everything you do just to cover your tracks because they love to play the blame game. Often you will need evidence to support your claims. The most enjoyable part of the job is pleasant regulars(customers). I've worked at other locations and they were not like this. I guess it depends on management at each store.
bad,"It is a job, but watch which manager or associate you talk to because Walmart is great at brain washing their employees especially the ones who been their for a long time. Also if you don't mind piking up the slack for old people go ahead because if you are able body have fun being a mangers go to person. I left could not take one of the mangers who was basically my superior. Rude, favoritism, liar, Manipulator, and spoke in Spanish when he wanted to talk about people luckily I knew Spanish lets just say I would not go to a random person outside of work and say half of what he says."
bad,"Walmart treats it's employees like dirt, not enough pay, they expect too much from it's workers and do not back them up when a customer complains about the worker, they don't listen to the workers side of the story."
bad,"False statements on benefits"
bad,"Terrible managers who had no idea what was going on half the time, they had no automotive experience whats so ever. often would never defend their workers who had done nothing wrong"
bad,I am so disappointed with how they treat you there I was let go for something petty and no warnings at all. The hours suck you work every holiday and weekends no life outside of work.
bad,When I started to work at Walmart it was ok I really liked it but it seems the longer that you worked there the worse it was like shorter schedules so it was less money and you only got paid every two weeks
bad,"Working in the pharmacy was the only thing that kept me from quitting Walmart.  The pharmacy at my store was filled with great people."
bad,"When I used to work here, I was excited my first day because i was making more at journeys and Texas Roadhouse. But after a while management started leaving and we got new management. That's not always fun because it just overall sucks. I felt like i wasn't getting paid fully for my hrs and it was a mess talking to them and trying to figure stuff out. They do not care if you are sick or if a family member is in the hospital. My grandma got heart surgery and we didn't know if she was going to make it after it. So i explained my situation and they said thats fine. I come in the next day and a different manager talks to me about it and tells me that im close to being fired cause im almost out of currents. currents are points that you can miss out of work. So then i thought that was ridiculous so i had to leave because they do not care at all."
bad,"Um bom local de trabalho, gostei de trabalhar na empresa."
bad,"Não gostei de trabalhar na empresa,pois não tinham respeito com os funcionários,não tinham os folgas,não tinham os horários para alimentação...."
bad,Walmart is a horrible place to work the only position that I feel is good is a co manager. That’s the only position that gets treated right. Everyone underneath gets used.
bad,"Walmart is not an ideal place to work. Their pay is too low for their expectations. Not to mention, its a place for people without families. They wont work with you on hours when your family depends on you."
bad,"ISD just got refurbished, though now a ghost town due to jet.com aquisition, other M&A activities."
bad,Managers cant do there job. Lazy people who have degrees. Managers there should be long gone. End up working til 8 every night when your scheduled til 5:45.
bad,The company is a decent company to work for. My co workers were amazing. They became my extended family. The managers were not professional and treated the employees like they were morons and like slaves. Not all wal marts are bad. I believe its the managers that set the tone of the work place.ive had a chance to go back. I declined!
bad,"Being a full time student, the company didn't work well with my school schedule. A lot of the management were rude and there seemed to be needless drama in the workplace that made work very uncomfortable as well as unprofessional"
bad,"extremely fast paced, extremely physically demanding, computer tells you what to do, like being on a super highway hauling freight on power equipment, walkout at the end of shift sore everyday with no energy left for family or myself."
bad,Working at Walmart was alright. I did not like the management. I did other things than be a cashier. I stocked shelves and assisted customers. The management wasn't that good.
bad,"This was the last job I held before re-entering school. It was fast-paced, and required heavy lifting and great time management. The workplace culture was decent, with many coworkers offering help when needed."
bad,its a very fast paced environment. the location I was at was very trashy not professional at all. management was terrible. but I learned how to have great customer service because no one else did.
bad,I took this job purely because I had nothing else and no one else was hiring at the time. They had ridiculous expectations and paid next to nothing at the time.
bad,quite possibly the worst job I have ever had. I worked at one as an unloader in high school and another one in TLE through college. aside from managers the employees are not treated well in my opinion. the benefits offered are a joke.
bad,"Walmart is an okay place to work. They give you the hours you want/need, but also give the option to get more hours. I think there is a need for new management along with the changes that are happening. Telling employees that they should quit their job, and give long, hard talks for sometimes hours on end about ""productivity"" should not be happening. On multiple occasions I found myself leaving work in tears because of how we are treated. For the first 6 months none of my supervisors knew my name and barely acknowledged me."
bad,Terrible bad experience management has bad attitude and it feels like a very toxic environment so I would not recommend to anyone. Maybe a good first job but that is all
bad,Not a good place to work. Very few people are nice. Very dirty they barely ever clean the store. It was like working at a high school with all he childish behavior.
bad,"this job had little to no room for advancement unless you live and breath walmart. the pay was well below the what you deserve for the amount of work that you were required to accomplish. while you work at walmart your life doesn't matter, your problems don't matter, your goals don't matter. more often than not you will be demanded to work odd shifts some over 14 hours per day. the management team at walmart are unskilled and ignore the requests and complaints of there workers. i have nothing good to say about this job"
bad,Management here is always sour. If it's not you there upset at it's someone else. They liked to leave me for hours at night and not answer my calls when I needed to use the restroom. One night I even had an accident and had to go home because no one would relieve me to simply go use the restroom.
bad,"Very stressful. Many occurrences in which managers were needed but unable to be found. ""Training"" very prolonged and confusing. Low tech resulted in many machine failures. Many instances of having to push carts in unsafe weather for 3+ hours."
bad,This place is a horrible job. The pay is laughable compared to the amount of work you do. management has no idea what they're doing. Wal-Mart only cares about money and not the employees
bad,Working here is down right a joke there is a point system after so many points you get fired. For example if your child gets sick and is in the hospital you get points each day you are out and it can cost you your job. Now it wasn't always like this it was at one time a great place to work and I can even understand the point system to a degree because there are people that call out just to call out but when there is a doctors note envolved then said points should be used
bad,The management there seem like they don't know what they are doing. They will pass you up for a higher position and give it to someone who has no experience in it. They definitely favor people and if they don't like you they will be very rude to you. And they don't take problems seriously. It's lottery impossible to get a raise there and to get any time off whether it's for a doctors appointment or vacation.
bad,They don't pay off of experience.. Unless you add every job you have ever had even if it was for an day.... Lack of communication and help where needed
bad,"I worked at Walmart in my Senior year of high school. The managers did not work with my high school schedule at all and would often schedule me at least 32 hours per week. At the time I was taking college classes at Collin County and several AP classes and it was hard to keep up. If I had potential hours I was working. I had no time to study. Also, Walmart is fast-paced, there are a lot of customers always and the manager would yell if the parking lot wasn't clean, if you had gone on the other side than they assigned or if you let the side you were not assigned to build up. There was no winning. The pay was good for what it was, $8 an hour, but due to the management and the bureaucracy of Wal-Mart I would not recommend the company and I never tried to go back"
bad,"When i was working for walmart it started out great, but as time went by ,the work and labor out weighed the pay,and the confusion on where pallets would go made it difficult to be fully productive"
bad,"The rating is dependant on location. In Gilbert AZ it was amazing. I was given the chance to move up and learn many different facets of the company. Management took pride in assisting employees advance and succeed.  In Pueblo CO they fail to adhere to company standards. I transferred from a supervisor to cake decorator. When I entered I was told I couldn't attempt to get into supervision because other people had been at the location longer, they had seniority over me. Seniority isn't the structure Walmart uses. Management was inconsistent with demands, and overall moral was low."
bad,Mostly kids and people only needing a supplemental income. Lack of motivation and work ethic. Mainly now about just having workers do things to cover the status quo.
bad,I was told that no nose piercings were allowed so I took mine out even though I had just got it and paied $40 for it. And then later i see other employees were them and some have eyebrows to. I had to work almost all holidays and I was having car trouble and couldn't make it to work sometimes so I was fired.
bad,"Es un buen trabajo, pero requiere de buenos jefes."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at Walmart. I've had awful hours, from leaving work at 12a to returning at 7a. I once had to work 2p to 11p and return at 2a to 11p. There was never a clear direction from management and team leads, creating chaos and tension."
bad,"I worked hard for this company for 3 years, in this time I was unappreciated. Management is constantly changing, and not all management wanted the same things, so it was very frustrating to try hard at something and it not be good enough. Long hours were required but no overtime was allowed. I wish I would have spent 3 years doing something career worthy instead of wasting my hard work on people who didn't care about me or my future."
bad,I feel the individual stores should have more control over their staff and policies based on the store location and the people. Walmart prides itself on family but when it comes to their employees they don't care. If you miss so many days they fire you no matter if your a good employee or not. Then rehire them in 30 days and not only do they start from scratch they have to go through the same training over again. That is a complete waste of money.  If you want a set schedule then Walmart is it if you need a flexible one just don't bother to apply.
bad,"15 hour days. philosophy was reactive instead of proactive, high turnover, long days , not much planning all work was extremely reactive instead of bing proactive."
bad,"With my time with the company i loved what i learned and the skills, but when it comes to management they are cut throat and do not care about their employees."
bad,"I won't complaint about the workload or the tasks assigned but overall, the management at Walmart is not efficient at all. Adjusting hours is almost impossible therefore, it becomes impossible to continue working especially for college students. The managers are not cooperative at all, everything is super-complicated, there is a high amount of stress at work, and one does not get paid according to the work they take from a person. I don't know about other positions, but working as a front-end cashier was a nightmare for me. Many of my co-workers were very cooperative and friendly and I wanted to continue working as I really need a job to survive. However, I tried my best and I requested the manager to change my schedule as I worked late till night in summer. I live far, I had to walk an hour to get there as there wasn't any public transportation that could take me there so it was hard for me to manage. But they didn't listen and my semester was about to start. All these factors altogether, forced me to submit my resignation."
bad,"They don't care how hard they make it on employees. Nobody can rely on their hours. They cannot even work 40 hours and want to pay them nothing! When I worked there, I worked very hard and had strange hours. They paid me 6.90 an hour!!!!!!!!!!! Nobdoy can live on that!!!!!!!!! NOBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,pushed to do more work than humanly possible within a shift. Getting paid less after 5 years then new hires that only work as cashiers. Paid time off is approved in order of request.
bad,"When I worked at Wal-Mart, they would give you some respect but overall it was pretty ridiculous. I would have to go to the bathroom all of the time due to medical reasoning and one of the employees refused to let me go to the bathroom and when that person did let me go, they would huff and puff and talk about me to other cashiers. This person also made me cry several times. Worst place to work."
bad,want you r to work long hour does not want to any over time never have enough help for each departments management is just wanting to make good number for bonuses do not care how they treat the employees. very bad company to work for anymore
bad,but some walmart managers feel like they are too good to help you. you cant make over time they dont care you are sick if you call offf to many times your going to get fired
bad,They work me like a dog. I would never go back. I worked in stocking and they had me lifting the blow up beds from the top shelf when other men were around. I lifted all the heavy things while my male co worker picked food.
bad,"The company brags about a standard of excellence, however that standard varies wildly between locations.  The store I worked in was riddled with harassment. Complaints about that behavior were ignored on a district and corporate level regularly. Not an employee friendly environment or company. Schedule changes could be made within 24 hrs of shift and you didn't always receive notification of them. Management turnover is high."
bad,"If you like to talk and enjoy your job, Walmart isn't the place. Between constant credit card offers and rude management, you're guaranteed to be miserable. Unless 10 dollars an hour outweighs your misery."
bad,"It is what you expect it to be. Not a glorious job, low pay, hard on the body and dull on the mind. Hard on the joints, cement floors are no ones friend, and hard on the lower back."
bad,This company i was blessed to work for Walmart but this company needs to appreciate they employees they say they pay 10 a hour but u don't no health insurance no 401k and they don't realize that people need to work but still have a life u get paid every two weeks and they should get paid every week i just think they need more work on their policy and strong people and view all management team because they r whats wrong ceo needs to visit every store with it being a surprise like under cover boss
bad,"This job experience wasn't the greatest for me. After some disagreements with management over things like my weekly hours, and level of training..I quit. I would work for another subway, just not with the ones in my town."
bad,I stocked various departments in the store.  I liked the people I came in contact with.  Management was not good.  They only liked certain people.  If you work hard for them they want more.
bad,I loved my coworkers but management is not all that great. They don't work for their emoloyees..  They are not flexoble with scheduling and don't really care for family matters outside of work
bad,Management  was bad disrespectful pay wasnt wasn't enough for what they wanted you to do no growth in walmart no promotions very strict do other things beside your job but didnt get payed more
bad,"Sad place to work. No communicaton between management and workers. NO forward thinking as for prevention of problems from upcoming events, and inspection ,makes everything a rush."
bad,Walmart is a place to work for supplemental income and not good to make a career out of.  Good for learning retail and customer service on the entry level.
bad,"I liked working with people ,the corporate structure leaves a lot to desire. the hardest part of the job was knowing what each manager wanted.the most enjoyable part was dealing with the custmers and solving thair problems"
bad,This was an entry level position making minimum wage. Part time during college it was manageable but having to work full time seems dreadful would not recommend.
bad,dead culture; management only cares about themselves; good 'ole boy network; can't get a promotion unless you know someone; working hard gets you nowhere; everyone fears for their job on a regular basis - NO job security
bad,People are not going by the rules and are just doing what they want to do. And there 8ant no respect given and no I e is there to help you when you need it
bad,Unorganized employers that don't like to give out hours (the 2 Wal-Marts I worked at anyways) they also expect employee to do a 2 man job by themselves in the same time.
bad,"Since is a department store you can learn from using the register, to stock new merchandise on the sales floor. You learn a little bit of everything and at the end of the day if you decide to get another job you will have more options available that other people that just work in a supermarket for example. Besides since Walmart is a very busy place due to their low prices you will learn how to multitask under pressure. However if you decide to stay in the company, you can also grow in the store and maybe you end up being the store manager of a new store in the future."
bad,Working at Walmart was stressful for me. I ended up in the hospital a few times from the stress. This job made me sick and even miscarried. The only good thing was the experience ive gained.
bad,"Walmart shows a lot of favoritism and is not fair to the workers. The managers show no remorse when you are ill or pregnant and it is definitely not a family store,"
bad,"It was a job that paid, but could have paid better. Not as family oriented as they say for their employees, they do not work around your schedule unless you fight for it."
bad,Managment could be more helpful with the customers. Need to take better initiative with customer complaints. Not very flexible so its hard to have another job.
bad,The managers at Wal-mart only look out for themselves and will fire without reason or finding out what is actually happening in a situation. They wont give you benefits unless you work 40+ hours a week but also wont schedule those hours.
bad,"processing transactions, helping customers find the products needed, cleaning and filling stock.  The staff fun to work with.  Customers can be difficult at times."
bad,"I see a lot of the reviews stating the management was very helpful . I completely disagree with that . Like one review said ,they are never around when you need them . I think the only way things get done are the cooperation among the employees . they have to in general figure things out for themselves. As for good pay , what planet are you from ? They only hire part time so they don't have to pay any benefits and the miniscule pay raises  they hand out each year are a laugh ."
bad,Short staffed. Management was rude and not very understanding. Alot of drama between workers and higher ups. Very stingy with overtime.The pay wasn't that great even working on nights. Only managers were payed decent.
bad,A typical day at work is cashiering and greeting customers. I learned patience with the job. The hardest part was keeping a smile on my face on my bad days. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
bad,"Management could care less about employees unless they are buddies, pay is poor while you do your job and your coworkers jobs, advancement is only an option if the managers like you enough and not because you are a hard worker"
bad,"i worked in store individualy "
bad,"Wal-Mart is very strict with point systems and give you coachings for stupid reasons. The environment wasn't what I was told. Some of the staff weren't nice people. And some of them start drama, which affected the work place."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the staff. They were not very coordinated and it was hard working together when everyone thought they were superior and their way was better.
bad,management is a joke staff are usually lazy bums shifts get taken away at a moments notice you can be transferred to other departments with no notice write ups for something you didn't do to trap you there would not recommend working there
bad,Working at Walmart was not the best choice that I made as a student. They are not particularly accommodating of student schedules. The management team are overworked which in turn negatively affects their employees.
bad,No advancement encouragements from Upper management.  Workplace culture is well diversified.  This company taught me that not all places truly care about their employees.
bad,Clocked in and went to the backroom to start my day. We had 6 sections to choose from and one person inside the truck (which was me). I'd fill up the line with the products so the other can take off the line and stack it on a pallet
bad,"Typical day at work was literally the same thing everyday, stocking, helping people find things, and repeat. There was nothing different happening. I didn't learn much cause all you need is commonsense to work here. Management was moody and backstabbing towards their employees as well dating their employees. There was nothing hard about the job. I personally didn't enjoy the job."
bad,"this place is horrible, understaffed, and your nothing but a number in the system, doesn't matter if your there 10  years or 30, good place for first time employee to get experience, other then that, completely horrible job"
bad,It's  Easy & Cool It's Not That We Don't Have As Many Hours & They Don't care About There Employees. I work with good employees & Some managers are Great.
bad,"They do not have good benefits, they do not have employee advancement. They do give raises to their employees though, so compensation is alright. Ok for a beginner in the working field"
bad,"The job is just like any other retail job, except pay is a little better. The job is fine, customers suck, management suck. They treat people like we're less than human and like kids."
bad,"A good job for someone who doesnt have the will to advance. Most associates become stagnant in their positions because advancement is very minimal. Weak Pay for the work that is expected to be performed,"
bad,I did not enjoy working here. The management needed help and mostly everyone was bias. They always had open positions with no one to fill it which ended up having me pick up more slack.
bad,"At the store I worked out there was too much management. "
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever had. Management constantly degrades and condescends employees while petting others. the pay is a joke, the work is hard, and the people are rude."
bad,Walmart Skipped Me On 2 Pay Checks And It Took months for Me To Get Them. The Commack Walmart Is Horrible ! The Managers Mouth is Very valguar And The Associates Are Problem Starters. Didn't Enjoy Working There Or For Walmart .
bad,"There is very little chance of moving up the ladder, you will do the same thing over and over everyday, and very few friendly people work here."
bad,"poor management wages were very low, over time wasn't allowed. the management makes it well known that the employees are not valued because they're easily replaceable."
bad,"Not a very competitive base pay or salary and inflexible. However, family oriented and productive. The laboring does not equate to pay, and therefore lowers the morale. Great learning experience."
bad,"I would spend long days doing repetitive tasks, my back got sore very quick. Was promoted to mid-level management but was nearly paid the same as a cashier. Management will say performance is poor, even though they don't give enough training for management positions. I am glad I left."
bad,The pay wasnt that great and the management treated you like you were their slave. The only good thing about that place was being able to wear jeans which I loved
bad,"This is a start up operation, very unorganized. There were several processes that used on a daily basis for this job description, accounts  payable/reconciliation. The supervisors were not trained to do the processes and the training team was not consistent in teaching the processes. This made a very simple process difficult."
bad,"I collect carts in the parking lot for the customers. The days typically run smoothly because I have cooperative coworkers. They help to keep me upbeat and happy. My hours change daily which makes it difficult to plan a week. The management is unfair and partial to certain employees for no reason, which affects the way I feel about going to work."
bad,"Receber, conferir e autorizar o armazenamento, aprendi muito pois era um emprego aonde era totalmente que fazia, nada contra a gerência , pois não tinha muita convivência com os eles , os colegas de trabalhos eram muitos unidos ajudando uns aos outros , a parte mais difícil era conviver com a má falta de desprezo que a empresa tinha com os funcionários e a parte mais ou menos boanão tinha ."
bad,Honestly the only good thing about working at store 3734 was the great break room and a few great associates. I would not go back to this store unless i was offered a management position so i could fix all the issues i saw within the store
bad,Right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  Have to have certain training on the computer that management won't give you time to do. Then you are penalized for not doing.
bad,I absolutely loved my position. The management was horrible. They did the least they could possibly do in any situation. My co workers were less then pleasant.
bad,Poor compensation for the amount of responsibilities. Only recommend for high school or those who lack education and experience to find a career elsewhere.
bad,I don't like here because they don't give enough hours to their full time associate. management have their favoritism. they don't listen to their associates need. all important to them our their self only.
bad,"Got cut by bent metal and got stitches, and as well as my disabilities, they used all of it against me and made false reasons to terminate me, ban me, and accused me of being a dangerous liability"
bad,Worst place the management doesn't care about there employees. Your not getting paid enough for all the foolishness you have to deal with on a daily basis.
bad,"A typical work day was customers complaining there were not enough workers at the register. I learned self control, because customers yell and scream and curse out the employees and there is nothing we can do but keep them calm."
bad,"This is the worst job anyone could have, when working here you have no life. I would not recommend this job. This was my first job. I do not miss this place, I miss the people I worked with."
bad,management doesnt really care about you give you low hours always have to find management to get more hours but its impossible to get to them unless you call. I
bad,"This job was terrible. Would work employees all night just to come back in a few hours later to work day shift. Poor management, poor pay, lack of work ethic from managers."
bad,"Alot of favoritism, alot on unfair working practices, co - workers are cool, employee confidentiality is a zero and everyone seems to know your business before you do, its just an uncomfortable working environment."
bad,"The biggest thing I disliked about this place was the fact I worked well over part time hours, and was never giving the option to get benefits. It really was a bummer."
bad,"Management was terrible and didn't know what they were talking about most of the time. Had to close every night. Not enough closers, threw away tons of product while managers told us to make more. Hated this job, otherwise the pay was decent for a broke college student ($8.25/hour)"
bad,Walmart use to be a fun place to work but not anymore They no longer treat employees with respect and they keep cutting your hours and changing your availability.
bad,"Working for Walmart was very different for me.  I worked in sales for over a year now.  You are told things at hiring, however as time passed, your pay was not increased as told and you were not moved to the position you were told you were getting."
bad,"S m h... Its an ok place to work. Upper management acts as if we are slaves and they do not care for us. Every worker in my store is part time, so no benefits until one year after youve worked their."
bad,"A typical day at work was extremely busy for a full 8 hours. This is a good thing since I like being busy. However, I do not wish to express my personal opinion of working at Walmart as I prefer to maintain a positive outlook."
bad,"Out of the several people I worked with, there were two out of many managers that actually cared. It didn't matter if you actually did your job or not, they pick who they don't like, and who they're going to place the blame on if things don't get done. I stopped caring about my own work when they stopped caring whether I was the only one pulling my weight or not."
bad,horrible management but I typically would sign in ever day then get to work immediately on my assigned isle. I am very thankful for the time I spent at this job it helped improve my people skills for dealing with even the most difficult customers. The management was for the most part efficient although occasionally their communication could be off they were for the most part good at their jobs. My coworkers were very friendly and I got along with all of them. The hardest part by far would be getting a very irritable customer. As for the most enjoyable part it was making friends with my customers and coworkers alike.
bad,The expectations are often out of wack with the time and resources given they do not know the meaning of SMART Goals. With that said it really depends on the particular store I have worked at a couple of locations and one of the stores was a great place to work.
bad,"Not really much to say about this retail job, they claimed to care about their staff and support veterans; but they never wanted to help them excel and it was all about who was friends with who."
bad,Enjoy decorating cakes and cupcakes. The customers are always awesome. Co workers are helpful. The bakery manager could be nicer and treat all employees the same.
bad,There is favoritism really bad.. if ur not a favorite u won't get raises or advancement.. They don't care if customers steal.  They only watch their employees for stealing. They don't trust u at all. Their benifits the medical sucks.
bad,Customers are constantly rude. Teamwork is almost nonexistent. absolutely no room for promotions. Management doesn't care about anyone but themselves
bad,Is an organization that does not invest in there employees or offer advancement unless your willing to do more with out an increase in pay!  They want more from a person but does little to encourage it!
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work if you are a student or are inbetween jobs/careers. There was not a lot of opprotunity for advancement, but there were flexible hours. Cashiering and Customer Service are good departments to work it, but it can be tiring. Overall, only worked there to earn some money before finding something else."
bad,"Working for Walmart was a great experienced for me. Every now and then, we would get a customer that was upset. Staying calm myself, I was able to calm them down and help get the problem solved. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, we got along just fine. The most enjoyable part if the job besides my co-workers, was the customers."
bad,"The pay is poor for what you have to deal with just with management, not even including the ludicrous customers. Also, every holiday has been ruined by working there."
bad,This was the worst job I ever worked at. They don't listen to you. They overload with work and send you no help. They overlook the work you put in. They don't give you overtime. They give special privileges to some and get rid of the rest. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"A typical night at Walmart as an over night stocker means not being able to sit down unless break is called, poor management, and rude co workers. Your daily schedule consists of working all night until morning, and sleeping all day missing out on family activities. The hardest part of the job was working on more than 100 boxes to stock by yourself. The only enjoyable part about the job was the one hour lunch breaks and sometimes we would get free lunch."
bad,"People had nasty atitudes ,bad management, no hours,The works had drama going on, bad communication, they didn't have a lot of security to keep the customers from picking a fight with employees"
bad,I worked in accounting office. the manager at the time was super racist and rude. I quit when I left to go to school. the have their favorites. they forgot that you have a life outside of walmart.
bad,The environment was always very hectic . I believe the experience was well needed for me to move onto better things . Walmart was never a company i seen myself moving up.
bad,"I would never work here, you get paid bad and get treated bad all at the same time! They do not give you what you are looking for. Worse time of my life."
bad,"You punch in  to go hunt for a head person to see where and what your duties are for that shift, that takes about 15 min, sometimes you bounce around because there are not enough people,  I do like the interaction with the customers and co-workers, you have to have a good sense of humor working for that company. the hardest part is the hrs. flex, one week you get 27 the next 13 the next 39 never know what your pay check will be, hard to budget. they will not make you a full time employee even if you get 40 hrs. week for a whole yr."
bad,I myself have trained in numerous departments and have obtained several skills which allow me to work in other departments. Although my supervisory and management teams withhold any chance for my advancement because we at 3320 are terribly understaffed. Many associates would gladly choose to relocate to another store that values their hard working associates more than at our store. I myself need more hours to work and less days where I am not scheduled without my consent.
bad,"I took this job because I needed a place to work that would fit my upcoming school schedule. I ended up leaving the job because they were unwilling to work around my school, and I decided that school was more important."
bad,"At my specific location, that facility was a joke. The management/supervision was a complete joke. There was 2 CSM's who were concerned for the cashiers and other associates but majority of them were horrible. The pay (before the raises) was disgustingly low for a job that they expected SO much out of you. The benefits were terrible and too expensive. The people at my specific location only gave a hoot about who they were flirting with, how many numbers they could get of each other or customers and who got with who that week. They constantly changed my planned out schedule, even without telling me so therefore I would get in trouble if they didn't inform me of my change. I did enjoy my very short time as a cashier/customer service rep but all in all this company thrives of the government welfare & doesn't give a hoot about their employees, their life outside of work and how they treat them."
bad,"A typical day at work making sure associates are doing there tacks."
bad,"I would process and fill prescriptions, verify insurance, close out at end of day. I learned to work quickly and efficiently. I enjoyed helping my routine customers."
bad,I was able to learn how to stand in my feet and how to speak and handle costumers. Also stocked organized and cleaned the store. I worked as sales associate cashier operator and matinance.
bad,"A typical shift begins with a lackluster attempt at moral through reading sales stats. Staff is clearly divided between objective oriented and clock watchers with no reward or consequence for being either. More motivated workers end up supporting those on constant break, just-not-to-be-found or in many cases, sleeping."
bad,A typical day at work is filled with drama. Management does not respect their Associates. I've learned that you have to basically suck up to management to succeed.
bad,"I was a retail manager at Wal Mart for a year. The company promoted me after being in a associate position for three months. I was making almost a dollar over minimum wage as a manager! What a joke. It was a dog eat dog atmosphere, if you weren't in with the store management then you got ignored and treated poorly."
bad,"Walmart is a good start up company, as well. However, the reason I left this job was because of the work environment. Despite trying to become friends and open to many of the other cashiers there, they closed me out like I was an outcast. I wasn't in a great work environment. Given only part time, I worked at least 40 hours a week. Many wouldn't complain over this, however this was my first real job so I wasn't ready for full time hours."
bad,"La empresa no se preocupa por el empleado si come o no."
bad,"Very repetitive, little to no opportunity for advancement, felt like a number there, management was running around without theirs heads most of the time and when they weren't it was when corporate handed down some irrelevant piece of information to ""better"" the company."
bad,Walmart cares only about making money so dont expect to be valued as a worker. Employees are a dime a dozen and continuously coming and going. This is not a place to expect to last long term.
bad,"Unload trucks, anywhere between 1,600 - 3,200 boxes per truck and sometimes have two trucks that day, With little to absolutely no help, and if we finished early,we did the overnight stocker's job and they got paid more than us and all they did was stock."
bad,"I was over worked, expected to be in 5 places at once, some managers were OK others were not tolerable. I stocked the grocery shelves, sometimes helped in bakery, produce, meat departments. As well as acted as cashier on demand. I worked in Health and Beauty straightened shelves and stocked if help was short. Co workers were decent to work with. I learned some management responsibilities but I was not trained very well in alot of areas on our scanner as I should have been."
bad,It was walmart what more do I need to say! they made their employs work for as little pay as possible but worked them hard sometimes pulling a double.
bad,"Walmart treats you like you are a slave, not an employee. Management is not respectful of employees. Always pushing for more, with no increase in resources. Some employees are expected to do everything by the book while the others do not have to comply with any policy."
bad,The managers there do not care about the co-workers and will work you hard yet pay you poorly. If they do not like you they will find a way to fire you.
bad,did not stay long enough to enjoy all the benefits of walmart  was only in that state for a short amoount of time did stocking and cleaning on night shift 11-7 am
bad,There was a lot of drama. Concerns weren't handled at all. They were changing the rules for different people on a daily basis. They don't uphold policies to all employees.
bad,"Péssima liderança,  e pouca oportunidade de crescimento,  não existe trabalho em equipe.  A cultura da empresa é uma falsidade gigantesca"
bad,Overall this is where I learned leadership and where to be a manager. This place was great back in the day but over the years it changed for the worse
bad,"This particular Walmart could care less about it's associates. They have a lot of favoritism, no real training and loads of disrespect between management and associates."
bad,"Worked at Walmart for six months.  I have a disability that impacts some of the jobs I am able to do.  Walmart kept putting me into the positions I am unable to do, thus setting me up to fail."
bad,"horrible in every sense of the word managment was awful, staffing never did theyre jobs correctly, customers were rude, no room to advance yourself, awful awful awful"
bad,"They hardly give anyone good hours. I went from working 32+ one week and 8-10 the next day, they will also randomly change your work schedule sometimes days in advanced and will not tell you."
bad,Working at Wal-Mart was a slave shift. csms have to run around the store and do much more then higher levels of management. the store I was working was always under staffed.
bad,"I worked for them for 15 years and almost everyday was unbearable.  People work at Walmart because they need a job, that is why they put up with the disrespect they get from management. I have nothing good to say about working at Walmart, their treatment of their employees is shameful. It is sad that the treatment comes all the way from the CEO to the Assist Managers. I  am glad that I left there. I only wish it had been sooner."
bad,Working at walmart was never a good job it destroys your own emotions you become very upset. Managers don't care. Only good thing there was your coworkers. You received a discount of 10% which didn't even cover taxes.
bad,This all depends on management but the Walmart i worked at was terrible. Managers had no respect for others always yelled or got angry over the smallest things. Did not appreciate the hard work i had to do in any weather. And would not let me move up to any other job no matter how hard i worked or how often i applied.
bad,"Depends on the owner , the store i worked at was unfair, you had to be a certain race to get what you want, they dont care that you have school, they take advantage and make you work alot of shifts, the pay isnt worth the work you do"
bad,"Walmart was not a fun workplace. In my personal opinion Walmart overworked and underpaid its employees. Walmart showed no interest in its employees whatsoever.  I have never worked for a company that was so unorganized, especially being as large as it is."
bad,The management team at Walmart is very interesting. They are selfish and AQon't care about anyone but themselves. They act like us employees don't have a life or responsibility outside of Walmart.
bad,The co-worker are great people that are in need to have a job. They work together for have a nice work place. The company are not that good with them. Don't have any benefit or hours for the employee. Work are sometime less than 16 in the week. Not enough for pay rent and have a life.
bad,"estube 6 meses por contrato, tercerizado por guia laboral.sa (GRUPO RÚO) de los cuales trabaje 1 mes y no me llamaron mas, la verdad que es una empresa que deja mucho que desear. en cuanto al trato de las personas , despues de todo los operarios tambien somos gente."
bad,"the employees were snobby and mean, they don't work with you about appointments and no insurance. the employees lied to get ahead and they overwork."
bad,No one worked well together.  Management was not easy to talk to.  Everyone felt unappreciated.  I learned that if you wanted to be positive you were usually out numbered by the negativity around you.
bad,"walmart is a difficult company to work for they expect you to work with very little training,and want you do things that are not in your job description with no additional compensation even if is way above your pay scale, management ignores policy, does not care about associates , does not follow through on any work related problems."
bad,"The place was not a safe environment to work in at night."
bad,"For the time working at Walmart they over work their employees.They give u two 15 min breaks but they usually take it from you. They did not give any benefits unless you have been with the companies for a few years. There management is very unorganized,disrespectful. I've learned a variety of skills working, such as cashiering, teamwork, and management skillls. The co-workers all helped to improve are working experience."
bad,"Walmart has the worst communication between employees and management. If they didn't like you they will ignore you even if you need help. You only really learned to work by yourself not as a team, at this store the co-workers were pretty good and they will help you if they can."
bad,"Typical day of work is being given way to much work to accomplish in during your shift. Don't ask for days off because you won't get it. They say family oriented place, not even close. If you wish to go far in this company be prepared for some of the worst days and nights of your life. Management loves to play favorites and i you are not one you will go no where in the company. They say the more you know the harder it is to replace you. This however is the exact opposite. The more you know the more they want to replace you. I would never go back to this company when thy want something from you, you better do it, if you want something from them don't even ask."
bad,was a good place to come in to ur board an if u wanted to u can help other coworkers not all did clean rooms check outs and the stay overs. clean sheets an towels.
bad,the managers were horribly aggressive towards everyone and my coworkers would do things to make every day i worked even more miserable than the last.
bad,"As a cashier, I loved working for Wal-Mart.  I believe the company is a great company, and that there is potential in climbing the corporate scale. I have learned how to interact and become multi-personal inviting a fun and enjoyable experience. I have also learned how to develop a strong ear to listen and cater to the need of customers demonstrating a desire to have compassion. I believe there are errors that need to be addressed throughout management in the store. Inexperienced and unqualified individuals appointed, in lower and higher levels of management, that do not have the correct training on professionalism and/or business etiquette. This heavily affects the atmosphere for the employees and customers."
bad,"empresa boa de trabalhar, porem o jovem aprendiz nao atua apenas em seu cargo especifico"
bad,"Empresa boa,porém a supervisão e gerencia acabam por controlar em seu nível hierárquico o desenvolvimento da empresa."
bad,Your learn the basics as far as customer service.  Great customer service is a must in this company because you come across several different people from all walks of life.  So having a fun personality and your ability to adjust would allow you a great opportunity to grow with this company.
bad,"Management doesn't know what they are doing, the rules are constantly changing, employees are never properly trained, and drama is allowed to run rampant. Working here is a joke and is extremely stressful."
bad,"Wal-mart é uma empresa que por fara parece ser uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, porém, não é! Realmente o salário é pago em dias, porém Eu uso meu carro para trabalhar,não é pago nenhum valor além do que 0,75 centavos por km rodado, não bato ponto eletrônico e isto tem 2 anos e 7 meses e não recebo o valor de 40% conforme Art. 62, ou seja, o Wal-mart rouba os seus próprios funcionários e ainda quer ser conhecida e reconhecida por ser uma empresa padrão."
bad,"Not a very good company to work for. Was desperate to work. Its seems harder to find work now than when I was 18 years old. Was told I would be working with 2 other members stocking hardlines. Instead was placed by myself stocking more than 3 separate departments. I stayed as long as I could bear it, however the work loads just kept getting more ridiculous. Management had a bad eye for choosing leaders as well. One of the members chosen to lead was fired for stealing. There are just to many negatives here."
bad,"not enjoyable at all. poor management,lazy employees and management. not a good place to work. expect to much from thier employees."
bad,hated my position wanted to transfer to anther post within the store but my manager keep delaying my oppurtunity .the worst job i have ever held. would not recommend.
bad,"productive for Wal-Mart, very hard time consuming work. typical day consist of unloading freight manually and sorting on pallets,one hour lunch break with no meal help, learned why the average worker is so stressed, learned what it was like to be overworked and underpaid. management was always jockeying to assert dominance over workers. co-workers were very receptive of each other and laid back. hardest part of the job was unloading freight without having people who were trained on unloading freight. hardest part was dealing with management trying to make you stay longer than contracted to, by threatening to fire. hardest part of job was working without time to study for school. hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was my one day off and going home"
bad,Working for Wal-Mart gave me the opportunity to gain job experience and working with the public. I didn't have the job for long since I was working for the summer to save a little money before going to college. It was a good job for the time I was there but would never think of staying long. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and completing jobs I was assigned. We all worked as a team. A typical day at work would include setting up landscaping displays and assembling lawn equipment.
bad,"Work itself is tiring but doable."
bad,"This company was not the best rated company for me, it was not organized, safety was not taken seriously and everyone there believed to be a manager. Also communication skills were poor."
bad,"Fun staff to work with"
bad,The initial training and pre-opening and overall moral was great once the store opened and other entities and outside management became involved all else went in the dumpster. Employees began stealing and doing other thing unbecoming which made it bad for all the other employees.
bad,"They promote a fictional ""culture"", but are truly just a call center chop shop.  If they spent more time focused on people rather than the fluff they focus on they might offer a better product."
bad,"My manager is great, one of the best I've ever had. Too bad other managers feel the need to belittle their employees. This could be why there is not loyalty."
bad,"I personally didn't have the greatest experience working at Wal-mart. I found that the management wasn't at all how they make themselves out be during the orientation. Although it wasn't always terrible, the employees are very nice, the friends I made at this job are great people, we always made the day worth while. The beginning pay wasn't all that great. I'm glad for this job because I learned how to communicate with other people a lot better, it taught me to be less shy. The hardest part of this job was having to deal with rude customers, or angry customers."
bad,"There was no clear direction when working on a task, start one task and get pull away to begin another leaving most task incomplete."
bad,A typical day there was very busy with customers and with restocking sales floor. The management team look down upon the sales associate. Not an team work environment.
bad,"Alright kids get comfortable because I am about to tell you a story. I applied to walmart fresh out of high school, because I really can't afford college and I wanted to job while I figured what I was gonna do. So I already knew that walmart was a bad employer, I mean even a friend wrote her final paper about it for english. So you go in for orientation which is really 5+ hours of brainwashing. They tell you all about how all employees are treated equally and how this company will really let you soar over time, it's all propaganda. Luckily there was an associate there that knew better, they let me go through my corporate phase but as soon as feces started hitting the fan, they were there to walk me through it. Everything started going downhill when our original assistant manager was moved to another shift. The company never really bothered with getting us a new one so were manager-less for months. As a mere associate, if you were to breathe in a way not approved by a manager, you would get a coaching, but more on that later. My department was a total disaster 80% of the time, all the department managers ever did was fuss around with freight and then complain that they always had pallets in the back. There was one manager in particular that didn't have anything binned, so if a customer was looking for jeans or a shirt in a certain size, you might as well be looking for a needle in a haystack. Upper management knew of this but they never talked to her about it, even though it was clearly upsetting the customers and it wasn't convenient for the workers. I am not exaggerating since"
bad,"I loved withing with customers by assisting them as needed by attending the store parking lot and gathering grocery carts and keeping the area clean for customer. Working with my team to accomplish each task given to us by management each night regardless of weather conditions, lack of personnel or unforeseen problems that come up. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of support from management to acknowledge the challenge we face with a very small crew and a lot of area to cover. Also, no opportunity to advance within the company at the location I was working."
bad,this was a very challenging position it required multitasking because there was not enough help. i learned to put my frustration aside and not to take it out on customers..
bad,"take trash mop sweep talk to customers greet them answer any question they ask with a perky smile I also did inventory mark downs changing signs bringing in stuff from the store hand out gift cards and sale walmart credit cards "
bad,It was hard just to show up to work everyday. Certain people got what they wanted while others were treated poorly.Mangers only listened to certain people while the needs of others were ignored. Working at Walmart was more like high school than the makings of a multi billion dollar corporation.
bad,Great environment to learn how to work fast and to work with different types of customers.  Very hard to grow inside company.
bad,"I worked in the Frozen/Dairy section. It probably needs 3 to 4 people to manage it all at once while helping customers, and there were barely 2 people at most per shift. Product was never rotated properly. The freezer was getting more pallets delivered than could be broken down. There were slip, trip, and pinch hazards always popping up with no solution offered to address them. People unfamiliar with the area were sent there to help out, which made things get put on wrong shelves. Egg boxes that were dropped were sometimes set aside for someone else to deal with. Management kept pulling us from our duties to ""straighten"" the shelves and make them look nice, rather than doing something productive like actually stock them. When I tried to change my hours to fit around my schedule when school started, not a single change was made, leaving me with overlapped class and work hours."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart for me was processing the returns that came back from the service, checking in the vendors, stocking the shelves, waiting on customers, being a cashier. It all really depended on how management felt that day depended on what I was doing. My co- workers all had the same kind of attitude is it time to clock out and go home yet. They really didn't care about the customers, it was all about hurry up get the job done so they could go home or about the money. Yes the enjoyable part of the job was clocking out to go home or to lunch. The hardest part of the job for me was not knowing what I would be doing from day to day, if certain management didn't like you they would always make it so much harder. If you was a college student it was always harder because you always had get your schedule changed just to get off to go school or class that day. They aren't really all for college students working there but yet it also depends on which was Walmart you work at too."
bad,"A typical day was unloading trailers and sorting product before taking it out onto the main floor. I also learned how to use a scanner gun to pick items off of shelves before they were brought to the sales floor. Safety was key, and so was doing your stretches before each shift."
bad,"Its been several years since I last worked here but it was terrible! Pay was not worth what you had to deal with on a daily basis. There are ways to advance in this company but unfortunately that ultimately depends on the store management, I've worked at 2 different stores in my area and in both stores it was all about politics(who you know or who likes you the most) NOT about how hard you work."
bad,"A typical day of work consists of stocking, organizing shelves, and setting up displays. Your co-workers will be like your family. It is a very enjoyable job and that's only because of the other co-workers"
bad,management was very unforgiving even when you didnt deserve blame. you did have a few who were good at their positions but you always had to come into work ready for war.
bad,"Wallmart had very poor management.  A lot of drama and confusion.  The pay is better now I hear, but they do not like to give you the hours you want and the chances of advancement is very low."
bad,Management always trying to micro manage. All about trying to get all the products out on the sales floor. Co-workers doesn't like newbies. The hardest part about the job is trying to reach a goal by a certain time.
bad,"A typical day here consisted of loading and unloading trucks. QAR, doing inventory, Shrink wrapping packages to be loaded onto pallets and trucks."
bad,I learned how to take on more task independently solely on the fact that you have to mostly depend on your self. you definitely only get promoted unless the your really chummy with the managment
bad,Hard working group of people that worked together to get the tasks done. Good Balance between working hard and having fun in the work place. Supportive managers.
bad,"Walmart, attitudes from Co worker, customers halore. People hate their lifes, and are stuck here. Management makes 2 dollars more than I did. Prepare to push carts no matter what position you are. Courtesy always leaving so you have to come fill in for them during your shift and get your shift done as well. "
bad,I love to cashier but the environment that I worked in with the people was just a bad experience. the management was bad at communication and customer service skills
bad,Walmart only thinks about Walmart not the employees I feel as tho I was overworked and under paid with no type of benefits.
bad,I have worked for Wal-Mart for a seasonal position as a cashier. I personally enjoyed being a cashier and found it fun to interact with the public; however I feel the management suffered and lacked in there ability of understanding their staff.
bad,"Good places to work if you like fast pace work enviorment, The wasnt the best for the amunt of work we were responsible for if crossed trained."
bad,When I was there I didnt care for the managment they dont treat there hard workers with the respect they deserve. It is a good stepping stone.
bad,the managers are somewhat unprofessional. there is not much to say. It is ok to work not the best place to work. its minimum wage.
bad,"Working at Walmart is not as easy as you think. I've used to go through so much just to get the day by smoother. I've learned that I have a gift that is not really rare in other people. I have the gift that can make any stranger open up to me and tell me their life story. Just in a matter of minutes I can cheer anyone up. I mainly focused on my job, so I'd never really have made close friends with any of the co-workers. Just hi how are you type conversation. They were friendly. Management was horrible. They say that they care for you in Walmart when in reality that's a horrible lie. The most enjoyable part of my job was making people smile. I enjoy interacting with many people as if I've known them for many years."
bad,"All about the money. Don't care about loyal long working employees. Was a dedicated employee of 17+ years and was let go just like that. Co-workers were great, we were like a family. Hardest part of job was putting up with rude customers and management. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers. Felt like I had reached the end of the road and could not climb or grow with company."
bad,"I have been working as a cashier for about a year, everyone is treated like dogs, there is no advancing I have tried several times. Recently had a new store manager that makes no attempt to talk to any of the associates unless it is something negative. A couple managers that are respectable but very few. They never ask you how you are or how was your day. Its all about mastercards and making sure you keep your mouth shut.  "
bad,"As fun as Wal-mart could be at time, and as much hard work as I put into the company, it always felt like management had no idea what was going on, or were to busy to even care about what happened. I had one cool boss at Wal-Mart who stood up for us workers, and he found a different job because of how crazy management was there. The often only cared about how much stuff they could sell, as opposed to actually helping the customer, and making the customer happy."
bad,Honestly this is more of a job for a teenager with a part time job or someone who wants a little extra money while in college. A typical day starts with me stocking the shelves with pallets of merchandise that arrived on the trucks the night before as well as cutting keys and issuing Maryland Department of Natural Resources Licenses to hunt and fish I would also make sure that the air guns pellet guns live ammunition and firearms were securely locked in their cases Once all the merchandise has been stocked or stored in the back room I would straighten up and organize the entire department making sure to remove all damaged or faulty items from the sales floor.
bad,"A typical day at work is walking in and wanting to walk out. I learned how to be patient with rude customers. Management was always about themselves, didn't understand the employees."
bad,"It was a job, plain and simple.  it paid the bills.  I loved all of my customers. There is no way to move around in the company unless you transfer or get in with upper management."
bad,"Known in the retail world as the worst employer to work for: poor worker treatment, low pay, low moral, never-ending stream of extra tasks from the higher management, hire all employees as temps, termination for financial reasons, under-staffing, no benefits provided until full time is achieved, hostile work environment, promotions based on management favoritism, blame-shifting to lower level employees (usually result of under scheduling). And many, many, more!!"
bad,"I have worked for Wal-Mart , not just once but twice. The first time was many years ago when Sam Walton was alive. The atmosphere and incentives and beliefs were all outstanding."
bad,"I learned a lot of warehouse skills. This was my first experience in a large warehouse. My co-workers kept to themselves, there was not a lot of socializing or work related relationships."
bad,"I worked at this job for a while. I liked it at first but as more employees started working, it became more difficult. Most of the managers were inexperienced. Their management skills were less than professional."
bad,It is a great place to work when  I was in college. They worked well with my school schedule. I develop great work relationships and friends.
bad,Every day when you go in you never know if you will actually be in your department or if they will send you to a different department. You could get pulled at anytime to work in a different area weather you know it or not and are expected to complete the task. Management is not positive. Having to fight to get time off even when you put in for months ahead. Constantly being told that its never good enough. Having a manager personally degrade/humiliate you in front of customers and other staff.
bad,They expect you to know every department with out training. Your hours are always changing and don't work well with other jobs or school hours.
bad,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
bad,Management does not care about the regular employees. I will not be working there much longer. I hope the rest of the store wakes up. WalMart can not run with out its associates.
bad,"A typical day consisted of attempting to put out 13 pallets of freight by yourself as there was no one around to help you in the evening shifts. The other people in the store were doing the same thing in their respective areas. It was hard tedious work, we did get a lunch break but it would throw your rhythm off as you were attempting to get everything out as fast as possible and if you didn't, you would sure hear about it from the morning shift. Management at the store was a invisible presence who was never around. Co-workers would help when they could but they were generally as overwhelmed as you were with freight as well and were trying to put up their own. The only enjoyable part of working at Walmart was when I got to go home. It taught me to be careful where I selected to work at, and to look long and hard at job descriptions before applying somewhere."
bad,"I had fun in the beginning but then got very bored, feeling under utilized, unchallenged, treated unfairly. Was told plenty of times i was going to be promoted but then never was, which at that time it started to eat away at my moral. Seemed they hired anyone which has in my eyes brought the name of Walmart down. Some of the employees they hired showed no interest in showing professional appearance. They treated the job like a paycheck and provided poor customer assistance in my eyes."
bad,when you clock in there is a meeting where they tell you what part of the building you are working in that work schedule. Management walks around nitpicking every detail of your job to make sure it looks perfect or else they make you stay on the clock and keep working
bad,"Walmart will hire almost anyone. As a sales associate or cashier. You have to be young and dumb to be promoted into management so hopes for working your way up after about 33 are nonsense."
bad,"For all that I'm about to complain about working for this company, I did learn a lot there in my four years of employment. I learned that the world is every man or woman for themselves, that when you work for a large company they are quick to make you aware of your expendability and that nothing is worth being made to feel like a machine or less of an individual."
bad,I worked at Walmart for just over one year and it was the worst job i have ever held. The management staff were rude and set forth unrealistic expectations.
bad,Working under staff and pulled to other departments constantly Training and promotions scarce Down time was far and few but helped to make the day go faster
bad,"I stock and zone the dairy and frozen department everyday. I pretty much already knew the job on arrival, so that makes it more smooth for me. Well there is some great managers and there is some not so great at all managers."
